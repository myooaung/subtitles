X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So that's why I came up the idea,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.310
Teoh doing that sewing class and using western fabric instead of Japanese like a regular

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.250
yukata so serious is going to be three weeks.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.950
So this tonight.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.780
So we're gonna do,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.860
like a very basic and the nine stitches going I'm gonna go over over and also the tool we

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860
can substitute.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.290
And you don't have to buy expensive Japanese stool.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.600
Use a stick.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.250
You create one or used the one you already have at home.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.460
Hopefully and also we can do the pigment.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.050
They're taking body measurements using a measuring tape.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.580
So tonight's listen,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.150
it's going to be like four things to cover.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.670
The first I wanted to go over the Matteo.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.310
So what kind of material you wanted to get or what?

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.050
You know what with off the public.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.710
And also I'm gonna go over the hunt sewing tool and what kind of stuff you have or you

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.380
don't have.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.890
And also the then we gonna do that.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.050
Take the MSM in the lastly nine Japanese stitches.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.030
We're not gonna So But I just show you what kind of stitch we need to make it.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.060
So maybe question for you And what do you hope you to learn from this class?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.280
You wanted to complete yukata?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.050
What makes you you take this crust?

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.050
I need the mission.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.100
So you do.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.080
You on your your yukata,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.970
you know?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.450
Okay.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:56.120
Do you have any idea off the yukata you wanted to make any color or Okay,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.640
that's good,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.950
baby.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.690
That the great brainstorming tonight?

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.050
What about I shot one?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.780
It's like a cosplay bird.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.610
It's like a cosplay cosplay costume playing.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.680
Okay,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.420
that that's going to bring Tony.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.410
I'm gonna go over.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.500
Okay,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.050
so I'm gonna go over the side.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.810
This is just show you.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.970
So,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.560
um,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.190
you cut the material.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.750
The music?

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.390
Sure.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.190
No,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.490
no,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.240
you gotta is the Japanese.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.280
Do you see the top?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.450
The casual summer kimono.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.090
So casual summer kimono is no Marie.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.040
Native cotton is not.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.280
Yukata is a The kimono has a two different things.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.650
One is that he go it.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.050
The tiny carry means that one public not lining.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.560
That's a pony.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.740
But it is a Tony.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.660
But you got these on you caught that?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.600
But this is yukata because made of cotton.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.670
But he's a different type of kimono.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.090
But I also know lining but no,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.750
you got that.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.050
If you go to a Japanese,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.920
you'll come that Japanese in in Tokyo,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.430
they give you the yukata and also how you too It's the reason why,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.160
you know,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.420
have a wrist on public.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.790
Because Japanese yukata is this narrow,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.790
which is,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.710
can you see,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.900
like,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.450
14.5 inches that miss 37 cents medal like only like this this wide but a western one is 44

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.120
to 60 which is that much more than two times almost three times of the 152.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:55.750
So that that means we can make the you got the much wider This is actually yukata,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.330
right?

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:06.140
It's like a This is the Japanese public with one than 234 right,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.770
this is 1234 So everything is came out of this one.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.350
But this is a public.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.870
This is a communal standard.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.790
The reasons 37 cents middle with the lengths is 13 years 13 and Bill bit,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.750
4.4 inches.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.500
That's the links they already cut.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.660
Then sell it so you can by longer than troll need right.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.600
They always pre cut,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.950
then sell it.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.360
So that's the reason why this is a problem is getting shorter or too narrow.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.300
So that's why and most of the people started to making their own yukata,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.670
using Western part because Western favorite cousin with because this is Japanese side where

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:20.080
the Western is quieter 12 right?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.450
That's the good things about it that the role edges that both sides.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.850
So that means you don't have to worry about the folding apart.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.350
So this is a basic sorry I didn't to translate in English,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.960
but this is This is the basic Japanese women's yukata thinks is like under yukata,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.500
and you gotta that's going to make an OBE that the time,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.490
you know,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.830
tied up from around the waist and this is together.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.850
The together is like a flip for the men's words and men's don't wear the under.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.630
You got,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.860
though.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.640
So just like a yukata and obi,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.750
and they don't even use this,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.580
um,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.950
like a tight and they just yukata and over Guetta.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.700
There's a basic one,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.090
but this is substitutes but version so men can wear these by public.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.070
Maybe you Negro like underwear.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.970
The tongue called for a T shirt underneath and then maybe defend Aware and the woman can

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.250
substitute the tank top cotton tanks up,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.540
but the bottom should be really sleepy because otherwise it's kind of the How did you move

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.540
?

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.610
Because the kimono is gonna close to your skin like this,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.080
much been tied up,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.270
so it's harder to walk if he's not.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.980
So this is like a political they sell Korea Stance should be fine,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.300
but a top maybe I've suggested the cotton because it's kind of hot.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.650
So that's the substitute and also the get you people young people,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.350
willy and sneakers and the three plump or sandals.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.550
It can be very modern.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.580
You don't have to follow the oldest traditional,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:25.430
even though you want to know Japanese culture and the also the OBE,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.110
because of the old ones,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.690
always open off the ring right here.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.270
This is the old version.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.350
Is people hard to tie these days?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.020
And so this gov.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.250
Called heckle be?

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.750
It's like a more soft.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.160
It's like a scarf material.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.850
It's used to be only four men and the kids,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:53.750
but because of this cannot and tied easily anymore and lady women study to very high Coby

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.390
and Japanese kimono industry is having hard time to selling yukata,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.550
so they used to do the pre made O.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.740
B.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.480
But the premium is that only one style they can change it because the capri me just tied

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.420
and the equipment but a young generation started to like more modern and something

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.210
different and something creative.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.520
But that's why they,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.320
like vehicle,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.850
will be better,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.230
because hecho of It's much,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:26.870
much Longer and also they can create like a different type of like obi decoration.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:33.740
But this type of obi I thought you can make out of Western public.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.160
But when you buy Obi,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.800
as you see,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.700
there's no scene.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.350
So that means if you wanted to make the OBE without seeing,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.180
you have to buy really long,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.600
so that means you have to spend a lot of money.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.540
Then you cut 1/2 then maybe maybe used you make two,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.470
or maybe one for something else.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:09:05.350
But it's hard to mix because so this is the Hickel be that the South one,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.490
the four meter.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:15.550
Some reason both women and make the same thing that is 13 years,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.750
13 years very long,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.750
I think 50 15 inches like a double size off the OBE.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.300
This is like old seven inch seven on,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.630
huh?

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:37.730
So you can kind of make it narrow that this is a traditional always with similar to

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.310
practice,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.680
but advance all these the even though they have a goby,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.690
they have this this type of Opie,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.620
I think.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.260
What according?

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.960
And this is also men substitute is that they can do.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.800
But I Yeah,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.270
nice.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.190
But a good guy is more like it won't last green.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.710
This is the sash.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.050
Build signs.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.000
Man's a second longer off course because the body,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.650
but only 20 cents metal longer like only eight inches longer.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.560
You're with 16 not seven.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.110
This is 5.5 1 inches.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.230
Yeah,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.740
yes.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.200
31 inches larger than old one.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:34.200
This is called the cochlea Chemo.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.250
It's like a time,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.020
these type of things.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.680
I couldn't find out the substitution in here,

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.160
but what I was thinking.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:52.030
Maybe you can you the road if you have a cotton or silk below and come right,

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:57.890
they come with this type of this type of things or you can use the leftover fabric to make

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.390
like this.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:05.650
This this is actually removed.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.100
But this is not really typical Japanese yukata.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.250
The reason why There's no seem in center.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:20.090
So this obviously using your western public because happen If they're using Japanese,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.550
one has to have a scene,

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.450
the center.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.710
But this one doesn't have it.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:34.080
So that means they use a wider fabric but that you save time to so me,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.100
the ladies are you know where.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.760
No,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:39.910
no,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.400
this is It's like I just showing for the substitution,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.040
not the existing not new kata I was.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.750
This is a kosher chemo,

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.490
right?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.310
The Japanese want one.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.940
When you were e I was sharing what you can substitute.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.910
Then I say I Maybe if you have a road,

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.150
you can use this this time that this is not to make you confused.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:11.050
So any question about accessory because no,

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.400
no,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.220
you get the little idea what the yukata is.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.170
Okay,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.530
so now you know that you got the pattern.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:29.360
Looks like that your character is actually the real yukata and hands on.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.230
So he wanted to take a look.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.600
And if you sweetie Yeah,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.880
it's a really nice clean.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.560
Uh,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.120
probably probably.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.550
Yeah,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.150
that's a good point.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:52.770
They also please touch this fabric and that fabric,

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:53.680
like same time.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.850
So maybe you're gonna see the difference in the thickness.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:02.840
So this one is more like a sharp type of problem.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.450
Shot would be maybe a little less.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.450
If this is probably,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.010
I would say,

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.800
this is a two or three,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.630
not even 23 own states.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.780
Far break is lighter.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.360
The yukata fabric is like a full on.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.950
That's what they call the port one's way fabric.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:22.870
So if you wanted to looking for the Cotton Online,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.600
so use a full on sweet cotton because there's a different type of what that weight.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.690
Because if it's like a like a heavier way is like a more campus,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.770
that's we always call the weight.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.650
If the way is like a one square public size,

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:47.830
so he wouldn't create like something salty,

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.950
it would be easy,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.980
solid color like these solid color.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.130
You don't have to all hear about the pardon,

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.800
but you know,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.660
flower or something.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.940
But they shouldn't Don't be difficult because this wasn't not so many patterns.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.780
If you have a big record of design,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.750
this wants to have you.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.400
It's like a rose over here and there,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.950
so you have to kind of I just the pattern,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.790
so that means it will be hard.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.250
So I wouldn't recommend it to doing at the beginning for the beginner.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.620
Is that doing very basic things or solely color?

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.450
Or this is gonna be easy because that is all over.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.750
The big pattern would be still difficult,

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:41.690
like tiny one that you want to try this.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.380
I'll tell you,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.750
this is like a little techniques Teoh measure differently.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:52.380
But the UK out of pattern you gotta Is there?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:52.720
Actually,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.450
there's no pattern that Pape No paper pattern.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.950
Yeah,

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.910
because this is the pattern.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.510
You see,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:07.790
Everything is like a square knot is like a entirely script is like everything is like a

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.290
square or like rectangle.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.390
So just measure,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.350
then cut.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.110
That's the powder.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.040
But pattern itself is so simple.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.090
You don't have a paper,

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:19.490
potter,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.580
but it is like a thought.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.900
Lining is like a fold not cut.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.620
Long public.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.060
Okay,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.070
a is over here.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.750
Be body here.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.900
He has to write B and C is here.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.620
Sisi,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.820
is the back received back?

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:56.370
Because this is This is weird because they should not this be dots because we can cut me.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.080
Not gonna cut over here should be done over here.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.550
I think they made a mistake.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:11.050
This is that is like a folding Nobody has here and inside it it's like a these over here in

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.450
here.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.510
The tiny one.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.600
This piece Okocha me.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.070
Interestingly,

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.670
the reason why they,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.070
you know,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.000
only caught like a minimally and almost like a date.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.450
Always.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.210
No,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.950
no waste.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.850
Because very extensive,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:38.650
even in Herrera is cottonwood wasn't so expensive that people wanted to put this back,

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.730
then making the role again,

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.340
or just wash,

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.740
Then give it to some of them.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.960
So pretty remember that it's gonna be like this.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.060
So just like fall from peace,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.480
right?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.350
Because bodies like folding and sleeve was holding,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.760
you know.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.950
Right.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.820
So after you cut this side,

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.850
then you already have a to sleeve,

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.760
then to body.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.950
So that's why measuring is very important.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.520
And cutting is very important.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.400
Because when I make yukata,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.380
I accidentally cut because the exactly,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.760
you know,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.780
the hadn I cut it.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:30.190
That was going Yeah,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.330
so that yeah,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.780
this is a really great idea because you have to remember,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.300
because if you fold it nicely,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.140
you know,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.690
the two sleeve size is exactly same.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.230
Why?

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.760
Because you fold it nicely.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.790
The body you measure nice correctly,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.470
then folding nicely.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.160
So never be different Sizes,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.050
exact size.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.080
This is a modern way.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.460
And they use the western far big.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.780
Really nice thing is that even though same color,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.380
they use a two different public like a dots and also wave.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.340
And I think I ascended.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.310
He she made the RV to.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.980
But this class,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.120
we're not gonna make Obie only there,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.480
you got.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.730
And this one is a big like a pata.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.220
They need to kind of record arrange,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.290
but the pattern is going to wear.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:31.370
And where because you don't wanna say cover only decided Had a flower?

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.740
No.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.220
Hello.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:32.780
This time.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.020
So you have to kind of arranging.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.200
This is like a looks really nice,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.550
but it made of like a French like a print yukata.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.260
You can be creative.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.090
Yes,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.940
this is women's men's virgin.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.720
And what he days is like two different color,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.080
even the same pattern.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.240
And also this guy is a really while.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.140
Okay.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.500
Again.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:03.680
What?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.520
11 time.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:04.960
So?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.610
So there,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:05.830
too.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.220
So day.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:06.600
Right,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.810
too.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.230
So there.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.680
And that body called,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.870
amigo that the body This is the court once just fold over here body,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.450
then rest of the peace.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.760
There's no like a just folding because color and Oconee,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.350
we have to cut its center.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:31.580
Maybe you wanna practice Use the paper first.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.510
Yeah,

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:44.010
that's one is like a color.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.160
And also okay.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.050
Me over here?

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.830
Yeah,

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.290
we could do cutting next time.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.480
So I'll make sure again where?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.170
Your car and so tonight.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.910
And I'm going to explain what kind of material you're going to get.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.280
And what size off the public the how much yard is you need to get?

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.310
So you have a handout paper and also I emailed you.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.180
And also,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.760
this is going to be the major man paper.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.880
They're all seven sentimental with the Japanese one,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:22.800
but a manic on one would be because this is 72.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.750
Sentimental is like,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.880
almost like a double.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:33.450
It's pretend to be like Looks like this with it's already sewing together.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:34.790
No sewing.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.660
That may be that they will compute.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.600
So remember,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.170
this one is the American and you Western.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.950
So this is a fabric with there's no scene.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:55.340
So this is 72.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.500
Sentimental,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.090
28 means public.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:11.370
So American one is have a 44 or 60 up to 60 but 60.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:16.220
The widest fabric is no very for the interior public interior.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:22.050
The cotton full on No Marie come on 44 40 50 inch.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.770
But this one is showing 20 inches to use,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:31.160
so that means that this side of the panel and then are divided behalf.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.230
So that's why there's a written that what,

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.800
oh,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.050
not what here,

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.550
front body here and the back.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.850
It's all together and no cutting.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:49.090
And also this is used for the folding and the color,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.850
So that's a little bit different way,

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.720
because the fabric with is not the long and narrow.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.750
So you can have two things in one with,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.930
you know,

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:07.260
the dismal thoughts and just trying to be the folding for people that it's all that it

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:13.350
because they use the 2077 2 cents middle of the unfolding in the half.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.660
I know that's confusing.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.970
Uh huh.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.320
This is the Japanese public,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.310
but it's still to be longer,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.570
right?

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.750
This is America,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.330
your political western,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:27.850
right?

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:35.550
So that means you already have a to side the two panel size off their far brick,

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.280
so you don't have to cut.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.260
You don't have to cut because it's already there.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:58.260
So that's why they fold it to make you two together without having to panel right.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:05.370
But Western has a two different type of with,

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:12.740
and also it depends on your size and you sizes smaller so you can make it like to,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.560
I know in the same field.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.630
This is like a,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.730
um,

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.330
open public notice.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:28.260
Folding you can have a sweet if it's happening is one you can make only sleep.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:36.670
But here is a wide enough to get there different parts together so you can get the sleeves

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.910
and body and without seeing,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:45.350
because the theme ability you know with is already quite enough to have a two panel.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.790
That's why there's a thought.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.960
That means you don't have to cut it.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.950
Let's keep it.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.910
No way.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:24:03.130
They just cut in the front to make the fuck right.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.780
Okay,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.620
right,

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:08.970
right,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.190
so I'll show you.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:29.460
So it's going to be It's deflect this instead off having to panel like this.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:36.240
So that's the difference between Japanese fabric and with some.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.210
But it depends on your measurement,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.980
because Western size also 44 or 60 inches,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.980
right,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.240
so we're gonna go onto the measure but before that,

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.050
and I'm going to show the stitches back away.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:54.930
Do you see the hand states over here and there?

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.520
Yeah,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.300
those are hunts Did,

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:57.670
too.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:03.450
Can you check that student Be maybe one on 3/8.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.070
How many stitches they have?

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.160
Oh,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.740
yes.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.690
It shouldn't be that boy sentimental,

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.080
you know?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.050
Can you read it for sentimental over here,

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.710
then can you count the hominid stitches over there?

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.260
You're right.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.700
It's 1 to 7.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.650
1234567 This is seven Spits.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.160
What about that one you got?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.710
That should be six or eight.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.230
Yeah,

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:41.300
it's 10 10 and 12 is so tiny 60 to be easy.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.770
But because the cotton is the thickness,

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.120
it's harder to solder.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.080
Crittenden 12.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.160
New offensive.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.000
But the self is so like this is silk.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.710
This is lining its silks opens and this is stronger.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:03.600
And also been so this one The reason why Japanese so hand sewing is beautiful is the key

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.760
said She said if the yes,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.440
the traditional Japanese golden never opened because of the key said,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.300
You see,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.830
the the thing is to be a little bit entire,

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.050
like a buffing.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:25.920
Do you see the difference between the scenes like not America okay is open and you can see

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.540
the scene like it's like this.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.230
It's car.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.250
You can see the same if you pull it,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.050
but here is like a two millimeter inside,

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.550
he said.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:42.380
Traditional Japanese clothing in the buffer zone like a tiny buffer zone,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:48.370
left around with speed when you saw something and not open to ironing,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.480
There's always like a full.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.600
Maybe next picture.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.330
I think that you,

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.460
this is always have a room,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.400
not the exact on the scene.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.220
Teoh iron it always have a little room on top rule.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.250
It's like about things like to needy nater,

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:13.660
which is like 18 or 1 16 1 16 Then I run.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.790
That's the technique,

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.350
just like only put on the one side.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:24.730
Do you see the pictures of not this only one side that this one is the opening does the

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.280
difference.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:31.130
And that's the Make the Japanese sewing look beautiful and nicely done.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.950
The ironing.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:38.890
So any question about a fabric All right?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.040
You want up in far right now?

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.540
Oh,

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.070
no,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.660
the Western.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.590
But I she really wanted to get the Japanese one because so easy right,

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.830
So right side.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.920
So I think I have a friend in a coup is doing this weekend.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.400

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.690
I asked you to bring the sewing kit so everybody wanna share it.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.260
So Japanese sewing kids expected.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:26.210
But no one has this This is a very traditional and that Christian as a crew made of bamboo

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.210
.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.950
Right?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:35.350
And this is the mock our and used to be made off horn.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.030
And also,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.270
this is the Corte is that this is a wreck trick.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.290
But the old one is like just iron,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.700
then put into the people.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.660
You know d C.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:54.550
But And this is a spray bottle,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.170
but this is looks like a very industrial one.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.420
This is a little car and for the sleeve to make.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.010
But I'm gonna make it than to copy for you.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:09.720
So this This also used to be a middle like metal.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:20.010
But now NATO Qatar for and off course thread and needles and two different type of scissors

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.010

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.630
They don't go to the share it's hear.

Hear if you if you cut paper using public scissor is not gonna bacon,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:41.840
but But it's since the cutting parties only few area.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.990

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:01.050
And she always told me to buy Fortify Brick very expensive.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.820
And then this isn't sewing.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.850
Needle is the Japanese,

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.910
and here's a European.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.400
I want the American European,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.130
then Japanese sizes,

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.170
all the sizes.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.000
Different name.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.470
This is the whole for cotton.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.470
Awful cotton.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:27.740
The two longer one for the foot on that big like a questioning like a foot down because

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.110
they need a longer otherwise can reach the other side.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.800
The photo Beginner.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.710

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.070

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.150
The difference between big differences,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:51.550
the whole I it's American is smaller.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.530
I mean Japanese.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.220
It's small.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:31:07.270
Anyone I assume maybe they don't have ah machine to make a bigger fool,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.520
right?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.560
Needle threat.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.060
Even Needle said I cannot say because small.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:19.130
So she was asking me in which one is better for start to get sewing yukata.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:26.020
And I said a little bit longer because longer one is the you just like a push the using

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.950
thimble.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.990
God brought that with you have a simple but Japanese one.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.670
Is that okay?

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.610
This is a threat.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:37.450
Right on.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:37.950
Uh,

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.730

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:47.280
I kind of like this Germany one because it was so nice and easy.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.860
You have they gotten why?

So this is a good one.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:06.940
And even though they use the cotton and very nicely Little bit pricey But it's nice and

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:13.530
very strong and easy to money This is a Japanese virgin and they come Come erectus tomato.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.340

as you see both sides almost in color.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:10.480
But this time it's hard to see because even Chinese white is kind of brings up through the

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:10.890
eye.

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:16.410
But a hero is not before the Western public because it's hard to see.

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:20.150
So these would be the other option that,

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:27.350
as she showed it took and the pen and pencil that the old then took.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:36.500
I just the reason why I choke is better because they have,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:36.940
ah,

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.960
different color.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.370
So if you have ah,

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:40.830
you know,

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:49.970
Dr Color and maybe years away or if you using thank you Boo and the ruler and I think I

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.230
brought this is my well,

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.510
exactly same month days.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.150
This is really good.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.210
And because there's,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.580
ah,

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.350
you can see through it and also can check is the square or not?

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:08.570
And so this If you wanted to buy and maybe we can,

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.190
I can give you the link to get cheaper.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.460
Its regular price of being 15 or $20.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.330
But you can get five with $7 half side.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.880
There's a several different size.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.320
This is the basic size,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.090
but you have only shorten.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.890
But I think this will be This is 18 inch 18.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.130
It's very useful this time.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:31.800
I have a three of them,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.880
so he wanted to below.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.770
I can bring more.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.860
This is a traditional Japanese,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.900
the coup geological.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.940
It's made of wood.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.660
Kind of think this is a tape measure,

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.850
measuring tapes,

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.460
pretty much saying.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.200
But only the skill is different.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.500
This is American right.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.800
American is the only used inches,

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:59.740
but half and quarter and eight in the 1/8 and 1 16 1 side is inch the other side of

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.540
sentimental,

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.420
so I could unite a happy by both.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.650
This is the coat is like tiny I run.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:11.190
This is a Japanese burgeon.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.470
But after I was researching this company is no longer exist.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:27.160
So probably taking a while to get hot because there's no attachment.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.740
So that means when they use,

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.210
it's gonna get cold,

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.890
you can switch.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.840
I intend to put the different version,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.980
but actually they already have a very similar version,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.760
as she said,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.360
because the people making quilts and they used this type of iron,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.850
it looks like this,

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.840
but electric version is already exists a lot of different types,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.470
but you don't have to because this is my steamer,

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.410
but looks like Iran.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.420
But it's the steam.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:02.110
But this can be used for this make you got the making and off course.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.800
You can use regular island so you don't have to buy you want.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.140
So this this is the final tool.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.660
I wanted to introduce that she'll they have it that the traditional one traditional 11 is

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.800
the tomato would.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.950
But now is the cooking like this camera and the table,

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.960
right?

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.040
If they quipped then also,

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.030
this side is called HIPAA Ricky Ork.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.360
OK,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:28.760
honey,

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:41.470
it's called because the pool people stepping is new school by keeping and stood easy to so

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.940
like that and really quick.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.060
But this is a subject.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.670
This is coming from friends,

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.340
I found out today This is a similar version is already exist in front,

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.300
so they use this type of stuff and for a long time,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.450
making dresses.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.770
When this console,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.470
this is a substitution,

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.670
this very interesting,

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:02.430
and they use like,

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:15.060
regular and take a clothing clip and using here for like a leg off the table or tear the at

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.500
that.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:21.530
Then you can pull like this because European one is put on the finger talk,

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:27.440
then then pushing like this is.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.460
But the Japanese version is good.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.880
Sewing more faster,

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.970
much faster.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.480
It's already you can buy if you like,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.640
but you can make using the piece of leather.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:48.520
So it zz just the cut that Gorondi and just throwing together the huge just take a cut the

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.080
weather,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:58.250
then put it together I think I used the left over public for the bill Cash build making

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.720
something.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.820
So I was thinking maybe you can if you have ah,

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.490
one side of the globe.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.040
Yeah,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.770
that glove.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.030
Yeah,

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.840
just cut it.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.900
Maybe even finger part that you can make it.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.920
No,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.880
not that way.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:21.560
This would go like this.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:33.850
You have Teoh,

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:44.250
right?

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:44.520
Right,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:44.710
right.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.140
That's right.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.340
Right.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.030
That's like a push Push over here.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.930
It's almost like a no sewing.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.830
Just like a pushing.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.790
They're just This side is going like,

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:02.740
yeah,

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.340
this side is just pushing,

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.350
but this side is like going like a waving All right,

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.970
right.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:20.160
So I I'm gonna sharing the you dio for all the stitches.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.480
And so I'm gonna show you all the stitches I'm going to share.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.800
So if you watched the video,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.670
you're going to see how they sewing really fast.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.490
And also moving this hand is pretty important.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.400
Not decided only here,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:41.190
But I just want to show you what kind of sticks we heart gonna use for the material later.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.380
So before the that's thick images do you see the 1st 1 section called me?

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.930
Duck it.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:53.900
You take a is heights I don't know why they call heights because a woman has a local story

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.000
is like a longer kimono.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.300
That's why they use the hype.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.430
Men don't use the height,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.380
the heights.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.320
Do you see that?

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.470
Lying a body,

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.430
things meet.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.320
ACA is heights.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.670
So do you remember your heights?

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:17.460
I So he wanted to make sure to someone to measure and they measuring each other.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.210
It's soon.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:19.710
Okay,

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.110
that's that.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.700
That's the height,

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.420
that full length,

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.520
like a top to the bottom Is that the hype?

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.830
And the next one is kind of Oh,

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.760
you have a pen that's really quick.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.190
And when?

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.440
When I want you to measure all the yellow area tonight,

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:43.150
then and when I got home had Kubica stuck.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.820
It is from the neck.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.150
You hear the born,

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:50.230
then it's going to be not all the way,

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.130
the bottom all the way.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.050
Baden bore,

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.080
even at the cost.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.140
The center is like a base off the neck base of the neck,

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.490
right here,

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.940
the U key.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.150
It's a week from centre back to this.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:25.280
It took the mug it that it's like 44 45 Wrigley's center from and also the top of the So

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.570
they're born people book from the bone.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:42.710
So I have a really with leave the right from here to here is that right?

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:49.610
Side is supposed to be this number when you plus these two twin What's the size?

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:58.720
What works when I would go e when it's 20.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.930
But what is what is this?

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:04.650
27.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:07.650
The back to Rick 27.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.300
Well,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.010
but how friends is different.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.200
Yeah,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.170
it's 27.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.150
What?

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.320
So that would be seven.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:34.290
I put it a diabetic about you might have got the Nobel final step course.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:39.810
Imani around hip it on hip would be this way.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:43.880
I Okay,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.800
so that would be there.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.380
But what?

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.940
I know you don't have to make it.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.050
This is your measurement,

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:50.390
you know,

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.560
keeping your mission.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.630
This is This is the Yuki.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.640
It's a weed measure.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.280
My Okay.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.240
There's ah,

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.450
standard size next three white area.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.290
There's an inch.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:32.320
And since middle that the standard Japanese signs You see why the area even this'll person

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.300
has a small kip.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.390
But we have to make the big you know,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:47.080
kimono according to the soldier with because otherwise I'm gonna fit right 29 stitches.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.110
I think we don't have a time to go over,

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:55.100
but I guess I'm going to send you all the stitches and there's Ah like the one is.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.530
I'm gonna give you the video.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.130
Then you can practice if you like.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:00.850
If you don't help me,

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:02.500
do you have enough thread?

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.460
Yeah,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.630
so I'll give you the homework to practice this.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:11.560
Ditch them.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.610
Bring Buck next sessions.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.100
There's a nine stitches,

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.020
so you have to practice nine.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:19.950
Yes,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.280
nice.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.610
Did she?

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.490
If I'll give you the video as well,

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.710
it's easy.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:32.520
And it should be fun that used for the sleep connection to make a stronger.
