00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
I am going to show you how to solder yukata using quarter size of yukata.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.070
That's so silly.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.650
First,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.390
in order to prevent the free edges from the feeling at the bottom of the sea,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.350
it also lay enforcement purpose,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.850
using as pocket to carry something.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:35.160
The user friends seen meth are that cold who could only in Japanese faultlessly wrong side

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.690
together.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.980
Study Monk will be 1.5 times off the remaining seen on the sleeve attaching side,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.220
and the mark will be there upon five cents mirror before,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.440
from the start off,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.960
the Carp started,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.050
so one sense Merrill away from the edge to 0.5 cents medal before the start off the card

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:13.410
started so one centimeter away from the edge to Europe on five cents a medal before the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.340
start of the car.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.790
So along the bottom of the sleeve,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.290
lying close to the roads,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.750
pull the needle and the thread through to the nod.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.580
Use runnings.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.800
This,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.990
too,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.350
so take 2 to 3 stitches on the needle.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.980
Keep the legs off the stitch.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.110
The same 2 to 3 stitches percent meter.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:58.130
It means 5 to 7 stitches per inch after you.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:09.240
So until the ads to dera 0.5 centimeter before the start of the curve fall along the line

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.190
with 0.1 centimeter of Kisa eloquence that is a tiny buffer zone left around the scene.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.550
Then turn over the sleep inside out.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.730
After you make you say stitch,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.150
Alon is hidden by not opening the scene right at the stitching line.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.750
The first stitch is over the edge of the Tropic.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.590
After that,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.250
using running stitches to sew along the bottom of deceive line.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:03:05.580
Is there a point to sentimental inside a road edge until the start of the car in Japanese,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:16.070
so in the needle is held still and the fabric placed on it in a pleading action put some

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.380
light tension under public and rocket gathering several stitches onto the needle.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.650
After stating an inch or two,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.370
I grew up on the threat the little.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.450
Then,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.710
using your thumb carefree stretch out the stitching.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.680
The action called it a cookie.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.950
The idea is to keep the work lose so the stitching does not.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.450
Parker.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.450
After the boxed its own,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.150
you cannot stretch out the stitching.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.850
When you at the start of the car,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.850
do you eat a cookie which stretched out to the Parker then so one back stitch,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.070
then so small stitches on the car line until the end off the car.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.250
At the end of the car,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.390
you do eat a Cokie again,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.190
then so one back stitch again after the car,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:39.050
keep so along with running stitches until the wrist opening at the end,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.350
missed opening.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:05:02.450
Scoop a small buck stitch and sew back 2 to 3 stitches to finish off stitching.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:12.380
Pull the thread and needles through the back and make a not and thieves the threat l

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.870
through several stitches before clipping the threat.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.870
-

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:54.860
Oh

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.860
,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.860
-

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:28.570
fall

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.120
the same.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:44.650
A winds treated with Ki se towards the front side because I am showing quarter scale of

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.450
yukata.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.750
So only one carve from the seem to make the car blind.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.940
Lleva wings off,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.150
thread dangling at the end off the carbs,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.520
then tighten the threat to form a buffer.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.180
Bolt.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.710
Buffer is a key,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:16.780
say arranged so that gathers of the same eloquence are at the center of the car.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.980
Then I make a nod to end.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:35.310
Oh,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:09:04.950
try folder using finger or Iran quarter size.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.510
I've seen a PIC approximately 0.2 sentimental trifle.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.750
The narrow hem very know him like a Elle nous silk scarf.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:19.890
Start from one stitch before the end of the sleeve,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.150
restore playing.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:27.810
And so along the narrow hem using slip stitch.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:37.390
So one stitch on the top of the sleeve to play bend to fly the hem.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:48.110
So to the one stitch after end off this leave risked opening in certain Nero one states

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.000
bellow and end of the wrist opening and stitch.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.550
The triple folded scene with Slip Stitch is at 0.5 sentimental inter volts,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:07.850
so this hem with stitches laugh free general 0.5 cents matter apart.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:18.510
You a noodle shoot a path through between the full bill layers off the hem so that most of

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:26.280
the thread it's hidden dipping outward to make a tiny stitch through to the right side of

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.700
the far brick and then running under the fold.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.720
Do not so,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.540
exactly on the tip off the crease,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.490
off the full that edge of the him,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:48.050
but rather above their 0.1 cents middle that sold alot from the edge.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.200
That is a key,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.790
say elements possible.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.170
If,

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.040
if possible,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:02.070
it was be a bit hard to do on quarter scale after yukata.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.860
But if you can try,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:03.860
-

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:41.000
once

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.350
you have finished hemming the wrist,

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.890
flip the sleeves so that is right side out.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.920
Make sure you leave a 0.1 cents mirror,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.950
kiss a along all the themes and then I run the edges.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:02.520
The base of the risks him should be exactly level with the key.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.390
Say off.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.350
The rest of the scene is completely three portion of the yukata.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:14.250
You can attest this leave after you have finished the body portion of the yukata.
