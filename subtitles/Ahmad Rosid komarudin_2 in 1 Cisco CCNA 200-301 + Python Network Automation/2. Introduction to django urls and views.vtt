00:00:00.760  -->  00:00:04.880
In the previous video, we learned about the
Django basic concept. And In this video we

2

00:00:05.120  -->  00:00:14.900
and in this will learn about urls and views deeply. Later,
we will create some page in our project

3

00:00:15.080  -->  00:00:20.380
so we can get better understanding about urls
and views in Django.

4

00:00:20.640  -->  00:00:25.240
But before that, let’s review our code from
previous video first.

5

00:00:26.020  -->  00:00:33.960
This is the ulrs.py file inside our first_project
directory, here we can see that we have admin

6

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:44.120
urls and root url. The root urls is redirected
to app1.urls, which is urls.py file inside

7

00:00:44.120  -->  00:00:49.080
app1, let’s take a look to that file.

8

00:00:52.480  -->  00:00:59.500
Here we can see that the root urls is redirected
to hello_world function inside views.

9

00:00:59.960  -->  00:01:08.440
Let's take a look at views.py file, here we can
see that hello_world function is returning

10

00:01:08.440  -->  00:01:12.620
simple html expressions “Selamat datang
di Django”

11

00:01:12.700  -->  00:01:24.420
Let’s open our browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000.
Here we get Selamat datang di Django.

12

00:01:24.820  -->  00:01:27.880
Now let’s do some experiments.

13

00:01:28.600  -->  00:01:35.880
Back to visual studio code and manipulate
urls.py file inside first_project directory.

14

00:01:36.540  -->  00:01:44.300
Let’s add app1 here, don’t forget to always
add / in the end of the url.

15

00:01:47.520  -->  00:02:01.020
Let’s back to the browser, refresh, here
we get a 404 error. We can see here that the

16

00:02:01.020  -->  00:02:09.660
available url is admin and app1, Now let’s
try to add app1 in the url.

17

00:02:12.440  -->  00:02:17.500
Here we can see that now we get Selamat datang di Django.

18

00:02:18.440  -->  00:02:26.400
Let’s do another experiment, go back to
vscode, and edit urls.py file inside app1

19

00:02:26.400  -->  00:02:35.500
directory. Let’s add hello_world here. Don’t
forget to always add / in the end of the url.

20

00:02:39.200  -->  00:02:48.600
Let’s back to browser and refresh. Here
we can see that we get 404 error, and we also

21

00:02:48.740  -->  00:02:58.700
see that the available url is admin and app1/hello_world.
That’s why when we try to access only app1

22

00:02:58.700  -->  00:03:08.599
we get a 404 error. Now let’s try to add
hello_world in the url. Okay Cool ! now we

23

00:03:08.600  -->  00:03:10.560
get Selamat datang di Django.

24

00:03:11.020  -->  00:03:19.400
Okay, Let’s do an experiment again, let’s
try to add a new url. Here in the urls.py

25

00:03:19.400  -->  00:03:29.420
file inside app1 directory, let’s add a
new url, let’s say a. This is just for experiment,

26

00:03:29.420  -->  00:03:37.440
you can put whatever you want here. This url
will be redirected to a function inside views

27

00:03:37.720  -->  00:03:46.680
Now we need to create a function in the views,
go to views, and here let’s add a function.

28

00:03:58.060  -->  00:04:01.960
Let’s say we want to display “This is
A”.

29

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:22.840
Let’s back to browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/app1/a.
Okay now we get “This is A”

30

00:04:23.500  -->  00:04:26.540
Let’s try to add one more url,

31

00:04:32.900  -->  00:04:35.420
let’s say
we want to add b.

32

00:04:40.640  -->  00:04:45.300
This url will be redirected to b function inside views.

33

00:04:46.160  -->  00:05:03.180
Let’s create b function inside views.py
file. Let’s say we want to display “This is B"

34

00:05:04.060  -->  00:05:17.420
Back to browser again, change a with b, and
here we are. Now we get “This is B”

35

00:05:18.320  -->  00:05:25.480
Okay now let’s try to test all of our url,
let’s change b to hello_world.

36

00:05:26.040  -->  00:05:36.100
Okay we get Selamat datang di Django. Change hello_world
to a. Okay we get “This is A”, and let’s

37

00:05:36.100  -->  00:05:41.580
change again to b. Okay we get “This is
B”.

38

00:05:42.140  -->  00:05:48.580
Okay I think we already done some experiment
and I hope you guys understand about urls

39

00:05:48.580  -->  00:05:54.380
and views concept in Django. If you think that
you are not fully understand the concept,

40

00:05:54.380  -->  00:06:00.360
I recommend you to rewatch this video. Or
if you have further question, you can ask

41

00:06:00.360  -->  00:06:04.660
me and I will do my best to answer all of
your questions.

42

00:06:05.100  -->  00:06:08.260
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
