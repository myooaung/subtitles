00:00:00.513  -->  00:00:04.361
In the previous video, we already learn about
web server.

2

00:00:05.209  -->  00:00:10.250
Next in this video, we are going to learn
about extended access list.

3

00:00:10.901  -->  00:00:20.292
The case is, we want to block all http access,
so we can not access the server with http,

4

00:00:20.923  -->  00:00:25.547
but we still able to access server with https.

5

00:00:26.546  -->  00:00:38.356
And then, all vlan is allowed to access server 1,
only vlan 20 is allowed to access server 2,

6

00:00:40.382  -->  00:00:45.473
and last, only vlan 30 is allowed to access server 3.

7

00:00:54.126  -->  00:00:59.900
So this is the case that we are going to use
to learn about extended access list.

8

00:01:00.428  -->  00:01:06.594
Now letâ€™s learn about the differences between
standard and extended access list.

9

00:01:07.886  -->  00:01:13.146
In standard access list, the rule is only
based on source address.

10

00:01:17.105  -->  00:01:22.212
Here we can see that the rule is deny and
then the source address.

11

00:01:23.908  -->  00:01:28.284
Extended access list is more powerful than
standard access list.

12

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:36.300
In the extended access list, the rule will
based on source address, destination address,

13

00:01:36.300  -->  00:01:38.173
and also protocol.

14

00:01:39.182  -->  00:01:44.414
So with extended access list, we can block
specific packet.

15

00:01:45.281  -->  00:01:53.417
Here in the rule 1, we only block http, so
https will still allowed.

16

00:01:54.124  -->  00:02:00.208
This case only possible if we use extended
access list, we can not use standard access

17

00:02:00.208  -->  00:02:08.419
list for this case, because in standard access
list, the rule is only based on source address.

18

00:02:09.513  -->  00:02:16.000
Okay I think enough for this video, I hope
you understand the differences between standard

19

00:02:16.000  -->  00:02:18.191
and extended access list.

20

00:02:18.907  -->  00:02:24.482
In the next video, we are going to learn how
to configure extended access list.

21

00:02:25.094  -->  00:02:28.665
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
