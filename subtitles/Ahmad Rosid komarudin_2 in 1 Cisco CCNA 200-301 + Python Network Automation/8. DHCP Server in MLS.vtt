00:00:00.469  -->  00:00:05.831
In the previous video, we have done configuring
svi on the multi layer switch.

2

00:00:06.368  -->  00:00:11.114
So now connection between pc in the different
vlan is OK.

3

00:00:12.176  -->  00:00:18.891
Next in this video, we are going to configure
dhcp server on the multi layer switch.

4

00:00:19.785  -->  00:00:25.697
So we don’t need to configure an ip address
manually one by one in all pc.

5

00:00:26.550  -->  00:00:34.189
Let’s just start, open the multi layer switch,
and then go to global configuration mode.

6

00:00:35.925  -->  00:00:42.790
Actually the configuration will be the same
as we configure dhcp server in the router.

7

00:00:43.726  -->  00:00:52.121
So first we need to create a pool, this is
for vlan 1, so the pool name let’s say vlan1.

8

00:00:53.247  -->  00:01:03.299
Next let’s define the network, this is pool
for vlan 1, so the network is 192.168.1.0

9

00:01:03.552  -->  00:01:06.886
255.255.255.0.

10

00:01:08.254  -->  00:01:16.549
The default router is the ip address of multi
layer switch for vlan1, which is 192.168.1.1.

11

00:01:17.390  -->  00:01:24.115
for dns server, we can use google dns server,
which is 8.8.8.8.

12

00:01:25.252  -->  00:01:30.537
Okay we have done for vlan 1, let’s continue
for vlan 10.

13

00:01:32.094  -->  00:01:49.638
Network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0, default-router
192.168.10.1, and then dns-server 8.8.8.8

14

00:01:50.722  -->  00:02:04.925
Next for vlan 20, ip dhcp pool vlan 20, network
192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0,

15

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:15.881
default-router 192.168.20.1, and dns-server 8.8.8.8

16

00:02:16.755  -->  00:02:20.050
Last, let’s configure for vlan 30.

17

00:02:20.829  -->  00:02:39.500
Ip dhcp pool vlan30, network 192.168.30.0
255.255.255.0, default-router 192.168.30.1,

18

00:02:39.911  -->  00:02:43.293
and dns-server 8.8.8.8

19

00:02:44.566  -->  00:02:49.578
Okay now we have done configuring dhcp server
for all vlan.

20

00:02:50.251  -->  00:02:54.462
Next let’s try configure dhcp client on
the pc.

21

00:02:55.167  -->  00:02:57.263
Let’s start frorm room 3.

22

00:02:59.736  -->  00:03:07.473
Okay here we can see dhcp request successful,
let’s just configure dhcp clien on all pc.

23

00:03:08.241  -->  00:03:13.811
I will speed up the video until the configuration
on all pc is done.

24

00:03:19.039  -->  00:03:25.170
Okay now all pc get an ip address automatically
from the dhcp server.

25

00:03:25.938  -->  00:03:27.740
Let’s test the connection.

26

00:03:28.381  -->  00:03:32.778
Here from vlan 10 room 1, to the vlan 30 room 2.

27

00:03:33.304  -->  00:03:38.734
The first packet is failed, let’s test again,
okay this is success.

28

00:03:39.597  -->  00:03:44.819
Next from vlan 1 room 1 to the vlan 20 room
2.

29

00:03:45.387  -->  00:03:51.868
The first packet is failed, let’s test again,
okay this is success.

30

00:03:52.614  -->  00:03:57.981
Last, let’s try from vlan 20 room 1 to the
vlan 10 room 3.

31

00:03:58.444  -->  00:04:05.417
The first packet is failed, let’s test again,
and now this is success.

32

00:04:06.427  -->  00:04:11.778
Okay so now we have done configuring dhcp
server in the multi layer switch.

33

00:04:12.484  -->  00:04:14.600
I think enough for this video

34

00:04:14.811  -->  00:04:18.116
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video
