00:00:00.171  -->  00:00:04.823
In the previous video, we already
learn about standard access list,

2

00:00:05.162  -->  00:00:10.419
so the case is we block the
packet from vlan 20 to the server.

3

00:00:10.575  -->  00:00:16.373
We assign the access list in
the fa0/0 with direction out.

4

00:00:17.181  -->  00:00:22.084
Next in this video, we are going
to learn more about direction.

5

00:00:22.526  -->  00:00:31.837
We will remove the access-group in the fa0/0
and then try to assign the access list to fa0/1.

6

00:00:32.283  -->  00:00:40.000
And absolutely if we assign the access
list to fa0/1, the direction will be in,

7

00:00:40.421  -->  00:00:48.839
because if we see the flow, from vlan 20 go to server,
the packet will be go like this.

8

00:00:49.114  -->  00:00:59.825
So here in the fa0/1, the packet will be in,
but in fa0/0, the packet will be out.

9

00:01:00.594  -->  00:01:09.234
Okay now let’s go to interface fa0/0,
and then no ip access-group 1 out.

10

00:01:11.261  -->  00:01:18.008
Now the access list is not assign to any
interface, so now, vlan 20 should be able

11

00:01:18.008  -->  00:01:25.840
to ping to the server again, let’s try. Okay
here we can see that the result is success.

12

00:01:26.286  -->  00:01:38.012
Now let’s assign the access-list to fa0/1,
interface fa0/1, ip access-group 1 in.

13

00:01:38.636  -->  00:01:42.141
Let’s test from vlan 20 to the server again,

14

00:01:43.653  -->  00:01:50.149
okay here failed. Test again from
vlan 20 to server 2, also failed.

15

00:01:50.552  -->  00:01:58.933
Let’s see the access-list, do show access-list,
here we can see that now the match is 6.

16

00:01:59.630  -->  00:02:03.650
Okay now let’s talk more about direction.

17

00:02:04.190  -->  00:02:11.897
If we assign the access-list in fa0/1 with
direction in like this, the packet that blocked

18

00:02:11.897  -->  00:02:19.890
is not only from vlan 20 to the server, but
from vlan 20 to the router will also blocked.

19

00:02:20.362  -->  00:02:26.043
Why? Remember that we assign
the access list in the fa0/1,

20

00:02:26.423  -->  00:02:31.486
so packet from vlan 20 to the
router will also blocked here.

21

00:02:32.206  -->  00:02:40.606
Let’s test it, vlan 20 to the router 2, here we
can see that the result Is failed, test again,

22

00:02:43.032  -->  00:02:44.213
still failed.

23

00:02:45.093  -->  00:02:50.823
Let’s see the access list, here we
can see that now the match is 8.

24

00:02:51.356  -->  00:02:59.478
Let’s test from vlan 10 to pc 2, success,
vlan 10 to the server, also success.

25

00:03:00.381  -->  00:03:10.099
Okay so if we assign the access list in fa0/0,
from vlan 20 to the router is still success,

26

00:03:10.312  -->  00:03:13.139
but to the server absolutely failed.

27

00:03:13.550  -->  00:03:21.867
But if we assign the access list in fa0/1,
from vlan 20 to the router is already blocked.

28

00:03:22.312  -->  00:03:36.941
Let’s try, now let’s remove the access list from
fa0/1, interface fa0/1, no ip access-group 1 in,

29

00:03:37.562  -->  00:03:48.488
and then let’s assign the access list to fa0/0
again, interface fa0/0, ip access-group 1 out.

30

00:03:49.535  -->  00:03:55.810
Okay now from vlan 20 to the router
should be success. Let’s test it,

31

00:03:56.480  -->  00:04:04.080
Okay here we can see that the result is success.
Let’s see the access list , do show access-list,

32

00:04:04.609  -->  00:04:16.236
here we can see that the match on second rule is
19, let’s test again, show again, okay here we can

33

00:04:16.236  -->  00:04:25.091
see that the match is still 19, this is because
we assign the access list to fa0/0,

34

00:04:25.091  -->  00:04:35.000
and the packet from vlan 20 to the router is not go through
fa0/0, this is why the packet is not match.

35

00:04:35.665  -->  00:04:41.886
Some of you may be have a question, why
we don’t configure access list on router1.

36

00:04:42.366  -->  00:04:51.269
If we configure access list on router 1, we
can assign the access list to fa0/0 or fa0/1,

37

00:04:51.901  -->  00:04:55.098
if we assign to fa0/0,

38

00:04:55.098  -->  00:05:03.699
the direction is in, and we assign the
access list to fa0/1, the direction is out.

39

00:05:04.480  -->  00:05:12.789
Let’s say we assign the access list
on fa0/0, so from vlan 20 to router 1,

40

00:05:12.789  -->  00:05:15.680
router 2, and server will be blocked.

41

00:05:16.270  -->  00:05:25.891
Let’s try it, unassign the access list on router2
first, here we assign the access list to fa0/0,

42

00:05:26.575  -->  00:05:33.497
go to interface fa0/0, and
then no ip access-group 1 out.

43

00:05:33.855  -->  00:05:37.451
Next we can copy the access list configuration,

44

00:05:37.756  -->  00:05:43.585
and then next we will paste the
configuration to router 1, do show run,

45

00:05:48.427  -->  00:05:52.541
this is the access list configuration, copy.

46

00:05:54.095  -->  00:05:57.573
Now let’s configure the access list on router 1.

47

00:05:58.000  -->  00:06:05.000
Enable, configure terminal, let’s just
paste the access list from router 2.

48

00:06:05.966  -->  00:06:09.791
Next, let’s assign the access list to interface,

49

00:06:10.190  -->  00:06:20.267
let’s say we will assign to fa0/0, so
interface fa0/0, ip access-group 1 in.

50

00:06:20.929  -->  00:06:28.373
Now from vlan 20 to router 1, router 2, and
server should be blocked. Let’s test it.

51

00:06:29.181  -->  00:06:37.276
Okay this is success, test again
from pc 2 to router 1, still success.

52

00:06:37.695  -->  00:06:45.154
Let’s check it, do show access list, okay
here nothing match with the access list.

53

00:06:45.787  -->  00:06:56.206
This is because the interface that connected
to vlan 20 is not fa0/0, but fa0/0.20,

54

00:06:56.876  -->  00:07:01.307
so let unassign the access list from fa0/0,

55

00:07:02.710  -->  00:07:09.920
and then go to interface fa0/0.20. ip access-group 1 in.

56

00:07:10.522  -->  00:07:19.866
Let’s test again, from vlan 20 to
router1, failed, vlan 20 to router 2,

57

00:07:21.101  -->  00:07:26.827
also failed, vlan 20 to server, also failed.

58

00:07:27.448  -->  00:07:29.482
Let’s see the access list again,

59

00:07:29.482  -->  00:07:37.585
do show access-list, here we can see that the
match is 3. This is because we send 3 packet.

60

00:07:38.156  -->  00:07:42.259
Okay, so now from vlan 20 to anywhere is blocked.

61

00:07:42.808  -->  00:07:48.815
This is why we configure the access list
on router 2, because if we configure the

62

00:07:48.815  -->  00:07:56.225
access list on router 1, so from vlan 20
to router 1 and router 2 will also blocked.

63

00:07:57.006  -->  00:08:04.526
Let’s unassign the access
list, no ip access-group 1 in,

64

00:08:07.196  -->  00:08:08.790
Test the ping again,

65

00:08:17.467  -->  00:08:19.036
okay success.

66

00:08:19.329  -->  00:08:23.375
Now let’s assign the access list on router 2 again,

67

00:08:23.867  -->  00:08:29.078
Interface fa0/0, ip access-group 1 out.

68

00:08:29.615  -->  00:08:37.695
Let’s test again, vlan 20 to router,
success, vlan 20 to router 2 also success,

69

00:08:38.114  -->  00:08:42.274
vlan 20 to server, okay this is failed.

70

00:08:42.857  -->  00:08:48.179
Okay I hope you understand the
implementation of direction in access list.

71

00:08:48.644  -->  00:08:50.946
I think enough for this video

72

00:08:51.129  -->  00:08:54.465
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
