00:00:00.295  -->  00:00:07.183
In the previous video, we already configure
the ip address of all router, server, and pc.

2

00:00:07.990  -->  00:00:14.131
Now in this video, we are going to configure
routing between Google and ISP.

3

00:00:15.162  -->  00:00:24.058
In this case, we are going to use BGP. Remember that bgp is
used to connecting between autonomous system.

4

00:00:24.955  -->  00:00:33.000
So let’s say google is in autonomous system
1, and ISP is in autonomouos system 2.

5

00:00:33.825  -->  00:00:41.427
Let’s start with google, router
bgp 1, let’s define the neighbor,

6

00:00:42.000  -->  00:00:50.364
in this case the neighbor will be ISP, so
neighbor and then the ip address of ISP,

7

00:00:50.715  -->  00:01:00.195
which is 10.10.10.2 remote-as 2, so this
is the autonomous system number of ISP.

8

00:01:02.192  -->  00:01:09.244
Next let’s advertise the connected
network, let’s start with 10.10.10.0,

9

00:01:09.886  -->  00:01:17.141
so network 10.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0,

10

00:01:17.740  -->  00:01:30.994
Next let’s advertise the network that connected
to server, network 172.16.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0

11

00:01:32.136  -->  00:01:42.344
Okay we have done on google router, next
let’s configure on ISP, router bgp 2,

12

00:01:43.423  -->  00:01:53.105
and then let’s define the neighbor, in this case the
neighbor is google, so neighbor 10.10.10.1

13

00:01:53.105  -->  00:02:02.002
remote-as 1. This is the ip address of google, and
this is the autonomous system number of google.

14

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:13.978
Next, let’s advertise the connected network,
network 10.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0,

15

00:02:15.058  -->  00:02:19.507
we will also need to advertise the
network that connected to customer,

16

00:02:20.028  -->  00:02:27.743
so network 10.20.20.0 mask 255.255.255.0

17

00:02:28.988  -->  00:02:36.285
Okay now we have done configuring
bgp on google and ISP. For testing,

18

00:02:36.536  -->  00:02:40.176
here we can see the routing table on ISP.

19

00:02:40.795  -->  00:02:48.834
Do show ip route, here we can see that now
ISP have a route to go to the google server,

20

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:54.117
which is 172.16.10.0/24.

21

00:02:55.110  -->  00:02:58.514
Let’s also check the routing
table on the google router,

22

00:03:01.364  -->  00:03:09.050
do show ip route, here we can see that we also
have a route to go to the customer network,

23

00:03:09.444  -->  00:03:13.905
which is 10.20.20.0/24.

24

00:03:14.662  -->  00:03:21.081
Okay I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn about the concept

25

00:03:21.081  -->  00:03:23.665
of network address translation.

26

00:03:24.384  -->  00:03:27.712
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
