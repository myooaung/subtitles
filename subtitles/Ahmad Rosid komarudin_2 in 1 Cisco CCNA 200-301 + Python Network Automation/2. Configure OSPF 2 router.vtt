00:00:00.683  -->  00:00:08.030
In the previous video, we already create topology
with 2 router, now in this video we are going to

2

00:00:08.030  -->  00:00:18.886
configure ospf in this topology. The concept of
ospf is same as eigrp, which is each router must

3

00:00:18.886  -->  00:00:27.170
advertise their connected network. So for example
here router 1 must be have 2 connected network,

4

00:00:27.418  -->  00:00:42.032
which is 10.10.10.0/24 connected to fa0/0,
and 192.168.1.0/24 connected to fa0/1.

5

00:00:44.007  -->  00:00:47.330
Router 2 must be have 2 connected network,

6

00:00:48.354  -->  00:01:00.760
10.10.10.0/24 connected to fa0/0 and
192.168.2.0/24 connected to fa0/1.

7

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:05.928
So router 1 and router 2 must advertise 2 network.

8

00:01:06.642  -->  00:01:16.890
Let’s start configuring router 1, the
command is router ospf, if we use eigrp,

9

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:25.840
we must define autonomous system number,
but in ospf, we must define ospf process id.

10

00:01:26.844  -->  00:01:28.920
Here let’s exit first.

11

00:01:30.746  -->  00:01:39.396
And then router ospf and question mark, here we
can see that we need to define ospf process id.

12

00:01:40.180  -->  00:01:48.454
In the eigrp, the autonomous system number
must be same on all routers, but in ospf,

13

00:01:48.580  -->  00:01:55.922
because this is only ospf process id, so
the number can be different in each router.

14

00:01:56.548  -->  00:02:04.260
Let’s say in router 1, we use router
ospf 1, in router 2 we use router ospf 2,

15

00:02:04.524  -->  00:02:10.238
and in router 3 we use router
ospf 3, this is will work.

16

00:02:10.976  -->  00:02:17.174
Or if we use same ospf process id
in all router, this is also work.

17

00:02:18.402  -->  00:02:20.930
Okay, let’s say here we use 1,

18

00:02:22.318  -->  00:02:30.996
Next we need to advertise all of connected
network. Let’s advertise 10.10.10.0/24,

19

00:02:31.748  -->  00:02:43.592
so network 10.10.10.0, in the eigrp, the command
is just like this and we can enter, but in ospf,

20

00:02:43.592  -->  00:02:48.586
we need to add some argument, question mark,

21

00:02:48.896  -->  00:02:51.678
Here we need to define wildcard bits,

22

00:02:52.058  -->  00:02:57.900
what is wildcard bits? Wildcard
bits is the reverse of subnetmask.

23

00:02:58.458  -->  00:03:06.256
We know that for prefix /24,
the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0.

24

00:03:10.000  -->  00:03:20.266
And then, to calculate wildcard bits, the
formula is 255.255.255.255 minus by subnetmask.

25

00:03:20.924  -->  00:03:30.850
In this case, the prefix is /24, and the
subnetmask for prefix /24 is 255.255.255.0.

26

00:03:32.390  -->  00:03:41.877
So here 255 minus by 0 is 255,
255 minus by 255 is 0,

27

00:03:41.877  -->  00:03:49.220
255 minus by 255 is 0 and 255
minus by 255 again is also 0.

28

00:03:49.894  -->  00:03:57.310
So the wildcard bits for prefix /24 is 0.0.0.255

29

00:03:59.160  -->  00:04:02.722
Okay, this is how we calculate wildcard bits.

30

00:04:07.668  -->  00:04:10.280
Now let’s back to the configuration,

31

00:04:10.854  -->  00:04:21.860
so here the wildcard bits is 0.0.0.255. And then
question mark again, here we need to define area,

32

00:04:24.346  -->  00:04:32.866
and then question mark, we must define the
area number. For now, let’s just use area 0.

33

00:04:33.800  -->  00:04:38.942
Okay now we have done
advertise network 10.10.10.0.

34

00:04:39.512  -->  00:04:44.218
Next, let’s advertise the
network that connected to pc 1.

35

00:04:44.848  -->  00:04:54.734
So here, network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.

36

00:04:56.360  -->  00:05:04.440
Okay now we have done configuring ospf on
router 1, next let’s configure on router 2.

37

00:05:06.172  -->  00:05:13.338
Enable, configure terminal, and
then router ospf, remember that

38

00:05:13.338  -->  00:05:21.724
here we need to define ospf process id, and
ospf process id doesn’t have to be same.

39

00:05:22.542  -->  00:05:29.568
In the router 1 we use process id 1,
let’s say here we will use process id 2.

40

00:05:30.562  -->  00:05:43.206
Next, let’s advertise the network,
network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.

41

00:05:44.228  -->  00:05:58.110
Next let’s advertise the network that connected
to pc 2, so network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.

42

00:06:00.694  -->  00:06:05.666
Okay now we have done configuring
ospf on router 1 and router 2.

43

00:06:06.016  -->  00:06:16.892
Let’s verify it, do show ip ospf neighbor,
here we can see that now we have ospf neighbor,

44

00:06:17.206  -->  00:06:22.858
and the status is full. This
is means that the ospf is UP.

45

00:06:24.788  -->  00:06:32.954
Let’s also check the routing table, do show
ip route, here we can see that from router 2,

46

00:06:32.954  -->  00:06:43.640
we have route to 192.168.1.0/24,
the label is O, this is means ospf.

47

00:06:46.388  -->  00:06:50.812
Let’s also check on router 1, do show ip route,

48

00:06:51.968  -->  00:07:01.316
here we can see that router 1 also have a
route to 192.168.2.0/24 and the label is o.

49

00:07:02.002  -->  00:07:13.018
So now pc 1 and pc 2 should be able to communicate
each others. Let’s try, failed, let’s test again,

50

00:07:14.608  -->  00:07:16.232
and here success.

51

00:07:16.712  -->  00:07:21.536
Okay so now we have done
configuring dynamic routing ospf.

52

00:07:22.058  -->  00:07:29.520
I think enough for this video, in the next video,
we are going to add 1 more router to our topology.

53

00:07:30.000  -->  00:07:33.408
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video.
