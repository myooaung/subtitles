00:00:00.468  -->  00:00:08.116
In the previous video, we already add one
router to our topology, so now we have 3 router.

2

00:00:08.757  -->  00:00:16.027
Next in this video, we are going to configure
static routing so pc 3 will able to communicate

3

00:00:16.027  -->  00:00:18.427
with pc 1 and pc 2.

4

00:00:19.257  -->  00:00:20.600
Let’s just start.

5

00:00:21.095  -->  00:00:28.546
Let’s start with pc 1, let’s say pc1 want
to communicate with pc 3, so the source is

6

00:00:28.546  -->  00:00:39.018
192.168.1.10, and the destination is 192.168.3.10,
so pc 1 will ask router 1,

7

00:00:39.018  -->  00:00:47.982
"hey router 1 do you know where is 192.168.3.10?" then router 1 will check it in the routing table,

8

00:00:48.434  -->  00:00:54.715
and here we can see that router 1 don’t know about 192.168.3.10
yet.

9

00:00:55.167  -->  00:00:58.729
So pc 1 can not communicate with pc 3.

10

00:00:59.734  -->  00:01:02.558
Next, let’s try from pc 2.

11

00:01:02.995  -->  00:01:11.856
Let’s say pc 2 want to communicate with pc 3,
so the source is 192.168.2.10, and the destination

12

00:01:11.856  -->  00:01:22.922
is 192.168.3.10, pc 2 will ask router 2, "hey
router 2 do you know where is 192.168.3.10?"

13

00:01:23.461  -->  00:01:29.375
then router 2 will check the routing table,
and here we can see that router 2 don’t know

14

00:01:29.375  -->  00:01:33.026
about 192.168.3.10 yet.

15

00:01:33.376  -->  00:01:37.458
So pc 2 also can not communicate with pc 3.

16

00:01:38.114  -->  00:01:46.844
The summary is pc 1 and pc 2 can not communicate
with pc 3 yet, so we need to configure static routing.

17

00:01:47.582  -->  00:01:49.716
Let’s start from router 1.

18

00:01:50.444  -->  00:02:02.479
If we see in the topology, we have total 5
network, which is 192.168.1.0/24, 10.10.10.0/24,

19

00:02:02.989  -->  00:02:14.889
10.20.20.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, and 192.168.3.0/24.

20

00:02:15.545  -->  00:02:20.168
So here we have 1 2 3 4 5.

21

00:02:20.590  -->  00:02:22.668
We have 5 different network.

22

00:02:23.251  -->  00:02:27.238
So each router must have 5 network in their
routing table.

23

00:02:28.097  -->  00:02:42.712
Here router 1 still have 3, router 1 know about
10.10.10.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24,

24

00:02:43.441  -->  00:02:52.654
router 1 don’t know about 10.20.20.0/24 and
192.168.3.0/24 yet.

25

00:02:53.207  -->  00:02:56.964
So we need to add 2 static routing in router 1.

26

00:02:57.459  -->  00:02:58.462
Let’s start.

27

00:02:58.826  -->  00:03:10.963
Enable, configure terminal, let’s add static
routing to 10.20.20.0 first, so ip route 10.20.20.0

28

00:03:10.963  -->  00:03:20.000
255.255.255.0, the next hop will be router 2,
which is 10.10.10.2.

29

00:03:22.273  -->  00:03:36.368
Next, let’s add static routing to 192.168.3.0/24,
so ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0,

30

00:03:36.790  -->  00:03:39.624
and then the next hop is still router 2.

31

00:03:39.624  -->  00:03:42.692
Which is 10.10.10.2

32

00:03:46.771  -->  00:03:49.656
Okay now we have done in router 1.

33

00:03:49.904  -->  00:03:56.719
Let’s write it, actually this is optional,
but for learning, I think this is important

34

00:03:56.719  -->  00:03:59.112
to write the routing table here.

35

00:04:05.813  -->  00:04:09.101
Okay next let’s configure on router 2.

36

00:04:09.523  -->  00:04:15.497
Router 2 should have 5 network in the routing
table, here we can see that router 2 already

37

00:04:15.497  -->  00:04:21.597
have 4 network, so we just need to add one
more network to routing table,

38

00:04:21.816  -->  00:04:35.947
which is 192.168.3.0/24, so
ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0

39

00:04:36.413  -->  00:04:42.063
and the next hop is router 3, which is 10.20.20.2.

40

00:04:46.186  -->  00:04:53.384
Let’s verify it, do show ip route, okay
here we can see that now router 2 know about

41

00:04:53.384  -->  00:05:00.814
192.168.3.0/24, the next hop is 10.20.20.2.

42

00:05:01.717  -->  00:05:04.381
Let’s also write the routing table here.

43

00:05:04.745  -->  00:05:07.513
Once again, this is optional.

44

00:05:14.826  -->  00:05:21.329
Okay now router 2 already have 5 network in
the routing table, last, let’s configure

45

00:05:21.329  -->  00:05:22.875
on router3.

46

00:05:23.414  -->  00:05:35.225
Here we can see that router3 only have 2 network,
which is 10.20.20.0/24 and 192.168.3.0/24,

47

00:05:35.982  -->  00:05:50.726
so we need to add 3 static routing, which
is 192.168.2.0/24, 10.10.10.0/24, and 192.168.1.0/24.

48

00:05:51.615  -->  00:06:05.084
Let’s start, enable, configure terminal,
let’s add routing to pc 2, so ip route 192.168.2.0

49

00:06:05.084  -->  00:06:14.098
255.255.255.0, the next hop is router 2, which
is 10.20.20.1.

50

00:06:18.921  -->  00:06:31.993
Next let’s add static routing to 10.10.10.0/24,
so ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0

51

00:06:32.212  -->  00:06:38.240
and the next hop is also router 2, which is 10.20.20.1.

52

00:06:39.041  -->  00:06:50.533
Last, let’s add static routing to pc 1, so
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

53

00:06:50.839  -->  00:06:55.000
and the next hop is still 10.20.20.1.

54

00:06:56.127  -->  00:07:02.497
Okay now we have done in router 3, let’s
verify it, do show ip route.

55

00:07:03.910  -->  00:07:09.459
Here we can see that we have 2 connected routing,
and 3 static routig.

56

00:07:10.552  -->  00:07:14.393
Now we have done configuring static routing
on all router.

57

00:07:19.317  -->  00:07:31.801
Let’s try ping between all pc. Let’s try
from pc 2 to pc 3 first, ping 192.168.30.10,

58

00:07:35.327  -->  00:07:38.665
okay here we can see that the result is success.

59

00:07:39.393  -->  00:07:54.631
Next let’s try from pc 1 to pc 3, ping 192.168.3.10,
okay here the result is also success.

60

00:07:55.650  -->  00:07:59.137
Okay, I hope you understand about static routing.

61

00:07:59.428  -->  00:08:06.026
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn about dynamic routing.

62

00:08:06.327  -->  00:08:09.807
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
