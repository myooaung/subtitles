00:00:00.515  -->  00:00:06.990
In the previous video, we already configure an
ip address in router1 and router2.

2

00:00:07.403  -->  00:00:12.133
Next in this video, we are going to talk about routing.

3

00:00:12.790  -->  00:00:22.812
I have a question, is pc 1 able to communicate with pc 2?
Let’s try it, check the ip address first,

4

00:00:23.372  -->  00:00:36.464
pc 2 is correct, pc 1 is also correct. Now
let’s ping from pc 1 to pc 2, ping 192.168.2.10,

5

00:00:37.300  -->  00:00:42.051
okay here we can see the result
is destination host unreachable,

6

00:00:42.492  -->  00:00:45.188
this is means that the ping is failed.

7

00:00:45.932  -->  00:00:56.437
Now let’s see why this is failed. When pc 1 ping
to pc 2, the source is 192.168.1.10,

8

00:00:57.022  -->  00:01:10.103
and the destination is 192.168.2.10, pc 1 will ask router 1,
"hey router 1, do you know where is 192.168.2.10?"

9

00:01:10.680  -->  00:01:16.122
When router 1 receive the question,
router 1 will check the routing table,

10

00:01:16.454  -->  00:01:27.905
let’s check it, do show ip route, here we can
see that router 1 don’t know about 192.168.2.10

11

00:01:28.826  -->  00:01:41.706
Router 1 only have an information about
10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24. This two network

12

00:01:41.706  -->  00:01:50.417
is automatically added to routing table with label
c, because this 2 network is connected to router 1.

13

00:01:51.212  -->  00:02:04.808
10.10.10.0/24 is connected in fa0/1, and
192.168.1.0/24 is connected in fa0/0.

14

00:02:06.163  -->  00:02:09.048
Let’s write the routing table in router 1,

15

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:26.188
Okay, this is why pc 1 can not ping to pc 2,
because router 1 don’t know where is 192.168.2.10.

16

00:02:26.892  -->  00:02:31.820
This is also same if we try
to ping from pc 2 to pc 1,

17

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:42.117
the source is 192.168.2.10 and
the destination is 192.168.1.10,

18

00:02:42.854  -->  00:02:50.920
so pc 2 will ask router 2, "hey router 2
do you know where is 192.168.1.10?"

19

00:02:51.546  -->  00:02:56.437
Router 2 don’t know about 192.168.1.10,

20

00:02:57.217  -->  00:03:05.085
why? Because if we see here in the topology,
router 2 will have 2 entry in the routing table,

21

00:03:05.486  -->  00:03:23.011
which is 10.10.10.0/24 connected to fa0/0,
and 192.168.2.0/24 connected to fa0/1.

22

00:03:26.769  -->  00:03:34.261
Let’s check it, do show ip route, okay here
we can see that we only have an information

23

00:03:34.261  -->  00:03:48.533
about 10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24,
router 2 don’t know about 192.168.1.0/24

24

00:03:49.720  -->  00:03:56.911
So now we need to configure a routing so
pc 1 will able to communicate with pc 2.

25

00:03:58.280  -->  00:04:02.120
In this case we will learn
about static routing first.

26

00:04:02.729  -->  00:04:07.668
Later in the next video, we will
also learn about dynamic routing.

27

00:04:08.783  -->  00:04:11.988
Okay, so let’s focus on static routing.

28

00:04:12.506  -->  00:04:18.086
With static routing, we will tell the
router how to reach destination.

29

00:04:18.600  -->  00:04:29.494
For example we will tell router 1, if router 1 want to go
to 192.168.2.10, router 1 should go to router 2.

30

00:04:30.200  -->  00:04:38.088
And router 2, if want to go to
192.168.1.10, router 2 should go to router 1.

31

00:04:38.723  -->  00:04:42.708
Let’s just start, we will configure router1 first.

32

00:04:43.569  -->  00:04:51.509
Ip route and then the destination network, in
this case we want to tell router 1 how to reach

33

00:04:51.509  -->  00:05:05.891
192.168.2.0/24, so the destination network is
192.168.2.0 and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0

34

00:05:06.660  -->  00:05:17.232
Next we need to define the next hop. If we see
here, if router 1 want to go to 192.168.2.0/24,

35

00:05:17.452  -->  00:05:25.237
absolutely router 1 will go through router 2.
So the next hop is the ip address of router 2,

36

00:05:25.326  -->  00:05:35.143
which is 10.10.10.2. so here let’s put
the router 2 ip address, 10.10.10.2.

37

00:05:36.020  -->  00:05:42.943
In simple word, this command means that
we tell router 1, if router 1 want to go to

38

00:05:42.943  -->  00:05:53.162
192.168.2.0/24, router 1 should go
through 10.10.10.2, which is router 2.

39

00:05:58.440  -->  00:06:03.137
Let’s check the routing table
again, do show ip route,

40

00:06:03.772  -->  00:06:14.225
here we can see that now we have route to
192.168.2.0/24 and the next hop is 10.10.10.2

41

00:06:14.746  -->  00:06:17.708
S here means static routing.

42

00:06:19.512  -->  00:06:25.088
Okay we have done in router 1,
next, let’s configure on router 2.

43

00:06:27.132  -->  00:06:31.428
From router 2, we want to tell how to go to pc 1,

44

00:06:34.512  -->  00:06:45.114
so ip route the destination network is
192.168.1.0 and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0,

45

00:06:45.932  -->  00:06:52.672
and then the gateway is the ip address
of router 1, which is 10.10.10.1.

46

00:06:55.757  -->  00:07:03.511
Okay now let’s see the routing table, do show
ip route, here we can see that now we have S,

47

00:07:03.600  -->  00:07:15.000
this is means static routing, the destination is
192.168.1.0/24 and the next hop is 10.10.10.1.

48

00:07:15.974  -->  00:07:22.574
Now pc 1 and pc 2 should be able to
communicate each others. Let’s try.

49

00:07:25.212  -->  00:07:29.061
Okay here we can see that
now the result is success.

50

00:07:30.000  -->  00:07:36.037
Okay I think enough for this video. I hope you understand about routing static.

51

00:07:36.614  -->  00:07:42.797
In the next video, we are going to add 1 more
router, and then we will learn how to configure

52

00:07:42.797  -->  00:07:45.568
static routing in 3 router.

53

00:07:46.196  -->  00:07:49.764
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
