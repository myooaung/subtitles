00:00:00.620  -->  00:00:05.620
Before test our project, let’s doing some
fix in our project.

2

00:00:06.860  -->  00:00:14.520
Here we have a navbar, but the link is still
not work. Let’s make this link work.

3

00:00:14.760  -->  00:00:16.960
Open the visual studio code.

4

00:00:17.160  -->  00:00:24.540
First, we need to edit urls.py file. We need
to put a name for each url.

5

00:00:24.620  -->  00:00:39.280
Let’s set the name of devices url to devices, configure
url to configure, verify_config url to verify_config,

6

00:00:44.060  -->  00:00:46.580
and log url to log.

7

00:00:51.480  -->  00:00:58.460
Next, let’s edit the template where we put
navbar script. Which is base.html.

8

00:00:58.860  -->  00:01:06.740
Here we can see some link, We have home link
here, if we see in the browser, we have home.

9

00:01:06.740  -->  00:01:09.480
Let’s edit the url for home.

10

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:18.200
But before that, if we see here, we don’t have a name for the home url yet.

11

00:01:18.200  -->  00:01:20.480
Let’s set the name first.

12

00:01:25.260  -->  00:01:31.500
Okay. Let’s back to base.hmtl, here let’s
define the url.

13

00:01:31.740  -->  00:01:37.720
Here we put the name of the url that we have set in the urls.py file.

14

00:01:40.240  -->  00:01:43.800
Next, let’s edit the url for Device List.

15

00:01:59.100  -->  00:02:02.120
Let’s copy this script for other url

16

00:02:02.680  -->  00:02:05.220
Let’s change this to Configure.

17

00:02:15.520  -->  00:02:18.440
We don’t
need disable class here.

18

00:02:23.020  -->  00:02:25.480
Let’s copy the configure link,

19

00:02:26.700  -->  00:02:33.020
paste for
verify_config, and paste again for log.

20

00:02:33.680  -->  00:02:36.620
Let’s change this to verify config,

21

00:02:42.820  -->  00:02:45.320
and change this to log.

22

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:59.020
Now let’s back to the browser, refresh.
Now let’s try the link. Go to home,

23

00:02:59.420  -->  00:03:01.420
go to device list.

24

00:03:04.780  -->  00:03:06.980
Go to configure,

25

00:03:08.260  -->  00:03:14.200
go to verify config, and finally go to log.

26

00:03:16.760  -->  00:03:20.940
Okay now our navbar is working perfectly!

27

00:03:21.460  -->  00:03:27.980
Next, if we see in the home page, we have
a last event here. But the data in the last

28

00:03:27.980  -->  00:03:30.660
event is still dummy data.

29

00:03:30.940  -->  00:03:35.500
Let’s edit this
to show last 10 event from the database.

30

00:03:35.880  -->  00:03:41.980
Open the visual studio code. Edit home function
in the views.py.

31

00:03:46.040  -->  00:03:47.840
Let’s create a new variable

32

00:03:47.840  -->  00:03:51.640
to save the last 10 data from log database.

33

00:04:05.600  -->  00:04:10.680
Here we use order_by -id, means we doing a

34

00:04:10.680  -->  00:04:19.580
reverse order, so we will get the new data.
And here we filter to get only 10 data.

35

00:04:20.660  -->  00:04:24.400
Next we need to add this variable to the context.

36

00:04:32.380  -->  00:04:38.160
Okay, we have done here. Now let’s edit
home.html.

37

00:04:42.240  -->  00:04:44.780
Here we can remove this.

38

00:04:47.360  -->  00:04:51.520
Then we need to doing a looping to the last_event.

39

00:05:02.220  -->  00:05:04.900
Don’t forget to put endfor.

40

00:05:08.500  -->  00:05:10.620
We can just remove this

41

00:05:12.860  -->  00:05:15.400
Let’s put target
in here.

42

00:05:21.100  -->  00:05:23.060
This is the action,

43

00:05:26.780  -->  00:05:28.840
and this is the status.

44

00:05:30.540  -->  00:05:33.480
Finally let’s put the time here.

45

00:05:37.560  -->  00:05:39.700
Let’s back to the browser

46

00:05:42.880  -->  00:05:44.540
Go to home menu.

47

00:05:44.800  -->  00:05:49.080
And here we can see that we don’t have any last event.

48

00:05:49.320  -->  00:05:52.480
This is because we don’t have
any action yet.

49

00:05:52.580  -->  00:05:58.020
Okay, this is the end of this video. Now our project is done!

50

00:05:58.020  -->  00:06:02.160
In the next video, we are going to test our application!
