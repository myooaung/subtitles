00:00:00.256  -->  00:00:04.922
In the previous video, we already learn about
the most simple computer network,

2

00:00:05.425  -->  00:00:08.131
which is connection between two computers.

3

00:00:08.676  -->  00:00:14.757
Here is the example, we have PC 1 connected
to the PC 2 using UTP Cable.

4

00:00:15.899  -->  00:00:22.317
But if we just connecting two computer using
UTP cable like this, these two computer can’t

5

00:00:22.317  -->  00:00:23.488
communicate yet.

6

00:00:24.297  -->  00:00:30.613
If we want PC 1 and PC 2 can communicate each
others, we will need an IP Address on both

7

00:00:30.613  -->  00:00:32.680
of PC 1 and PC 2.

8

00:00:33.643  -->  00:00:35.535
So what is an IP Address?

9

00:00:36.165  -->  00:00:39.808
IP Address is the name of computer in the
computer network.

10

00:00:40.396  -->  00:00:45.962
Let’s imagine in the real world, if we want
to communicate with our friends, we will need

11

00:00:45.962  -->  00:00:48.000
to know his or her name.

12

00:00:48.456  -->  00:00:55.174
Let’s say his name is Dony, so we will call him
“hey Dony!, let’s go to eat”.

13

00:00:55.906  -->  00:01:01.862
As well as computer network, each computer
will need a name to communicate each others.

14

00:01:02.773  -->  00:01:07.225
And the name of computer in the computer network
is an IP Address.

15

00:01:07.889  -->  00:01:17.663
For example, the IP Address of PC 1 is 192.168.1.1,
if you don’t understand this numbers yet, don’t worry!

16

00:01:18.280  -->  00:01:21.548
We will learn more about IP Address in the
next video.

17

00:01:22.042  -->  00:01:26.551
For now, just understand that this is the
example of IP Address.

18

00:01:27.625  -->  00:01:33.165
And then the IP Address of PC 2 is 192.168.1.2

19

00:01:36.463  -->  00:01:42.432
Now these two computer have an IP Address,
so they can communicate each others.

20

00:01:42.987  -->  00:01:52.387
The IP Address of PC 1 is 192.168.1.1, and
the IP Address of PC 2 is 192.168.1.2.

21

00:01:52.924  -->  00:01:59.790
Let’s say PC 2 want to access data on PC 1,
so PC 2 can call the PC 1 IP Address, \which

22

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:03.175
which is 192.168.1.1.

23

00:02:03.729  -->  00:02:06.511
This is how computer network work!

24

00:02:07.363  -->  00:02:12.932
Okay, for the summary, each computer in the
computer network will be need a name to communicate

25

00:02:12.932  -->  00:02:18.926
each others, and the name of computer in the
computer netwok is an IP Address.

26

00:02:19.897  -->  00:02:25.844
Okay I hope you understand about what is IP
Address and why we need an IP Address in the

27

00:02:25.844  -->  00:02:26.861
computer network.

28

00:02:27.449  -->  00:02:32.274
In the next video, we are going to learn how
to install Cisco Packet Tracer.

29

00:02:33.774  -->  00:02:35.388
What is Cisco Packet Tracer?

30

00:02:36.078  -->  00:02:41.305
Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation
tool that will help us very much to learn

31

00:02:41.305  -->  00:02:44.474
about computer network especially cisco.

32

00:02:45.573  -->  00:02:49.621
So thankyou for watching and see you on the
next video!
