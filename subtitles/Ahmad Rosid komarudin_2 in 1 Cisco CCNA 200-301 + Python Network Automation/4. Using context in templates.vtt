In the previous video, we already learned about
templates in Django. Now in this video,

2

00:00:06.980  -->  00:00:12.980
we are going to learn about context. Context
mean that we can pass data from our

3

00:00:12.980  -->  00:00:16.020
views.py file to templates file.

4

00:00:17.120  -->  00:00:22.560
Okay let’s open
the visual studio code and I will show you what i mean

5

00:00:23.560  -->  00:00:27.740
Go to views.py inside app1 directory

6

00:00:28.420  -->  00:00:34.960
Let me explain about context first. In simple
word, the purpose of context is that we can

7

00:00:34.960  -->  00:00:40.600
access the variable that we have defined in
the views.py from the template file.

8

00:00:41.180  -->  00:00:48.360
Let’s create a context in hello world function,
the type of context must be a dictionary

9

00:00:52.180  -->  00:00:58.260
in this example I create a dictionary about
me, the name will be Ahmad

10

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:11.660
and let’s say the age is 21. Now we need
to pass this context in the return statement.

11

00:01:13.660  -->  00:01:19.240
When we pass a context in return statement
like this, we can access this data from the

12

00:01:19.240  -->  00:01:28.860
templates, let’s open hello world.html,
here I can access the context data in templates

13

00:01:28.860  -->  00:01:38.520
file using double curly braces like this.
Let’s also put a age context here.

14

00:01:42.680  -->  00:01:55.440
Now let’s open the browser and go to app1/hello_world,
Here we can see that we get Ahmad and 21.

15

00:01:55.620  -->  00:02:02.780
Okay I think this is enough for this video.
Hope you guys understand about context in Django

00:02:02.780  -->  00:02:06.020
