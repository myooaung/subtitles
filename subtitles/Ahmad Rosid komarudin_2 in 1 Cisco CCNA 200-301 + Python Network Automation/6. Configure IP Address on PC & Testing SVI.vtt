00:00:00.216  -->  00:00:07.988
In the previous video, we have done configuring
svi in the multi layer switch. Next in this video,

2

00:00:07.988  -->  00:00:12.000
we are going to configure
an ip address for all pc.

3

00:00:12.856  -->  00:00:19.040
But I will not configure on all pc,
we will just configure some pc and

4

00:00:19.040  -->  00:00:24.904
test communication between vlan to make
sure our SVI configuration is correct.

5

00:00:26.445  -->  00:00:37.293
Okay let’s start from room 3, this is vlan
20, the ip address let’s say 192.168.20.2

6

00:00:37.577  -->  00:00:42.080
and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

7

00:00:43.953  -->  00:00:52.173
Next this is also vlan 20, the
ip address is 192.168.20.3,

8

00:00:53.519  -->  00:00:59.727
okay here we can see an error message, the
ip address is already used in the network.

9

00:01:00.605  -->  00:01:05.796
This is means that this ip is
already used by others computer.

10

00:01:06.457  -->  00:01:17.704
Let’s use other ip, let’s say 192.168.20.10
and the gateway is 192.168.20.1,

11

00:01:19.610  -->  00:01:27.944
Next this is vlan 10, the ip
address let’s say 192.168.10.5,

12

00:01:28.971  -->  00:01:41.876
okay here 10.5 is also already used. Let’s try
192.168.10.10 and the gateway is 192.168.10.1

13

00:01:42.696  -->  00:01:47.682
Next let’s try in room 2, this is vlan 20,

14

00:01:48.902  -->  00:01:58.025
the ip address is 192.168.20.20
and the gateway is 192.168.20.1

15

00:01:58.833  -->  00:02:11.247
Next this is also vlan 20, the ip address let’s
say 192.168.20.21, and the gateway Is 192.168.20.1.

16

00:02:11.497  -->  00:02:14.689
Next here let’s configure for vlan 1,

17

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:23.910
the ip address let’s say 192.168.1.10
and the gateway is 192.168.1.1.

18

00:02:26.788  -->  00:02:38.779
Next for vlan 30. The ip address let’s say
192.168.30.10, and the gateway is 192.168.30.1.

19

00:02:39.519  -->  00:02:42.573
Last, let’s configure for vlan 10,

20

00:02:43.120  -->  00:02:52.836
the ip address let’s say 192.168.10.30
and the gateway is 192.168.10.1

21

00:02:53.679  -->  00:03:05.242
here also vlan 10, the ip address let’s say
192.168.10.31, and the gateway is 192.168.10.1

22

00:03:05.942  -->  00:03:11.304
Okay now we have done configuring
the ip address in room 3 and room 2,

23

00:03:12.114  -->  00:03:15.293
for room 1 you can try it by your self.

24

00:03:16.045  -->  00:03:23.476
Next let’s test the connection between
vlan. Let’s test from vlan 10 to vlan 20.

25

00:03:24.936  -->  00:03:31.576
Okay this is fail, let’s try again, still failed.

26

00:03:32.388  -->  00:03:38.858
If the result is failed like this, we can
try to ping from the pc to the gateway first,

27

00:03:39.748  -->  00:03:45.943
let’s say from vlan 10 let’s
try ping to 192.168.10.1

28

00:03:46.800  -->  00:03:53.316
okay here ping to the gateway is success.
Let’s try from vlan 20 to the gateway,

29

00:03:54.000  -->  00:04:00.756
ping 192.168.20.1, okay here this is also success.

30

00:04:01.474  -->  00:04:11.796
Let’s also try from vlan 30 to the gateway,
ping 192.168.30.1, okay this is also success.

31

00:04:12.400  -->  00:04:21.679
But communication between pc in the different vlan
is still failed. Why? This is because by default,

32

00:04:21.679  -->  00:04:29.224
multi layer switch is only work on layer
2. The layer 3 function is not enabled yet.

33

00:04:29.897  -->  00:04:34.595
To check it, we can see the routing
table in the multi layer switch.

34

00:04:35.565  -->  00:04:40.185
Here let’s enable, and then show ip route.

35

00:04:41.794  -->  00:04:45.853
Here we can see icmp redirect cache is empty.

36

00:04:46.674  -->  00:04:51.521
This is means that the layer
3 function is not enabled yet.

37

00:04:52.639  -->  00:04:56.811
Okay I think enough for this
video, in the next video,

38

00:04:56.811  -->  00:05:00.594
we are going to learn how to
enable the layer 3 function

39

00:05:00.594  -->  00:05:02.303
in the multi layer switch.

40

00:05:03.108  -->  00:05:06.440
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
