00:00:00.281  -->  00:00:04.885
In the previous video, we already create topology  with 2 router.

2

00:00:05.302  -->  00:00:10.402
And we also already configure the ip address for all router and pc.

3

00:00:11.134  -->  00:00:18.475
Next in this video, we are going to learn about the
differences between static and dynamic routing.

4

00:00:19.489  -->  00:00:24.200
When we configure static routing,
we add the routing manually,

5

00:00:26.197  -->  00:00:33.081
so ip route, the destination,
and then the next hop or gateway.

6

00:00:34.014  -->  00:00:41.104
So we tell the router, the destination
and the next hop. Let’s see the command,

7

00:00:41.649  -->  00:00:45.219
Here ip route and then the destination,

8

00:00:46.004  -->  00:00:55.928
192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0, and
the next hop is 10.10.10.2,

9

00:00:56.449  -->  00:01:08.567
so we tell router 1, if router 1 want to go to
192.168.2.0/24, router 1 should go to 10.10.10.2.

10

00:01:09.341  -->  00:01:12.494
But if we configure dynamic routing,

11

00:01:12.494  -->  00:01:18.441
we don’t need to do that, but we need
to advertise all of connected network.

12

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:29.932
Let’s say here in router 1, router 1 have 2
connected network, which is 10.10.10.0/24

13

00:01:30.080  -->  00:01:37.710
and 192.168.1.0/24. So router 1
will advertise this 2 network,

14

00:01:38.447  -->  00:01:43.878
When router 1 advertise this 2 network,
router 1 will tell router 2,

15

00:01:44.136  -->  00:01:55.540
"hey router 2, I have 2 network behind me, which
is 10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24.

16

00:01:56.324  -->  00:02:01.764
So if you want to go to this 2
network, you can go through me".

17

00:02:02.599  -->  00:02:11.705
When router 2 receive advertise from router 1,
router 2 will see it’s routing table. Here router 2

18

00:02:11.705  -->  00:02:24.430
already have information about 10.10.10.0/24,
but router 2 don’t know about 192.168.1.0/24 yet.

19

00:02:25.319  -->  00:02:34.383
So router 2 automatically add network
192.168.1.0/24 to it’s routing table,

20

00:02:34.609  -->  00:02:41.824
and the next hop will be router 1, because
router  receive this information from router 1.

21

00:02:42.482  -->  00:02:47.768
Let’s write it, let’s say this is dynamic,

22

00:02:49.567  -->  00:02:56.777
When router 2 receive 10.10.10.0/24, router 2
already have an information about this,

23

00:02:57.104  -->  00:03:06.261
so we don’t need to write it, and then when router 2
receive an information about 192.168.1.0/24,

24

00:03:06.425  -->  00:03:09.481
router 2 don’t know about this network yet,

25

00:03:09.647  -->  00:03:13.730
so router 2 will add this
network to the routing table.

26

00:03:19.170  -->  00:03:23.755
This is also work when router 2
advertise the connected network.

27

00:03:25.924  -->  00:03:34.562
Router 2 will advertise
10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.

28

00:03:36.300  -->  00:03:42.646
When router 1 receive advertise from router 2,
router 1 will see the routing table,

29

00:03:43.051  -->  00:03:48.895
router 1 already have an information about 10.10.10.0/24,

30

00:03:49.191  -->  00:04:00.427
but router 1 don’t know about 192.168.2.0/24, so
router1 will have new network in the routing table automatically,

31

00:04:00.619  -->  00:04:10.738
which is 192.168.2.0/24 and
the next hop is router 2, which is 10.10.10.2

32

00:04:11.889  -->  00:04:21.261
I am sorry here I do a mistake, in the router 2,
the dynamic routing should be 192.168.1.0/24.

33

00:04:23.832  -->  00:04:30.334
Okay this is the concept of dynamic routing.
So remember that if we use dynamic routing,

34

00:04:30.334  -->  00:04:33.756
each router will advertise
their connected network,

35

00:04:33.911  -->  00:04:40.805
and then the routing will added automatically,
we don’t need to add routing manually anymore.

36

00:04:41.477  -->  00:04:47.159
Okay I think enough for this video, in
the next video we are going to learn

37

00:04:47.159  -->  00:04:49.693
how to configure dynamic routing.

38

00:04:50.255  -->  00:04:53.739
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
