00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.666
In the previous video, we already create topology
to learn about network address translation.

2

00:00:07.162  -->  00:00:14.950
Now in this video, we are going to configure
the ip address on all router server and pc.

3

00:00:15.567  -->  00:00:20.063
Let’s just start, we will start with google
router.

4

00:00:20.560  -->  00:00:34.602
CLI, no, enable, configure terminal, we will
configure fa0/0 first, so interface fa0/0,

5

00:00:34.828  -->  00:00:45.145
no shutdown, and then the ip address is 172.16.10.1
255.255.255.0,

6

00:00:46.078  -->  00:01:00.000
Next for fa0/1, interface fa0/1, no shutdown,
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0,

7

00:01:00.748  -->  00:01:07.919
okay we have done on router 1, next let’s configure
the ip address on server google.

8

00:01:09.243  -->  00:01:21.793
Desktop, ip configuration, the ip address
is 172.16.10.2, and the gateway is 172.16.10.1.

9

00:01:22.304  -->  00:01:29.675
the prefix is /24, so the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0.

10

00:01:30.668  -->  00:01:37.650
Okay we have done on google, next let’s
configure the Ip address of ISP router,

11

00:01:42.239  -->  00:01:54.433
no, enable, configure terminal, let’s start
with fa0/0, so interface fa0/0, no shutdown,

12

00:01:54.704  -->  00:02:09.000
ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0, Next
for fa0/1, interface fa0/1, no shutdown,

13

00:02:09.150  -->  00:02:15.531
ip address 10.20.20.1 255.255.255.0.

14

00:02:16.494  -->  00:02:19.099
Okay we have done on isp.

15

00:02:19.580  -->  00:02:33.329
Next, let’s configure the customer, CLI, no,
enable, configure terminal,

16

00:02:33.585  -->  00:02:48.120
let’s start with fa0/0, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,
ip address 10.20.20.2 255.255.255.0

17

00:02:48.483  -->  00:03:01.910
Next let’s configure the ip address for
vlan 10 and vlan 20, go to interface fa0/1,

18

00:03:02.196  -->  00:03:03.382
no shutdown.

19

00:03:03.954  -->  00:03:12.691
And then let’s configure for vlan 10, interface
fa0/1.10, encapsulation dot1q 10,

20

00:03:12.691  -->  00:03:19.220
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

21

00:03:21.357  -->  00:03:31.293
Next let’s configure for vlan 20, interface
fa0/1.20, encapsulation dot1q 20,

22

00:03:31.534  -->  00:03:37.772
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0

23

00:03:39.893  -->  00:03:46.937
Okay we have done configuring the ip address,
next let’s configure dhcp server for vlan

24

00:03:46.937  -->  00:03:48.883
10 and vlan 20.

25

00:03:49.199  -->  00:04:02.068
Let’s start with vlan 10, ip dhcp pool vlan
10, network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0,

26

00:04:03.332  -->  00:04:07.060
default-router 192.168.10.1.

27

00:04:10.791  -->  00:04:23.475
Next let’s configure for vlan 20, ip dhcp
pool vlan 20, network 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0,

28

00:04:24.664  -->  00:04:28.536
default-router 192.168.20.1

29

00:04:29.348  -->  00:04:31.239
Okay we have done here.

30

00:04:31.540  -->  00:04:41.348
Last, let’s configure vlan on the switch,
enable, configure terminal,

31

00:04:41.348  -->  00:04:46.415
let’s create the vlan, vlan 10, vlan 20.

32

00:04:47.107  -->  00:04:54.581
Next let’s configure the interface that
connected to client, this is fa0/2,

33

00:04:54.581  -->  00:05:03.241
and this fa0/3, so interface fa0/2 until 3 will be
in vlan 10, interface range fa0/2-3,

34

00:05:04.625  -->  00:05:10.922
switchport mode access, switchport access vlan 10.

35

00:05:12.728  -->  00:05:25.499
Next for vlan 20, this is fa0/4 and this is
fa0/5, interface range fa0/4-5,

36

00:05:25.499  -->  00:05:30.353
switchport mode access, switchport access vlan 20.

37

00:05:31.541  -->  00:05:39.666
Last, let’s configure trunk on interface
that connected to the router, interface fa0/1,

38

00:05:39.666  -->  00:05:41.838
switchport mode trunk.

39

00:05:42.530  -->  00:05:46.910
Okay now we have done configuring on all router
and switch.

40

00:05:47.331  -->  00:05:51.996
Next, let’s configure dhcp client on all
pc.

41

00:06:00.873  -->  00:06:05.801
Okay, all pc is get an ip address automatically
from the router.

42

00:06:06.087  -->  00:06:11.873
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure routing.

43

00:06:12.294  -->  00:06:15.741
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
