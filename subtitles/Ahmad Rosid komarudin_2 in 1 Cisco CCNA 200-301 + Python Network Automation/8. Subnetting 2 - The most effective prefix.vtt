00:00:00.427  -->  00:00:07.340
In the previous video we already learn subnetting
first case, which is we have 100 PC.

2

00:00:07.871  -->  00:00:14.038
Now in this video, we are going to learn about
subnetting again, but with different case.

3

00:00:14.542  -->  00:00:17.329
In this case we will have 12 PC.

4

00:00:18.373  -->  00:00:21.567
We will doing subnetting calculation for 12
PC.

5

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:29.510
We are going to calculate which prefix is
the best, Total IP, Subnetmask, Network IP,

6

00:00:29.510  -->  00:00:32.018
Broadcast IP, and Range IP.

7

00:00:32.726  -->  00:00:37.907
Actually this is same with previous video,
just with different case.

8

00:00:38.680  -->  00:00:40.400
Okay let’s just start.

9

00:00:40.828  -->  00:00:44.241
We will start by finding the best prefix we
can use.

10

00:00:44.912  -->  00:00:46.824
Here we have 12 PC.

11

00:00:47.299  -->  00:00:54.493
Let’s try to remember the powers again,
2 to the power of 1 is 2, 2 to the power of

12

00:00:54.493  -->  00:00:59.002
2 is 4, and 2 to the power of 3 is 8

13

00:01:00.064  -->  00:01:04.040
And the next 2 to the power of 4 is 16.

14

00:01:04.767  -->  00:01:13.638
We can stop here, because we just have 12
PC, and here we can see that we already have 16

15

00:01:14.175  -->  00:01:16.830
This is the best choice for 12PC.

16

00:01:17.296  -->  00:01:22.382
Because the next power, 2 to the power of
5 is 32.

17

00:01:22.670  -->  00:01:23.895
This is to much.

18

00:01:24.314  -->  00:01:27.042
And 2 to the power of 3 is not enough.

19

00:01:27.610  -->  00:01:32.849
So the best choice is 2 to the power of 4,
which is 16.

20

00:01:33.408  -->  00:01:35.438
Now let’s calculate the prefix.

21

00:01:36.099  -->  00:01:42.271
To find the prefix, we can just minus 32 by
4, and we get 28.

22

00:01:42.756  -->  00:01:47.720
So the best prefix that we can use for 12
PC is /28.

23

00:01:48.465  -->  00:01:52.102
Now we need to determine which range IP we
will use.

24

00:01:52.800  -->  00:02:05.158
Remember that we must use Private IP, so we
can choose between 10.0.0 or 172.16 or 192.168.

25

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:10.197
In this case, we are going to use 172.16

26

00:02:11.073  -->  00:02:20.266
Let’s say we will use 172.16.10.x, remember
that the first third numbers will never change.

27

00:02:20.630  -->  00:02:23.183
But the last number will be change.

28

00:02:24.403  -->  00:02:34.319
If we see here, we have 172.16.10.x, this is
included in the Private IP Address seconds range

29

00:02:34.971  -->  00:02:41.856
and the prefix that we will use is
/28, which is the result of our calculation before

30

00:02:43.151  -->  00:02:45.653
Okay I think enough for this video.

31

00:02:46.016  -->  00:02:51.701
So we already calculate the best prefix that
we can use and also we already determine

32

00:02:51.701  -->  00:02:53.537
which IP we will use.

33

00:02:54.198  -->  00:03:00.879
In the next video, we are gong to calculate
the Total IP, Subnetmask, Network IP, Broadcast IP

34

00:03:00.879  -->  00:03:02.523
and Range IP.

35

00:03:03.194  -->  00:03:10.094
But before you watch the next video, I suggest
you to try calculate all of this by your self

36

00:03:10.712  -->  00:03:14.075
After that, you can watch the solution in
the next video.

37

00:03:14.429  -->  00:03:18.135
You can evaluate your calculation
is correct or no.

38

00:03:18.862  -->  00:03:22.316
Okay, thankyou for watching and see you in
the next video!
