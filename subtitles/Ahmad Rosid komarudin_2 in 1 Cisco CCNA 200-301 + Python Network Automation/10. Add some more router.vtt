00:00:00.453  -->  00:00:05.243
In this video, we are going to add
some more router to our topology.

2

00:00:05.707  -->  00:00:13.762
Let’s add 3 more router, so we will have 5
router in the topology. Let’s just start.

3

00:00:14.751  -->  00:00:17.584
We will use 2691 series.

4

00:00:18.384  -->  00:00:27.499
We can add some router at once by using shift,
so here shift and then drag and drop the router.

5

00:00:30.086  -->  00:00:37.001
Here we can type how many router that we
want to import. Let’s import 3 router here.

6

00:00:39.323  -->  00:00:50.786
Here we can see that we import 3 router at once.
this is router 1, router 2, router 3, router 4,

7

00:00:53.058  -->  00:00:55.136
and this is router5.

8

00:01:02.053  -->  00:01:15.000
Let’s connecting router 3 to the switch,
router 4 to the switch and router 5 to the switch.

9

00:01:16.714  -->  00:01:25.343
Next let’s configure the ip address for router 3
4 and 5. And we also need to configure ssh

10

00:01:25.343  -->  00:01:28.984
so we can remote the router from ubuntu server.

11

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:33.299
Let’s just start, start the router,

12

00:01:37.504  -->  00:01:48.203
Here router 3, the ip address will be
10.10.10.3/24, router4 will be 10.10.10.4/24,

13

00:01:50.213  -->  00:01:55.104
and router5 will be 10.10.10.5/24.

14

00:01:56.418  -->  00:02:14.466
Let’s configure on router 3 first,
configure terminal, the interface is fa0/0,

15

00:02:17.366  -->  00:02:30.944
so here interface fa0/0, no shutdown, and
the ip address is 10.10.10.3 255.255.255.0

16

00:02:32.269  -->  00:02:37.575
Let’s ping to router 1, ping 10.10.10.1,

17

00:02:40.531  -->  00:02:54.177
okay this is success, ping to ubuntu server do
ping 10.10.10.254. okay this is also success.

18

00:02:55.001  -->  00:03:04.472
Next let’s configure ssh. Configure domain
name first, ip domain-name mydomain.local,

19

00:03:07.696  -->  00:03:18.897
Next, let’s create the key, crypto
key generate rsa, the modulus is 1024.

20

00:03:21.126  -->  00:03:30.209
Next let’s create username and password,
username cisco privilege 15 secret cisco.

21

00:03:31.778  -->  00:03:40.330
Last let’s configure the vty,
line vty 0 15, login local.

22

00:03:41.401  -->  00:03:45.208
Okay we have done configuring ssh on router 3.

23

00:03:45.688  -->  00:03:49.537
Let’s try to remote the
router3 from ubuntu server.

24

00:03:50.304  -->  00:03:58.353
Here let’s exit first. Now we are in the
mac os, let’s remote to ubuntu server,

25

00:03:59.184  -->  00:04:08.316
ssh ubuntu and then the ip address of
ubuntu server, which is 192.168.56.2.

26

00:04:14.624  -->  00:04:21.937
Okay we are success remote the ubuntu
server, next, let’s try to ping to router 3.

27

00:04:22.568  -->  00:04:37.543
Ping 10.10.10.3, okay this is success, now let’s
try to remote router 3, ssh cisco@10.10.10.3

28

00:04:41.710  -->  00:04:46.088
Okay we are success remote
router 3 from ubuntu server.

29

00:04:46.691  -->  00:04:50.632
Last, don’t forget to save
the cisco configuration.

30

00:04:51.241  -->  00:04:59.674
So when we close the gns3, the cisco
configuration will not gone, do write.

31

00:05:03.000  -->  00:05:05.933
Okay I think enough for this video,

32

00:05:06.224  -->  00:05:12.736
for router 4 and router 5 you can configure
the ip address and ssh by your self.

33

00:05:13.424  -->  00:05:16.960
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video.
