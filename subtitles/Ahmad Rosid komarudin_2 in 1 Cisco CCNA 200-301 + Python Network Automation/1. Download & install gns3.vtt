00:00:00.499  -->  00:00:04.874
In this section, we are going to learn about
network automation.

2

00:00:05.236  -->  00:00:13.379
We will start with preparing the lab. First we will learn how to download and install gns3.

3

00:00:13.973  -->  00:00:23.416
Gns3 is network simulation tools, just like cisco packet tracer. But we have many more features in gns3.

4

00:00:24.000  -->  00:00:31.528
In gns3, we are able to import linux virtual
machine to doing a network automation.

5

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:42.837
Okay let’s just start learning how to download and
install gns3. Open a browser and go to gns3.com.

6

00:00:43.638  -->  00:00:48.540
Here we can just click free
download to download the gns3.

7

00:00:51.994  -->  00:00:59.175
Here you can choose the operating system
that you use. In this case I use Mac OS.

8

00:01:01.760  -->  00:01:06.986
To download gns3, we need to login or create
a free account first.

9

00:01:07.270  -->  00:01:16.124
Don’t worry, this is totally free, you just need to create a free
account and then you are able to download gns3.

10

00:01:16.877  -->  00:01:23.402
I already download the gns3, so I
will skip the step to download gns3.

11

00:01:24.273  -->  00:01:31.337
To install the gns3, here we can see an
installation guide for each operating system.

12

00:01:31.793  -->  00:01:36.873
Let’s check on windows first.
This is should be very easy,

13

00:01:37.250  -->  00:01:40.604
we just need to next next next until finish.

14

00:01:41.396  -->  00:01:48.646
Here the guide is very complete, we can see
the version of windows that supported by gns3,

15

00:01:48.952  -->  00:01:55.218
minimum requirements, recommended
requirements, and others.

16

00:01:58.139  -->  00:02:01.993
And then here we also have optimal requirements.

17

00:02:04.676  -->  00:02:13.869
The miimum requirement is 4 gig ram,
recommended requirement is 16 gig ram,

18

00:02:16.268  -->  00:02:25.205
and for optimal requirement is 32 gig ram. So
at least to learn about network automation,

19

00:02:25.205  -->  00:02:28.364
I think we need to have 8 gig ram.

20

00:02:29.409  -->  00:02:33.951
Okay, let’s see how we can
install gns3 on windows,

21

00:02:34.247  -->  00:02:38.180
here we need to create a free
account to download gns3,

22

00:02:43.757  -->  00:02:50.697
after that we can double click the installer
and then just next next next until finish.

23

00:02:51.597  -->  00:02:56.114
Okay, so that is how we can
install gns3 in windows.

24

00:02:58.394  -->  00:03:02.367
Let’s check how we can install gns3 on linux.

25

00:03:02.898  -->  00:03:10.710
In linux, we can install gns3 from terminal.
So we can just copy and paste this command.

26

00:03:11.089  -->  00:03:16.710
You can search the distro that you use
to see the command to install gns3.

27

00:03:17.796  -->  00:03:22.768
Last, let’s see howe we
can install gns3 on mac os.

28

00:03:26.436  -->  00:03:34.191
This is the installer that I have
downloaded before, just double click this,

29

00:03:44.784  -->  00:03:49.846
here I just need to drag and drop
the installer to application.

30

00:03:50.382  -->  00:03:56.700
Just it, this is how we can install
gns3 on mac os, very easy right?

31

00:03:58.397  -->  00:04:00.914
Let’s open the gns3,

32

00:04:07.649  -->  00:04:16.284
here we get a message that gns3 is downloaded
from internet, let’s just click open,

33

00:04:18.916  -->  00:04:33.000
yes, we need to type our password, and
here we are. This is the display of gns3.

34

00:04:34.142  -->  00:04:37.980
We can chose run appliances on my local computer,

35

00:04:39.393  -->  00:04:52.470
and here we can check don’t show this message
again. Next, next, just next here, and finish.

36

00:04:53.194  -->  00:04:57.744
Okay now we have done installing gns3 on
our laptop.

37

00:04:58.196  -->  00:05:00.630
I think enough for this video,

38

00:05:00.792  -->  00:05:06.124
in the next video, we are going to learn
how to import cisco router to gns3.

39

00:05:07.272  -->  00:05:10.958
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video.
