00:00:00.713  -->  00:00:05.712
In the previous video, we already learn about
the concept of BGP.

2

00:00:06.210  -->  00:00:11.765
The point is, BGP is used to connecting between
Autonomous System.

3

00:00:12.522  -->  00:00:17.867
Next in this video, we are going to learn
how to configure BGP.

4

00:00:18.489  -->  00:00:19.855
Let’s just start.

5

00:00:20.570  -->  00:00:31.599
Let’s import 2 router, let’s change the
name, this is router 2, and this is router 1.

6

00:00:32.367  -->  00:00:43.835
Let’s also import 2 pc, let’s change the
name, this is pc 2, and this is pc 1.

7

00:00:44.809  -->  00:00:53.577
Let’s connecting pc 1 to router 1, pc 2 to
router 2 and router 1 to router 2.

8

00:00:54.686  -->  00:01:08.870
For the ip addressing, here router 1, let’s
say 10.10.10.1/30, here 192.168.1.1/24,

9

00:01:09.710  -->  00:01:33.241
pc 1 192.168.1.2/24, and then here router 2, 10.10.10.2/30,
here 192.168.2.1/24, and pc 2 192.168.2.2/24.

10

00:01:33.884  -->  00:01:39.232
I am sorry, here the router should be 192.168.2.1.

11

00:01:40.331  -->  00:01:53.241
Now let’s start the ip address configuration,
open router 1, CLI, no, enable, configure terminal,

12

00:01:53.749  -->  00:02:05.343
let’s configure fa0/1 first, so interface
fa0/1, no shutdown, ip address 10.10.10.1

13

00:02:05.499  -->  00:02:09.000
255.255.255.252.

14

00:02:10.324  -->  00:02:26.560
And then for fa0/0, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0.

15

00:02:29.152  -->  00:02:37.870
Okay we have done on router 1, next let’s
configure router 2, CLI, no, enable,

16

00:02:37.870  -->  00:02:51.489
configure terminal, let’s start with fa0/1, interface
fa0/1, no shutdown, the ip address is 10.10.10.2

17

00:02:51.489  -->  00:02:55.002
255.255.255.252,

18

00:02:56.070  -->  00:03:14.916
Next for fa0/0, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0,

19

00:03:16.264  -->  00:03:21.345
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
on router 1 and router 2.

20

00:03:21.946  -->  00:03:25.542
Next let’s configure the ip address of pc.

21

00:03:26.257  -->  00:03:37.922
Let’s start with pc 1, the ip address is
192.168.1.2 and the gateway is 192.168.1.1.

22

00:03:38.876  -->  00:03:47.800
Last, let’s configure the ip address of
pc 2, the ip address is 192.168.2.2

23

00:03:48.000  -->  00:03:51.747
and the gateway is 192.168.2.1.

24

00:03:53.033  -->  00:03:58.552
Okay now we have done configure ip address
on all router and pc,

25

00:03:59.122  -->  00:04:05.595
I think enough for this video, in the next video, we are going to
configure bgp.

26

00:04:06.186  -->  00:04:09.611
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
