00:00:00.714  -->  00:00:07.032
In the previous video, we already learn how
to configure an ip address in cisco router.

2

00:00:08.000  -->  00:00:15.520
Next in this video, we are going to learn
about one command that I think this is so useful.

3

00:00:16.148  -->  00:00:18.588
The command is end.

4

00:00:19.314  -->  00:00:21.494
What is the function of this command?

5

00:00:22.031  -->  00:00:23.534
Let’s just try it!

6

00:00:24.486  -->  00:00:32.556
Here I try to enter global configuration mode,
and then go to interface fa0/1.

7

00:00:33.388  -->  00:00:40.328
Here we can see that if we are in the global
configuration mode, the prompt is config,

8

00:00:41.183  -->  00:00:49.954
and then after enter the interface fa0/1,
the prompt is config-if like this.

9

00:00:51.511  -->  00:00:56.949
In this case, if we want to go to privilege
mode, we can type exit.

10

00:00:57.796  -->  00:01:04.359
This exit is used to exit from interface configuration
to global configuration mode.

11

00:01:05.357  -->  00:01:09.546
And then we need to exit again to go to privilege
mode.

12

00:01:10.400  -->  00:01:17.741
So from the interface configuration to privilege
mode, we will need to type exit two times.

13

00:01:18.974  -->  00:01:24.776
Rather than typing exit two times like that,
we can just using end command.

14

00:01:25.373  -->  00:01:26.490
Let’s try it.

15

00:01:27.307  -->  00:01:32.478
Go to global configuration again, enter the
interface configuration.

16

00:01:33.740  -->  00:01:36.829
Okay here let’s try to use end command.

17

00:01:37.940  -->  00:01:42.423
Here we can see that we are directly go to
privilege mode.

18

00:01:43.862  -->  00:01:48.846
Okay, so the end command is used to go to
privilege mode directly.

19

00:01:49.322  -->  00:01:54.883
For example, here from global configuration
mode, if I type end,

20

00:01:54.883  -->  00:01:58.355
I also directly go to privilege mode.

21

00:01:59.459  -->  00:02:06.894
So once again, the function of end command
is to go to privilege mode directly.

22

00:02:08.119  -->  00:02:10.301
Okay I think enough for this video

23

00:02:10.483  -->  00:02:13.583
Thankyou for watching and see you n the next video!
