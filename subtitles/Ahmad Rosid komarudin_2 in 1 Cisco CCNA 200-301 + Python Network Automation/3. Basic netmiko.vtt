00:00:00.475  -->  00:00:05.382
In the previous video, we already install
netmiko on ubuntu server.

2

00:00:05.936  -->  00:00:12.241
Next in this video, we are going to learn
how to do network automation using netmiko.

3

00:00:12.944  -->  00:00:15.186
Let’s see on the documentation.

4

00:00:15.904  -->  00:00:21.160
First, we need to import connect handler function
from netmiko.

5

00:00:21.833  -->  00:00:26.781
The script is From netmiko import connect
handler.

6

00:00:27.230  -->  00:00:33.180
And then here we need to create a dictionary
to shave the router information.

7

00:00:33.659  -->  00:00:42.719
You can use anything for the variable name,
in this example, the variable name is cisco 881.

8

00:00:43.581  -->  00:00:51.366
Here the device type is cisco ios, this is
means that we are going to do network automation

9

00:00:51.366  -->  00:00:53.390
on cisco devices.

10

00:00:54.243  -->  00:01:01.868
If we want to do network automation on other
vendors, we can click on this ssh_dispatcher

11

00:01:02.033  -->  00:01:04.275
to see the other device type.

12

00:01:05.442  -->  00:01:16.226
In the ssh dispatcher, we can see in the CLASS_MAPPER
section, let’s just copy this, go to ssh

13

00:01:16.226  -->  00:01:24.278
dispatcher and then ctrl f to find, paste
it here.

14

00:01:25.000  -->  00:01:29.286
Okay here we can see many device type that
we can use.

15

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:39.173
For example, if we want to do network automation
on aruba devices, so the device type is aruba_os.

16

00:01:41.986  -->  00:01:46.690
This is that we are use, which is cisco_ios.

17

00:01:47.468  -->  00:01:54.171
Or if you want to do network automation on
cisco nexus series, so the device type will

18

00:01:54.171  -->  00:01:57.208
be cisco_nxos.

19

00:01:58.180  -->  00:02:05.760
If You want to remote cisco ASA Firewall,
So the device type will be cisco_asa

20

00:02:09.426  -->  00:02:24.125
Here we also have juniper, mikrotik, linux,
and others, we have so many choices here.

21

00:02:25.068  -->  00:02:31.760
Okay let’s back to the documentation, here
we need to define host, this is the ip address

22

00:02:31.760  -->  00:02:39.282
of the router, username, this is the username
to remote the router using ssh,

23

00:02:39.506  -->  00:02:41.405
and this is the password.

24

00:02:42.093  -->  00:02:50.839
We also can define the port of ssh, but this
is optional, we only need to define this parameter

25

00:02:50.839  -->  00:02:55.184
if we change the default ssh port on the cisco
router.

26

00:02:56.411  -->  00:03:04.272
Here we also can define enable secret, for
now, the user is in privilege 15,

27

00:03:05.000  -->  00:03:12.759
so when we login using that user, we are in the privilege
mode directly, so we don’t need to define

28

00:03:12.759  -->  00:03:15.212
enable secret parameter here.

29

00:03:16.245  -->  00:03:23.439
After defining the dictionary about the router,
next, we can connect to the router,

30

00:03:24.052  -->  00:03:30.608
this is very simple, we just need to call ConnectHandler
function from netmiko.

31

00:03:31.311  -->  00:03:38.526
And then the argument is the dictionary that
we have created, we need to use stars (*) two

32

00:03:38.526  -->  00:03:42.898
time like this if the argument is a dictionary.

33

00:03:43.915  -->  00:03:46.976
After that, we can send the cisco command.

34

00:03:47.499  -->  00:03:56.393
Let’s say we want to check the cisco interface,
so we can send command show ip interface brief.

35

00:03:57.245  -->  00:03:59.845
And then we can print the output.

36

00:04:00.686  -->  00:04:03.875
Okay, this is more simple than paramiko right?

37

00:04:04.429  -->  00:04:07.999
Let’s try to write the netmiko script on
sublime.

38

00:04:09.001  -->  00:04:14.847
Let’s create new folder, let’s say the
name is lab-netmiko.

39

00:04:17.001  -->  00:04:27.702
And then here inside lab_netmiko, let’s
create new file, let’s say the name is netmiko_basic.py.

40

00:04:36.051  -->  00:04:43.591
Now let’s try to write the netmiko script,
first, let’s import connect handler function

41

00:04:43.591  -->  00:04:45.260
from netmiko.

42

00:04:45.829  -->  00:04:50.727
The script is From netmiko import connect
handler.

43

00:04:55.186  -->  00:05:00.801
Now let’s create a dictionary to save an
information about the router.

44

00:05:01.594  -->  00:05:08.748
We will try to automate router 1 first, so
let’s say the variable name is router 1,

45

00:05:11.666  -->  00:05:14.627
the device type is cisco ios,

46

00:05:18.203  -->  00:05:28.658
the host is the ip address of router 1, which
is 10.10.10.1, the username is cisco,

47

00:05:30.244  -->  00:05:33.528
and the password is also cisco.

48

00:05:34.186  -->  00:05:40.936
We don’t need to define port and secret
for now, because the ssh port on router 1 is

49

00:05:40.936  -->  00:05:48.216
default, which is 22, and our user is already
in the privilege 15.

50

00:05:52.391  -->  00:06:03.159
Now let’s connect to the router, net_connect,
this is just a variable, so you can use anything here,

51

00:06:03.563  -->  00:06:12.925
let’s say we use conn, and then connect
handler, and the dictionary name, which is r1.

52

00:06:15.716  -->  00:06:22.675
After connect to the router, we can send the
cisco command, let’s try to see the interface,

53

00:06:23.094  -->  00:06:29.876
output, conn, this is the variable that we
already defined before.

54

00:06:31.521  -->  00:06:37.452
And then send_command show ip interface brief,

55

00:06:39.352  -->  00:06:42.029
last, let’s print the output.

56

00:06:45.000  -->  00:06:46.820
Okay we have done here.

57

00:06:47.374  -->  00:07:01.475
Save, let’s go to ubuntu server, ls, here
we can see that now we have lab_netmiko,

58

00:07:01.864  -->  00:07:15.923
let’s cd to lab_netmiko, ls, here we can see that
we have netmiko_basic.py. let’s execute this.

59

00:07:18.541  -->  00:07:23.395
Here we can see that we are success to print
the interface of router1,

60

00:07:24.039  -->  00:07:29.631
But there is no description about the router,
let’s modify the script.

61

00:07:30.364  -->  00:07:37.928
Before print the output, let’s print the
router ip address, so here print interface

62

00:07:38.257  -->  00:07:48.775
for router, we can use f string here, and
then here we can define the dictionary name,

63

00:07:49.015  -->  00:07:54.756
which is r1 and let’s access the host key.

64

00:07:57.238  -->  00:08:04.537
Oh sorry, here we already use doble quote,
so here we must use single quote.

65

00:08:08.637  -->  00:08:09.399
Save,

66

00:08:10.970  -->  00:08:15.731
Let’s back to the ubuntu server, execute
the script again.

67

00:08:17.557  -->  00:08:27.283
Okay here we have description, interface for
router 10.10.10.1, and this is the interfaces.

68

00:08:28.091  -->  00:08:31.034
Okay I think enough for this video

69

00:08:31.109  -->  00:08:34.785
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
