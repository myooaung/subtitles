00:00:00.593  -->  00:00:05.117
In this video, we are going to
learn about inter vlan routing,

2

00:00:05.237  -->  00:00:10.000
which is how we can connecting
between pc in the different VLAN.

3

00:00:10.609  -->  00:00:16.461
So all pc in all vlan should be
able to communicate each others.

4

00:00:17.877  -->  00:00:25.000
To connecting between vlan like this, we will
need a router. So here let’s import a router,

5

00:00:25.208  -->  00:00:31.589
go to network devices, and then
here let’s import router 2811.

6

00:00:32.475  -->  00:00:39.138
Here we only need 1 router and we only need
to connecting this router to 1 switch.

7

00:00:39.595  -->  00:00:46.960
We are free to connecting this router to any switch, we
can connecting the router to switch 1, switch 2,

8

00:00:46.960  -->  00:00:52.506
or switch3. In this case I want to
connecting the router to switch 1.

9

00:00:54.113  -->  00:00:59.065
Now let’s talk about the
address. In the previous video,

10

00:00:59.065  -->  00:01:05.803
I have said that different vlan must be using
different network or different block subnet.

11

00:01:06.340  -->  00:01:15.218
But here we still configure all vlan with
same block subnet, which is 192.168.1.x.

12

00:01:15.717  -->  00:01:20.237
From now, we are going to use
different network for each vlan.

13

00:01:20.723  -->  00:01:28.591
For example, for vlan 10, we are
going to use 192.168.10.0/24,

14

00:01:29.603  -->  00:01:39.120
for vlan 20 we are going to use
192.168.20.0/24, and for vlan 30 we are

15

00:01:39.120  -->  00:01:50.612
going to use 192.168.30.0/24. Okay, this is the
ip address that we are going to use for each vlan

16

00:01:51.165  -->  00:01:59.212
Next, you need to remember that if pc want
to communicate with other pc in the different network,

17

00:01:59.330  -->  00:02:08.178
the pc will need a gateway. Here
let’s go to the pc, dekstop, ip configuration,

18

00:02:08.529  -->  00:02:15.637
and here we can see default gateway.
Once again, remember that if pc want

19

00:02:15.637  -->  00:02:23.391
to communicate with others pc in the different
network, so the pc will need a default gateway.

20

00:02:23.969  -->  00:02:29.280
But if pc want to communicate
with other pc in the same network,

21

00:02:29.280  -->  00:02:37.680
the pc will not need default gateway.
For example here if pc in the vlan 10

22

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:45.000
want to communicate with others pc in the
vlan 10, so the pc not need default gateway.

23

00:02:45.666  -->  00:02:55.555
But if pc in the vlan 10 want to communicate with
pc in the vlan 20, so the pc will need a gateway.

24

00:02:56.096  -->  00:03:01.231
And who Is the gateway? The
gateway will be the router.

25

00:03:02.079  -->  00:03:09.315
So here we need to configure an ip address
in the router to become gateway for all pc.

26

00:03:10.000  -->  00:03:14.052
Okay let’s just start. Open the router,

27

00:03:14.866  -->  00:03:23.972
go to CLI , here choose no, enable, and
then go to global configuration mode.

28

00:03:24.753  -->  00:03:33.385
Next, here we can see that the light of
interface fa0/0 is still red, this is means

29

00:03:33.385  -->  00:03:43.492
that the interface is still disable, let’s enable
this. Interface fa0/0, and then no shutdown.

30

00:03:44.866  -->  00:03:49.344
Okay here we can see that now
the light is already green.

31

00:03:50.000  -->  00:03:56.212
Next let’s configure the ip address in
the router to become gateway for all pc.

32

00:03:56.706  -->  00:04:06.573
Let’s configure for vlan 1 first. For vlan
1, we will configure the ip address in fa0/0.

33

00:04:06.976  -->  00:04:22.440
Here we already in fa0/0, so ip
address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0.

34

00:04:23.885  -->  00:04:30.115
Okay now we have done configuring the
ip address in the router for vlan 1.

35

00:04:31.359  -->  00:04:40.178
Next let’s configure the ip address for vlan 10.
For vlan 10, we will need to create sub interface.

36

00:04:40.546  -->  00:04:52.286
So here let’s go to interface fa0/0.10. fa0/0
is the interface of router that connected to the switch,

37

00:04:52.488  -->  00:05:00.646
and 10 means that we are going to
create sub interface 10. This will be for vlan 10

38

00:05:01.359  -->  00:05:09.822
Next let’s type encapsulation dot1q 10.
This command is to define that interface

39

00:05:09.822  -->  00:05:15.000
fa0/0.10 is for vlan 10.

40

00:05:16.522  -->  00:05:19.711
Next let’s configure the ip address.

41

00:05:20.184  -->  00:05:31.240
The ip address of vlan 10 is 192.168.10.1
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0.

42

00:05:32.180  -->  00:05:40.614
Okay we have done for vlan 1 and vlan 10, next
let’s configure for vlan 20. Let’s create sub

43

00:05:40.614  -->  00:05:53.562
interface for vlan 20, so interface fa0/0.20,
encapsulation dot1q 20. Remember that this command

44

00:05:53.562  -->  00:06:05.000
is to define that interface fa0/0.20 is for vlan
20. And finally let’s configure the ip address.

45

00:06:05.499  -->  00:06:16.857
The ip address for vlan 20 is 192.168.20.1
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0

46

00:06:17.889  -->  00:06:31.097
Okay, last let’s configure the ip address for vlan
30. Interface fa0/0.30, encapsulation dot1q 30

47

00:06:32.336  -->  00:06:47.465
and then ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0.
Okay now we have done configuring the ip address

48

00:06:47.465  -->  00:06:56.077
of router for all vlan. To verify, we can
use command do show ip interface brief.

49

00:06:58.353  -->  00:07:06.326
Here we can see that we already have
ip address for vlan 1, 10, 20 and 30.

50

00:07:07.153  -->  00:07:13.121
Next, we need to configure trunk in the
switch interface that connected to the router.

51

00:07:13.700  -->  00:07:22.418
In this case the interface is fa0/8. Why
this interface should configured as trunk?

52

00:07:23.233  -->  00:07:28.309
This is because when different vlan
want to communicate each others,

53

00:07:28.631  -->  00:07:36.353
the communication will go through the router.
For example vlan 10 want to communicate with

54

00:07:36.353  -->  00:07:42.287
vlan 20, so the packet from vlan
10 will be sent to the switch,

55

00:07:42.609  -->  00:07:50.397
from switch to the router, from the router
back to the switch and finally go to vlan 20.

56

00:07:51.216  -->  00:07:55.528
This is why we need to configure fa0/8

57

00:07:55.528  -->  00:08:01.812
as trunk. So this interface will
able to pass packet from any vlan.

58

00:08:02.593  -->  00:08:04.555
Okay let’s configure it.

59

00:08:05.180  -->  00:08:06.132
Enable,

60

00:08:06.400  -->  00:08:14.772
configure terminal. Go to interface
fa0/8, and then switchport mode trunk.

61

00:08:16.142  -->  00:08:25.425
Let’s verify it, do show interface trunk. Okay
here we can see that now we have 2 trunk,

62

00:08:25.425  -->  00:08:32.436
which is the interface that connected to the router,
and the interface that connected to the switch 2.

63

00:08:33.182  -->  00:08:39.288
Okay now we have done configuring inter
vlan routing, now all vlan should be able

64

00:08:39.288  -->  00:08:45.138
to communicate each others. We are going
to doing a testing in the next video.

65

00:08:45.612  -->  00:08:49.441
So thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video
