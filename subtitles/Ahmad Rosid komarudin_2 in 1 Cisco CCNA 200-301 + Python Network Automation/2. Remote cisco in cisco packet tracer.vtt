00:00:00.631  -->  00:00:06.441
In the previous video, we already learn how
to remote real device of cisco.

2

00:00:07.220  -->  00:00:16.335
And as I said, in this course, we are not going to use cisco
real device, but we will use Cisco Packet Tracer

3

00:00:17.122  -->  00:00:24.311
Okay let’s just start. In this video we are going
to learn how to remote cisco router and switch

4

00:00:24.311  -->  00:00:30.832
inside cisco packet tracer. First,
let’s import router to our project,

5

00:00:31.297  -->  00:00:40.030
go to network devices, and then here we can see
a router. Here we have many choices of router.

6

00:00:41.710  -->  00:00:50.071
And if we want to use switch, we can go to switch,
and here we also see so many choices of switch.

7

00:00:50.856  -->  00:00:55.537
We will import a router first,
actually you are free to choose

8

00:00:55.537  -->  00:01:03.121
with type of router you want to use.
But along this course, I will use 2811,

9

00:01:03.377  -->  00:01:10.484
because I think the features of this router
is most powerful compare to others type.

10

00:01:11.645  -->  00:01:15.440
And then let’s import a switch. Along this course,

11

00:01:15.440  -->  00:01:23.083
we will use 2 type of switches,
which is 2960 and 3560.

12

00:01:23.751  -->  00:01:33.243
But the configuration between these 2 switch will
be same, so in this case, I will use 2960 first.

13

00:01:34.218  -->  00:01:40.864
In the real device, if we want to remote a
cisco devices, we will need a console cable.

14

00:01:41.331  -->  00:01:47.747
But in Cisco Packet Tracer, we can just click
on the device that we want to configure,

15

00:01:47.939  -->  00:01:51.065
and then go to tab CLI.

16

00:01:52.647  -->  00:01:55.481
Here we can configuring the cisco.

17

00:01:56.205  -->  00:02:02.309
We can also go to the router
and here we also have a CLI tab.

18

00:02:04.000  -->  00:02:10.588
The different between switch and router,
in the switch, we already in like this,

19

00:02:10.899  -->  00:02:17.777
but in the router, there is a question "would you
like to enter the initial configuration dialog?"

20

00:02:18.190  -->  00:02:26.160
We need to answer this question, yes or no.
If we choose yes, the router will be guide us

21

00:02:26.160  -->  00:02:33.230
to configure initial configuration.
Let’s try it, here let’s choose yes.

22

00:02:33.617  -->  00:02:39.753
And here we get a question again. "Would
you like to enter basic management setup?"

23

00:02:40.136  -->  00:02:48.190
Yes again. Okay here we need to input a
hostname, let’s say the hostname is core router,

24

00:02:48.778  -->  00:02:54.897
and then enter enable secret,
this is a password for our router.

25

00:02:55.555  -->  00:03:02.080
And there will be many question about
initial configuration that we need to answer.

26

00:03:02.554  -->  00:03:08.071
But I think, the initial configuration
dialog is little bit confusing,

27

00:03:08.525  -->  00:03:12.203
so usually I choose no in this question.

28

00:03:12.832  -->  00:03:20.430
If we already answer yes like this, we can just
restart the router. In the Cisco Packet Tracer,

29

00:03:20.430  -->  00:03:27.442
here we can go to physical tab. And
then here we can see on or off button.

30

00:03:28.765  -->  00:03:34.577
Here we can see that the light is green,
this is means that our router is on.

31

00:03:35.018  -->  00:03:42.000
Now let’s click this, and the router
now is off. Now let’s click this again

32

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:48.000
to switch on the router. Okay this
is how we can restart the router

33

00:03:48.474  -->  00:03:57.094
Now let’s go to CLI again. Here we can see that
we have a question again. Now we will choose no.

34

00:03:57.699  -->  00:04:06.112
And here we already in like in the cisco switch.
The different is in the hostname. In the switch,

35

00:04:06.112  -->  00:04:12.869
the default hostname is Switch, and in the
router, the default hostname is Router.

36

00:04:13.635  -->  00:04:20.709
Okay this is the first way to remote cisco
router and switch inside Cisco Packet Tracer.

37

00:04:21.284  -->  00:04:27.970
The second way is we can use a console
cable in Cisco Packet Tracer. Let’s try.

38

00:04:28.471  -->  00:04:35.924
Here we need to import a PC to our
topology. Let’s add 2 PC. The first PC

39

00:04:35.924  -->  00:04:42.372
is used to remote the switch, and the
other PC is used to remote the router.

40

00:04:43.034  -->  00:04:50.482
Next let’s connecting the PC with cisco
devices using console cable. Here we can

41

00:04:50.482  -->  00:04:57.000
choose the blue cable, let’s connect the
cable to the switch, choose console port.

42

00:04:57.000  -->  00:05:05.723
And then to PC 1, here we choose RS
232, this is a serial port in the PC.

43

00:05:06.000  -->  00:05:09.697
Let’s also connecting a
console cable to the router.

44

00:05:12.314  -->  00:05:17.818
Okay now we already connecting the cisco
switch and router to our computer using

45

00:05:17.818  -->  00:05:26.668
console cable. Next we can remote the cisco
switch and router from the PC. Open the PC.

46

00:05:26.960  -->  00:05:35.842
go to desktop, and here we can choose terminal.
This terminal is just like a putty in the real device.

47

00:05:36.270  -->  00:05:44.912
Here we can just click ok. Okay here we
can see that we already inside the cisco switch.

48

00:05:45.501  -->  00:05:52.845
Now we can configuring the cisco switch from
here. This is also work for cisco router.

49

00:05:53.287  -->  00:06:00.765
Here let’s open the PC that connected to the
router using console cable. Go to desktop,

50

00:06:00.925  -->  00:06:06.214
and then open the terminal.
Here we can just click ok.

51

00:06:07.085  -->  00:06:11.661
Okay here we can see that we
already inside the cisco router.

52

00:06:11.937  -->  00:06:15.775
We also can configuring
the cisco router from here.

53

00:06:16.657  -->  00:06:21.591
Okay I think enough for this video. In
the next video, we are going to learn

54

00:06:21.591  -->  00:06:28.482
about basic command in the cisco. Thankyou
for watching and see you on the next video!
