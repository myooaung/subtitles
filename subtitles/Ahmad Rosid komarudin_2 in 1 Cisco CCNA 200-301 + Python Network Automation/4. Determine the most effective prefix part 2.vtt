00:00:00.348  -->  00:00:05.797
In the previous video, we already learn how
to find the best prefix that we can use in

2

00:00:05.797  -->  00:00:06.939
the computer network.

3

00:00:07.699  -->  00:00:13.532
And as I said, in this video we are going
to learn with another case to find the best

4

00:00:13.532  -->  00:00:15.050
prefix we can use.

5

00:00:16.320  -->  00:00:22.027
Let’s say here we have a computer network
that consists of 60 computers.

6

00:00:22.741  -->  00:00:26.929
The question is, which prefix is the best
we can use?

7

00:00:27.875  -->  00:00:32.645
Now, pause the video and try to calculate
it first by your self.

8

00:00:33.414  -->  00:00:39.719
After you find the answer, you can continue
watching this video and see if your answer

9

00:00:39.719  -->  00:00:41.176
is correct or no.

10

00:00:44.199  -->  00:00:45.808
Okay, how?

11

00:00:46.179  -->  00:00:49.193
Do you find the best prefix for 60 computers?

12

00:00:49.972  -->  00:00:53.017
Now let’s take a look at my explanation.

13

00:00:54.305  -->  00:00:58.943
First, let’s write the powers that we do
in the previous video.

14

00:00:59.880  -->  00:01:10.721
2 to the power of 1 is 2, 2 to the power 2
is 2 multiply by 2, which is 4, 2 to the power

15

00:01:10.721  -->  00:01:22.430
of 3 is 4 multiply by 2, which is 8, 2 to
the power of 4 is 8 multiply by 2, which is 16

16

00:01:23.337  -->  00:01:29.272
2 to the power of 5 is 16 multiply by 2 which
is 32.

17

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:36.550
2 to the power of 6 is 32 multiply by 2, which
is 64.

18

00:01:37.050  -->  00:01:49.097
2 to the power of 7 is 64 multiply by 2 which
is 128, and last, 2 to the power of 8 is 128

19

00:01:49.097  -->  00:01:52.906
multiply by 2, which is 256.

20

00:01:54.130  -->  00:01:57.589
Now let’s find the best for 60 computers.

21

00:01:58.572  -->  00:02:05.880
If we see until 2 to the power of 5, here
we know that the total IP is still 32,

22

00:02:06.251  -->  00:02:07.650
this not enough.

23

00:02:08.364  -->  00:02:15.851
But 2 to the power of 6 is 64, and this is
enough for 60 computers.

24

00:02:16.731  -->  00:02:24.677
So the best prefix for 60 PC is 32 minus 6,
which is /26.

25

00:02:25.975  -->  00:02:33.000
Another example, let’s say here we have
a computer network that consist of 100 computers.

26

00:02:34.433  -->  00:02:36.632
Which pefix is the best to use?

27

00:02:37.355  -->  00:02:40.880
We can just see the power calculation that
we already do.

28

00:02:41.473  -->  00:02:47.765
The answer is 2 to the power of 7, which is
128.

29

00:02:48.565  -->  00:02:56.137
If we use 2 to the power of 6, this is not
enough, and if we use 2 to the power of 8,

30

00:02:56.137  -->  00:02:57.655
this is to much.

31

00:02:58.350  -->  00:03:02.193
So the best is, 2 to the power of 7.

32

00:03:03.064  -->  00:03:09.215
And the prefix will be 32 minus 7, which is
/25

33

00:03:10.402  -->  00:03:16.011
Okay now I hope you really understand how
to find the best prefix we can use in the

34

00:03:16.011  -->  00:03:16.996
computer network.

35

00:03:17.747  -->  00:03:20.742
Thankyou for watching and see you in the next
video!
