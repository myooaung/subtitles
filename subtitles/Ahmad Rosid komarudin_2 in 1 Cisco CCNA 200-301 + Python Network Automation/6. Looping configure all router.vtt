00:00:00.411  -->  00:00:06.429
In the previous video, we already learn
how to create multiple interface at once,

2

00:00:07.126  -->  00:00:13.820
now in this video, we are going to learn
how to configure multiple router at once.

3

00:00:14.369  -->  00:00:21.514
So for example here, in the gns3,
we have router 1 until router 5,

4

00:00:22.026  -->  00:00:26.226
Let’s try to configure on all router at once.

5

00:00:27.591  -->  00:00:31.331
Let’s just start, create a new file,

6

00:00:35.000  -->  00:00:40.640
let’s say the name is paramiko_looping_router.py.

7

00:00:43.097  -->  00:00:48.623
And then let’s copy paste the
script from paramiko_basic.py.

8

00:00:51.866  -->  00:00:56.140
Here we ask the input about ip address.

9

00:00:56.709  -->  00:01:00.771
But now we will looping to all router at once,

10

00:01:00.951  -->  00:01:08.569
so we don’t need to ask an input about ip
address anymore. Let’s just remove this.

11

00:01:09.494  -->  00:01:12.626
But we still need username and password.

12

00:01:13.343  -->  00:01:21.471
Now let’s define a looping here. We can start
the looping here in the connect section.

13

00:01:22.077  -->  00:01:28.989
Why here? Because for
username password, ssh client

14

00:01:29.123  -->  00:01:37.746
and set missing host key policy will be same for
all router, so we don’t need to looping here.

15

00:01:38.223  -->  00:01:41.586
We will start the looping in the connect section,

16

00:01:41.729  -->  00:01:46.720
because the ip address of
each router is different.

17

00:01:47.320  -->  00:01:55.994
We will looping with very basic case, if we see
the ip address of all router, they have a pattern,

18

00:01:56.229  -->  00:02:06.489
the ip address is 10.10.10 and then the
router number, so router 1 is 10.10.10.1,

19

00:02:06.686  -->  00:02:18.094
router 2 is 10.10.10.2, router 3 is 10.10.10.3,
router 4 is 10.10.10.4 and router 5 is 10.10.10.5

20

00:02:19.686  -->  00:02:30.974
So we can looping on the last number, here for
x, x is just variable, you can use anything,

21

00:02:31.583  -->  00:02:40.757
in range 1 until 6, this is means that
we will looping start from 1 until 5.

22

00:02:41.677  -->  00:02:50.983
And then we can add indentation here, so all
script until close will be the part of looping.

23

00:02:51.734  -->  00:03:00.670
For the hostname, we can change it become like
this, 10.10.10. and then the router number,

24

00:03:01.280  -->  00:03:10.700
so router 1 should be 10.10.10.1,
router 2 should be 10.10.10.2 and others.

25

00:03:11.371  -->  00:03:16.903
In this case, for router
number, we can use variable x,

26

00:03:17.386  -->  00:03:23.280
so here we will use f string, and then x here.

27

00:03:23.866  -->  00:03:32.871
When the value of x is 1, this script will
remote router 1, when the value of x is 2,

28

00:03:32.940  -->  00:03:37.100
the script will remote router 2, and others.

29

00:03:38.320  -->  00:03:40.483
The username and password is same on

30

00:03:40.483  -->  00:03:46.340
all router. And then here we can
see that the script is too long.

31

00:03:46.609  -->  00:04:03.406
We can enter the script after comma like this,
Okay so now the script is look good.

32

00:04:03.983  -->  00:04:10.997
Next here, we can change this become 10.10.10.x,

33

00:04:12.929  -->  00:04:19.583
Here invoke shell, configure terminal,
and then interface loopback0,

34

00:04:20.077  -->  00:04:25.266
For ip address, let’s configure the
different ip address for each router,

35

00:04:25.466  -->  00:04:30.689
let’s say router 1, the ip address will be 10.1.1.1,

36

00:04:30.854  -->  00:04:41.497
router 2 let’s say will be 10.1.1.2, until router 5
let’s say the ip address will be 10.1.1.5.

37

00:04:42.237  -->  00:04:46.103
So here we can change this become x.

38

00:04:46.571  -->  00:04:51.566
F string here, and then
let’s change this become x.

39

00:04:52.571  -->  00:05:01.143
After send the command, we save the output, print
the output, and last, close the ssh connection.

40

00:05:01.917  -->  00:05:05.222
Okay we have done here. Save,

41

00:05:08.863  -->  00:05:20.549
let’s back to the terminal, ls, here we can
see that we have paramiko_looping_router.py.

42

00:05:21.269  -->  00:05:23.583
let’s execute this script.

43

00:05:25.371  -->  00:05:31.854
Here we don’t need to input ip address
anymore, but we still need to input username,

44

00:05:32.200  -->  00:05:37.840
just enter here, for password,
we also can just enter.

45

00:05:38.420  -->  00:05:55.514
First the script will configure router 1, and
then router 2, router 3, router 4, and last router 5.

46

00:05:56.260  -->  00:06:01.580
Okay so now we are success to
configure multiple router at once.

47

00:06:02.469  -->  00:06:12.169
For the testing, let’s check the interface on
all router, router 1, show ip interface brief,

48

00:06:16.483  -->  00:06:19.591
here we can see that we have loopback0,

49

00:06:21.189  -->  00:06:22.594
Router 2,

50

00:06:26.149  -->  00:06:29.567
show ip interface brief exclude unassign,

51

00:06:31.306  -->  00:06:37.563
here we also have loopback0,
the ip address is 10.1.1.2.

52

00:06:38.323  -->  00:06:39.643
router 3,

53

00:06:43.471  -->  00:06:56.339
do show ip interface brief exclude unassign, here we
also have loopback0, the ip address is 10.1.1.3,

54

00:06:58.525  -->  00:07:00.000
router 4,

55

00:07:03.984  -->  00:07:16.114
do show ip interface brief exclude unassign, here we also have loopback0, the ip address is 10.1.1.4,

56

00:07:16.700  -->  00:07:18.787
and last, router 5,

57

00:07:23.716  -->  00:07:27.526
do show ip interface brief exclude unassign,

58

00:07:31.009  -->  00:07:38.809
here we can see that we also have
loopback0, the ip address is 10.1.1.5.

59

00:07:39.840  -->  00:07:44.490
Okay so now we are success to configure multiple
router at once.

60

00:07:45.061  -->  00:07:47.606
I think enough for this video,

61

00:07:47.683  -->  00:07:51.286
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
