00:00:01.520  -->  00:00:06.170
In the previous video, we already practice
about switch.

2

00:00:06.170  -->  00:00:15.240
So here we have topology that contains 5 pc,
And all of the pc is connected to the switch.

3

00:00:15.240  -->  00:00:22.880
All of this pc is in the same block subnet,
which is the first block subnet.

4

00:00:22.880  -->  00:00:29.140
Before we learn about router, let’s create
the same topology again, but we will use the

5

00:00:29.140  -->  00:00:33.730
second block subnet.

6

00:00:33.730  -->  00:00:43.530
Here let’s import a switch, and then let’s
import some PC.

7

00:00:43.530  -->  00:01:00.460
Let’s say we will use 3 pc. and then connecting
all of the pc to the switch

8

00:01:00.460  -->  00:01:06.780
Okay now let’s configure the ip address
of the pc using the second block subnet.

9

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:12.179
let’s say the ip address is start from 33.

10

00:01:12.179  -->  00:01:19.170
Remember that network ip can never be used,
so we can not use 32.

11

00:01:19.170  -->  00:01:26.200
The possible ip address that we can use is
between 33 until 62.

12

00:01:26.200  -->  00:01:30.950
In this case we will start from 33.

13

00:01:30.950  -->  00:01:40.789
Here let’s go to desktop, ip configuration,
the ip address is 10.10.10.33, and then the

14

00:01:40.789  -->  00:01:48.389
subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

15

00:01:48.389  -->  00:01:58.319
Okay next here let’s configure with 34,
so the ip address is 10.10.10.34, the subnetmask

16

00:01:58.319  -->  00:02:08.369
is 255.255.255.224, last, let’s configure
with 35.

17

00:02:08.369  -->  00:02:20.950
Here the ip address 10.10.10.35, and the subnetmask
is 255.255.255.224.

18

00:02:20.950  -->  00:02:27.230
Okay we have done configuring the ip address
of all pc. now let’s test the connection

19

00:02:27.230  -->  00:02:32.530
between pc5, pc6 and pc7.

20

00:02:32.530  -->  00:02:36.860
Here let’s try from pc5 to pc6.

21

00:02:36.860  -->  00:02:38.270
Okay success.

22

00:02:38.270  -->  00:02:42.660
This is mean that the connection between pc5
and pc6 is ok.

23

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:52.830
Let’s try from pc6 to pc7, okay also success.

24

00:02:52.830  -->  00:03:01.240
And finally from pc5 to pc7, okay and this
is also success.

25

00:03:01.240  -->  00:03:08.280
Okay now we have two topology, let’s say
the first topology is room number 1, and the

26

00:03:08.280  -->  00:03:12.000
second topology is room number 2.

27

00:03:12.000  -->  00:03:16.740
And this two room is use different block subnet.

28

00:03:16.740  -->  00:03:24.010
In the next video, we are going to learn how
to connecting this two room, okay, thankyou

29

00:03:24.010  -->  00:03:26.830
for watching and see you on the next video!
