00:00:00.297  -->  00:00:04.917
In the previous video, we already build two
topology like this.

2

00:00:05.571  -->  00:00:12.770
So here we have room number 1 which using the
first block subnet, and we also have room

3

00:00:12.770  -->  00:00:17.457
number 2 which using second block subnet.

4

00:00:18.165  -->  00:00:24.000
Now in this video, we are going to learn how
to connecting this two rooms.

5

00:00:24.576  -->  00:00:29.075
To connecting different block subnet like
this, we will need a router.

6

00:00:30.070  -->  00:00:32.030
Okay let’s just start.

7

00:00:32.466  -->  00:00:41.194
Let’s import a router to our topology, go
to network devices, and here we have router.

8

00:00:41.766  -->  00:00:45.791
In this case, I will use router 2811.

9

00:00:46.948  -->  00:00:51.064
Next let’s connecting this two switch to
the router.

10

00:00:54.659  -->  00:01:00.572
Actually, each interface in the router or
switch must be have a name.

11

00:01:01.198  -->  00:01:07.080
In the real device, we will see the name of
the interface in the top of interface.

12

00:01:07.420  -->  00:01:14.243
Let’s say fa0/1, fa0/2 and others.

13

00:01:15.060  -->  00:01:21.000
In the cisco packet tracer, by default the
name of the interface is not shown like this.

14

00:01:22.198  -->  00:01:29.043
To show the name of the interface, we can
go to cisco packet tracer and then preference.

15

00:01:29.846  -->  00:01:35.023
Remember that if you use windows, the preference
menu is under edit.

16

00:01:36.072  -->  00:01:42.114
Next here we can mark “Always show port
labels in logical workspace”.

17

00:01:43.149  -->  00:01:47.800
Okay now we can see here that each interface
have a name.

18

00:01:48.236  -->  00:01:56.160
So the router interface that connected to
switch 1 is fa0/0, and interface that connected

19

00:01:56.160  -->  00:02:00.000
to the switch  2 is fa0/1.

20

00:02:01.510  -->  00:02:09.080
Okay next we need to configure so all pc in
the room number 1 can communicate with all

21

00:02:09.080  -->  00:02:11.164
pc in the room number 2.

22

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:16.197
To do that we need to configure ip address
on the router.

23

00:02:16.850  -->  00:02:23.028
We will use first block subnet in fa0/0, why?

24

00:02:23.178  -->  00:02:32.570
Because fa0/0 is connected to the room number
1 and room number 1 is using first block subnet.

25

00:02:33.551  -->  00:02:39.755
And then we will configure fa0/1 with second
block subnet.

26

00:02:40.654  -->  00:02:49.390
In this case, I will use the last ip address
of first block subnet for fa0/0, which is

27

00:02:49.390  -->  00:02:56.554
30, remember that 31 Is broadcast address,
so we can not use 31.

28

00:02:57.617  -->  00:03:06.852
Okay let’s open the router, go to config
menu, and here we can see fa0/0.

29

00:03:07.723  -->  00:03:11.755
Here we need to change the interface status
to on.

30

00:03:12.300  -->  00:03:18.959
If you see here, the color of interface is
red, but after we change the status to on,

31

00:03:18.959  -->  00:03:21.348
the color now is green.

32

00:03:22.424  -->  00:03:29.540
Next let’s configure the ip address, here
we will use the last address from first block

33

00:03:29.540  -->  00:03:41.009
subnet, which is 10.10.10.30, and then the
subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

34

00:03:42.643  -->  00:03:50.689
Okay we have done for fa0/0, now let’s move
to fa0/1.

35

00:03:51.424  -->  00:03:58.557
Here we will use the ip address from second
block subnet, in this case we will also use

36

00:03:58.557  -->  00:03:59.874
the last address.

37

00:04:00.119  -->  00:04:09.114
Which is 62, remember that we can not use
63, because this is broadcast address.

38

00:04:10.108  -->  00:04:14.313
Okay here let’s change the status of interface
to on.

39

00:04:14.762  -->  00:04:27.000
And then configure the ip address, 10.10.10.62
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

40

00:04:28.254  -->  00:04:32.397
Okay now we have done configuring the ip address
of the router.

41

00:04:33.000  -->  00:04:40.529
Next we need to configure default gateway
on all pc. The gateway will be the ip address

42

00:04:40.529  -->  00:04:41.634
of router.

43

00:04:42.533  -->  00:04:50.929
For all pc in the room number 1, the gateway
will be the ip address of fa0/0, which is

44

00:04:50.929  -->  00:04:59.850
10.10.10.30, and the gateway for all pc in
the room number 2 will be the ip address of

45

00:04:59.850  -->  00:05:06.650
fa0/1, which is 10.10.10.62.

46

00:05:07.522  -->  00:05:11.352
Let’s configure gateway for all pc in the
room number 1 first.

47

00:05:11.651  -->  00:05:15.528
The gateway is 10.10.10.30

48

00:05:19.600  -->  00:05:26.475
Okay we have done configuring gateway on all
pc in the room number 1, now let’s configure

49

00:05:26.475  -->  00:05:36.580
the gateway on all pc in the room number 2,
the gateway is 10.10.10.62.

50

00:05:40.733  -->  00:05:42.383
Okay we have done.

51

00:05:42.969  -->  00:05:50.551
Finally let’s test connection between room
number 1 to room number 2, let’s test from

52

00:05:50.551  -->  00:05:53.065
pc 4 to pc 5.

53

00:05:53.923  -->  00:05:57.000
The first test usually failed like this.

54

00:05:57.291  -->  00:06:05.489
Let’s try again, okay here we can see that
ping from pc 4 to pc 5 is successful,

55

00:06:05.789  -->  00:06:11.181
this is mean that connection between room number 1
and number 2 is ok!

56

00:06:11.739  -->  00:06:16.778
To make sure, let’s try again from pc 2 to pc 6.

57

00:06:17.745  -->  00:06:21.694
Okay the first test is failed, let’s try
again.

58

00:06:22.566  -->  00:06:24.984
Here we can see that success.

59

00:06:25.965  -->  00:06:30.628
Okay let’s just test again from room number
1 to room number 2.

60

00:06:31.350  -->  00:06:35.015
Okay here we can see that this is also success.

61

00:06:35.750  -->  00:06:43.313
So now we are successfully connecting room
number 1 with room number 2 using a router.

62

00:06:44.593  -->  00:06:48.266
I hope you understand about how switch and
router work.

63

00:06:48.593  -->  00:06:55.435
The summary is, switch is used to connecting
many pc that in the same block subnet,

64

00:06:55.721  -->  00:07:01.583
and router is used to connecting many pc that
in the different block subnet.

65

00:07:02.577  -->  00:07:05.194
Okay I think enough for this video

66

00:07:05.372  -->  00:07:08.895
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
