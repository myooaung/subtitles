00:00:00.612  -->  00:00:04.548
In the previous video, we already create topology
like this.

2

00:00:05.384  -->  00:00:10.727
We will use this topology to learn about network
automation using netmiko.

3

00:00:11.694  -->  00:00:15.954
Now in this video, we are going to learn about
netmiko.

4

00:00:16.573  -->  00:00:20.811
What is netmiko, and how we can install netmiko.

5

00:00:21.507  -->  00:00:28.011
You can try to open the netmiko documentation
in github.com, this is the url,

6

00:00:28.901  -->  00:00:34.635
Or you can go to google and try to search
netmiko github like this.

7

00:00:38.166  -->  00:00:41.119
And then you can open the first website.

8

00:00:41.815  -->  00:00:45.233
Okay now let’s start learn about netmiko.

9

00:00:45.841  -->  00:00:53.644
Netmiko is a multi vendor library to simplify
paramiko ssh connection to network devices.

10

00:00:54.600  -->  00:01:02.901
So the function of netmiko is same as paramiko,
which is doing ssh to networking devices.

11

00:01:03.726  -->  00:01:07.383
But netmiko is more simple than paramiko.

12

00:01:07.905  -->  00:01:11.642
And netmiko is build based on paramiko.

13

00:01:13.239  -->  00:01:20.499
Here we can see supported platform, this is
means the vendors that supported by netmiko.

14

00:01:21.259  -->  00:01:30.067
The supported platform is divided to 3 category,
which is regular tested, limited testing,

15

00:01:30.067  -->  00:01:32.115
and experimental.

16

00:01:33.000  -->  00:01:37.278
To check the detail, we can click here in
the platforms.

17

00:01:41.699  -->  00:01:45.148
Okay this is the vendor that regulary tested.

18

00:01:45.506  -->  00:01:52.508
We have arista, cisco devices, hp, juniper,
linux, and others.

19

00:01:53.247  -->  00:01:56.043
And this is vendor that limited tested.

20

00:01:56.554  -->  00:02:02.515
Here we have many vendor, including mikrotik
is also limited tested.

21

00:02:04.557  -->  00:02:12.823
And then this is the vendor that experimental,
we also have many vendor here, including Fortinet

22

00:02:12.823  -->  00:02:15.000
is also experimental.

23

00:02:16.044  -->  00:02:20.690
Okay so we have many vendor that supported
by netmiko.

24

00:02:21.624  -->  00:02:25.644
Next, let’s see how we can install netmiko.

25

00:02:26.426  -->  00:02:28.932
This is the command to install netmiko.

26

00:02:29.540  -->  00:02:30.734
Very simple right?

27

00:02:31.299  -->  00:02:35.392
We just need to type pip install netmiko.

28

00:02:36.000  -->  00:02:44.295
And here we can see some requirement for netmiko,
so when we install netmiko, this package will

29

00:02:44.295  -->  00:02:46.247
installed automatically.

30

00:02:47.398  -->  00:02:54.354
Okay let’s just install netmiko on ubuntu
server, let’s make sure that netmiko is

31

00:02:54.354  -->  00:03:09.160
not installed yet, pip3 freeze, here we can
see that netmiko is not installed yet.

32

00:03:09.953  -->  00:03:17.237
So if we try to import netmiko on python,
we should get an error, let’s try it.

33

00:03:17.791  -->  00:03:19.866
Go to python interpreter.

34

00:03:20.268  -->  00:03:23.408
And then let’s try to import netmiko.

35

00:03:24.158  -->  00:03:26.443
Okay here we get an error,

36

00:03:27.334  -->  00:03:34.725
Exit, and then let’s try to install netmiko,
pip3 install netmiko.

37

00:03:36.474  -->  00:03:44.572
Wait for a minute, okay done,

38

00:03:45.126  -->  00:03:59.623
Let’s check again, pip3 freeze, here we
can see that now we have netmiko.

39

00:04:00.242  -->  00:04:03.248
Let’s try to import on python interpreter.

40

00:04:03.944  -->  00:04:08.735
Go to python interpreter, and then import
netmiko.

41

00:04:09.701  -->  00:04:12.811
Okay now we don’t have an error anymore.

42

00:04:13.534  -->  00:04:18.205
This is means that netmiko is installed correctly
on our server.

43

00:04:19.237  -->  00:04:25.083
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to start learn how to

44

00:04:25.083  -->  00:04:28.187
do network automation using netmiko.

45

00:04:28.871  -->  00:04:32.380
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
