00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:06.463
In the previous section, we already learn
about network automation using paramiko.

2

00:00:06.925  -->  00:00:13.592
Next in this section, we are going to learn
network automation using netmiko.

3

00:00:14.369  -->  00:00:15.849
What is netmiko?

4

00:00:16.592  -->  00:00:21.143
We will learn more about netmiko later in
the next video.

5

00:00:22.068  -->  00:00:25.612
Now we are going to setup the topology first.

6

00:00:25.992  -->  00:00:34.286
Let’s just start, create new project, let’s
say the name is network automation netmiko.

7

00:00:37.606  -->  00:00:50.074
Let’s import the ubuntu server, and then
let’s also import some router,

8

00:00:50.454  -->  00:00:59.271
here we can type shift and then drag and drop the router,
let’s import 5 router.

9

00:01:02.805  -->  00:01:17.402
Okay now we have 5 router, this is router 1,
router 2, router 3, router 4, and this is router 5.

10

00:01:18.195  -->  00:01:21.913
Now let’s connecting all router to the switch.

11

00:01:26.819  -->  00:01:30.499
Let’s also connecting the switch to ubuntu
server.

12

00:01:30.961  -->  00:01:38.195
Remember that in the ubuntu server, the interface
that connected to gns3 is the second ethernet,

13

00:01:38.361  -->  00:01:40.298
so ethernet 1 here.

14

00:01:41.025  -->  00:01:48.809
Ethernet0 is connected to internet, ethernet1
is connected to gns3, and ethernet3 is connected

15

00:01:48.809  -->  00:01:50.361
to the laptop.

16

00:01:51.154  -->  00:02:01.702
If you forget, you can check it in the virtualbox,
here click on ubuntu, and then setting.

17

00:02:05.220  -->  00:02:12.857
In the network section, here we can see that
adapter 1 is nat, this is connected to internet,

18

00:02:13.204  -->  00:02:21.030
adapter2 is not attached, this is will be
connected to gns3, and then adapter3 is host

19

00:02:21.030  -->  00:02:25.596
only adapter, this is connected to our laptop.

20

00:02:33.590  -->  00:02:41.460
Okay done, let’s start all router and ubuntu
server, here we can click on this icon.

21

00:02:42.022  -->  00:02:47.110
Wait for a minute until all router and ubuntu
server is started.

22

00:02:51.421  -->  00:02:58.934
While waiting for all router and ubuntu server
started, let’s create a note for the ip address.

23

00:02:59.472  -->  00:03:10.392
Router 1, the ip address will be 10.10.10.1,
router 2 will be 10.10.10.2,

24

00:03:14.125  -->  00:03:29.592
router 3 will be 10.10.10.3, router 4 will be 10.10.10.4, and
last, router 5 will be 10.10.10.5

25

00:03:34.910  -->  00:03:48.850
Okay now let’s check on ubuntu server, login,
let’s check the ip address.

26

00:03:51.592  -->  00:04:02.527
Here we can see that the ip address of enp0s3
is 10.0.2.15, this ip address is automatic,

27

00:04:02.924  -->  00:04:07.981
because we configure dhcp client on enp0s3

28

00:04:08.758  -->  00:04:20.857
For enp0s8, the ip address is 10.10.10.254,
this is connected to gns3, and last, for enp0s9,

29

00:04:20.857  -->  00:04:29.851
the ip address is 192.168.56.2, this interface
is connected to our laptop.

30

00:04:30.594  -->  00:04:34.932
So the ip address in the ubuntu server is
correct.

31

00:04:35.775  -->  00:04:41.374
Now let’s configure ip address and ssh on
all router.

32

00:04:42.216  -->  00:04:47.081
Let’s show the interface label first, click
on this icon.

33

00:04:48.237  -->  00:04:54.676
Here we can see that all router connected
to the switch on fa0/0.

34

00:04:55.601  -->  00:05:03.002
Later, the configuration of all router will
be same, so we can write the template configuration

35

00:05:03.002  -->  00:05:04.337
on sublime.

36

00:05:04.552  -->  00:05:12.592
Let’s create new file, here we will write
the template to configure ip address and ssh

37

00:05:12.592  -->  00:05:14.232
on all router,

38

00:05:14.893  -->  00:05:16.570
Configure terminal

39

00:05:18.502  -->  00:05:35.254
Interface fa0/0, no shutdown, and then ip
address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0,

40

00:05:35.799  -->  00:05:38.832
this is will be for router 1.

41

00:05:39.261  -->  00:05:42.195
And then for ssh configuration

42

00:05:42.410  -->  00:05:53.681
Ip domain-name mydomain.local, crypto key
generate rsa and then enter,

43

00:05:54.341  -->  00:05:58.438
Here for the modulus is 1024.

44

00:05:59.264  -->  00:06:02.877
Next, we need to create username and password.

45

00:06:03.274  -->  00:06:10.443
Username cisco privilege 15 secret cisco.

46

00:06:11.781  -->  00:06:18.352
Last, let’s configure vty, line vty 0 15.

47

00:06:18.550  -->  00:06:20.150
Login local.

48

00:06:20.976  -->  00:06:23.639
Don’t forget to save the configuration.

49

00:06:23.639  -->  00:06:24.685
Do write.

50

00:06:25.280  -->  00:06:32.368
Okay this is the configuration template to
configure ip address and ssh on all router.

51

00:06:32.930  -->  00:06:40.385
Later for router 2, we just need to change
the ip address, the other configuration is same.

52

00:06:40.938  -->  00:06:44.642
Let’s copy this, go to router 1.

53

00:06:47.532  -->  00:06:50.000
And then paste the command here.

54

00:06:55.995  -->  00:07:01.394
Okay all configuration is success, except
in the modulus section.

55

00:07:01.584  -->  00:07:03.790
Let’s edit the template again,

56

00:07:04.352  -->  00:07:08.376
Here we have enter 2 time, let’s remove
this.

57

00:07:08.954  -->  00:07:15.842
Let’s just copy in the crypto key section,
back to router 1, paste,

58

00:07:16.354  -->  00:07:21.408
Here choose yes, and this is 1024.

59

00:07:23.192  -->  00:07:24.486
Okay done.

60

00:07:25.000  -->  00:07:27.424
Now we are done on router 1.

61

00:07:27.738  -->  00:07:31.950
Now let’s test to remote router 1 from ubuntu
server.

62

00:07:32.479  -->  00:07:37.541
But before that, let’s remote ubuntu server
from our laptop first.

63

00:07:38.053  -->  00:07:54.342
Ssh ubuntu@192.168.56.2, okay success, now
let’s try ping to router 1, ping 10.10.10.1,

64

00:07:54.854  -->  00:07:56.928
okay this is success.

65

00:07:57.324  -->  00:08:06.164
Now let’s try to remote router 1, ssh cisco@10.10.10.1,

66

00:08:07.122  -->  00:08:15.420
Okay we get an error here, this is because
yesterday we remote 10.10.10.1,

67

00:08:15.817  -->  00:08:22.729
but now we remote 10.10.10.1 again, but the router is
different.

68

00:08:23.406  -->  00:08:35.176
To solve this, we can just remove this file,
copy this, sudo rm and then paste it.

69

00:08:37.108  -->  00:08:45.287
Now let’s ssh to router 1 again, okay now
this is success.

70

00:08:46.344  -->  00:08:54.428
Now Let’s try ping to router 2, this is failed,
because we don’t configure anything yet

71

00:08:54.428  -->  00:08:55.948
on router 2.

72

00:08:56.542  -->  00:08:58.886
Now let’s configure router 2.

73

00:08:59.117  -->  00:09:03.957
In the sublime, let’s change the ip address
become 2.

74

00:09:04.486  -->  00:09:09.843
Copy, back to gns3, open router 2.

75

00:09:15.194  -->  00:09:17.768
And then paste the command here.

76

00:09:18.627  -->  00:09:27.811
Here we can see configure terminal, configure
the ip address, domain name, crypto key generate

77

00:09:27.811  -->  00:09:34.869
rsa 1024, create username, and configure vty.

78

00:09:35.530  -->  00:09:38.954
And last here we save the configuration.

79

00:09:39.565  -->  00:09:43.672
Okay so the configuration on router 2 is success.

80

00:09:44.102  -->  00:09:49.621
Let’s check it, ping to router 2 first, okay
success.

81

00:09:49.869  -->  00:09:52.732
Let’s try ssh to router 2.

82

00:09:59.454  -->  00:10:02.118
Okay this is also success.

83

00:10:02.762  -->  00:10:10.487
Okay I think enough for this video, for router 3,
4 and 5, you can try it by your self.

84

00:10:10.867  -->  00:10:16.037
You just need to edit the ip address and then
copy paste the command.

85

00:10:16.516  -->  00:10:22.689
In the next video, we are going to start learning
network automation using netmiko.

86

00:10:23.251  -->  00:10:26.961
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
