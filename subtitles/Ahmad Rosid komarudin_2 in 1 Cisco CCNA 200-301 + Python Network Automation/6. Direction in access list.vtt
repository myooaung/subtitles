00:00:01.138  -->  00:00:06.000
In the previous video, we already
learn about direction in access list.

2

00:00:06.467  -->  00:00:11.637
Now we have an access list to
block from vlan 20 to the server.

3

00:00:12.086  -->  00:00:20.560
Let’s check it, do show access list,
here we have access list 1 to block

4

00:00:20.560  -->  00:00:28.857
from vlan 20 and permit any, and this
access list is assign to interface fa0/0,

5

00:00:29.326  -->  00:00:30.444
let’s check it,

6

00:00:32.443  -->  00:00:38.801
here we can see that in fa0/0, there
is a command to assign the access-list.

7

00:00:39.526  -->  00:00:43.789
In the router 1, actually we also have access-list,

8

00:00:44.197  -->  00:00:50.911
let’s check it, here we also have access-list 1. But if we try show run,

9

00:00:53.698  -->  00:01:01.157
here we can see that the access list is not assign
to any interface. So this access list is not used.

10

00:01:01.409  -->  00:01:09.564
So now, from vlan 20 to router 1 and router 2
should be ok, but vlan 20 to server will failed.

11

00:01:10.646  -->  00:01:18.413
Now let’s try with new case, let’s say we
also want to block from pc 0 to the server.

12

00:01:18.824  -->  00:01:24.444
Pay attention that we only block
from pc0, not from vlan 10.

13

00:01:24.972  -->  00:01:32.203
So pc 1 should be able to ping to the server.
but vlan 20 and pc 0 should be failed.

14

00:01:32.830  -->  00:01:38.739
Let’s try it first, pc 0 to
server, okay this is success.

15

00:01:39.212  -->  00:01:46.714
So now let’s add the access list to block from
pc 0. Let’s check the ip address of pc 0 first,

16

00:01:48.757  -->  00:01:53.322
here we can see that the
ip address is 192.168.10.2.

17

00:01:54.818  -->  00:02:03.095
Okay go to router 2, configure
terminal, and then access-list

18

00:02:03.095  -->  00:02:09.527
1 deny, because we only want to
block 1 pc, so we can use host.

19

00:02:10.504  -->  00:02:18.278
So deny host, and then the ip address
of pc 0, which is 192.168.10.2.

20

00:02:20.215  -->  00:02:22.235
Let’s see the access list again,

21

00:02:24.516  -->  00:02:32.708
here we can see that now we have rule to
block from 192.168.10.2, which is pc 0.

22

00:02:34.418  -->  00:02:43.644
Let’s test ping from pc 0 to server again, here
we can see that the result is still success.

23

00:02:44.215  -->  00:02:52.659
Let’s see on the router 2, do show access list.
we can see that we don’t have any match here.

24

00:02:53.064  -->  00:03:01.496
But we have new match in the permit any, the
match for permit any before is 21, but now 22.

25

00:03:02.123  -->  00:03:07.127
So the packet from pc 0 to the
server is match with this rule.

26

00:03:07.692  -->  00:03:13.318
Let’s test again, here the match is 22, let’s
test send packet from pc 0 to the server,

27

00:03:14.350  -->  00:03:22.641
let’s see in the router again, here we can see
that now the match in the permit any is 23.

28

00:03:23.495  -->  00:03:31.101
why packet from pc 0 match with this rule? This
is because, access list will read the rule

29

00:03:31.101  -->  00:03:39.816
from top to the buttom. Here we have
number 10 20 30, this is a sequence number

30

00:03:40.295  -->  00:03:45.198
when pc 0 send packet to the server,
router will read the access list,

31

00:03:46.025  -->  00:03:52.258
the packet is not match with the first rule,
and then router will read second rule,

32

00:03:52.850  -->  00:04:01.767
and here the packet is match, because the source is any.
This is why from pc 0 to the server is success.

33

00:04:02.486  -->  00:04:10.068
So, to block from pc 0, we need to create
the rule with sequence number lower than 20.

34

00:04:10.492  -->  00:04:17.151
Let’s say 17 or 15 or anything,
as long as lower than 20.

35

00:04:17.821  -->  00:04:18.967
Let’s try it,

36

00:04:19.704  -->  00:04:28.074
First, we need to go to the access list, the
command is ip access-list and then here standard,

37

00:04:29.747  -->  00:04:31.324
and then the id.

38

00:04:33.126  -->  00:04:40.874
Next we need to remove the rule with sequence
number 30 first, the command is no 30.

39

00:04:41.489  -->  00:04:43.521
Let’s see the access list again,

40

00:04:46.646  -->  00:04:50.899
here we can see that now
sequence number 30 is gone.

41

00:04:51.532  -->  00:04:58.271
Next let’s create rule to block from
pc 0 with sequence number lower than 20.

42

00:04:58.732  -->  00:05:06.998
Let’s say I use sequence number 15
and then deny host 192.168.10.2.

43

00:05:07.772  -->  00:05:11.120
So here we define the
sequence number that we want.

44

00:05:13.126  -->  00:05:21.441
Let’s see the access list again, do show access
list, okay here we have sequence number 10,

45

00:05:21.507  -->  00:05:28.216
and then 15 that we just add, and finally
we have sequence number 20 to permit any.

46

00:05:28.806  -->  00:05:39.545
Now pc 0 should not able to communicate with
server. Let’s try, okay the result is failed.

47

00:05:40.387  -->  00:05:45.286
Okay I think enough for this video, I
hope you understand about the concept

48

00:05:45.286  -->  00:05:47.905
of sequence number in access list.

49

00:05:48.460  -->  00:05:51.643
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
