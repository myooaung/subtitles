00:00:00.598  -->  00:00:06.581
In the previous video, we already learn
how to configure multiple router at once.

2

00:00:07.174  -->  00:00:17.012
Here we can see that we looping from 1 until
5. And then here we connect to 10.10.10.1

3

00:00:17.254  -->  00:00:21.990
until 10.10.10.5 using looping.

4

00:00:23.044  -->  00:00:27.381
Looping like this actually is not best practice.

5

00:00:28.219  -->  00:00:35.579
Now the ip address of all router is
in sequence. But how if the ip address

6

00:00:35.579  -->  00:00:47.874
of all router is not in sequence, let’s say we
have 1, and then 11, and then 20, 35, and others,

7

00:00:48.515  -->  00:00:54.000
Or, how if the ip address of all
router is not similar like this?

8

00:00:55.044  -->  00:01:01.769
For now the first 3 number
is same, which is 10.10.10,

9

00:01:02.546  -->  00:01:07.277
How if the ip address of all
router is totally different?

10

00:01:07.839  -->  00:01:12.993
So we can not configure multiple
router at once using this way.

11

00:01:13.704  -->  00:01:19.485
The solution is, we can save the ip
address of all router in the list,

12

00:01:20.084  -->  00:01:23.375
and then we do looping on the list.

13

00:01:23.912  -->  00:01:38.645
Let’s just try, let’s just copy this, create
new file, the name is paramiko_looping_list.py,

14

00:01:44.626  -->  00:01:46.692
And then paste the script.

15

00:01:48.010  -->  00:01:51.885
First we need to create the list of ip address,

16

00:01:52.404  -->  00:02:01.067
so here list_ip and then let’s put the
ip address of router 1 until router 5 here.

17

00:02:01.746  -->  00:02:15.947
Let’s start with router 1, 10.10.10.1,
10.10.10.2 for router 2, 10.10.10.3 for router 3,

18

00:02:16.774  -->  00:02:25.633
10.10.10.4 for router 4, and
last 10.10.10.5 for router 5.

19

00:02:26.602  -->  00:02:32.169
Here the script is to long, we
can enter it after the comma,

20

00:02:32.534  -->  00:02:37.405
let’s say after 3 router, we can enter like this.

21

00:02:45.764  -->  00:02:48.302
Okay now the script is look good.

22

00:02:49.284  -->  00:02:56.205
now we have the list of ip address,
next we can looping to this list.

23

00:02:57.174  -->  00:03:02.637
Let’s change this variable to ip,
you are free to use anything here,

24

00:03:02.719  -->  00:03:05.381
because this is just a variable.

25

00:03:06.122  -->  00:03:10.838
And then let’s change this
become the name of the list.

26

00:03:11.642  -->  00:03:19.252
Here for the connect, we don’t need f string
anymore, we can just put the ip variable.

27

00:03:19.716  -->  00:03:28.981
Because the value of ip variable is
10.10.10.1, so we don’t need f string anymore.

28

00:03:29.722  -->  00:03:35.258
Here for the print, let’s also change this become
ip variable.

29

00:03:36.720  -->  00:03:44.842
Okay and then here configure terminal, interface
loopback 3, let’s change this become loopback4,

30

00:03:45.138  -->  00:03:52.323
and the ip address will be same
on all router. Let’s say 10.5.1.1,

31

00:03:52.946  -->  00:04:01.738
so the ip address of loopback4 for all
router will be same, which is 10.5.1.1

32

00:04:02.577  -->  00:04:09.794
We will learn how to configure different ip
address for each router later in the next video.

33

00:04:10.564  -->  00:04:19.240
And then do write here to save the configuration,
last here we send command to see the interface.

34

00:04:20.084  -->  00:04:24.938
Okay, save, let’s execute this script,

35

00:04:26.589  -->  00:04:41.491
Let’s login to ubuntu server using
ssh, ssh ubuntu@192.168.56.2 ls,

36

00:04:41.814  -->  00:04:50.318
Let’s cd to lab_paramiko, ls again, here we
can see that we have paramiko_looping_list.py,

37

00:04:50.829  -->  00:04:52.912
let’s execute this script,

38

00:04:56.824  -->  00:04:58.667
Just enter enter here,

39

00:05:01.764  -->  00:05:08.747
Okay success login to router 1, create
loopback4, save the configuration,

40

00:05:08.824  -->  00:05:15.960
and here we can see that we have
loopback4, the ip address is 10.5.1.1,

41

00:05:16.731  -->  00:05:26.507
Router 2 also success, we have loopback4,
the ip address is same, which is 10.5.1.1

42

00:05:27.617  -->  00:05:42.000
Router 3 also success, router 4 also
success, and last, router 5 also success.

43

00:05:43.752  -->  00:05:48.171
Okay so now we are success
configure all router at once

44

00:05:48.171  -->  00:05:49.579
using list.

45

00:05:50.174  -->  00:05:52.556
I think enough for this video

46

00:05:52.816  -->  00:05:56.164
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
