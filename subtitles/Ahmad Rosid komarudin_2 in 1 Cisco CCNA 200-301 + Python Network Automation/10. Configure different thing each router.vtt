00:00:00.213  -->  00:00:06.558
In the previous video, We already create a
script to looping in the list ip address.

2

00:00:07.136  -->  00:00:15.000
So here we have a list that save the ip address
of all router, and then we do looping to this list.

3

00:00:15.786  -->  00:00:25.703
But if you remember, the ip address of loopback
is same on all router, which is 10.5.1.1.

4

00:00:26.675  -->  00:00:33.215
Now, we are going to modify this script, so
the last number in the loopback ip address

5

00:00:33.215  -->  00:00:37.766
will based on the last number in the router
ip address.

6

00:00:38.816  -->  00:00:45.596
Here we have the ip address list of all router,
so we will use the last number,

7

00:00:45.727  -->  00:00:50.422
which is 1 2 3 4 and 5.

8

00:00:51.105  -->  00:00:55.807
And then this last number will used in the
loopback ip address.

9

00:00:56.635  -->  00:00:58.184
How we can do that?

10

00:00:58.499  -->  00:01:01.740
Let’s try it in the python interpreter first.

11

00:01:02.384  -->  00:01:10.454
Copy this, go to terminal, and then go to
python interpreter.

12

00:01:11.124  -->  00:01:17.029
Let’s clear this using ctrl + l. and then
paste the script.

13

00:01:19.025  -->  00:01:20.890
Let’s print the list_ip,

14

00:01:23.333  -->  00:01:25.799
Okay this is the list.

15

00:01:26.653  -->  00:01:35.927
Let’s try to looping here, for ip in list_ip,
and then print the ip,

16

00:01:37.910  -->  00:01:48.293
Here we get the ip address of all router,
10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5.

17

00:01:49.134  -->  00:01:57.216
Here we can see that the data type of each
ip address is tring, here we have a quote,

18

00:01:57.492  -->  00:01:59.286
this is means string.

19

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:08.648
Let’s check it, up arrow until we see the
looping again, and then here let’s print

20

00:02:08.648  -->  00:02:10.688
the type of ip.

21

00:02:13.157  -->  00:02:16.126
Here we can see that the type is string.

22

00:02:17.058  -->  00:02:25.168
In the string, we have method split, this
method will split the string become a list.

23

00:02:25.640  -->  00:02:27.000
Let’s try it,

24

00:02:27.946  -->  00:02:40.285
For ip in list_ip, and then let’s try to
split this ip, ip_split, this is just a variable,

25

00:02:40.915  -->  00:02:50.043
And then ip.split(“.”), this is means
that we split the ip based on dot .

26

00:02:51.000  -->  00:03:01.674
So the result will be a list, 10 10 10 and
then 1, let’s print the ip_split here.

27

00:03:06.153  -->  00:03:07.828
Enter 2 times,

28

00:03:08.340  -->  00:03:18.000
Okay this is router 1, this is router 2, this
is router 3, this is router 4, and this is router 5.

29

00:03:19.034  -->  00:03:24.085
Okay so now we can access the last number
using indexing.

30

00:03:24.755  -->  00:03:37.745
In python, the index is started by 0, so here
0 1 2 3, so the index of last number is 3,

31

00:03:38.099  -->  00:03:42.000
or we also can use reverse indexing

32

00:03:42.702  -->  00:03:51.578
Reverse indexing is start from the last item,
the index of last item is -1.

33

00:03:52.510  -->  00:03:55.758
Okay now let’s try to print the last number.

34

00:03:56.309  -->  00:04:12.214
For ip in list_ip, ip_split ip.split dot,
and then let’s print the ip_split index 3,

35

00:04:14.501  -->  00:04:21.282
Or you can also using reverse indexing, so
the index will be -1.

36

00:04:22.162  -->  00:04:23.620
Enter 2 times,

37

00:04:24.145  -->  00:04:29.877
Okay here we get 1 2 3 4 and 5,

38

00:04:30.941  -->  00:04:37.977
We will use this number as the ip address
of loopback interface, so the ip address of

39

00:04:37.977  -->  00:04:41.933
loopback interface for each router will be
different.

40

00:04:42.839  -->  00:04:50.046
Now let’s back to sublime, here let’s
take the last number of the ip address like

41

00:04:50.046  -->  00:04:53.318
we already do in the python interpreter.

42

00:04:54.250  -->  00:04:59.592
Router_id, this is just a variable, you can
use anything.

43

00:05:00.000  -->  00:05:07.283
And then ip.split, dot, so we split the ip
based on dot.

44

00:05:07.913  -->  00:05:14.575
And then here let’s access the index -1,
which is the last item.

45

00:05:15.784  -->  00:05:18.751
Next, let’s configure for loopback5,

46

00:05:20.616  -->  00:05:30.320
The ip address is 10.6 and then here will
be based on router_id, so we use f string,

47

00:05:30.503  -->  00:05:33.225
And then here router_id.

48

00:05:35.680  -->  00:05:45.613
Okay save, back to therminal, exit from interpreter,

49

00:05:46.624  -->  00:05:54.545
And then here let’s execute
the script, python paramiiko_looping_list.py,

50

00:05:56.817  -->  00:05:58.413
enter enter here,

51

00:06:04.179  -->  00:06:11.346
Okay here we success on router 1, the ip address
is 10.6.1.1,

52

00:06:11.937  -->  00:06:17.756
Router 2 also success, the ip address is 10.6.1.2,

53

00:06:18.347  -->  00:06:21.907
Router 3, also success, the ip address is 10.6.1.3,
this is 3.

54

00:06:22.734  -->  00:06:26.332
Router 4 also success, this is 4.

55

00:06:26.713  -->  00:06:31.357
And last, router 5 also success, this is 5.

56

00:06:32.172  -->  00:06:35.111
Okay I think enough for this video

57

00:06:35.242  -->  00:06:38.808
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
