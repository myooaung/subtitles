00:00:00.911  -->  00:00:07.596
In the previous video, we already learn how
to doing network automation using paramiko.

2

00:00:08.297  -->  00:00:16.817
But the case is still very simple, which
is to create only 1 loopback interface.

3

00:00:17.435  -->  00:00:23.540
Now in this video, we are going to
do more complex network automation.

4

00:00:24.042  -->  00:00:30.918
Let’s say we want to create some interface
loopback at once. Let’s just start.

5

00:00:31.464  -->  00:00:33.313
Create a new file,

6

00:00:37.657  -->  00:00:41.816
let’s say the name is paramiko_looping.py.

7

00:00:48.408  -->  00:00:53.344
I will copy paste the script
from the paramiko_basic.py,

8

00:00:53.657  -->  00:00:56.612
and then later we will edit this.

9

00:00:57.755  -->  00:01:02.949
Okay now let’s edit this script
to create some interface at once.

10

00:01:03.528  -->  00:01:08.647
Let’s say we will create
interface loopback 4 until 6.

11

00:01:09.177  -->  00:01:21.045
To do that, we will use looping, for n, this n is
just a variable, you can use anything you want,

12

00:01:21.495  -->  00:01:33.029
in range 4 until 7, if we looping between 4
until 7 like this, the result will be 4 until 6.

13

00:01:33.435  -->  00:01:47.984
Let’s try it on python interpreter first. Here
let’s type the script, for n in range 4 7,

14

00:01:50.000  -->  00:01:51.901
let’s print the n,

15

00:01:52.537  -->  00:02:00.866
Here we can see that the result is
4 until 6. So here 7 minus by 1.

16

00:02:01.626  -->  00:02:09.122
If we type the looping between 4 until
6, the result will be only until 5.

17

00:02:09.546  -->  00:02:14.642
Let’s try it, for n in range 4 6

18

00:02:18.793  -->  00:02:22.903
Here we can see that the result is only until 5,

19

00:02:23.546  -->  00:02:31.272
so if we want to create loopback 4 until
6, we need to looping on 4 until 7.

20

00:02:32.535  -->  00:02:40.000
Here we need to have indentation we can block
the script and then tab in the keyboard.

21

00:02:40.522  -->  00:02:50.181
For the interface name, let’s change it using n,
because we want the name of interface is loopback4

22

00:02:50.181  -->  00:02:57.537
loopback5 and loopback 6, so we
need to change this 3 become n.

23

00:02:58.070  -->  00:03:05.217
We can use f string, f here, and
then here let’s change become n.

24

00:03:05.817  -->  00:03:10.990
So this n will be 4 5 and 6.

25

00:03:11.482  -->  00:03:18.581
Next, for the ip address, we can see that
the ip address is increment by 1 from the

26

00:03:18.581  -->  00:03:29.909
loopback number. Loopback0, the ip address is
10.1.1.1, loopback1 the ip address is 10.1.1.2.

27

00:03:30.279  -->  00:03:40.642
loopback2 the ip address is 10.1.1.3,
and loopback3 the ip address is 10.1.1.4.

28

00:03:41.159  -->  00:03:46.165
So the last number Is the
loopback number increment by 1,

29

00:03:46.746  -->  00:03:52.337
Now we can change this become n plus by 1.

30

00:03:55.817  -->  00:04:03.677
And then here we need to use f string.
So when we create interface loopback4,

31

00:04:03.677  -->  00:04:15.304
the ip address will be 4 plus by 1, which is 5. When
we create loopback5, the ip address will be 5 plus

32

00:04:15.304  -->  00:04:27.096
by 1, which is 6. And when we create loopback6,
the ip address will be 6 plus by 1, which is 7.

33

00:04:27.931  -->  00:04:33.150
Okay we have done here, we using indentation here,

34

00:04:33.322  -->  00:04:40.433
so this script will be looping, but
the output script is outside looping.

35

00:04:41.193  -->  00:04:47.759
Because we want to execute print
output when all configuration is done.

36

00:04:48.442  -->  00:04:54.180
And then here, configure terminal
is also outside the looping,

37

00:04:54.553  -->  00:04:58.525
because we only need to use
configure terminal command

38

00:04:58.525  -->  00:05:06.549
one time. We don’t need to type configure
terminal every time create interface loopback.

39

00:05:07.288  -->  00:05:12.487
save, let’s execute this script.

40

00:05:16.442  -->  00:05:23.479
Ls, here we can see that we have
paramiko_looping_interface.py,

41

00:05:23.977  -->  00:05:30.658
let’s execute this, python
paramiko_looping_interface.py.

42

00:05:33.624  -->  00:05:44.675
just enter enter here, okay this is success
to login to router 1, configure terminal,

43

00:05:44.790  -->  00:05:54.480
and here we are success to configure loopback 4,
the ip address is 10.1.1.5, configure loopback5,

44

00:05:54.480  -->  00:06:04.353
the ip address is 10.1.1.6, and configure
loopback6, the ip address is 10.1.1.7.

45

00:06:04.840  -->  00:06:15.617
okay this is success. Let’s check on router 1,
do show ip interface brief exclude unassign,

46

00:06:19.531  -->  00:06:24.284
here we can see that we have
interface loopback 4 until 6.

47

00:06:25.097  -->  00:06:30.177
Okay so now we are success to
create many interface at once.

48

00:06:31.311  -->  00:06:33.946
Before moving to next video,

49

00:06:33.946  -->  00:06:41.989
let’s remove all interface loopback on
router 1, so here we have loopback 0 until 6,

50

00:06:42.104  -->  00:06:48.946
let’s try to remove all of this
loopback interface, we can use looping.

51

00:06:49.497  -->  00:06:51.648
Let’s just comment this,

52

00:06:51.944  -->  00:06:59.835
to comment multiple line of code, we
can block the script, and then ctrl + /,

53

00:07:03.546  -->  00:07:07.759
Here we can see that all script is become comment.

54

00:07:08.155  -->  00:07:16.334
If we block the script again, and type ctrl +
/ again, the comment will be gone like this.

55

00:07:16.986  -->  00:07:23.310
If I type ctrl + / again, this
script will become comment again.

56

00:07:24.282  -->  00:07:30.934
And then now let’s write a script to
remove interface loopback 0 until 6,

57

00:07:31.466  -->  00:07:42.675
so for n in range 0 7, because we want to looping
until 6, so we need to write until 7 here.

58

00:07:43.193  -->  00:07:54.420
Or actually, we don’t need 0 here, so we can just
type 7. This is will be looping from 0 until 6.

59

00:07:54.906  -->  00:08:03.906
And then here no interface loopback
n. here we need to use f string.

60

00:08:05.722  -->  00:08:13.891
Don’t forget \n here for enter.
Last, let’s sleep for a half second.

61

00:08:14.405  -->  00:08:22.177
Because the configuration is very simple,
so a half second is enough. Save this.

62

00:08:23.288  -->  00:08:31.488
Let’s back to the terminal, execute the script.
Enter enter here,

63

00:08:35.660  -->  00:08:42.260
okay here we can see that we are success
to remove interface loopback 0 until 6.

64

00:08:43.949  -->  00:08:51.104
Let’s check on router 1 again, show
ip interface brief exclude unassign.

65

00:08:51.688  -->  00:08:56.820
Here we can see that we don’t
have loopback 0 until 6 anymore.

66

00:08:57.466  -->  00:09:00.755
Okay I think enough for this video,

67

00:09:00.755  -->  00:09:06.722
in the next video, we are going to learn how to
configure many router at once.

68

00:09:07.110  -->  00:09:10.747
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video.
