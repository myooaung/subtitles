00:00:00.142  -->  00:00:08.990
In the previous video, we already learn about how
to remote cisco router and cisco switch in Cisco Packet Tracer.

2

00:00:09.089  -->  00:00:15.666
There are 2 way, the first way
is using CLI inside the router or switch.

3

00:00:15.666  -->  00:00:23.737
And the second way is using console cable from a
PC. You are free to use which one do you want.

4

00:00:24.141  -->  00:00:31.382
And then, in this video we are going to learn
about basic command of cisco devices. The command

5

00:00:31.382  -->  00:00:40.474
in cisco switch and router will be same. So in
this video, we just will use one of router or switch.

6

00:00:40.673  -->  00:00:47.598
Because if you are familiar with router
let’s say, you will able to configure a switch.

7

00:00:48.122  -->  00:00:53.458
But I think the font is to small,
let’s raise the font size first.

8

00:00:53.761  -->  00:01:01.501
Go to Cisco Packet Tracer and then preference.
Remember that if you use windows, the preference

9

00:01:01.501  -->  00:01:12.356
will be under edit. Here in the font tab, let’s
set the font size of CLI to 20. And then apply.

10

00:01:13.242  -->  00:01:20.816
Okay now let’s go to the PC, open
the terminal. And here let’s just ok.

11

00:01:21.622  -->  00:01:30.356
Okay now the font size is ok. And if we
open the CLI, the font size is also ok.

12

00:01:31.161  -->  00:01:38.182
Okay now we can start learn about basic
command in cisco. But in this case we will just

13

00:01:38.182  -->  00:01:46.657
use CLI tab of the router or switch. So we
don’t need a PC. let’s just delete it for now.

14

00:01:47.202  -->  00:01:52.718
Okay, we will learn about basic cisco
command in the router. Let’s open the router.

15

00:01:53.441  -->  00:02:00.293
The first thing that you need to know is
that in cisco, there is some permission level.

16

00:02:00.531  -->  00:02:07.520
The first level is user level or
user mode. If we are in the user mode,

17

00:02:07.520  -->  00:02:16.416
the symbol will be right angle bracket like this.
Okay so in this case, we are now in the user mode.

18

00:02:17.002  -->  00:02:22.997
In the user mode, the command will be
limited, we just have read permission.

19

00:02:23.481  -->  00:02:29.478
To see any command that we can use in
the user mode, we can type question mark.

20

00:02:30.162  -->  00:02:34.937
Okay this is the commands that
we can use in the user mode.

21

00:02:35.561  -->  00:02:40.877
There is some basic command to
troubleshooting like ping, and traceroute.

22

00:02:42.000  -->  00:02:50.098
And here we also have telnet and ssh
command, this is to remote other devices.

23

00:02:51.123  -->  00:02:54.422
And here if we see, there is no command to

24

00:02:54.422  -->  00:03:00.000
do a configuration. Because
the permission is read only.

25

00:03:00.422  -->  00:03:06.177
If we want to do a configuration,
we need to go to privilege mode.

26

00:03:06.361  -->  00:03:10.517
The privilege mode will be have a full permission.

27

00:03:10.902  -->  00:03:18.000
To go to privilege mode, we can
use command enable. Here we can see

28

00:03:18.000  -->  00:03:26.317
that the symbol change to hash like this. This
is means that we are in the privilege mode.

29

00:03:26.582  -->  00:03:32.880
And remember that privilege mode will be
have full permission. This is means that

30

00:03:32.880  -->  00:03:38.437
the command that we can use here will
be much more than in the user mode.

31

00:03:38.982  -->  00:03:43.302
Let’s type question mark
here. Okay here we can see

32

00:03:43.302  -->  00:03:50.997
any command that we can use in the privilege
mode, and if we see here, we can see a more.

33

00:03:51.321  -->  00:03:58.281
This is means that we still have other command
that we can use. To see the other command,

34

00:03:58.281  -->  00:04:05.357
we can type enter. If we use enter
like this, we can see 1 other command.

35

00:04:06.000  -->  00:04:13.363
We can also use space, if we type space,
we will see many other command at once.

36

00:04:14.042  -->  00:04:22.037
Okay now we can see here that the command in the
privilege mode is much more than in the user mode.

37

00:04:22.743  -->  00:04:29.216
Okay next, in the cisco also
have global configuration mode.

38

00:04:29.402  -->  00:04:36.601
The global configuration mode will be used
to doing a configuration. Remember that

39

00:04:36.601  -->  00:04:43.057
if you want to configuring anything, you
must go to global configuration mode first.

40

00:04:43.422  -->  00:04:49.917
To go to global configuration mode,
we can use command configure terminal.

41

00:04:50.942  -->  00:04:54.697
Okay here we can see a config like this.

42

00:04:54.981  -->  00:04:59.537
This is means that we are in
the global configuration mode.

43

00:05:00.162  -->  00:05:07.197
Now, if we already in the global configuration
mode like this, we can do a configuration.

44

00:05:07.882  -->  00:05:14.242
So once again, always remember that if
you want to doing any configuration,

45

00:05:14.242  -->  00:05:18.337
you need to go to global configuration mode first.

46

00:05:19.182  -->  00:05:25.517
If we want to exit from global
configuration mode, we can just type exit.

47

00:05:26.182  -->  00:05:30.857
Okay now here we can see that
we are in the privilege mode.

48

00:05:31.202  -->  00:05:37.066
And if we try to exit again, we
will be in the user mode like this.

49

00:05:38.003  -->  00:05:43.557
Okay now let’s try to enable
again to go to privilege mode.

50

00:05:44.582  -->  00:05:52.158
I said before that to exit from privilege mode
to the user mode, we can use exit command.

51

00:05:52.802  -->  00:06:02.357
Beside that, we also can use disable command.
Okay here we can see that we are in the user mode.

52

00:06:02.942  -->  00:06:09.236
Okay now let’s enable again, and we
are going to do some configuration.

53

00:06:10.203  -->  00:06:17.920
The first thing that we are going to configure
is a hostname. Hostname is just like the name

54

00:06:17.920  -->  00:06:25.280
of our devices. By default, the hostname
of cisco router will be Router, and the

55

00:06:25.280  -->  00:06:33.280
default hostname of cisco switch will be Switch.
Absolutely this will be confusing if the hostname

56

00:06:33.280  -->  00:06:42.317
of all our router is just Router. This is why we
need to configure the hostname of each devices.

57

00:06:42.864  -->  00:06:50.481
Now let’s try to configure the hostname.
Remember that if we want to configure anything,

58

00:06:50.481  -->  00:06:58.256
we need to go to global configuration mode first.
Here let’s go to global configuration mode,

59

00:06:58.342  -->  00:07:04.640
the command is configure terminal.
Oh I’m sorry, there is a typo here.

60

00:07:05.760  -->  00:07:10.959
Okay here we can see that now we are
in the global configuration mode.

61

00:07:11.575  -->  00:07:14.577
Now let’s configure the hostname.

62

00:07:14.802  -->  00:07:23.737
The command is hostname space the hostname.
In this case the hostname will be Router1.

63

00:07:24.102  -->  00:07:30.277
And when we enter, we can see here that
the hostname will be change like this.

64

00:07:31.462  -->  00:07:38.917
Okay now we have done configuring the hostname.
Next we are going to configure a password.

65

00:07:39.302  -->  00:07:47.238
If you see here, when we go to privilege mode from
user mode, we don’t need to type any password.

66

00:07:47.661  -->  00:07:54.240
Absolutely this is not secure, because
remember that privilege mode is have

67

00:07:54.240  -->  00:08:02.557
full permission. The best practice is, we need
to configure a password to go to privilege mode.

68

00:08:02.982  -->  00:08:10.558
So not anyone can enter privilege mode,
but just some people who know the password.

69

00:08:10.982  -->  00:08:17.680
Okay now let’s configure the password.
From global configuration mode like this,

70

00:08:17.680  -->  00:08:24.849
we can type enable password and
the the password. Let’s say 123.

71

00:08:25.564  -->  00:08:34.096
Okay we have done configuring the password. Now
let’s try to exit. Here we back to privilege mode,

72

00:08:34.242  -->  00:08:38.116
and then exit again to back to user mode.

73

00:08:38.942  -->  00:08:48.601
Okay now we are in the user mode. Now let’s try
to enable. Okay here we can see that now when we

74

00:08:48.601  -->  00:08:57.433
want to go to privilege mode, we need to enter
a password. In this case, the password is 123.

75

00:08:58.501  -->  00:09:03.718
When you type the password, there is
nothing display in the CLI like this,

76

00:09:04.102  -->  00:09:12.558
so just type the password and enter. Okay here
we can see that now we are in the privilege mode.

77

00:09:13.001  -->  00:09:22.178
Now let’s try to use the wrong password. Exit, and
then enable again. I try to use wrong password.

78

00:09:22.461  -->  00:09:30.797
Here we can see that we are unable to go to
privilege mode. Okay let’s use the right password.

79

00:09:31.982  -->  00:09:40.233
Next I will show you the other command. Which
is show running-config. Let’s try it first.

80

00:09:40.769  -->  00:09:48.616
Okay so show running-config is used to see all
of the configuration that we already do.

81

00:09:49.182  -->  00:09:56.777
Okay here we can see many configuration. But
most of these is the default configuration.

82

00:09:57.462  -->  00:10:01.417
But here we can see some of
our configuration before,

83

00:10:01.861  -->  00:10:08.720
here we can see hostname and password
configuration. But here, if we see the

84

00:10:08.720  -->  00:10:16.376
password configuration, we can see the password
clearly. This is absolutely not secure.

85

00:10:16.861  -->  00:10:24.201
So how we can configure the password more
secure? I will show you. But before that,

86

00:10:24.201  -->  00:10:31.217
here we can see more. We can type enter
to see one more line of the configuration,

87

00:10:31.316  -->  00:10:39.040
or we can type space to see many line of
configuration at once. Or if you want to quit,

88

00:10:39.040  -->  00:10:46.118
you can type q. Okay here we are
going to quit from here, so type q.

89

00:10:47.062  -->  00:10:53.536
Okay like I said before, I will show you
how to configure the password more secure.

90

00:10:54.081  -->  00:10:56.916
Let’s go to global configuration mode.

91

00:10:57.302  -->  00:11:05.161
Now to configure the password more secure, we
can use enable secret command. If you remember,

92

00:11:05.161  -->  00:11:13.661
earlier we use enable password command,
but now we will use enable secret command.

93

00:11:14.982  -->  00:11:23.736
Okay so the command is enable secret and then
the password. Let’s say the password is cisco.

94

00:11:24.502  -->  00:11:28.158
Okay now let’s show running-config again.

95

00:11:30.662  -->  00:11:39.568
Here we get an error, why? This is because show
command is the command in privilege mode.

96

00:11:39.727  -->  00:11:45.241
So if we use show command in the global
configuration mode like this, we will

97

00:11:45.241  -->  00:11:53.896
get an error. Now let’s exit to privilege mode
first, and then type show running-config again.

98

00:11:54.742  -->  00:12:01.222
Okay here we can see that we don’t get an
error. But if you want to use show command

99

00:12:01.222  -->  00:12:09.840
in the global configuration mode, we can
use "do". So here do show running-config.

100

00:12:13.921  -->  00:12:21.200
Here we can see that we also don’t get
an error. Okay so remember that if you

101

00:12:21.200  -->  00:12:26.736
want to use show command in the global
configuration mode, we will need a "do".

102

00:12:27.821  -->  00:12:34.557
And also remember that we only need "do"
if we are in the configuration mode,

103

00:12:34.861  -->  00:12:43.500
if we in the privilege mode, we will not need
"do". Let’s try.  Here in the privilege mode,

104

00:12:43.500  -->  00:12:49.061
let’s type do show run. Here we get an error.

105

00:12:52.622  -->  00:13:00.910
Okay next, here we can see that now we have
2 password. There is an enable secret.

106

00:13:00.910  -->  00:13:09.257
Pay attention here, the password of enable secret will
be encrypted like this. So this is more secure.

107

00:13:09.582  -->  00:13:13.857
And remember that if we have 2 password like this,

108

00:13:14.141  -->  00:13:18.358
so there is an enable secret
and also enable password,

109

00:13:18.621  -->  00:13:26.457
the password that will used is the enable
secret. Because enable secret is more secure.

110

00:13:26.981  -->  00:13:34.021
Here let’s try to exit. And then enable
again. Let’s try to use the password

111

00:13:34.021  -->  00:13:43.557
from enable password, the password is 123. Okay
here we are unable to enter privilege mode.

112

00:13:44.162  -->  00:13:51.256
Now let’s try to use the password from
enable secret, the password is cisco.

113

00:13:52.102  -->  00:13:57.337
Okay here we can see that we have
successfully enter the privilege mode.

114

00:13:58.001  -->  00:14:04.681
Next, we are going to learn how to
remove configuration in cisco. Let’s say,

115

00:14:04.681  -->  00:14:11.538
here we want to remove enable password.
Because this configuration is no longer used.

116

00:14:12.822  -->  00:14:18.861
Okay go to global configuration mode.
To remove configuration in cisco,

117

00:14:18.861  -->  00:14:27.477
we just need to type no and then the
command, so no enable password like this.

118

00:14:28.121  -->  00:14:35.437
Now let’s try to show run again, remember that
now we are in the global configuration mode,

119

00:14:35.581  -->  00:14:41.577
so we will need do. So here do show run.

120

00:14:42.321  -->  00:14:47.679
Okay here we can see that the
enable password is no longer exist.

121

00:14:48.282  -->  00:14:52.837
Okay I hope you understand
some basic command in cisco.

122

00:14:53.401  -->  00:14:58.661
I think enough for this video, in the
next video we are going to learn about

123

00:14:58.661  -->  00:15:00.916
cisco basic command again.

124

00:15:01.333  -->  00:15:04.761
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video
