00:00:00.779  -->  00:00:07.117
In the previous video, we already determine
the best prefix and the IP range we will use.

2

00:00:08.154  -->  00:00:13.846
We agreed we will use 10.10.10.0/27.

3

00:00:14.906  -->  00:00:20.469
Next in this video we are going to calculate
the total IP and subnetmask.

4

00:00:21.327  -->  00:00:27.000
The total IP is 2 to the power of 32 minus
by 27.

5

00:00:27.733  -->  00:00:35.098
32 minus by 27 is 5, and 2 to the power of
5 is 32.

6

00:00:35.811  -->  00:00:40.426
So the total ip for prefix /27 is 32.

7

00:00:41.519  -->  00:00:44.545
Next let’s calculate the subnetmask.

8

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:52.417
The formula is 256 minus by total ip, and
the total ip is 32.

9

00:00:53.008  -->  00:00:55.639
256 minus by 32.

10

00:00:55.940  -->  00:00:58.820
The result is 224.

11

00:00:59.634  -->  00:01:06.629
So the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

12

00:01:07.912  -->  00:01:12.000
Okay we have done with total IP and subntmask.

13

00:01:12.426  -->  00:01:16.231
Now let’s calculate the network ip and broadcast
ip.

14

00:01:16.900  -->  00:01:21.137
Remember that network ip is always started
with 0.

15

00:01:21.817  -->  00:01:28.468
The network for the next block subnet is 0
plus by the total ip, which is 32.

16

00:01:28.736  -->  00:01:30.661
The result is 32.

17

00:01:31.509  -->  00:01:38.516
The next block subnet, 32 plus by total ip
again, the result is 64.

18

00:01:39.252  -->  00:01:46.420
Next block subnet, 64 plus by total ip again,
the result is 96.

19

00:01:47.234  -->  00:01:54.426
Next block subnet, 96 plus by total ip again,
the result is 128.

20

00:01:55.296  -->  00:02:06.863
Next block subnet, 128 plus by total ip again,
the result is 160, 160 plus by total ip again,

21

00:02:07.175  -->  00:02:21.427
the result is 192, 192 plus by total ip again,
the result is 224, and so on, until we reach 256

22

00:02:22.030  -->  00:02:29.610
Actually we don’t need to calculate until
256, but for learning, we are going to calculate

23

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:31.607
until 256.

24

00:02:32.299  -->  00:02:38.675
Here 224 plus by total ip again, 32, the result
is 256.

25

00:02:39.545  -->  00:02:42.611
Okay here we already reach 256.

26

00:02:42.611  -->  00:02:44.061
We can stop here.

27

00:02:44.473  -->  00:02:50.716
Next let’s calculate the broadcast ip. 32
minus by 1 is 31.

28

00:02:51.541  -->  00:02:55.580
Here is 63 because 64 minus by 1.

29

00:02:56.862  -->  00:03:10.541
Here 127, here 159, here 191, here 223, and
here 255.

30

00:03:11.756  -->  00:03:15.839
Okay, so this is the block subnet for /27.

31

00:03:16.274  -->  00:03:24.062
Here we have block subnet 1, block subnet
2, block subnet 3, block subnet 4, block subnet 5

32

00:03:24.151  -->  00:03:28.973
block subnet 6, block subnet 7, and block
subnet 8.

33

00:03:29.564  -->  00:03:32.171
So we have 8 block subnet here.

34

00:03:32.650  -->  00:03:35.848
We are free to use which block subnet we want.

35

00:03:36.216  -->  00:03:39.595
Let’s say we are going to use the first
block subnet.

36

00:03:40.097  -->  00:03:49.595
So the network is 10.10.10.0, the third first
number is not change and the last number is

37

00:03:49.595  -->  00:03:52.105
the result of our calculation.

38

00:03:53.945  -->  00:03:58.819
And then the broadcast is 10.10.10.31.

39

00:03:59.410  -->  00:04:03.706
Remember that network ip and broadcast ip
will never can be used.

40

00:04:04.163  -->  00:04:10.484
So the ip that we can use is after network
ip until before broadcast ip.

41

00:04:11.187  -->  00:04:24.265
So the ip range is 10.10.10.1, after 0 is
1, until 10.10.10.30, before 31 is 30.

42

00:04:25.034  -->  00:04:36.794
Okay, so for these 15 pc, we are free to use
the ip from range 10.10.10.1 until 10.10.10.30.

43

00:04:38.043  -->  00:04:43.914
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to practice using

44

00:04:43.914  -->  00:04:45.279
packet tracer.

45

00:04:45.825  -->  00:04:49.047
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
