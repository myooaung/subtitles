00:00:00.418  -->  00:00:05.608
In the previous video, we already calculate
the best prefix we can use for 12 PC,

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:14.160
and we also already determine which IP we will
use, which is 172.16.10.0,

3

00:00:14.565  -->  00:00:17.103
and the prefix is /28.

4

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:22.617
Now in this video, we are going to calculate
the Total IP and Subnetmask

5

00:00:23.371  -->  00:00:25.860
But before continue watching this video,

6

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:29.384
make sure that you already try to calculate by your self.

7

00:00:30.677  -->  00:00:35.683
If don’t, pause the video now, and try to
calculate by your self first.

8

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:39.477
But if you have done, let’s continue to
this video.

9

00:00:40.685  -->  00:00:43.642
Okay now let’s calculate the Total IP.

10

00:00:44.125  -->  00:00:53.217
The formula is 2 to the power of 32 minus
by the prefix, in this case, the prefix is /28

11

00:00:53.878  -->  00:01:00.207
32 minus 28 is 4, so 2 to the power of
4.

12

00:01:00.584  -->  00:01:02.230
The result is 16.

13

00:01:02.791  -->  00:01:07.019
So the total IP for prefix /28 is 16.

14

00:01:08.156  -->  00:01:10.694
Next we are going to calculate subnetmask.

15

00:01:11.177  -->  00:01:15.967
The formula is 256 minus by total IP.

16

00:01:16.550  -->  00:01:26.708
In this case the total IP is 16, so 256 minus
16, the result is 240.

17

00:01:27.802  -->  00:01:32.043
Remember that this number will replace the
last number in the subnetmask.

18

00:01:33.273  -->  00:01:40.922
So the subnetmask for prefix /28 is 255.255.255.240.

19

00:01:45.350  -->  00:01:49.471
Okay now we have successfully calculate the
total IP and the subnetmak.

20

00:01:50.000  -->  00:01:54.648
In the next video we are going to calculate
Network IP and Broadcast IP.

21

00:01:55.281  -->  00:01:58.374
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
