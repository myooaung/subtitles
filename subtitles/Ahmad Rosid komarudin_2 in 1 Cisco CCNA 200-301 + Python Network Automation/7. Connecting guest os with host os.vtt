00:00:00.530  -->  00:00:08.240
In the previous video, we have done configuring
ssh on router1 and router2, so now we can

2

00:00:08.240  -->  00:00:15.280
remote router1 and router2 using ssh from
ubuntu server

3

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:21.410
Next in this video, we are going to connecting
guest os with host os.

4

00:00:21.410  -->  00:00:28.500
What is guest os and host os? We will talk
more about this in this video.

5

00:00:28.500  -->  00:00:36.390
In the previous video, we already create topology
like this, so the ubuntu is connected to switch

6

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:42.949
inside gns3, and also we have two router that
connected to a switch.

7

00:00:42.949  -->  00:00:51.460
And the ubuntu is also connected to the internet.
If you remember, ubuntu have 2 interface,

8

00:00:51.460  -->  00:01:00.370
the first interface is connected to internet,
and the second interface is connected to gns3.

9

00:01:00.370  -->  00:01:08.070
Ubuntu is guest os, so guest os is the virtual
machine.

10

00:01:08.070  -->  00:01:12.229
And then our laptop is host os.

11

00:01:12.229  -->  00:01:21.890
In this case, I use mac, so this mac is host
os. If you use windows on your laptop, so

12

00:01:21.890  -->  00:01:25.759
the windows is host os.

13

00:01:25.759  -->  00:01:33.350
In the previous video, we already learn how
to connecting ubuntu with router inside gns3.

14

00:01:33.350  -->  00:01:41.000
Now in this video, we are going to learn how
to connecting the ubuntu with our laptop.

15

00:01:41.000  -->  00:01:47.600
So we will able to remote the ubuntu server
from our laptop. Let’s just start.

16

00:01:47.600  -->  00:01:54.679
Shutdown the ubuntu server first, here we
can right click and then shutdown.

17

00:01:54.679  -->  00:02:05.520
Next, let’s go to setting, in the network
section, we have network adapter 1 that connected

18

00:02:05.520  -->  00:02:10.619
to internet, this is attached to nat,

19

00:02:10.619  -->  00:02:19.121
And then network adapter2, this is connected
to gns3, here we can see that the attached

20

00:02:19.121  -->  00:02:28.480
to is generice driver and the name is UDPTunnel.
This is changed automatically when we connecting

21

00:02:28.480  -->  00:02:33.739
the ubuntu with router inside gns3.

22

00:02:33.739  -->  00:02:41.250
And then to connecting ubuntu with our laptop,
we need to add one more interface, so let’s

23

00:02:41.250  -->  00:02:43.849
enable network adapter 3.

24

00:02:43.849  -->  00:02:52.580
Attached to is host only adapter, and here,
in the name, this is not selected.

25

00:02:52.580  -->  00:03:01.720
This is means that we don’t have host only
adapter yet. Let’s create it first.

26

00:03:01.720  -->  00:03:13.700
Cancel this, go to file, and then host network
manager. Here we can create.

27

00:03:13.700  -->  00:03:23.780
Here we can see that by default the ip address
is 192.168.56.1, close this.

28

00:03:23.780  -->  00:03:32.890
Now let’s check on our laptop, open the
terminal, ifconfig,

29

00:03:32.890  -->  00:03:40.799
Here we can see that now we have 1 new interface,
which is vboxnet0.

30

00:03:40.799  -->  00:03:52.720
Now let’s configure the ubuntu again, enable
network adapter 3, attached to is host only

31

00:03:52.720  -->  00:04:00.409
adapter, and here we can choose vboxnet0.

32

00:04:00.409  -->  00:04:11.849
Okay we have done here, let’s start the
ubuntu again.

33

00:04:11.849  -->  00:04:28.540
Let’s login, now let’s configure the ip
address that connected to our laptop. Let’s

34

00:04:28.540  -->  00:04:34.880
check the interface first, ip address,

35

00:04:34.880  -->  00:04:43.889
Okay here we only have 2 interface. So the
new interface is not detected yet. Shutdown

36

00:04:43.889  -->  00:04:46.430
the ubuntu first.

37

00:04:46.430  -->  00:04:53.699
Right click here and then choose configure.
In the network section, here we can see that

38

00:04:53.699  -->  00:04:56.360
the interface is still 2,

39

00:04:56.360  -->  00:05:06.030
Let’s also check on the virtualbox,

40

00:05:06.030  -->  00:05:13.250
Okay here the network adapter 3 is not enabled
yet, let’s enable this.

41

00:05:13.250  -->  00:05:22.080
And then in the gns3, we also need to change
this become 3.

42

00:05:22.080  -->  00:05:28.900
Okay we get an error here, this is means that
we can not add new interface when there is

43

00:05:28.900  -->  00:05:31.840
a cable connected to the ubuntu.

44

00:05:31.840  -->  00:05:37.530
Let’s close this, and then remove the cable
first.

45

00:05:37.530  -->  00:05:43.919
Configure again, and then change the network
to 3.

46

00:05:43.919  -->  00:05:52.860
Let’s also configure the template, so if
we import ubuntu in the other project, we

47

00:05:52.860  -->  00:05:56.060
don’t need to configure the network adapter
again.

48

00:05:56.060  -->  00:05:59.710
Right click here and then configure.

49

00:05:59.710  -->  00:06:07.169
Here the interface is still 2, let’s change
this become 3.

50

00:06:07.169  -->  00:06:13.419
Okay now let’s connecting the ubuntu to
the switch again. Remember that we need to

51

00:06:13.419  -->  00:06:20.349
connecting ubuntu with gns3 in the second
interface, first interface is connected to

52

00:06:20.349  -->  00:06:26.569
internet, and the last interface is connected
to our laptop.

53

00:06:26.569  -->  00:06:32.759
Let’s start the ubuntu,

54

00:06:32.759  -->  00:06:45.280
Wait for a minute .
Let’s login, now let’s check the interface,

55

00:06:45.280  -->  00:06:55.389
okay here now we have 1 new interface, which
is enp0s9. This interface is connected to

56

00:06:55.389  -->  00:06:57.699
host os or our laptopo.

57

00:06:57.699  -->  00:07:05.140
We will need to configure the ip address of
this interface based on the ip address in

58

00:07:05.140  -->  00:07:18.789
the virtual box. Let’s check it, here we
can see that the ip address in the virtualbox

59

00:07:18.789  -->  00:07:28.879
is 192.168.56.1, this is the ip address on
the host os or our laptop. Let’s check it,

60

00:07:28.879  -->  00:07:39.470
Ifconfig, here we can see that the ip address
of vboxnet0 is 192.168.56.1

61

00:07:39.470  -->  00:07:49.130
So in the ubuntu server, we need to configure
the ip address become 192.168.56.x, let’s

62

00:07:49.130  -->  00:07:56.979
say we are going to use 2, so the ip address
will be 192.168.56.2.

63

00:07:56.979  -->  00:08:07.810
let’s start, go to ubuntu, sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yml.

64

00:08:07.810  -->  00:08:14.270
type the password.

65

00:08:14.270  -->  00:08:27.230
Now let’s configure for enp0s9.

66

00:08:27.230  -->  00:08:38.570
Save the configuration, ctrl + x , y , enter.

67

00:08:38.570  -->  00:08:49.691
Let’s apply the configuration, sudo netplan
apply, let’s check again, ip address, okay

68

00:08:49.691  -->  00:08:55.160
here we can see that now the ip address of
enp0s9 is 192.168.56.2.

69

00:08:55.160  -->  00:09:10.650
Let’s try ping to host os, ping 192.168.56.1.,
okay this is success.

70

00:09:10.650  -->  00:09:19.010
So now we have done connecting guest os or
virtual machine with host os or our laptop.

71

00:09:19.010  -->  00:09:28.220
Now we can remote the guest os from host os
using ssh. Remember when we install the ubuntu,

72

00:09:28.220  -->  00:09:32.050
we also install ssh server.

73

00:09:32.050  -->  00:09:47.380
Open the terminal, ssh ubuntu and then the
ip address of ubuntu, which is 192.168.56.2.

74

00:09:47.380  -->  00:09:57.440
Okay I get an error here, this is because
I already remote 192.168.56.2 before. Just

75

00:09:57.440  -->  00:09:58.910
remove this.

76

00:09:58.910  -->  00:10:01.520
Let’s remote again,

77

00:10:01.520  -->  00:10:05.210
Okay we are success remote the ubuntu from
our laptop.

78

00:10:05.210  -->  00:10:12.220
I think enough for this video, thank you for
watching and see you on the next video.
