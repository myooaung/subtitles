00:00:00.454  -->  00:00:04.929
In the previous video, we have done configuring
telnet in the router.

2

00:00:05.482  -->  00:00:12.113
But if we see here, we only need to type password
when remote the router using telnet.

3

00:00:12.647  -->  00:00:15.000
We don’t need to use username.

4

00:00:15.800  -->  00:00:16.490
Why?

5

00:00:16.703  -->  00:00:22.959
This is because, when we configure telnet,
we use command login like this.

6

00:00:23.880  -->  00:00:30.445
So remember that if we use command login like
this, we will only need to type password when

7

00:00:30.445  -->  00:00:33.096
remote the cisco devices using telnet.

8

00:00:33.648  -->  00:00:35.661
We don’t need a username.

9

00:00:36.679  -->  00:00:43.450
The question is, how we can configure so when
we remote the route using telnet,

10

00:00:43.799  -->  00:00:46.609
we will need to type username and password?

11

00:00:48.373  -->  00:00:50.531
Okay let’s just try it.

12

00:00:50.957  -->  00:00:55.995
The first thing that we need to do is, create
a username and password.

13

00:00:56.887  -->  00:01:05.129
The command is username and the the user,
let’s say I create user1, then secret,

14

00:01:05.352  -->  00:01:09.888
and the password, let’s say the password is
password1.

15

00:01:10.838  -->  00:01:15.274
So the username is user1 and the password
is password1.

16

00:01:16.689  -->  00:01:23.401
Next let’s go to line vty again, and then
let’s type login local.

17

00:01:24.060  -->  00:01:28.823
This command means that if we want to remote
the router using telnet,

18

00:01:29.017  -->  00:01:31.500
we need to type username and password.

19

00:01:32.120  -->  00:01:37.210
In this case the username will be user1 and
the password is password1,

20

00:01:39.479  -->  00:01:48.704
Now let’s try from the pc, here open telnet
or ssh client.

21

00:01:49.296  -->  00:01:54.059
Choose telnet, type the router Ip address
and then connect.

22

00:01:55.213  -->  00:02:01.453
Okay here we can see that now we need to type
username, the username is user1,

23

00:02:02.742  -->  00:02:05.431
and then here we need to type the password.

24

00:02:05.858  -->  00:02:08.119
The password is password1.

25

00:02:09.312  -->  00:02:13.168
Okay here we are successfully remote the router
using telnet.

26

00:02:13.672  -->  00:02:19.046
And now we need to type username and password
when remote the router using telnet.

27

00:02:20.336  -->  00:02:28.350
May be some of you have a question, how If
we want to have not just 1 user, is that possible?

28

00:02:29.183  -->  00:02:31.724
Yes absolutely, let’s try it.

29

00:02:32.354  -->  00:02:39.324
Here let’s create new user name, let’s
say the user is user2 and the password is

30

00:02:39.324  -->  00:02:40.302
password2.

31

00:02:42.813  -->  00:02:46.316
To verify it, we can use do show run.

32

00:02:50.747  -->  00:02:57.465
Okay here we can see that now we have 2 user, which is user1 and user2.

33

00:02:58.318  -->  00:03:02.560
Now let’s try to login using telnet from
other client.

34

00:03:03.200  -->  00:03:10.424
Open telnet or ssh client, here choose telnet,
put the ip address of the router,

35

00:03:10.657  -->  00:03:18.000
and then connect, okay here we can type the username,
let’s say we will use user2,

36

00:03:18.659  -->  00:03:21.228
and then the password is password2.

37

00:03:25.542  -->  00:03:30.774
Okay here we can see that now we are success
to login using user2.

38

00:03:32.451  -->  00:03:34.940
Okay I think enough for this video

39

00:03:35.270  -->  00:03:38.398
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
