00:00:00.643  -->  00:00:08.380
In the previous video, we already learn how
to import cisco router to gns3, next in this

2

00:00:08.380  -->  00:00:15.730
video, we are going to learn how to install
ubuntu server. we will use the ubuntu server

3

00:00:15.730  -->  00:00:18.470
to doing a network automation.

4

00:00:18.470  -->  00:00:19.490
Let’s just start,

5

00:00:19.490  -->  00:00:27.259
We will install the ubuntu server on virtual
box, if you don’t have virtualbox yet, you

6

00:00:27.259  -->  00:00:28.880
can download it first.

7

00:00:28.880  -->  00:00:40.210
Just go to virtualbox.org, download, and here
we can choose the operating system that you

8

00:00:40.210  -->  00:00:41.350
use.

9

00:00:41.350  -->  00:00:49.070
I will not show you how to install virtualbox,
because this is very simple,

10

00:00:49.070  -->  00:00:54.789
For now, I already have virtualbox installed
on my laptop.

11

00:00:54.789  -->  00:01:00.880
Next, we need to download the ubuntu server
installer.

12

00:01:00.880  -->  00:01:12.280
Go to releases.ubuntu.com/20.04, this is the
latest version of ubuntu when this video created.

13

00:01:12.280  -->  00:01:16.350
Here we can choose the server version.

14

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:20.080
I also already download this ubuntu installer.

15

00:01:20.080  -->  00:01:26.260
Now let’s start learn how to install ubuntu
server on virtualbox.

16

00:01:26.260  -->  00:01:40.400
Click new here to create a new virtual machine,
for the name, let’s say Ubuntu, continue,

17

00:01:40.400  -->  00:01:43.770
I will leave the RAM as default, which is
1gig,

18

00:01:43.770  -->  00:01:56.170
Continue, and here choose create to create
new virtual hard drive.

19

00:01:56.170  -->  00:02:03.740
Choose VDI, continue, dynamic, continue, here
we can choose the size of the virtual hard

20

00:02:03.740  -->  00:02:04.740
drive.

21

00:02:04.740  -->  00:02:12.930
The default is 10gig, this is enough, so let’s
just create.

22

00:02:12.930  -->  00:02:14.540
And done.

23

00:02:14.540  -->  00:02:25.200
Let’s start the virtual machine, when we
start the virtual machine for the first time,

24

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:29.750
we will need to choose the installer,

25

00:02:29.750  -->  00:02:48.070
Add, and then choose the ubuntu installer
that we have downloaded before.

26

00:02:48.070  -->  00:03:00.650
Start,

27

00:03:00.650  -->  00:03:08.740
Okay now we can install the ubuntu server,
choose the language, you can use up and down

28

00:03:08.740  -->  00:03:14.990
arrow in the keyboard, and to go to the next
step, you can use enter.

29

00:03:14.990  -->  00:03:18.710
Here I choose English and then enter,

30

00:03:18.710  -->  00:03:27.401
Here we have a question about ubuntu update,
I choose continue without updating here, and

31

00:03:27.401  -->  00:03:28.401
then enter,

32

00:03:28.401  -->  00:03:35.290
Here we can choose the keyboard type that
we use, this is the right keyboard for me,

33

00:03:35.290  -->  00:03:36.390
so just enter,

34

00:03:36.390  -->  00:03:45.050
Here we can configure the ip address, but
the default is dhcp, for now we will leave

35

00:03:45.050  -->  00:03:48.590
it as default.

36

00:03:48.590  -->  00:03:52.190
Proxy address, leave it blank, done,

37

00:03:52.190  -->  00:03:55.910
Mirror address, leave it default, done,

38

00:03:55.910  -->  00:04:04.930
Here we can choose the partition method, the
default is automatic partition, if you want

39

00:04:04.930  -->  00:04:12.080
to doing a partition by your self, you can
choose custom storage layout.

40

00:04:12.080  -->  00:04:15.640
If you beginner, just leave it default and
done.

41

00:04:15.640  -->  00:04:23.790
We can use tab in the keyboard to go to done,
and then enter.

42

00:04:23.790  -->  00:04:30.450
Here we need to type the username and password,

43

00:04:30.450  -->  00:04:35.290
To move from username to the password you
can use tab,

44

00:04:35.290  -->  00:04:46.660
Here we have a choices to install ssh server
or no, in this case I will install ssh server.

45

00:04:46.660  -->  00:04:50.389
so we can remote the virtual machine from
our laptop.

46

00:04:50.389  -->  00:04:56.280
Let’s check this using space in the keyboard.

47

00:04:56.280  -->  00:05:01.380
Here we can choose some application.

48

00:05:01.380  -->  00:05:05.699
But I will leave it as default.

49

00:05:05.699  -->  00:05:10.470
Okay now the installation process is running.

50

00:05:10.470  -->  00:05:17.270
We just need to wait until the installation
process is done.

51

00:05:17.270  -->  00:05:26.490
Okay now the installation is done, we can
see installation complete here, but in the

52

00:05:26.490  -->  00:05:34.770
buttom, we can see downloading and installing
security update, you can wait until the update

53

00:05:34.770  -->  00:05:46.060
is done, but for now, I will just cancel the
update and reboot.

54

00:05:46.060  -->  00:05:59.000
Okay here the ubuntu is ready, let’s login
using username and password that we have created.

55

00:05:59.000  -->  00:06:01.720
Okay we are success login to the ubuntu server.

56

00:06:01.720  -->  00:06:09.040
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn how to connecting

57

00:06:09.040  -->  00:06:12.570
this ubuntu server with router inside gns3.

58

00:06:12.570  -->  00:06:17.150
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
