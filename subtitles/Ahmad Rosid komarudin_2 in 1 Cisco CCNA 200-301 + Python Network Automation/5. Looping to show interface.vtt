00:00:00.382  -->  00:00:07.573
In the previous video, we already learn about
the differences between send_command and send_config set.

2

00:00:08.086  -->  00:00:16.031
Next, in this video, we are going to learn
how to automate multiple router at once using netmiko.

3

00:00:17.075  -->  00:00:21.320
In this case, we will show the interface on
all router.

4

00:00:22.198  -->  00:00:23.463
Let’s just start.

5

00:00:24.148  -->  00:00:30.163
Create new file, let’s say the name is netmiko_looping.py.

6

00:00:35.147  -->  00:00:40.990
And then let’s copy and paste the script
from netmiko_basic.py.

7

00:00:42.139  -->  00:00:49.750
Here we can see that we define a dictionary
for router 1, if you remember the ip address

8

00:00:49.750  -->  00:01:02.607
of router 1 is 10.10.10.1, router 2 is 10.10.10.2,
router 3 is 10.10.10.3 and others,

9

00:01:03.624  -->  00:01:05.654
Let’s check on on gns3.

10

00:01:06.206  -->  00:01:08.773
Here we can see that we have a pattern.

11

00:01:09.403  -->  00:01:17.032
Router 1 is 10.10.10.1, router 2 is 10.10.10.2
and others.

12

00:01:17.750  -->  00:01:23.949
The differences is only in the last number,
the first 3 number is same,

13

00:01:24.899  -->  00:01:32.473
So here, we can do looping like this, for
n in range 1,6,

14

00:01:32.937  -->  00:01:37.634
This is means that we do looping on number
1 until 5.

15

00:01:38.562  -->  00:01:42.097
And then let’s add an indentation to this
script.

16

00:01:42.904  -->  00:01:46.309
So this script will become part of looping.

17

00:01:47.668  -->  00:01:56.172
Next, we can change this number become n,
so we need to use f string here, and then

18

00:01:56.172  -->  00:01:58.203
change this become n.

19

00:02:01.618  -->  00:02:06.898
And then for the router variable, let’s
just change this become r,

20

00:02:08.467  -->  00:02:12.000
and then here we also need to change it to r.

21

00:02:13.210  -->  00:02:15.067
Okay we have done here,

22

00:02:15.620  -->  00:02:21.633
the device type of all router will be same,
the ip address will be different, the username

23

00:02:21.998  -->  00:02:29.919
and password also will be same on all router,
and then connect to the router, this is will

24

00:02:29.919  -->  00:02:38.382
be based on the looping, when the n is 1,
so we connect to router 1, when the n is 2,

25

00:02:38.603  -->  00:02:41.702
so we connect to router 2, and others.

26

00:02:42.674  -->  00:02:48.484
And then here, let’s say we just want to
send command to show the interface,

27

00:02:49.379  -->  00:02:55.944
so we can comment this script, and then uncomment
this script,

28

00:02:56.949  -->  00:03:00.322
Let’s also add exclude unassign here.

29

00:03:06.775  -->  00:03:11.360
And then here, we also need to change this
variable to r.

30

00:03:12.620  -->  00:03:15.064
Last, we print the output.

31

00:03:15.749  -->  00:03:18.000
Let’s move this script to the end,

32

00:03:19.437  -->  00:03:23.787
Okay so now we just need 16 lines of code.

33

00:03:24.870  -->  00:03:28.580
This is very simple compared to paramiko.

34

00:03:29.221  -->  00:03:30.367
Save this,

35

00:03:30.809  -->  00:03:39.943
Back to the terminal, ls, here we can see
that we have netmiko_looping.py, let’s execute

36

00:03:39.943  -->  00:03:41.071
this script.

37

00:03:43.281  -->  00:03:52.586
Okay here we can see that router 1 is success,
router 2 success, router 3 success, router 4

38

00:03:52.586  -->  00:03:56.547
success and router 5 also success.

39

00:03:57.542  -->  00:04:05.608
But here we can see that we don’t have divider
between router, so the output is not too good.

40

00:04:06.293  -->  00:04:10.806
Back to sublime, and let’s add a divider.

41

00:04:15.778  -->  00:04:21.000
Save, let’s execute the script again,

42

00:04:21.705  -->  00:04:29.012
okay router 1 success, router 2, router 3, router 4,
and router 5.

43

00:04:30.095  -->  00:04:36.000
Okay so now we are success to remote multiple
router at once using netmiko.

44

00:04:36.778  -->  00:04:39.208
I think enough for this video

45

00:04:39.540  -->  00:04:42.900
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
