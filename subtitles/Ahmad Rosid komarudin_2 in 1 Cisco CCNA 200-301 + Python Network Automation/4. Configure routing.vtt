00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:04.581
Okay, now we have done configuring ip address
on router 1 and router 2.

2

00:00:05.127  -->  00:00:13.318
Next in this video, we are going to configure routing so all pc
will able to communicate with all servers.

3

00:00:13.951  -->  00:00:22.386
For now, all pc should not able to communicate
with servers. Why? Because router 1 don’t have a

4

00:00:22.386  -->  00:00:31.547
route to go to server, and router 2 also don’t
have a route to go to the pc. Let’s check it.

5

00:00:33.461  -->  00:00:43.712
Do show ip route, here we can see that
router 1 only have route to 10.10.10.0/30,

6

00:00:44.021  -->  00:00:51.879
vlan 10, vlan 20, and vlan 30, router 1
don’t have a route to go to the server yet.

7

00:00:52.546  -->  00:00:57.000
Let’s also check on router 2, do show ip route,

8

00:00:59.746  -->  00:01:10.035
here we can see that router 2 only have route
about 10.10.10.0/30 and 192.168.1.0/24,

9

00:01:10.444  -->  00:01:16.062
router 2 don’t have a route to go
to vlan 10, vlan 20, and vlan 30.

10

00:01:16.809  -->  00:01:21.646
This is why we need to configure
routing on router 1 and router 2.

11

00:01:22.272  -->  00:01:29.571
You are free to use any routing protocol,
you can use static routing, eigrp, or ospf.

12

00:01:30.181  -->  00:01:38.271
But in this case, I will use ospf. Let’s
start with router 1. Router ospf 1,

13

00:01:38.677  -->  00:01:48.944
let’s advertise all connected network, here router 1 have
4 connected network, let’s start with 10.10.10.0,

14

00:01:49.437  -->  00:02:04.544
so network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.3 area 0, remember
that for prefix /30, the wildcard bits is 0.0.0.3,

15

00:02:05.059  -->  00:02:09.000
next let’s advertise the network of all vlan.

16

00:02:09.392  -->  00:02:22.293
Let’s start with vlan 10, network 192.168.10.0
0.0.0.255 area 0, next for vlan 20,

17

00:02:22.569  -->  00:02:40.727
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0, last for
vlan 30, network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.

18

00:02:41.688  -->  00:02:50.219
Okay now we have done configuring ospf on
router 1, next let’s configure ospf on router 2.

19

00:02:52.249  -->  00:03:01.136
Router ospf and then the id, you are free to
use any number, in this case I will also use 1.

20

00:03:01.962  -->  00:03:05.502
Next let’s advertise all connected network,

21

00:03:06.134  -->  00:03:09.954
in this case, router 2 have 2 connected network,

22

00:03:10.512  -->  00:03:22.955
let’s start with 10.10.10.0 first,
so network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.3 area 0,

23

00:03:23.836  -->  00:03:36.749
next let’s advertise the network that connected
to server, network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0.

24

00:03:38.808  -->  00:03:44.149
Okay now we have done configuring
ospf on router 1 and router 2.

25

00:03:44.729  -->  00:03:48.977
Let’s check the routing table, let’s check on
router 1 first, do show ip route,

26

00:03:49.617  -->  00:04:00.000
here we can see that router 1 already have route to go to the
server, and the label is O, this is means ospf.

27

00:04:02.888  -->  00:04:12.223
Let’s also check on router 2, do show ip
route, here we can see that router 2 also

28

00:04:12.223  -->  00:04:21.354
have route to vlan 10, 20, and 30. And
the label is also O, this is means ospf.

29

00:04:22.157  -->  00:04:28.484
So now, all pc should be able to
communicate with all servers. Let’s test it.

30

00:04:29.210  -->  00:04:34.315
Vlan 20 to server 1, failed, test again,

31

00:04:36.261  -->  00:04:47.080
and success, vlan 30 to server 1, success,
vlan 10 to server 2, failed, test again,

32

00:04:48.271  -->  00:04:55.503
okay here success, vlan 10 to server 3,
failed, test again, okay this is also success.

33

00:04:56.488  -->  00:05:01.432
Okay so now all pc is able to
communicate with all servers.

34

00:05:02.147  -->  00:05:09.159
I think enough for this video, in the next video,
we are going to start learning about access list.

35

00:05:09.597  -->  00:05:12.968
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video.
