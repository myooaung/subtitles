00:00:00.464  -->  00:00:05.830
In the previous video, we already learn about
the concept of etherchannel.

2

00:00:06.236  -->  00:00:14.508
The point is, etherchannel is used to grouping
multiple physical interface become 1 logical interface.

3

00:00:15.175  -->  00:00:18.967
So spanning tree will not block any interface.

4

00:00:19.605  -->  00:00:27.471
And the bandwidth now become 300mega, because
100mega multiply by 3.

5

00:00:28.790  -->  00:00:40.624
To configure an etherchannel, we have 3 options,
first, we can use LACP, LACP is an open standard,

6

00:00:41.030  -->  00:00:48.020
this is means that LACP can used in all networking
vendor, not just cisco.

7

00:00:50.702  -->  00:00:57.677
The second options is PAGP, PAGP is a cisco
proprietary.

8

00:00:58.214  -->  00:01:03.594
This is means that we only can configure PAGP
in cisco switch.

9

00:01:04.536  -->  00:01:12.619
If we have cisco switch meet with hp switch
let’s say, so we can not use PAGP, we must

10

00:01:12.619  -->  00:01:14.590
use LACP.

11

00:01:15.199  -->  00:01:22.497
But if cisco switch meet with cisco switch,
we can use PAGP or LACP.

12

00:01:24.236  -->  00:01:28.666
And the last option is, we can use layer 3
etherchannel.

13

00:01:29.144  -->  00:01:32.031
This is also an open protocol.

14

00:01:32.640  -->  00:01:37.786
But for now let’s just focus on lacp and
pagp first.

15

00:01:38.235  -->  00:01:43.174
We will learn about layer 3 etherchannel later
in the next video.

16

00:01:44.218  -->  00:01:45.487
Let’s just start.

17

00:01:47.734  -->  00:01:58.358
Open swith 0, enable, configure terminal, and
then go to the interface, in this case the

18

00:01:58.358  -->  00:02:05.912
interface that connected to switch 1 is fa0/1
until fa0/3.

19

00:02:07.463  -->  00:02:12.085
So interface range fa0/1-3.

20

00:02:13.360  -->  00:02:18.333
The first thing that we need to do is configure
the interface as trunk.

21

00:02:19.087  -->  00:02:21.508
So switchport mode trunk.

22

00:02:23.668  -->  00:02:30.428
Okay now fa0/1 until fa0/3 is already trunk.

23

00:02:31.370  -->  00:02:34.523
Next, let’s configure the etherchannel.

24

00:02:35.000  -->  00:02:42.305
The command is channel-group question mark,
here we have an option 1 until 6,

25

00:02:42.653  -->  00:02:45.000
this is the etherchannel id.

26

00:02:45.768  -->  00:02:54.753
In this case let’s say I use 1, then mode,
and then question mark again, okay here we

27

00:02:54.753  -->  00:02:57.460
have some options for the mode.

28

00:02:58.155  -->  00:03:04.902
If we want to configure etherchannel LACP,
the option is active and passive,

29

00:03:05.670  -->  00:03:13.021
but if we want to configure etherchannel PAGP, the option
is auto and desirable.

30

00:03:13.876  -->  00:03:21.567
In this video, we are going to configure lacp
first, so the option is active and passive.

31

00:03:22.553  -->  00:03:29.858
If we use mode active, so the switch will
invite the neighbor to activate the etherchannel.

32

00:03:30.524  -->  00:03:37.162
But if we use passive, this is means that
the switch will wait for invitation from the

33

00:03:37.162  -->  00:03:38.205
neighbor.

34

00:03:39.249  -->  00:03:44.202
So we need to configure at least 1 switch
to become active.

35

00:03:45.303  -->  00:03:53.095
For example switch 0 active and switch 1 passive,
the etherchannel will up.

36

00:03:54.081  -->  00:04:01.841
But if we configure switch 0 passive and switch 1
also passive, the etherchannel will not up.

37

00:04:02.522  -->  00:04:07.641
How if we configure switch 0 to active and
switch 1 also active?

38

00:04:08.395  -->  00:04:11.188
Absolutely the etherchannel also up.

39

00:04:12.594  -->  00:04:16.999
Okay, let’s say here we want to configure
switch 0 to active.

40

00:04:18.303  -->  00:04:22.337
Now we have done configuring etherchannel
on switch 0.

41

00:04:23.062  -->  00:04:26.861
Next let’s configure etherchannel in the
switch 1.

42

00:04:28.745  -->  00:04:37.053
Enable, configure terminal, and then interface
range fa0/1-3.

43

00:04:38.357  -->  00:04:44.856
First let’s configure the interface to trunk,
so switchport mode trunk.

44

00:04:45.755  -->  00:04:56.403
Next let’s configure the etherchannel, channel-group,
and for the id, we must use the same id as switch 0.

45

00:04:56.852  -->  00:05:01.848
In the switch 0 we use id 1, so here
we need to use 1.

46

00:05:03.109  -->  00:05:10.322
For the mode, because switch 0 is active, so
here we can use active or passive.

47

00:05:13.206  -->  00:05:15.184
Let’s try to use passive.

48

00:05:17.445  -->  00:05:23.219
Okay now we have done configuring etherchannel,
let’s fast forward time.

49

00:05:24.857  -->  00:05:28.925
Okay here we can see that now all interface
is green.

50

00:05:29.679  -->  00:05:34.339
This is means that there is no interface blocked
by spanning tree.

51

00:05:35.223  -->  00:05:40.549
For the testing, we can use command do show
etherchannel summary.

52

00:05:43.505  -->  00:05:51.946
Here we can se po1, po is port channel, and
1 is the id that we have configured.

53

00:05:53.381  -->  00:06:01.726
Here we have uppercase S and uppercase U.
Uppercase s means layer 2, and uppercase u

54

00:06:01.726  -->  00:06:03.208
means in use.

55

00:06:06.396  -->  00:06:15.077
The protocol is LACP, and the port is fa0/1
until fa0/3.

56

00:06:15.584  -->  00:06:23.118
And all of the interface is uppercase P, uppercase
P means in port channel.

57

00:06:24.031  -->  00:06:27.495
Okay, so the etherchannel in switch 0 is ok.

58

00:06:28.118  -->  00:06:30.541
Let’s also check on switch 1.

59

00:06:31.179  -->  00:06:43.492
Do show etherchannel summary, here we can
see po1, uppercase S and uppercase U, uppercase S

60

00:06:43.492  -->  00:06:47.380
means layer 2, and uppercase U means in
use.

61

00:06:47.975  -->  00:06:58.207
The protocol is LACP, the interface is fa0/1-3,
and all of the interface is uppercase P,

62

00:06:58.584  -->  00:07:01.580
uppercase P means in port channel.

63

00:07:02.826  -->  00:07:05.720
Okay so now the etherchannel is up.

64

00:07:06.532  -->  00:07:11.660
Let’s add 2 pc to make sure that the etherchannel
is really ok.

65

00:07:19.487  -->  00:07:35.157
Configure the ip address, here 192.168.1.1,
and then this is 192.168..1.2.

66

00:07:39.360  -->  00:07:41.832
Now let’s test the ping.

67

00:07:48.267  -->  00:07:51.645
Okay here we can see that the ping is success.

68

00:07:52.674  -->  00:07:58.685
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to learn how to configure

69

00:07:58.685  -->  00:08:00.983
etherchannel pagp.

70

00:08:01.577  -->  00:08:05.064
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
