00:00:00.077  -->  00:00:05.534
In the previous video, we already learn
how to import cisco router to gns3,

2

00:00:05.954  -->  00:00:12.963
we use cisco 7200 series. But I
think this series is to heavy.

3

00:00:13.463  -->  00:00:20.660
So in this case, I will try to use
the lighter series, which is 2691.

4

00:00:21.208  -->  00:00:25.530
To download it, we can just
browse download cisco image,

5

00:00:25.736  -->  00:00:32.187
and then open the first website.
Here we can download 2691.

6

00:00:36.630  -->  00:00:49.013
Now let’s back to gns3 and learn how to import
cisco 2691 series. Go to preference, ios routers,

7

00:00:49.746  -->  00:00:58.328
click new to import new router, browse
to the image that we have download,

8

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:13.675
yes, next, next the default ram is 192.

9

00:01:14.343  -->  00:01:26.155
Next, here for the slot, let’s add 4t, here we
also have 1fetx, this is means 1 fast ethernet,

10

00:01:26.572  -->  00:01:37.787
and 4t means 4 serial interface. Let’s just
choose 4t. Here we can just type any number,

11

00:01:38.121  -->  00:01:49.651
let’s say 1 2 1, next, let’s find
the idle pc, wait for a minute here.

12

00:01:57.000  -->  00:01:58.373
Okay done.

13

00:02:02.780  -->  00:02:14.155
Now we have 7200 and 2691 series. Let’s
import 2691 series to the project.

14

00:02:17.656  -->  00:02:25.982
Connecting router 1 to router 2, here we have
many interfaces, we have fast ethernet,

15

00:02:25.982  -->  00:02:32.064
and we also have serial interface.
Let’s choose fast ethernet.

16

00:02:33.411  -->  00:02:38.424
Start the router, right click
on the router and then start,

17

00:02:40.062  -->  00:02:45.000
or we also click on this icon
to start all router at once.

18

00:02:47.165  -->  00:02:50.479
Okay now router 1 and router 2 is started,

19

00:02:51.120  -->  00:03:04.235
let’s configure the ip address, router 1 will be
10.10.10.1/24 and router 2 will be 10.10.10.2/24.

20

00:03:05.561  -->  00:03:07.470
Let’s start with route1,

21

00:03:17.758  -->  00:03:27.056
configure terminal, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,

22

00:03:29.161  -->  00:03:36.311
and then the ip address is
10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0,

23

00:03:38.408  -->  00:03:40.464
next for router 2,

24

00:03:45.280  -->  00:03:52.438
configure terminal, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,

25

00:03:52.739  -->  00:04:00.263
and then the ip address is
10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0.

26

00:04:01.535  -->  00:04:03.428
let’s test the connection,

27

00:04:04.073  -->  00:04:10.998
Ping from router 2 to router 1, do ping 10.10.10.1,

28

00:04:13.416  -->  00:04:15.478
Okay this is success.

29

00:04:15.906  -->  00:04:21.314
I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to learn how

30

00:04:21.314  -->  00:04:29.566
to install virtual machine ubuntu. We will
need linux ubuntu to do network automation.

31

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:33.617
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video.
