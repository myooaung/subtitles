00:00:00.079  -->  00:00:06.062
In the previous video, we already done doing
subnetting calculation with different case.

2

00:00:06.763  -->  00:00:15.206
Next in this video, we are going to learn about the
concept of block subnet. In the previous video,

3

00:00:15.206  -->  00:00:22.834
I said that block subnet is just like a room. This
is the result of our calculation before.

4

00:00:23.227  -->  00:00:33.901
Here we have block subnet 1, 2, 3 and so on. We can imagine
that each block subnet is used in each room .

5

00:00:34.356  -->  00:00:41.839
Let’s say we have a building and
in the building we have room 1, 2 and 3.

6

00:00:42.221  -->  00:00:46.813
So we can use the first
block subnet for room number 1,

7

00:00:47.034  -->  00:00:53.409
second block subnet for room number 2,
and third block subnet for room number 3.

8

00:00:54.086  -->  00:01:02.646
Let’s say in the room number 1 there are 15 pc,
room number 2 also has 15 pc, and room number

9

00:01:02.646  -->  00:01:11.840
3 also has 15 pc. 15 pc in the room number
1 can use ip range from first block subnet,

10

00:01:12.431  -->  00:01:18.000
15 pc in the room number 2 can use
ip range from second block subnet,

11

00:01:18.535  -->  00:01:25.446
and finally 15 pc in the room number 3 can
use ip range from the third block subnet.

12

00:01:25.975  -->  00:01:31.514
One thing that you need to remember is that
by default, each block subnet can't

13

00:01:31.514  -->  00:01:43.058
communicate each others. So let’s say here we have
PC 1 and PC 2. The ip address of PC 1 is 10.10.10.10

14

00:01:43.403  -->  00:01:50.115
and the ip address of PC 2 is 10.10.10.20/27.

15

00:01:51.739  -->  00:01:58.328
In this case, PC 1 and PC 2 can communicate each others, why?

16

00:01:58.586  -->  00:02:05.452
Because these 2 pc is in the same block subnet. Which is first block subnet.

17

00:02:05.655  -->  00:02:12.831
Here we can see that 10 is in the first block
subnet, and 20 also in the first block subnet.

18

00:02:13.255  -->  00:02:20.738
Okay, so PC 1 can communicate with PC 2
because they are in the same block subnet.

19

00:02:21.379  -->  00:02:32.117
But how if the ip address of PC 1 is
10.10.10.15/27, and the ip address of PC 2 is

20

00:02:32.117  -->  00:02:44.577
10.10.10.50/27? In this case, these 2 pc can
not communicate each others. Why?

21

00:02:44.577  -->  00:02:51.680
Because PC 1 is in the first block subnet but
PC 2 in the second block subnet.

22

00:02:52.942  -->  00:02:56.375
Okay let’s try it in the Cisco Packet Tracer.

23

00:02:57.000  -->  00:03:04.455
Here we will configure the ip address as our
calculation before. We will use the first case first.

24

00:03:04.578  -->  00:03:19.452
The ip address of PC 1 is 10.10.10.10/27
and the ip address of PC 2 is 10.10.10.20/27.

25

00:03:20.308  -->  00:03:27.132
Okay let’s configure the ip address of
PC 1. Go to dekstop, ip configuration,

26

00:03:27.508  -->  00:03:39.291
the ip address is 10.10.10.10,
the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

27

00:03:39.680  -->  00:03:47.298
remember that this subnetmask is the result
of our calculation before for prefix /27.

28

00:03:48.332  -->  00:03:57.791
Okay next, let’s configure the Ip address
of PC 2. The ip address is 10.10.10.20,

29

00:03:58.043  -->  00:04:09.120
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.
close this, and open the command prompt.

30

00:04:09.674  -->  00:04:19.520
Here let’s try to ping to the PC 1. Which is
10.10.10.10, here we can see that the ping

31

00:04:19.520  -->  00:04:22.948
from PC 2 to PC 1 is successful.

32

00:04:23.526  -->  00:04:34.178
Next, let’s try the second case, so the
ip address of PC 1 will be 10.10.10.15/27,

33

00:04:34.375  -->  00:04:47.865
and the ip address of PC 2 will be 10.10.10.50/27.
Go to PC 1, here let’s change the ip address to 15.

34

00:04:48.160  -->  00:04:55.096
Next go to PC 2, and change this to 50.

35

00:04:55.932  -->  00:05:02.724
Now let’s ping to PC 1. Which is 10.10.10.15.

36

00:05:04.984  -->  00:05:15.218
Okay here we can see that the result is request timeout. This is means that PC 2 and PC 1 can not communicate each others.

37

00:05:16.197  -->  00:05:22.849
Okay I hope you now understand the concept
of block subnet. Remember that by default

38

00:05:22.849  -->  00:05:29.458
each block subnet can not communicate each
others. But some of you may be have a question,

39

00:05:29.865  -->  00:05:36.142
how if we want to each block subnet can
communicate each others? For that case,

40

00:05:36.142  -->  00:05:43.378
we will need additional device, which is router.
We will learn about router in the next video.

41

00:05:44.339  -->  00:05:50.757
Okay I think enough for this video. Thankyou
for watching and see you on the next video.
