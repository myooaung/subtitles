00:00:00.893  -->  00:00:06.410
In the previous video, we already learn how
to configure multiple router at once,

2

00:00:06.795  -->  00:00:12.980
which is we configure interface loopback0 on router 1
until router 5.

3

00:00:13.795  -->  00:00:20.454
But the problem is, we still need to check
the interface on each router one by one.

4

00:00:21.466  -->  00:00:28.010
Now in this video, we are going to create
a network automation script to check the interface

5

00:00:28.010  -->  00:00:30.214
on all router at once.

6

00:00:30.850  -->  00:00:39.955
This is easy, here after configuring ip address,
we can type a command to show interface,

7

00:00:40.726  -->  00:00:46.505
so here show ip interface brief exclude unassign.

8

00:00:47.643  -->  00:00:51.545
Don’t forget to use \n or enter here.

9

00:00:52.961  -->  00:00:58.440
Let’s also print a divider here, so the
output will be good.

10

00:01:02.704  -->  00:01:09.684
And for the loopback, let’s try to create
loopback1, and the ip address let’s say

11

00:01:09.684  -->  00:01:16.608
10.2.1.x. Here we also need to use time sleep.

12

00:01:21.956  -->  00:01:25.780
Save, back to terminal,

13

00:01:27.000  -->  00:01:28.948
Let’s execute the script.

14

00:01:33.364  -->  00:01:35.258
Just enter enter here.

15

00:01:39.119  -->  00:01:41.693
Here we can see that we get an error.

16

00:01:41.962  -->  00:01:44.183
Invalid input detected.

17

00:01:44.891  -->  00:01:46.364
Why this is error?

18

00:01:46.642  -->  00:01:53.031
Because now we are in the configuration mode,
so we need to use do.

19

00:01:53.810  -->  00:02:05.073
Let’s add do here, and then let’s say
we will create loopback 2, and the ip address is 3.

20

00:02:06.549  -->  00:02:14.108
Save, back to terminal, and then let’s execute
the script again.

21

00:02:14.762  -->  00:02:16.582
Just enter enter here.

22

00:02:19.995  -->  00:02:21.794
Okay this is success.

23

00:02:22.332  -->  00:02:28.726
We are success to configure loopback2 with
ip address 10.3.1.1 on router 1,

24

00:02:29.183  -->  00:02:34.821
and here we can see that we already have loopback0 until
loopback2 on router  1.

25

00:02:36.000  -->  00:02:42.089
Router 2, we also have loopback0 until loopback2,
the ip address is correct

26

00:02:43.155  -->  00:02:49.271
Router 3, we also have loopback0 until 2, the
ip address is correct.

27

00:02:49.845  -->  00:02:52.623
Router 5 is also correct.

28

00:02:53.582  -->  00:02:59.284
Okay so now we are success to doing looping
to show interface on all router.

29

00:03:00.000  -->  00:03:02.295
I think enough for this video

30

00:03:02.537  -->  00:03:05.915
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
