1

00:00:00.473  -->  00:00:03.851
Okay now we have 3 router in the topology,

2

00:00:04.165  -->  00:00:12.996
in this video, we will configure eigrp so pc 1, pc 2 and pc 3 will able to communicate each others.

3

00:00:13.824  -->  00:00:21.425
Remember that the concept of dynamic routing
is each router must advertise their connected network.

4

00:00:22.084  -->  00:00:32.419
In the router 2, we add new ip address in fa1/0,
so absolutely router 2 have new connected network.

5

00:00:33.066  -->  00:00:41.580
So in the router 2, we must add new configuration,
which is advertise the new network to eigrp.

6

00:00:42.746  -->  00:00:49.808
In router 1, we don’t add an ip address,
so we don’t have new connected network here,

7

00:00:50.396  -->  00:00:54.412
so we don’t need to add new configuration
on router 1.

8

00:00:55.275  -->  00:01:03.574
In router 3 we don’t configure eigrp yet,
so absolutely we need to add new configuration here.

9

00:01:05.216  -->  00:01:10.554
So now we need to add new configuration on
router 2 and router 3.

10

00:01:11.309  -->  00:01:13.238
Let’s start with router 2.

11

00:01:14.905  -->  00:01:27.737
Go to router eigrp 10, and then advertise
the new network, which is 10.20.20.0, so network

12

00:01:27.737  -->  00:01:30.604
10.20.20.0.

13

00:01:32.585  -->  00:01:38.759
Okay now we have done on router 2, next let’s
configure on router 3.

14

00:01:39.347  -->  00:01:48.151
Here we will advertise 2 network, which is
10.20.20.0 and 192.168.3.0,

15

00:01:49.729  -->  00:02:01.408
Router eigrp 10, network 10.20.20.0 and network
192.168.3.0.

16

00:02:02.663  -->  00:02:09.868
Okay now we have done! let’s check the neighbor,
do show ip eigrp neighbor.

17

00:02:10.937  -->  00:02:15.976
Here we can see that router 3 have 1 neighbor,
which is router 2.

18

00:02:16.496  -->  00:02:21.665
So now the eigrp between router 2 and router 3
is already up.

19

00:02:23.165  -->  00:02:32.862
Let’s check the routing table, do show ip
route, here we can see that router 3 automatically

20

00:02:32.862  -->  00:02:45.086
have route to 192.168.1.0 which is the network
of pc 1 and 192.168.2.0 which is the network of pc 2.

21

00:02:45.997  -->  00:02:52.058
Let’s also check on router 1, enable, show
ip route.

22

00:02:53.087  -->  00:03:04.477
Here we can see that now in router 1 automatically
have route to pc 3, which is 192.168.3.0/24.

23

00:03:05.575  -->  00:03:11.606
Now pc 1, pc 2, and pc 3 should be able to communicate
each others.

24

00:03:12.136  -->  00:03:13.214
Let’s try it.

25

00:03:13.636  -->  00:03:22.134
Let’s test from pc 1 to pc 3, failed, test
again, and here success.

26

00:03:22.790  -->  00:03:29.415
Let’s test from pc 2 to pc 3, okay here the
result is also success.

27

00:03:30.601  -->  00:03:37.454
Okay so now we have done configuring eigrp,
so all pc can communicate each others.

28

00:03:38.023  -->  00:03:40.367
I think enough for this video

29

00:03:40.661  -->  00:03:43.930
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
