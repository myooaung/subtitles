00:00:00.426  -->  00:00:07.648
Okay, have you done configuring this topology
so all pc is able to communicate with all server?

2

00:00:08.617  -->  00:00:10.995
Now let’s see the solution.

3

00:00:11.482  -->  00:00:15.910
Let’s start with switch 1, we will configure
vlan here.

4

00:00:16.567  -->  00:00:29.068
Go to CLI, enable, configure terminal, let’s
create the vlan first, vlan 10, vlan 20,

5

00:00:29.384  -->  00:00:31.063
and vlan 30.

6

00:00:32.109  -->  00:00:39.957
Next let’s configure the interface that
connected to the pc. This is fa0/2,

7

00:00:39.957  -->  00:00:42.585
and this is fa0/3.

8

00:00:43.314  -->  00:00:49.424
So fa0/2 and fa0/3 will be in vlan 10.

9

00:00:50.323  -->  00:00:58.932
Interface range fa0/2-3, switchport mode access,
switchport access vlan 10.

10

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:07.902
And then for vlan 20, this is fa0/4, and this
is fa0/5.

11

00:01:08.620  -->  00:01:13.822
So fa0/4-5 will be in the vlan 20.

12

00:01:14.892  -->  00:01:24.078
Interface range fa0/4-5, switchport mode access,
switchport access vlan 20.

13

00:01:24.783  -->  00:01:32.868
Next for vlan 30, this is fa0/6, and this
is fa0/7,

14

00:01:33.549  -->  00:01:39.696
so interface fa0/6-7 will be in the vlan 30.

15

00:01:41.008  -->  00:01:47.274
Interface range fa0/6-7, switchport mode access.

16

00:01:47.274  -->  00:01:50.007
Switchport access vlan 30.

17

00:01:50.481  -->  00:01:56.115
Last, let’s configure the interface that
connected to router 1 become trunk.

18

00:01:58.898  -->  00:02:03.770
Interface fa0/1, switchport mode trunk.

19

00:02:04.901  -->  00:02:18.722
Okay now we have done on switch 1, next let’s
configure router 1, CLI, enable, configure terminal,

20

00:02:19.062  -->  00:02:22.157
let’s configure the ip address
of vlan first.

21

00:02:23.007  -->  00:02:27.833
Here the light is still red so we need to
enable the interface.

22

00:02:28.478  -->  00:02:33.000
Interface fa0/0, no shutdown.

23

00:02:33.821  -->  00:02:36.291
Okay now the light is green.

24

00:02:37.117  -->  00:02:40.422
Now let’s configure the ip address of vlan.

25

00:02:40.884  -->  00:02:54.990
Let’s start with vlan 10, interface fa0/0.10,
encapsulation dot1q 10, ip address 192.168.10.1

26

00:02:55.914  -->  00:02:59.190
255.255.255.0

27

00:03:00.138  -->  00:03:10.917
Next let’s configure for vlan 20, interface
fa0/0.20, encapsulation dot1q 20,

28

00:03:11.087  -->  00:03:17.540
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0.

29

00:03:18.549  -->  00:03:29.543
Last let’s configure for vlan 30, interface
fa0/0.30, encapsulation dot1q 30,

30

00:03:29.871  -->  00:03:36.700
ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0.

31

00:03:37.587  -->  00:03:45.000
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
for all vlan, next let’s also configure

32

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:47.939
dhcp server for all vlan.

33

00:03:48.838  -->  00:04:04.010
Let’s start with vlan 10, ip dhcp pool vlan 10,
network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0, default-router

34

00:04:04.010  -->  00:04:08.569
192.168.10.1,

35

00:04:08.569  -->  00:04:19.796
Next for vlan 20, ip dhcp pool vlan 20, network
192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0,

36

00:04:20.258  -->  00:04:39.579
default-router 192.168.20.1, last for vlan 30, ip dhcp pool
vlan 30, network 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0,

37

00:04:40.090  -->  00:04:43.615
default-router 192.168.30.1.

38

00:04:44.673  -->  00:04:51.645
Okay now we have done configuring dhcp server
for all vlan, let’s configure dhcp client

39

00:04:51.645  -->  00:04:53.087
on the client.

40

00:05:02.508  -->  00:05:07.996
Okay all pc already get an ip address automatically
from the router 1.

41

00:05:08.483  -->  00:05:14.430
Last, let’s configure the ip address of
the router 1 that connected to router 2.

42

00:05:15.196  -->  00:05:27.053
Interface fa0/1, no shutdown, ip address 10.10.10.1
255.255.255.252.

43

00:05:28.086  -->  00:05:35.342
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
on router 1, I think enough for this video,

44

00:05:35.622  -->  00:05:39.445
in the next video, we are going to configure
router 2.

45

00:05:39.676  -->  00:05:42.974
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
