00:00:00.634  -->  00:00:06.236
In the previous video we already learn how to find
Network IP and Broadcast IP.

2

00:00:06.829  -->  00:00:12.950
Now in this video, we are going to learn the last thing, which is Range IP.

3

00:00:13.361  -->  00:00:20.763
But before we start learning about Range IP,  first we need to determine which
block subnet we are going to use.

4

00:00:21.316  -->  00:00:28.520
In this case, we are going to use the
first block subnet, which is 0 until 127.

5

00:00:29.520  -->  00:00:36.643
Okay, now you need to remember that Network
IP and Broadcast IP can never be used.

6

00:00:37.076  -->  00:00:43.781
Let’s say we want to configure the IP
Address of computer as 192.168.0.0,

7

00:00:44.201  -->  00:00:50.066
pay attention here that 0 is the
Network IP. So this will be failed,

8

00:00:50.403  -->  00:00:57.000
because we try to use Network IP,  and always
remember that Network IP can never be used!

9

00:00:57.904  -->  00:01:06.768
Let’s try it in the Cisco Packet Tracer. Here
let’s try to edit the IP to 192.168.0.0.

10

00:01:07.485  -->  00:01:14.600
Okay, here we can see that we have an error message
“error invalid ip for this subnetmask entered”

11

00:01:15.485  -->  00:01:20.654
Why this happened? This is because 192.168.0.0

12

00:01:20.654  -->  00:01:25.840
is Network IP and remember that
Network IP can never be used.

13

00:01:27.000  -->  00:01:33.517
Now let’s try to configure with Broadcast IP, if
you remember our calculation before, the Broadcast

14

00:01:33.517  -->  00:01:48.230
IP is 192.168.0.127, so let’s configure here
192.168.0.127. Here we don’t have an error, why?

15

00:01:48.230  -->  00:02:01.910
Because the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0, which
is /24, in the subnetmask 255.255.255.0 or prefix /24

16

00:02:01.910  -->  00:02:10.898
127 is not broadcast, but the broadcast
is 255. This is why we don’t get an error here.

17

00:02:11.514  -->  00:02:19.784
Now let’s edit the subnetmask to
255.255.255.128 as our calculation before.

18

00:02:20.887  -->  00:02:23.397
Okay here we get an error now.

19

00:02:24.224  -->  00:02:32.076
So always remember that Network IP and Broadcast
IP can never be used. So which IP that we can used?

20

00:02:32.682  -->  00:02:41.646
The IP that can be used is after Network IP until
before Broadcast IP. And this is called range IP.

21

00:02:42.057  -->  00:02:51.317
So range IP is the IP that can be used.
In this case the range IP is 1 until 126.

22

00:02:51.920  -->  00:02:56.876
And remember that this number will
replace the last number in the IP Address,

23

00:02:57.773  -->  00:03:08.220
so the Range IP is 192.168.0.1
until 192.168.1.126.

24

00:03:09.344  -->  00:03:16.024
Okay, now we are done learning subnetting in the
first case. We have learned to calculate Total IP,

25

00:03:16.215  -->  00:03:20.839
Subnetmask, Network IP,
Broadcast IP, and IP Range.

26

00:03:21.643  -->  00:03:27.847
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn about subnetting again

27

00:03:27.847  -->  00:03:33.331
with different case. Thankyou for
watching and see you on the next video!
