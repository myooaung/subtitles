00:00:00.564  -->  00:00:04.250
In the previous video, we already configure
router 1.

2

00:00:04.988  -->  00:00:09.364
Now in this video we are going to configure router 2.

3

00:00:10.000  -->  00:00:11.081
Let’s just start.

4

00:00:12.130  -->  00:00:25.255
Let’s configure fa0/1 first, enable, configure
terminal, go to interface fa0/1, no shutdown,

5

00:00:25.938  -->  00:00:34.611
and then the ip address is 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252.

6

00:00:35.892  -->  00:00:48.305
Next let’s configure for fa0/0, interface
fa0/0, no shutdown, ip address 192.168.1.1

7

00:00:49.748  -->  00:00:52.997
255.255.255.0.

8

00:00:53.634  -->  00:00:57.828
Okay we have done on router 2, this is very
simple.

9

00:00:59.086  -->  00:01:02.121
On the switch, we don’t need to configure
anything.

10

00:01:02.967  -->  00:01:06.771
Next let’s configure the ip address on all
servers.

11

00:01:07.734  -->  00:01:16.226
Let’s change the name first, this is server 1,
this is server 2, and this is server 3.

12

00:01:17.918  -->  00:01:26.116
Let’s configure the ip address, this is
server 1, the ip address is 192.168.1.10,

13

00:01:27.404  -->  00:01:30.873
and the gateway is 192.168.1.1.

14

00:01:31.867  -->  00:01:42.444
Server 2, the ip address is 192.168.1.20, and
the gateway is 192.168.1.1.

15

00:01:43.391  -->  00:01:53.601
Server 3, the ip address is 192.168.1.30, and
the gateway is 192.168.1.1.

16

00:01:54.913  -->  00:02:00.247
Okay so now we have done configuring ip address
in router 1 and router 2.

17

00:02:01.202  -->  00:02:08.390
Now we just need to configure routing so all
pc will able to communicate with all servers.

18

00:02:09.275  -->  00:02:14.966
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure routing on

19

00:02:14.966  -->  00:02:16.799
router 1 and router 2.

20

00:02:17.412  -->  00:02:20.650
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
