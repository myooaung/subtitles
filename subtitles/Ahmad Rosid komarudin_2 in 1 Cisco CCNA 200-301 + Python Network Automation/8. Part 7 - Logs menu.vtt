00:00:00.900  -->  00:00:05.380
In the previous video, we already create a
verify config menu.

2

00:00:05.380  -->  00:00:09.200
Now in this video, we are going to create log menu.

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:18.680
Okay let’s just start. Open the visual studio code. First, let’s create a models for Log.

4

00:00:20.020  -->  00:00:23.320
Here I will copy paste from my note.

5

00:00:25.440  -->  00:00:33.800
Here we have some column in the log models.
Target will be used to store the ip address of the router.

6

00:00:33.800  -->  00:00:40.780
Action will be configure or
verify config. And status will be success or failed.

7

00:00:41.180  -->  00:00:46.940
We have time here, this column
will show us when the action is executed.

8

00:00:47.220  -->  00:00:54.720
Finally we have a message here. This column will show us the message if the action is failed.

9

00:00:55.820  -->  00:01:03.120
Because we doing a modification in the models.py
file, so we need to doing a migration.

10

00:01:03.220  -->  00:01:11.840
Open the command prompt, stop the server, and do
a makemigration.

11

00:01:20.140  -->  00:01:23.060
Next let’s do a migrate.

12

00:01:26.020  -->  00:01:29.660
Okay, now let’s run the server again

13

00:01:37.500  -->  00:01:48.720
Now let’s go to views.py file. Here we will
doing a manipulation in the configure &amp; verify_config function.

14

00:01:50.680  -->  00:01:56.540
If we see here, the script will
try to login to the device and send the command.

15

00:01:57.040  -->  00:02:04.000
When try to login to the router, there is
a chance that we got an error, either we use

16

00:02:04.000  -->  00:02:08.500
a wrong IP Address or may be we have a wrong
username and password.

17

00:02:08.860  -->  00:02:11.680
So we need to use try in here.

18

00:02:16.600  -->  00:02:19.720
And then here, we need to use except.

19

00:02:26.300  -->  00:02:35.020
Except block will be executed if we got an error in the try block. Here we will write a script to add data to

20

00:02:35.020  -->  00:02:38.440
the log database that the action is failed.

21

00:02:38.660  -->  00:02:42.300
I will just copy and paste the script from my note.

22

00:02:45.620  -->  00:02:51.980
Here we add a data to the log database. But we need to import Log first.

23

00:03:01.660  -->  00:03:10.280
Here the target will be the ip address of
the router, dev is the variable that we already defined before.

24

00:03:10.800  -->  00:03:17.580
Then the action will be configure, because we doing a manipulation in the configure function.

25

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:26.360
The status will be error. The time
will be datetime.now, and the message will be e,

26

00:03:26.360  -->  00:03:30.520
which is the variable that save the
exception message.

27

00:03:35.060  -->  00:03:41.400
Here we can see that we use datetime function, so we need to import it first.

28

00:03:55.060  -->  00:04:00.920
Until now, we only add data to log database when the program is failed,

29

00:04:01.540  -->  00:04:10.220
but if the program is success, we don’t add data to log database. Now let’s write a script to add data to

30

00:04:10.220  -->  00:04:16.480
the log database when the program is success.
We can just copy and paste this script.

31

00:04:20.060  -->  00:04:23.120
Let’s change the status to success,

32

00:04:28.100  -->  00:04:33.660
and the message is “no error”, because the program is running successfully.

33

00:04:35.760  -->  00:04:44.740
Okay now we have done in the configure function. Let’s copy and paste this script to the verify_config function.

34

00:05:04.500  -->  00:05:07.960
Let’s change the action to verify config.

35

00:05:15.300  -->  00:05:26.120
Now, let’s create a page to show the log.
Open urls.py file, here let’s create a new url, let’s say log.

36

00:05:28.780  -->  00:05:34.260
And this url will be
redirected to log function inside views.py.

37

00:05:34.500  -->  00:05:38.580
Now let’s create log function in the views.py.

38

00:05:47.360  -->  00:05:51.860
Let’s create a variable to save all of logs from the database.

39

00:05:58.180  -->  00:06:03.020
Next let’s create a context to pass the
variable to the template.

40

00:06:08.720  -->  00:06:12.720
And finally return the template file and the context.

41

00:06:19.760  -->  00:06:27.720
Now let’s create the template file. I already
upload the log.html file in the resources section.

42

00:06:27.720  -->  00:06:32.480
So you can just download it and put
it in the templates directory.

43

00:06:37.680  -->  00:06:48.740
Okay now we have log.html file here. Open
the browser, and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/log.

44

00:06:51.500  -->  00:07:00.740
Okay now we have log page here. But we don’t have any log yet, because we don’t do any action for now.

45

00:07:01.040  -->  00:07:07.340
In the next video, we are going to test our
application, so we will get a log in here.

46

00:07:07.340  -->  00:07:10.580
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
