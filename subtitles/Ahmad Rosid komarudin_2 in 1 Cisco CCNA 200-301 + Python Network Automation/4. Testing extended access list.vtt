00:00:00.554  -->  00:00:06.557
In the previous video, we have done configuring
extended access list with this example case.

2

00:00:07.256  -->  00:00:12.930
Now in this video, we are going to test the
configuration that we have done.

3

00:00:13.794  -->  00:00:16.762
Let’s test from vlan 10 to the server.

4

00:00:17.473  -->  00:00:28.374
From pc 0 ping to all server, let’s ping
to server 1 first, 192.168.1.10,

5

00:00:29.041  -->  00:00:30.719
okay this is success.

6

00:00:31.364  -->  00:00:38.239
Next, let’s try to server 2, this is should
be failed, why?

7

00:00:38.315  -->  00:00:47.429
Because only vlan 20 who allowed to go to
server 2, let’s try, ping 192.168.1.20,

8

00:00:48.730  -->  00:00:51.638
okay here we can see that this is failed.

9

00:00:52.272  -->  00:00:59.897
Let’s try to server 3, this is also should
be failed, because only vlan 30 who allowed

10

00:00:59.897  -->  00:01:01.729
to go to server 3.

11

00:01:02.297  -->  00:01:08.090
Ping 192.168.1.30, okay this is also failed.

12

00:01:09.500  -->  00:01:21.613
Let’s test from vlan 20, vlan 20 to server 1,
this is should be success, ping 192.168.1.10,

13

00:01:22.815  -->  00:01:30.531
okay success, next let’s test to server 2,
this is also should be success.

14

00:01:30.914  -->  00:01:38.877
Ping 192.168.1.20, okay success.,

15

00:01:39.620  -->  00:01:50.222
Last, let’s try to server 3, this is should
be failed, ping 192.168.1.30, okay failed.

16

00:01:50.889  -->  00:01:58.608
Next, let’s try
from vlan 30, ping to server 1 first,

17

00:01:58.958  -->  00:02:03.664
ping 192.168.1.10, this is should be success.

18

00:02:05.314  -->  00:02:06.653
Okay success.

19

00:02:07.309  -->  00:02:17.240
Let’s try to server 2, this is should be
failed, ping 192.168.1.20, okay failed.

20

00:02:18.584  -->  00:02:23.873
Last, let’s try to sever 3, this is should
be success.

21

00:02:29.469  -->  00:02:31.159
Okay success.

22

00:02:31.848  -->  00:02:36.084
Okay so now the result is correct based on
the case.

23

00:02:36.631  -->  00:02:40.247
Next, let’s try to access using web browser.

24

00:02:40.761  -->  00:02:46.403
From vlan 30 to the server, this is should
be failed, why?

25

00:02:46.403  -->  00:02:55.125
Because here we access using http, here we
can see request timeout, this is means failed.

26

00:02:55.792  -->  00:03:03.542
Let’s try using https, here we can see that
this is success.

27

00:03:04.197  -->  00:03:10.073
Okay so now http is blocked, but https is
still allowed.

28

00:03:10.817  -->  00:03:13.088
So our configuration is correct.

29

00:03:13.689  -->  00:03:15.862
I think enough for this video.

30

00:03:16.000  -->  00:03:19.296
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
