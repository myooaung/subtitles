00:00:00.640  -->  00:00:05.440
In the previous video, we already&nbsp;
learn about basic command in cisco.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:12.560
Next in this video, I will show you&nbsp;
that command in cisco can be shortened.

3

00:00:13.760  -->  00:00:20.880
For example, the command enable can&nbsp;
be shortened to en like this. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

4

00:00:20.880  -->  00:00:23.280
we don’t need to type the complete command.

5

00:00:24.560  -->  00:00:31.760
Okay let’s just try it. Let’s open the&nbsp;
router. Here let’s back to the user mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

6

00:00:33.040  -->  00:00:37.360
And then type en. Type the password,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:40.000  -->  00:00:45.680
and okay here we can see that we have&nbsp;
successfully go to privilege mode.

8

00:00:47.040  -->  00:00:54.000
Let’s try to exit again. May be some&nbsp;
of you have a question, can I shortened&nbsp;&nbsp;

9

00:00:54.000  -->  00:01:03.280
the enable command become just e? Let’s try it.&nbsp;
Okay here we get an error ambiguous command.&nbsp;&nbsp;

10

00:01:05.600  -->  00:01:09.280
Now let’s try e and then question mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:01:11.120  -->  00:01:19.280
Here we can see that there is 2 command&nbsp;
that started by e, which is enable and exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

12

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:29.360
This is why we get an error ambiguous command.&nbsp;
But if we type en and question mark, here we&nbsp;&nbsp;

13

00:01:29.360  -->  00:01:40.080
can see that the possible command is only enable.&nbsp;
So we can shortened the enable command become en.

14

00:01:40.080  -->  00:01:48.720
Next let’s try to shortened configure terminal.&nbsp;
Here I type co and then question mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15

00:01:49.680  -->  00:01:57.600
Here we can see that we still have more than 1&nbsp;
possible command, which is 3 command. Now let’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:08.640
try con and then question mark. Here we have 2&nbsp;
possible command, Next let’s try conf and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:02:08.640  -->  00:02:16.240
question mark. Here we can see that now we only&nbsp;
have 1 possible command, which is configure.

18

00:02:17.600  -->  00:02:25.920
Space, and then here I type t and question&nbsp;
mark. Here the only command that started by&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:02:25.920  -->  00:02:33.600
t is only terminal. Okay so this is the&nbsp;
shortened command of configure terminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

20

00:02:34.480  -->  00:02:41.920
Let’s enter it. Okay here we can see that we are&nbsp;
successful to enter global configuration mode.

21

00:02:43.360  -->  00:02:50.880
Now let’s try to exit from global configuration&nbsp;
mode. Let’s type e and then question mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22

00:02:51.920  -->  00:02:59.840
Okay here we can see many command that started&nbsp;
with e. let’s try ex and then question mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:03:00.880  -->  00:03:08.000
Okay here we just have one command, which&nbsp;
is exit, so this is enough. Let’s enter it.

24

00:03:09.520  -->  00:03:16.720
Next, let’s try show running-config.&nbsp;
Let’s type sh and then question mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

25

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:26.960
Okay here we only have one command. And then let’s&nbsp;
try r and then question mark. Okay here we also&nbsp;&nbsp;

26

00:03:26.960  -->  00:03:37.120
have only one command, which is running-config,&nbsp;
so, sh space r is enough for show running-config.

27

00:03:38.560  -->  00:03:46.240
Okay now you are know about shortened command&nbsp;
in cisco. But one thing that you need to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:03:46.240  -->  00:03:54.880
is that command in the cisco packet tracer is&nbsp;
much less than in the real device. So may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

29

00:03:54.880  -->  00:04:00.880
some shortened command in cisco packet tracer&nbsp;
is work, but in the real device is not work.

30

00:04:02.160  -->  00:04:09.520
Here is some command shortened that I&nbsp;
usually use. For enable the command is en,&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:04:11.040  -->  00:04:19.920
exit is ex, configure terminal is conf&nbsp;
t, and show running-config is show run.

32

00:04:21.760  -->  00:04:28.080
Okay that is some shortened command that&nbsp;
I usually use. Next, we are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:04:28.080  -->  00:04:36.640
learn about autocomplete. So, beside shortened&nbsp;
command, we also can use autocomplete in cisco.

34

00:04:37.760  -->  00:04:44.960
Here let’s type sh and then tab. So&nbsp;
the command will be autocomplete become&nbsp;&nbsp;

35

00:04:44.960  -->  00:04:50.400
show like this. And then let’s&nbsp;
type run and then tab again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

36

00:04:51.840  -->  00:04:56.320
Okay here the command is autocomplete&nbsp;
become show running-config.

37

00:04:58.320  -->  00:05:04.560
Okay that’s some feature of cisco that we can&nbsp;
use to speed up the configuration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38

00:05:05.600  -->  00:05:10.800
The first one is shortened command,&nbsp;
and the second is autocomplete.

39

00:05:12.080  -->  00:05:18.640
Okay I think enough for this video. Thankyou&nbsp;
for watching and see you on the next video!
