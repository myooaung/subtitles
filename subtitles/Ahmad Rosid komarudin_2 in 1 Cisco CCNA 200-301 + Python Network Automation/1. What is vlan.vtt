00:00:00.494  -->  00:00:06.407
In this video, we are going to start
learning about vlan. So what is vlan?

2

00:00:06.685  -->  00:00:09.159
And why we need a vlan?

3

00:00:10.428  -->  00:00:19.865
We will learn with an example case. Here let’s
say we have a room. And in this room we have 9 pc.

4

00:00:20.386  -->  00:00:23.896
all of this pc is connected to a switch.

5

00:00:24.995  -->  00:00:33.733
These 9 pc is separated to different division.
These 3 pc is in accounting division,

6

00:00:34.268  -->  00:00:42.512
these 3 pc is in the engineering division, and
last, these 3 pc is in the marketing division.

7

00:00:43.520  -->  00:00:47.722
Usually, each division will
have different services.

8

00:00:48.407  -->  00:00:53.539
Let’s say engineering division need higher
bandwidth than others division.

9

00:00:54.030  -->  00:01:02.021
Or let’s say marketing division is allowed to access social
media like facebook, instagram, or others,

10

00:01:02.595  -->  00:01:07.076
but others division is prohibited
to access social media.

11

00:01:08.115  -->  00:01:12.320
Because each division need
different services like that,

12

00:01:12.320  -->  00:01:20.376
so we will need to configure vlan for each
division. Let’s say for accounting we use vlan 10,

13

00:01:20.626  -->  00:01:30.317
engineering use vlan 20, and marketing use vlan
30. So each division will use different vlan.

14

00:01:31.071  -->  00:01:36.449
And then, each vlan will use different
network or different block subnet.

15

00:01:36.960  -->  00:01:46.866
Let’s say vlan accounting or vlan 10, will
use 192.168.10.0/24, for engineering or vlan

16

00:01:46.866  -->  00:02:03.381
20 will use 192.168.20.0/24, and finally for
marketing or vlan 30 will use 192.168.30.0/24.

17

00:02:04.306  -->  00:02:09.280
If each division using different
vlan and different network like this,

18

00:02:09.280  -->  00:02:11.952
we can easily manage the service.

19

00:02:13.276  -->  00:02:19.764
Here let’s complete the topology. So from
the switch must be connected to a router,

20

00:02:20.146  -->  00:02:24.074
and from router must be
connected to internet like this.

21

00:02:24.963  -->  00:02:33.095
Now let’s say we want to only allow access social
media from marketing division, to do that we can

22

00:02:33.095  -->  00:02:44.469
create a firewall or access list in the router to
allow access to social media from 192.168.30.0/24,

23

00:02:44.960  -->  00:02:47.521
and block access from the others.

24

00:02:48.963  -->  00:02:53.489
Okay, so that is the first
advantage of using vlan.

25

00:02:54.146  -->  00:03:01.381
The second advantage that we can get if
using vlan is separation of broadcast domain.

26

00:03:02.024  -->  00:03:11.952
Let’s say here we have PC 1, and here we have
PC 2. When PC 1 want to send packet to PC 2,

27

00:03:12.365  -->  00:03:22.004
first PC1 will send ARP packet to the switch. This
ARP packet is used to ask the mac address of PC 2.

28

00:03:22.734  -->  00:03:26.501
After switch receive the ARP packet from PC 1,

29

00:03:26.727  -->  00:03:31.243
switch will broadcast the ARP
packet to all pc connected to it.

30

00:03:32.195  -->  00:03:40.202
But because now we already have vlan, so the
ARP packet from PC1 will not sent to other vlan,

31

00:03:40.487  -->  00:03:48.432
but only sent to the computer that is in the
same vlan with PC 1, which is PC 2 and PC 3.

32

00:03:49.360  -->  00:03:54.255
The ARP packet will not sent to
PC in the vlan 10 and vlan 20.

33

00:03:55.224  -->  00:04:02.794
Okay, so this is the second advantage of using
vlan, which is separation of broadcast domain.

34

00:04:03.426  -->  00:04:08.125
Okay I think enough for this video,
I hope you understand what is vlan

35

00:04:08.125  -->  00:04:11.310
and why we need to configure a vlan.

36

00:04:11.645  -->  00:04:15.130
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
