00:00:00.621  -->  00:00:06.340
In the previous video, we have done configuring BGP on google and ISP.

2

00:00:06.974  -->  00:00:13.581
Next in this video, we are going to learn about the concept of
network address translation.

3

00:00:14.172  -->  00:00:20.087
But before that, let’s remember about private
and public ip address first.

4

00:00:22.516  -->  00:00:31.313
Public ip address is in the internet and accessible
from anywhere, but private ip address is only

5

00:00:31.313  -->  00:00:33.705
accessible from the local network.

6

00:00:34.865  -->  00:00:40.838
In this topology, let’s say the Ip address
of google server, the network between google

7

00:00:40.838  -->  00:00:47.936
and ISP, and the network between ISP and customer
is public ip address.

8

00:00:48.789  -->  00:00:54.471
And then the ip address of vlan 10 and vlan
20 is private ip address.

9

00:00:55.325  -->  00:01:03.770
The problem is, private ip address will not
able to go to the internet, so for example

10

00:01:03.880  -->  00:01:13.847
here from vlan 10 want to ping to google,
so the source address is 192.168.10.2,

11

00:01:14.307  -->  00:01:21.201
let's say this is the ip address of pc 0, and then
the destination will be the google,

12

00:01:22.098  -->  00:01:26.068
which is 172.16.10.2.

13

00:01:26.735  -->  00:01:35.368
When pc 0 send this packet, the packet will
go through router 3, and then forwarded to ISP.

14

00:01:35.855  -->  00:01:46.273
ISP will see the packet, here ISP will see
that the source address of the packet is 192.168.10.2,

15

00:01:46.864  -->  00:01:52.989
ISP don’t know about this network, because
this is private ip address,

16

00:01:53.580  -->  00:01:58.057
so the packet will not forwarded to the internet or google.

17

00:01:59.698  -->  00:02:05.851
So for now, the client will not able to communicate
with internet or google.

18

00:02:06.552  -->  00:02:11.776
So the solution is, we will configure nat
in the customer router.

19

00:02:12.509  -->  00:02:20.277
The function of nat is to translate the network
address, in this case nat will translate the

20

00:02:20.277  -->  00:02:21.605
source address.

21

00:02:22.765  -->  00:02:31.686
So if the source is 192.168.10.2, after nat
process in router 3, the source address will

22

00:02:31.686  -->  00:02:39.091
become the public ip address of customer router,
which is 10.20.20.2

23

00:02:39.781  -->  00:02:46.051
After that, the packet will forwarded to the
ISP, ISP will see the packet,

24

00:02:46.325  -->  00:02:54.875
now the source address is public ip address, and ISP know
about this ip address, so the packet will

25

00:02:54.875  -->  00:02:57.199
be forwarded to the internet.

26

00:02:58.534  -->  00:03:04.852
Okay so that is the concept of network address
translation, I hope you understand.

27

00:03:05.432  -->  00:03:11.130
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure nat

28

00:03:11.371  -->  00:03:15.797
so all client will able to communicate with internet
or google.

29

00:03:16.333  -->  00:03:19.714
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video .
