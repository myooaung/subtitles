00:00:00.215  -->  00:00:05.557
In the previous video, we have done
installing gns3 on our computer.

2

00:00:06.061  -->  00:00:12.499
Next in this video, we are going to
learn how to import cisco router to gns3.

3

00:00:13.452  -->  00:00:20.763
First, we need to download cisco image,
let’s just go to browser, and then type

4

00:00:20.763  -->  00:00:34.782
download cisco image for gns3. Let’s just open the
first website, and here we can choose some image.

5

00:00:35.169  -->  00:00:43.512
You are free to use any image, but my
recommendation is 7200 and 2691,

6

00:00:44.129  -->  00:00:54.518
if the specification of your laptop is high, you
can use 7200, but if not, you can use 2691.

7

00:00:56.018  -->  00:01:05.859
In this case, I will try to use 7200 first,
but if this is to heavy, I will move to 2691.

8

00:01:06.418  -->  00:01:12.616
Okay let’s back to gns3, I
already download the 7200 series,

9

00:01:12.966  -->  00:01:21.150
let’s just import it, go to gns3 and
then preference. If you use windows,

10

00:01:21.150  -->  00:01:29.484
the preference menu will be under
edit. Next go to ios router,

11

00:01:32.209  -->  00:01:41.121
click new to import new router. Let’s import
the cisco image that we have downloaded before.

12

00:01:47.606  -->  00:01:51.000
This is the image, let’s import this,

13

00:01:58.116  -->  00:02:05.398
next, next, the default ram is 512,

14

00:02:05.815  -->  00:02:15.736
next, in the slot 1, we can choose
2fe-tx, so this is two fast ethernet.

15

00:02:18.418  -->  00:02:22.444
Next, choose Idle-pc finder,

16

00:02:24.953  -->  00:02:41.121
wait for a minute here, okay
done, and here we can finish.

17

00:02:41.846  -->  00:02:46.721
Okay so now we have done import
the cisco router to gns3.

18

00:02:52.196  -->  00:02:54.451
Let’s create a new project.

19

00:03:03.661  -->  00:03:10.111
And then go to here, we can import
the router that we already import.

20

00:03:11.150  -->  00:03:19.397
Let’s import 2 router, and then to start
the router, we can right click on the router

21

00:03:19.397  -->  00:03:28.530
and then start, here we can see that router 1 is
green, this is means that router 1 is started,

22

00:03:29.021  -->  00:03:37.096
let’s also start router 2. To remote the
router, we can just double click the router.

23

00:03:44.153  -->  00:04:04.013
Okay here we are successful remote the
router, let’s connecting this two router,

24

00:04:21.753  -->  00:04:26.940
if we want to see the interface
label, we can click on this icon.

25

00:04:29.162  -->  00:04:35.934
Here we can see the interface label,
router 1 is connected to fa0/0,

26

00:04:36.080  -->  00:04:40.377
and router 2 also connected to fa0/0.

27

00:04:41.015  -->  00:04:48.598
Let’s try to configure the ip address, let’s
start with router 1, configure terminal,

28

00:04:48.880  -->  00:04:58.376
we will configure fa0/0, so go to interface
fa0/0, no shutdown,

29

00:04:58.697  -->  00:05:14.241
and then the ip address is 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0.
Next for router 2, configure terminal,

30

00:05:14.241  -->  00:05:26.437
interface fa0/0, no shutdown, and then the
ip address is 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0.

31

00:05:27.378  -->  00:05:38.071
Okay done, let’s test the connection, from
router 2 ping to router 1, do ping 10.10.10.1,

32

00:05:41.489  -->  00:05:44.911
okay here we can see that the ping is success.

33

00:05:45.926  -->  00:05:48.404
I think enough for this video

34

00:05:48.453  -->  00:05:52.078
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
