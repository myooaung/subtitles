00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:06.960
In the previous video, we already start building
our new project. Now, in this video,

2

00:00:06.960  -->  00:00:09.960
we are going to add bootsrap to our project.

3

00:00:09.960  -->  00:00:14.060
Let’s just start, open the visual studio
code.

4

00:00:16.220  -->  00:00:21.460
First we need to configure template directory in the settings.py file.

5

00:00:23.900  -->  00:00:27.000
Here let’s define templates directory.

6

00:00:28.180  -->  00:00:34.000
Now let’s create the templates directory.
Remember that the templates directory must

7

00:00:34.000  -->  00:00:37.100
in the same level with our project directory.

8

00:00:43.620  -->  00:00:53.040
Now let’s edit views.py inside our app.
Here let’s change HttpResponse with render.

9

00:00:55.680  -->  00:00:59.420
And the name of template file is home.html

10

00:01:00.480  -->  00:01:07.320
Next, we need to create a template file. In
this case, we will need 2 file, base.html

11

00:01:07.360  -->  00:01:15.700
and home.html. I already upload two of them
in the resource section. So you can just download it.

12

00:01:26.980  -->  00:01:36.320
Okay, here we have base.html and home.html,
next we need to put this file to our templates directory.

13

00:01:36.320  -->  00:01:40.060
We can just drag and drop the file
to visual studio code.

14

00:01:45.680  -->  00:01:51.640
Okay now we have base.html and home.html in the templates directory.

15

00:01:52.520  -->  00:02:03.280
Now let’s understand the code. In the base.html,
here we define the bootstrap script for css.

16

00:02:04.580  -->  00:02:12.140
The title is Django Network Automation. Here
we can see that we have a navbar.

17

00:02:15.160  -->  00:02:22.560
And here we define block content. Later this block
content will be replaced by another html file.

18

00:02:22.660  -->  00:02:26.740
And here we also have bootstrap script for
javascript.

19

00:02:28.040  -->  00:02:37.760
In the home.html, first we extend to base.html.
Here in block content, we have a card.

20

00:02:37.760  -->  00:02:46.820
This card will show us the graph about total devices,
cisco devices, and mikrotik devices.

21

00:02:48.020  -->  00:02:53.740
This is just a dummy data, later after we
create a database, we will change this total

22

00:02:53.740  -->  00:03:01.900
by data in the database. Next, in the buttom,
we have a table. This table will show us the

23

00:03:01.900  -->  00:03:08.920
10 last event. Here we can see that this is
still a dummy data. Later we will change this

24

00:03:08.920  -->  00:03:11.760
data using data from database.

25

00:03:12.140  -->  00:03:18.360
Okay now let’s open the browser and go to
127.0.0.1:8000.

26

00:03:24.080  -->  00:03:30.780
Here we can see that now we have a beautifull page. The title is Django Network Automation.

27

00:03:31.720  -->  00:03:33.760
And we have a navbar here.

28

00:03:33.880  -->  00:03:41.000
We also have a graph that show the total devices.
And here we also have a table that show us

29

00:03:41.000  -->  00:03:43.320
the last event of the application.

30

00:03:43.800  -->  00:03:51.540
Okay, this is the end of this video. In the
next video, we are going to create a models in our project.

31

00:03:51.540  -->  00:03:54.720
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video!
