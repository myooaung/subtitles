00:00:00.624  -->  00:00:07.065
In the previous video, we already learn about
Public IP Address and Private IP Address.

2

00:00:07.453  -->  00:00:12.169
Now in this video we are going
to start learning about subnetting.

3

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:17.101
Okay, do you remember why we need to learn subnetting?

4

00:00:17.570  -->  00:00:23.762
Yes! We need to learn subnetting to determine
the best prefix we will use in the network.

5

00:00:24.400  -->  00:00:28.240
For example, here we have a
computer network that consist

6

00:00:28.240  -->  00:00:35.333
of 12 computers. So in this case, we
will need 12 IP for each computers.

7

00:00:35.760  -->  00:00:42.046
The question is, which prefix is
the best for 12 IP or 12 computers?

8

00:00:43.018  -->  00:00:51.245
In the previous video, I say that if
we use prefix /24, the total IP is 256.

9

00:00:52.792  -->  00:00:59.145
How we can get this 256? we are
going to learn about this now.

10

00:00:59.760  -->  00:01:07.493
To get this 256 is 2 to the
power of 32 minus prefix.

11

00:01:08.043  -->  00:01:19.621
In this case, the prefix is 24, so the total
IP is 2 to the power of 8. Because 32 minus 24

12

00:01:19.621  -->  00:01:31.718
is 8. And 2 to the power of 8 is 256.
This is how we get 256 for prefix /24.

13

00:01:32.800  -->  00:01:40.547
The question is, why 32? this
is because IP Address is consist of 32 bit.

14

00:01:41.367  -->  00:01:47.607
Oh ya, this formula is the easyway to
learn about subnetting. If you want to learn

15

00:01:47.607  -->  00:01:53.845
subnetting in the hardway, you will need
to convert this IP Address to binary first,

16

00:01:53.977  -->  00:01:59.733
doing some calculation in the binary, and then
convert it back to the decimal.

17

00:02:00.188  -->  00:02:04.242
I will not teach you the hardway in this course.

18

00:02:04.646  -->  00:02:11.239
Because if we learn in the hardway, everyone of
you will think that computer network is difficult!

19

00:02:11.744  -->  00:02:16.621
In this course, I want to make the
computer network as simple as possible.

20

00:02:16.820  -->  00:02:20.285
So you can happy to learn about computer network.

21

00:02:21.046  -->  00:02:32.102
Okay, back to this. Now let’s review this again, so here we have
prefix /24, the total IP is 256,

22

00:02:32.278  -->  00:02:48.926
we can get this 256 from 2 to the power of 32 minus prefix,
32 minus 24 is 8. And 2 to the power of 8 is 256.

23

00:02:49.599  -->  00:02:58.793
May be some of you have a trouble to determine 2
to the power of 8. So I will give you another easier example.

24

00:02:58.983  -->  00:03:06.482
Let’s say we have prefix /30. How
many IP Address that we can use in prefix /30?

25

00:03:08.420  -->  00:03:17.370
2 to the power of 32 minus 30, 32 minus
30 is 2, so 2 to the power of 2,

26

00:03:17.701  -->  00:03:24.869
I think all of you will know the answer
right? Yes.. 2 to the power of 2 Is 4.

27

00:03:25.584  -->  00:03:35.199
Now let’s try another example. Let’s say we have
prefix /29. How many IP Address that we can use

28

00:03:35.199  -->  00:03:45.874
in prefix /29?  Let’s try to calculate. 2
to the power of 32 minus 29. 32 minus 29

29

00:03:45.874  -->  00:03:58.649
is 3, so 2 to the power of 3, the answer is 8. So
the total IP that we can use in prefix /29 is 8,

30

00:03:59.547  -->  00:04:07.485
Well, if you see here, actually we have
a patterns. 2 to the power of 2 is 4,

31

00:04:07.778  -->  00:04:18.373
2 to the power of 3 is 8. This is means that if the
power increment by 1, the result is multiply by 2.

32

00:04:19.360  -->  00:04:31.981
Let’s write it out. 2 to the power of 1 is 2, 2
to the power of 2 is 4, 2 to the power of 3 is 8,

33

00:04:32.632  -->  00:04:41.840
2 to the power of 4 is 16, 2
to the power of 5 is 32, and others.

34

00:04:42.392  -->  00:04:49.565
If you see the patterns, here we just need to
multiply the result by 2. 2 to the power of 2

35

00:04:49.565  -->  00:05:00.075
is 2 multiply by 2, which is 4. 2 to the
power of 3 is 4 multiply by 2, which is 8.

36

00:05:00.755  -->  00:05:12.715
2 to the power of 4 is 8 multiply by 2, which
is 16. 2 to the power of 5 is 16 multiply by 2,

37

00:05:12.791  -->  00:05:24.043
which is 32, 2 to the power of 6 is 32
multiply by 2, which is 64. 2 to the power of 7

38

00:05:24.043  -->  00:05:38.675
is 64 multiply by 2, which is 128, and 2 to the
power of 8 is 128 multiply by 2, which is 256.

39

00:05:39.243  -->  00:05:44.261
So the pattern is that we just
need to multiply the result by 2.

40

00:05:44.261  -->  00:05:48.625
We don’t need to have a
trouble to calculating powers anymore.

41

00:05:49.645  -->  00:05:59.527
Okay, here we stop in 2 to the power of 8. Because this
is for prefix /24, in this course we will only

42

00:05:59.527  -->  00:06:10.000
learn about subnetting prefix /24 until /30. So
we just need to know until 2 to the power of 8.

43

00:06:10.704  -->  00:06:14.079
Okay, now I hope you understand how to determine

44

00:06:14.079  -->  00:06:18.082
how much IP Address that we
can use in the specific prefix.

45

00:06:18.720  -->  00:06:25.661
Before I end this video, let’s try one more example to make sure
that you really understand.

46

00:06:26.042  -->  00:06:40.534
Let’s say we have prefix /26, the total IP for this prefix is 2
to the power of 32 minus 26. 32 minus 26 is 6,

47

00:06:40.835  -->  00:06:53.835
so 2 to the power of 6, and the result is 64. So
the total IP that we can use in prefix /26 is 64.

48

00:06:54.574  -->  00:07:03.814
Now let’s back to our first case. Here we
have 12 PC, and absolutely we will need 12 IP Address.

49

00:07:04.195  -->  00:07:08.307
The question is which
prefix is the best for this case?

50

00:07:08.748  -->  00:07:15.174
The answer is very simple, we just need
to see in the our calculation before.

51

00:07:15.475  -->  00:07:23.226
Here we have 2 to the power of 1, the result
is 2. Absolutely this is not enough for us

52

00:07:23.768  -->  00:07:31.872
4 is also not enough, 8 not enough,
and finally, 16 is absolutely enough.

53

00:07:32.551  -->  00:07:37.283
16 is enough for 12 PC. And this is the best.

54

00:07:37.664  -->  00:07:47.442
So which prefix the best? This is easy,
the prefix is 32 minus 4. Which is /28.

55

00:07:48.246  -->  00:07:56.307
So in the computer network that consist of 12 PC,
the best prefix that we can use is prefix /28.

56

00:07:57.562  -->  00:08:03.834
Okay I hope now you understand how to find the
best prefix that we can use in the computer network.

57

00:08:04.123  -->  00:08:10.381
In the next video, we are going to learn another
case to find the best prefix we will use.

58

00:08:11.192  -->  00:08:14.537
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video!
