00:00:00.610  -->  00:00:05.404
In the previous video, we have done configuring inter vlan routing.

2

00:00:05.904  -->  00:00:10.028
And now all vlan can communicate each others.

3

00:00:10.664  -->  00:00:17.419
But for now we need to configure the ip
address of all pc one by one manually.

4

00:00:18.597  -->  00:00:23.297
In this video we are going
to learn about dhcp server.

5

00:00:23.824  -->  00:00:31.750
If we configure a dhcp server, we don’t need to
configure the ip address of pc manually anymore.

6

00:00:32.478  -->  00:00:38.830
Okay let’s just start, we will
configure dhcp server in the router.

7

00:00:39.840  -->  00:00:43.840
Enable, and then go to global configuration mode.

8

00:00:44.560  -->  00:00:53.753
To configure dhcp server, the command is ip dhcp
pool and then the name of the pool.

9

00:00:54.159  -->  00:01:02.092
We can use anything for the pool name. But usually we
will use the vlan number or the vlan name

10

00:01:02.092  -->  00:01:08.537
for the pool name, for example
we can use vlan 10 or accounting.

11

00:01:09.104  -->  00:01:17.164
But actually we can use anything for the pool
name. For now, let’s say I will use vlan10.

12

00:01:18.649  -->  00:01:26.563
Next we need to define a network,
because this pool is for vlan 10,

13

00:01:27.451  -->  00:01:37.592
so the network is 192.168.10.0 and
the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0.

14

00:01:38.423  -->  00:01:41.760
Next we will need to configure default-router,

15

00:01:42.560  -->  00:01:50.190
the default router will become the gateway for
the pc in the vlan 10. So here default-router

16

00:01:50.411  -->  00:02:00.365
and then the gateway for vlan 10, which is the
ip address of router it self, so 192.168.10.1.

17

00:02:01.317  -->  00:02:10.678
Next we also can configure dns. So dns-server and
the the dns server, usually we will use google

18

00:02:10.678  -->  00:02:21.109
dns server, which is 8.8.8.8. Okay now we have
done configuring the dhcp server for vlan 10.

19

00:02:21.717  -->  00:02:28.030
To test it, we can configure the
dhcp client in all of pc vlan 10.

20

00:02:29.184  -->  00:02:39.671
Let’s start from room 1. Here we can choose dhcp,
and here we can see that dhcp request successful.

21

00:02:40.304  -->  00:02:46.018
Here we can see that the
ip address is 192.168.10.2,

22

00:02:46.491  -->  00:02:52.791
this ip address is automatically
assigned to the pc by dhcp server.

23

00:02:53.918  -->  00:02:57.497
Let’s configure dhcp client in the other pc.

24

00:03:01.838  -->  00:03:11.152
Here we can see that this is also success.
Next this is also vlan 10, here also success,

25

00:03:11.636  -->  00:03:22.764
Next let’s try here. This is also
success, the ip address is 192.168.10.5.

26

00:03:23.624  -->  00:03:32.577
Last, let’s configure for vlan 10 in room 3,
okay here success, the ip address is 10.6,

27

00:03:33.331  -->  00:03:39.804
and last here this is also
success. The ip address is 10.7.

28

00:03:40.451  -->  00:03:45.840
Okay so now the dhcp server
configuration for vlan 10 is done.

29

00:03:46.345  -->  00:03:58.310
Next let’s configure dhcp server for vlan 1.
Ip dhcp pool vlan1, the network is 192.168.1.0

30

00:03:58.612  -->  00:04:08.683
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0. The default
router is the ip address of router for vlan 1,

31

00:04:09.065  -->  00:04:17.750
which is 192.168.1.1. and
the dns server is 8.8.8.8.

32

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:32.325
Next for vlan 20. Ip dhcp pool vlan 20.
The network is 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0,

33

00:04:32.720  -->  00:04:41.057
default router 192.168.20.1,
and then dns-server 8.8.8.8.

34

00:04:41.412  -->  00:04:56.638
Last for vlan 30, ip dhcp pool vlan 30.
Network 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0

35

00:04:57.464  -->  00:05:06.457
default router 192.168.30.1,
and dns-server 8.8.8.8

36

00:05:07.370  -->  00:05:12.377
Okay now we have done configuring
dhcp server for all vlan.

37

00:05:12.997  -->  00:05:17.006
Now let’s configure dhcp client on all pc.

38

00:05:18.665  -->  00:05:24.000
I will speed up the video until the
configuration off all pc is done.

39

00:05:28.717  -->  00:05:35.219
Okay so now all pc can get an ip address
automatically from dhcp server.

40

00:05:35.801  -->  00:05:40.392
I think enough for this video and see you on the next video!
