00:00:01.360  -->  00:00:06.960
In this video, we are going to start building
our Web Base Network Automation Application.

2

00:00:07.280  -->  00:00:09.180
Okay let’s just start.

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:14.440
Let’s open the command prompt. Let’s
create a new project.

4

00:00:24.800  -->  00:00:31.380
Let’s try to dir.  Here we can see that we
have a new folder with the same name as our project.

5

00:00:31.380  -->  00:00:34.020
Let’s cd to this directory.

6

00:00:37.100  -->  00:00:39.680
Now let’s create a new app.

7

00:00:50.060  -->  00:00:55.880
Okay now we have a new app. In this video,
we are going to display hello world.

8

00:00:55.980  -->  00:01:03.820
Let’s open the code editor. First, we need
to register our new app to settings.py.

9

00:01:10.580  -->  00:01:15.900
Here in the INSTALLED_APPS, let’s register the
network_automation apps.

10

00:01:19.620  -->  00:01:23.180
Next, let’s edit urls.py file.

11

00:01:24.520  -->  00:01:27.120
Let’s remove
unnecessary script.

12

00:01:29.720  -->  00:01:32.740
And we need to import include here

13

00:01:35.640  -->  00:01:43.960
Let’s add a new path. In this case we use
root url. And then include network_automation.urls,

14

00:01:44.080  -->  00:01:47.180
network_automation is the name of our app.

15

00:01:49.720  -->  00:01:55.680
Next, we need to create urls.py file inside
network_automation directory.

16

00:02:02.240  -->  00:02:07.800
We can just copy and paste from urls.py file inside our
project directory.

17

00:02:10.960  -->  00:02:17.500
We don’t need admin here. We can just delete
it. We also don’t need include.

18

00:02:23.360  -->  00:02:26.960
Now let’s change this to views.home.

19

00:02:32.780  -->  00:02:36.500
Because we use views here, so we need to import
it.

20

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:47.620
Now let’s create home function in views.

21

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:53.440
Let’s import HttpResponse first.

22

00:02:57.800  -->  00:03:00.640
Now let’s create the home function

23

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:10.740
We will just return a simple html expression
to show hello world here.

24

00:03:19.480  -->  00:03:27.600
Let’s run our project. Open the command
prompt and type python manage.py runserver

25

00:03:32.460  -->  00:03:37.700
Let’s open the browser and navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000.

26

00:03:41.000  -->  00:03:45.860
Okay, now we get Hello World!
This is the end of this video.

27

00:03:45.860  -->  00:03:49.900
In the next video we are going to add a bootstrap to our project.

28

00:03:50.080  -->  00:03:53.500
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
