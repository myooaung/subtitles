00:00:00.291  -->  00:00:08.698
In this section, we are going to start learn about
network automation. We will use paramiko first.

2

00:00:09.216  -->  00:00:14.576
In the previous video, we already
learn how to install python package.

3

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:22.423
And now we already have paramiko,
let’s check it, pip3 freeze,

4

00:00:27.019  -->  00:00:30.693
Here we can see that we already have paramiko.

5

00:00:31.259  -->  00:00:37.986
To make sure that paramiko is installed
correctly, we can go to python interpreter,

6

00:00:39.123  -->  00:00:42.041
and then try to import paramiko.

7

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:52.114
If we don’t get an error like this, so
paramiko is installed correctly. Exit here.

8

00:00:53.339  -->  00:00:58.970
Go to sublime, let’s create a new folder here,

9

00:01:01.843  -->  00:01:04.903
let’s say lab-paramiko.

10

00:01:06.950  -->  00:01:16.461
Inside lab-paramiko, let’s create new
file, let’s say paramiko_basic.py.

11

00:01:20.211  -->  00:01:35.253
Save this, let’s check in the ubuntu server,
here we can see that we have folder lab_paramiko,

12

00:01:35.664  -->  00:01:43.863
let’s see inside lab_paramiko, here we can
see that we also have paramiko_basic.py.

13

00:01:44.766  -->  00:01:50.172
Now let’s write a python script to do network automation.

14

00:01:50.639  -->  00:01:54.343
I already write the script to do network automation,

15

00:01:54.784  -->  00:02:02.061
so I will just copy and paste the script,
and then I will explain the script to you.

16

00:02:03.283  -->  00:02:11.720
Okay this is the script, we have 24 lines
of code here. Let’s learn this code.

17

00:02:12.200  -->  00:02:19.685
First, here we import the paramiko. Here
we also import package time and getpass.

18

00:02:20.347  -->  00:02:25.197
So this is some package that we
are going to use in this code.

19

00:02:26.403  -->  00:02:35.494
Paramiko is not installed by default, so we
need to install it using pip3 install paramiko

20

00:02:35.494  -->  00:02:38.165
like we do in the previous video.

21

00:02:38.723  -->  00:02:46.138
But time and getpass is installed by default,
so we don’t need to install it anymore.

22

00:02:47.043  -->  00:02:52.514
we will talk more about the
function of time and getpass later.

23

00:02:53.024  -->  00:03:00.933
For paramiko, the point is, we will use
paramiko to remote the router using ssh.

24

00:03:01.579  -->  00:03:07.426
For example, in the normal way,
if we want to remote the router,

25

00:03:07.426  -->  00:03:16.711
we can open a terminal and then type ssh
username@ the ip address of the router.

26

00:03:17.024  -->  00:03:23.671
and then we need to type the password
and we success ssh to the router.

27

00:03:25.579  -->  00:03:28.693
Okay, so that is the normal way.

28

00:03:29.030  -->  00:03:36.317
Now, if we want to do network automation,
we need to remote the router from python.

29

00:03:36.934  -->  00:03:43.111
Paramiko is a package to remote
the router using ssh from python.

30

00:03:44.384  -->  00:03:48.151
Next here we ask input from user,

31

00:03:48.520  -->  00:03:55.605
and then the data that inputed by user
will be saved in the ip_address variable.

32

00:03:56.275  -->  00:04:02.810
Here we also ask an input from user
and save the data to username variable.

33

00:04:03.630  -->  00:04:07.450
For the password, we use getpass library,

34

00:04:08.003  -->  00:04:18.453
so getpass.getpass. This is means that we
call getpass function inside getpass library.

35

00:04:19.259  -->  00:04:23.818
So the first getpass is the
name of the library or package,

36

00:04:24.035  -->  00:04:30.336
and the second getpass is the name of
the function inside getpass library.

37

00:04:30.651  -->  00:04:33.160
What is the function of this script?

38

00:04:33.598  -->  00:04:38.607
This is same as input, but the differences is,

39

00:04:38.694  -->  00:04:44.730
if we use getpass, everything that we
type will not shown in the terminal.

40

00:04:45.240  -->  00:04:54.336
Let’s try it, go to python
interpreter, let’s try input first,

41

00:04:54.849  -->  00:05:03.733
Ip_address = input and then ip address. Enter.

42

00:05:03.918  -->  00:05:14.453
Here we need to input the ip address, let’s
say 192.168.1.1, let’s print the ip_address,

43

00:05:18.544  -->  00:05:25.709
okay here we can see that the
value of ip_address is 192.168.1.1

44

00:05:26.483  -->  00:05:32.053
Now let’s try to use getpass,
let’s import it first,

45

00:05:36.624  -->  00:05:43.647
And then password getpass.getpass, enter this,

46

00:05:43.899  -->  00:05:49.204
Here we can type the password, let’s say 123.

47

00:05:49.867  -->  00:05:54.412
Here we can see that we can not see
anything that we type.

48

00:05:54.412  -->  00:05:59.634
Let’s just enter here, and then let’s print the password.

49

00:06:00.323  -->  00:06:08.544
Here we can see that the value of password is
123. So remember that the function of getpass

50

00:06:08.544  -->  00:06:15.789
is just like input, but everything that
we type will not shown in the terminal.

51

00:06:16.963  -->  00:06:22.071
Okay, then here we create a variable ssh_client,

52

00:06:22.680  -->  00:06:28.085
this variable is a ssh client
function from paramiko.

53

00:06:30.131  -->  00:06:38.896
Next here we define set missing host key
policy auto add policy. This is means

54

00:06:38.896  -->  00:06:44.306
that we add the key from the router
automatically to the ubuntu server.

55

00:06:44.667  -->  00:06:53.826
If you remember, when we remote a router for the
first time, we need to type yes. Let’s scroll,

56

00:06:55.627  -->  00:07:03.802
Here we can see that we remote router 3,
and here we need to type yes to continue.

57

00:07:04.294  -->  00:07:07.733
So that is the function of this script.

58

00:07:09.288  -->  00:07:18.823
Next, here we connect to the router. Here we
have hostname, this is argument from paramiko.

59

00:07:19.334  -->  00:07:28.047
So we need to use hostname, we can not change
this, the hostname is ip_address variable.

60

00:07:28.238  -->  00:07:35.714
This is a variable that we already created
before. The username is username variable,

61

00:07:36.779  -->  00:07:40.466
and the password is password variable.

62

00:07:41.203  -->  00:07:50.410
If the variable that you create is not username,
let’s say user, so here will not username,

63

00:07:50.534  -->  00:07:58.213
but user. So remember that this is
based on variable that we have created.

64

00:07:58.798  -->  00:08:09.358
Let’s say again the variable is not password,
but passw, so here we also need to use passw.

65

00:08:10.840  -->  00:08:15.000
Here we print that we success
login to the ip address,

66

00:08:15.278  -->  00:08:20.442
so remember that this the variable
that we have created before.

67

00:08:21.246  -->  00:08:27.906
Next here we invoke shell, this is
means that we go to the cisco shell.

68

00:08:28.440  -->  00:08:31.893
After that, we can type the cisco command,

69

00:08:32.478  -->  00:08:35.634
Herer we can see configure terminal,

70

00:08:35.634  -->  00:08:46.298
and then backslash n, this is means enter, so
here we type configure terminal and then enter.

71

00:08:46.846  -->  00:08:55.734
Next here we create interface loopbcak0,
and don’t forget to enter, the ip address

72

00:08:55.734  -->  00:09:07.654
is 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255, once again,
don’t forget to use backslash n or enter.

73

00:09:08.379  -->  00:09:15.155
So the point is, this script is used to
create interface loopback 0 in the router,

74

00:09:15.155  -->  00:09:20.466
and the ip address for loopback0 is 1.1.1.1

75

00:09:21.118  -->  00:09:31.629
But this is public ip address, let’s change this
become private ip address, let’s say 10.1.1.1.

76

00:09:32.878  -->  00:09:36.317
Next here we have time sleep 1,

77

00:09:36.619  -->  00:09:44.533
this is means that the script will stop for 1
second to wait the cisco command is executed.

78

00:09:45.118  -->  00:09:49.174
May be some of you have a question, how if we not

79

00:09:49.174  -->  00:09:55.813
use time sleep? We will answer that
question later in the next video.

80

00:09:56.563  -->  00:10:02.114
Okay, next here we save the
output to the output variable.

81

00:10:02.606  -->  00:10:11.389
Here 65535 means that we save 65535 character.

82

00:10:12.089  -->  00:10:20.213
And then decode here. In python3,
the type of the outuput is byte,

83

00:10:20.454  -->  00:10:24.442
so we need to decode the result like this.

84

00:10:25.000  -->  00:10:32.082
Later in the next video, we will try to
remove this decode and see what happened.

85

00:10:33.184  -->  00:10:40.661
Here we print the output. And last,
here we close the ssh connection.

86

00:10:41.254  -->  00:10:42.608
Save this.

87

00:10:43.166  -->  00:10:49.280
If we see circle black like this, this is
means that the script is not saved yet,

88

00:10:50.240  -->  00:10:55.487
if we already save the script, the
circle black will gone like this.

89

00:10:56.360  -->  00:11:11.242
Now let’s go to ubuntu server, exit, ls, let’s go
to lab paramiko directory, cd lab_paramiko. Ls,

90

00:11:11.782  -->  00:11:20.114
Here we can see paramiko_basic.py, this Is
the script that we just create in the sublime.

91

00:11:20.680  -->  00:11:29.018
Let’s run this script, but before that, let’s make
sure that the router is don’t have loopback0 yet,

92

00:11:29.352  -->  00:11:37.428
let’s check on router1, show ip interface brief.

93

00:11:41.603  -->  00:11:44.890
Here we can see that we have fast ethernet,

94

00:11:46.195  -->  00:11:51.757
a lot of serial interface, but
we don’t have loopback0 yet.

95

00:11:52.360  -->  00:11:54.903
Now let’s run the script,

96

00:11:55.198  -->  00:11:59.476
Python3 paramiko_basic.py,

97

00:12:00.144  -->  00:12:08.379
Let’s remote the router 1, so the ip address
is 10.10.10.1, the username is cisco,

98

00:12:08.379  -->  00:12:11.383
and the password is also cisco.

99

00:12:11.979  -->  00:12:20.415
Here we can see that we are success login to
10.10.10.1, and here we can see the configuration,

100

00:12:20.755  -->  00:12:32.888
configure terminal, interface loopback0, and
the ip address is 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.255.

101

00:12:33.480  -->  00:12:38.855
this is means that we are success
send this configuration to router 1.

102

00:12:39.947  -->  00:12:46.749
Let’s check on router 1 again,
do show ip interface brief.

103

00:12:49.123  -->  00:12:57.807
Here we can see that now we have
loopback0, the ip address is 10.1.1.1

104

00:12:58.355  -->  00:13:04.602
Okay so now we are success to do
network automation using python.

105

00:13:05.000  -->  00:13:12.564
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn more about time sleep.

106

00:13:12.974  -->  00:13:16.808
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
