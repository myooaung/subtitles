00:00:00.525  -->  00:00:05.304
In the previous video, we have done configuring
default route on router 3.

2

00:00:05.941  -->  00:00:16.115
Next in this video, we are going to configure nat so all client will
able to ping to internet. Okay let’s just start.

3

00:00:18.735  -->  00:00:23.480
To configure nat, first
we need to define the private ip address

4

00:00:23.480  -->  00:00:31.297
using access list. In this case, the
private ip address is vlan 10 and vlan 20,

5

00:00:31.936  -->  00:00:39.000
Let’s create the access list,
access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0

6

00:00:41.706  -->  00:00:51.955
0.0.0.255, this is for vlan 10,
next let’s also create for vlan 20,

7

00:00:52.506  -->  00:01:00.302
Access-list 1 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255.

8

00:01:01.485  -->  00:01:09.839
Next, to configure nat, the command
is ip nat inside source list 1

9

00:01:10.305  -->  00:01:18.835
interface this is the public interface,
which is fa0/0, and then overload.

10

00:01:19.616  -->  00:01:28.938
This command means, that the router will doing a
nat from list 1, list 1 is vlan 10 and vlan 20,

11

00:01:29.327  -->  00:01:40.590
so vlan 10 and vlan 20 will be translated to the
ip address of fa0/0. In this case 10.20.20.2.

12

00:01:41.557  -->  00:01:49.330
so now if the client go to internet, the
original source address is 192.168.10.2,

13

00:01:49.585  -->  00:01:57.877
but after pass the router, the source
address will be translated to 10.20.20.2

14

00:02:01.745  -->  00:02:08.408
and then overload means that many private
ip address will be translated to only one

15

00:02:08.408  -->  00:02:15.147
public ip address, here we can see that we
have many client with private ip address,

16

00:02:15.598  -->  00:02:18.827
but we only have 1 public ip address.

17

00:02:19.456  -->  00:02:28.347
So we need to use overload here, to translate many
private ip address become 1 public ip address.

18

00:02:29.536  -->  00:02:36.138
Next we need to define all of interface
become nat inside or nat outside.

19

00:02:36.788  -->  00:02:43.590
Let’s start with fa0/0, so interface fa0/0

20

00:02:44.320  -->  00:02:54.000
This interface is connected to the internet, so
this will be nat outside, so here ip nat outside.

21

00:02:55.046  -->  00:03:05.046
Next, go to sub interface for vlan 10, interface
fa0/1.10, this interface is connected to internal,

22

00:03:05.440  -->  00:03:13.516
so we need to define this interface become
nat inside, the command is ip nat inside.

23

00:03:14.396  -->  00:03:24.879
Let’s also define sub interface for vlan 20 as
nat inside, interface fa0/1.20, ip nat inside.

24

00:03:25.846  -->  00:03:28.357
Okay we have done configuring nat.

25

00:03:28.806  -->  00:03:38.269
Now let’s try ping from client to internet or
google, pc0 to gooogle, okay this is success.

26

00:03:39.725  -->  00:03:54.378
Let’s also test from vlan 20, ping
172.16.10.2, okay this is also success.

27

00:03:55.118  -->  00:03:58.466
Okay so now we have done configuring nat.

28

00:03:58.785  -->  00:04:01.101
I think enough for this video

29

00:04:01.307  -->  00:04:04.593
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video .
