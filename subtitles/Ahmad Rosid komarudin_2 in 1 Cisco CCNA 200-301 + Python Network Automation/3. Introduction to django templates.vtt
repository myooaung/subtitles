In the previous video, we already learned about
urls and views in Django.

2

00:00:06.080  -->  00:00:16.360
Now in this video, we are going to learn about templates in Django.
Okay let’s start. Open the visual studio code

3

00:00:19.680  -->  00:00:26.840
Here in views.py we can see that the
function just return simple html expressions.

4

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:33.100
If we use this method, we will get a problem
when we want to render complex page.

5

00:00:33.480  -->  00:00:43.320
We can't put large html syntax here. That’s not effective.
This is best practice to work with templates.

6

00:00:43.640  -->  00:00:49.960
So, if we work in the team, the front end
developer can work easily without touch the

7

00:00:49.960  -->  00:00:56.660
Django code, they can focus on html, css,
and javascript code.

8

00:00:58.240  -->  00:01:06.720
Okay, I will show you how to use templates
in Django. First, we need to define the directory

9

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:13.720
where we will save our templates in settings.py,
in the Templates section.

10

00:01:21.460  -->  00:01:27.840
Now let’s create templates directory. Please
notice that templates directory must in the

11

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:31.580
same level as our project and app directory.

12

00:01:40.900  -->  00:01:44.340
Okay now we have templates directory

13

00:01:44.600  -->  00:01:54.480
Now let’s modify views.py file. Here we will
not return the html expressions anymore

14

00:01:54.700  -->  00:01:58.860
We will return render and the template files.

15

00:02:12.000  -->  00:02:15.000
Here we can see the hello_world function

16

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:18.020
will return hello_world.html.

17

00:02:18.600  -->  00:02:23.980
Now let’s create hello_world.html inside
templates directory.

18

00:02:30.340  -->  00:02:36.680
You can write a simple html file in here, in this case I just want
to print Hello World.

19

00:02:45.880  -->  00:02:50.920
Now let’s go to browser, navigate to app1/hello_world.

20

00:02:57.240  -->  00:03:00.580
Here we can see that we get hello world.

21

00:03:00.840  -->  00:03:08.400
This display is generated by our template.
To make sure, let’s add some html syntax

22

00:03:08.400  -->  00:03:14.020
in the template file. Let's say we want to add Welcome to Django.

23

00:03:23.540  -->  00:03:31.960
Back to browser, refresh,
and here we can see that we get Hello world

24

00:03:31.960  -->  00:03:38.760
and Welcome to Django. Okay this is mean that
our template file is work!

25

00:03:39.100  -->  00:03:47.280
Now let’s manipulate all of function inside
views.py to use templates. We will use a.html

26

00:03:47.340  -->  00:04:02.480
for function A, and b.html for function B.

27

00:04:09.660  -->  00:04:14.640
Now let’s create a.html &amp; b.html

28

00:04:21.800  -->  00:04:30.800
Let’s just copy and paste from hello_world.html
to a.html &amp; b.html.

29

00:04:31.560  -->  00:04:41.760
For b.html, I want to display This is B, and for a.html, I want
display This is A.

30

00:04:46.120  -->  00:04:56.640
Let’s back to the browser. Let’s go to
a, here we can see that we get This is A,

31

00:04:56.880  -->  00:05:04.300
let’s go to b, and here we can see that
we get This is B.

32

00:05:04.300  -->  00:05:09.180
Congratuliation! Now we are able to use templates
in Django.

33

00:05:09.180  -->  00:05:16.820
In the next video we are going to learn about context. Thank you for watching
and see you on the next video.
