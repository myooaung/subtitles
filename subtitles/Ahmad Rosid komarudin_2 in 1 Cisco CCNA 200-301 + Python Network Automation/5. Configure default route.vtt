00:00:00.618  -->  00:00:04.952
In the previous video, we already learn about
the concept of nat.

2

00:00:05.496  -->  00:00:11.919
Now in this video, we are going to learn how to configure nat. Let’s just start.

3

00:00:12.699  -->  00:00:18.144
But before configuring nat, first, we need
to configure default route.

4

00:00:19.822  -->  00:00:20.743
What is that?

5

00:00:21.288  -->  00:00:28.592
Actually default route is a static route,
but the destination will be all network.

6

00:00:29.500  -->  00:00:36.837
So for example, from router 2 want to go to
google, if we configure static route,

7

00:00:36.837  -->  00:00:44.930
the destination network will be 172.16.10.0/24,

8

00:00:44.930  -->  00:00:56.220
but if we configure default route, the network
will be all network, which is 0.0.0.0/0, usually

9

00:00:56.220  -->  00:01:01.260
default route is configured on the customer
router to internet.

10

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:05.640
Because in the internet, the network is very
much.

11

00:01:05.640  -->  00:01:12.060
There is impossible to add static routing
to each network one by one, for example in

12

00:01:12.060  -->  00:01:19.540
the internet there is a network of google,
facebook, youtube, twitter, Instagram, and

13

00:01:19.540  -->  00:01:21.260
others.

14

00:01:21.260  -->  00:01:28.510
So once again, this is impossible to add static
routing one by one to specific network.

15

00:01:28.510  -->  00:01:31.850
This is why we will configure default route.

16

00:01:31.850  -->  00:01:39.200
Let’s just start, let’s see the routing
table first, do show ip route, here we can

17

00:01:39.200  -->  00:01:43.420
see that we don’t have a route to go to
google yet.

18

00:01:43.420  -->  00:01:51.920
Now let’s configure default route, configure
terminal, ip route and then the destination

19

00:01:51.920  -->  00:02:03.860
network is all network, which is 0.0.0.0 and
then the subnetmask is 0.0.0.0,

20

00:02:03.860  -->  00:02:10.869
And then the next hop is the ISP, which is
10.20.20.1

21

00:02:10.869  -->  00:02:18.730
Okay we have done, now router3 should be able
to communicate with google, let’s try, do

22

00:02:18.730  -->  00:02:31.220
ping 172.16.10.2, okay here we can see that
this is success.

23

00:02:31.220  -->  00:02:38.269
But from the client, the ping should be failed.

24

00:02:38.269  -->  00:02:48.969
Let’s try, okay this is failed.

25

00:02:48.969  -->  00:02:54.629
Remember that we need to configure nat on
the customer router so all client will able

26

00:02:54.629  -->  00:02:58.030
to ping to internet or google.

27

00:02:58.030  -->  00:03:03.709
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure nat, so all

28

00:03:03.709  -->  00:03:06.239
client will able to ping to the internet.

29

00:03:06.239  -->  00:03:09.989
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video .
