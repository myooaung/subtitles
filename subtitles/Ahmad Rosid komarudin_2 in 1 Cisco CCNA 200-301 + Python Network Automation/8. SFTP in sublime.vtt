00:00:00.729  -->  00:00:05.571
In the previous video, we have done
creating a topology like this.

2

00:00:05.778  -->  00:00:13.675
So here we have ubuntu server inside virtualbox.
This ubuntu server is connected to internet,

3

00:00:13.919  -->  00:00:20.950
connected to router inside gns3, and
also connected to host os or our laptop.

4

00:00:21.575  -->  00:00:30.933
If you remember, we also able to remote the ubuntu
server from our laptop using ssh. Let’s check it,

5

00:00:32.650  -->  00:00:36.002
here, we are in the mac os terminal,

6

00:00:36.085  -->  00:00:43.717
but this is the ubuntu prompt. This is means
that we remote the ubuntu server from our laptop.

7

00:00:44.148  -->  00:00:48.442
This ubuntu server will used
to do network automation.

8

00:00:48.736  -->  00:00:53.607
we will write a network automation
script here in the ubuntu server.

9

00:00:54.193  -->  00:00:59.538
So we need to make sure that python
is installed in the ubuntu server.

10

00:01:00.079  -->  00:01:07.436
Let’s type pyt and then tab. Here we
can see that we already have python3.

11

00:01:07.919  -->  00:01:16.196
Let’s enter here, okay this is
python version 3.8.2. Let’s exit.

12

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:25.878
To write the python script, we have multiple
way. First, we can use text editor from ubuntu,

13

00:01:25.878  -->  00:01:35.784
which is nano. Let’s try, nano and then
the file name, let’s say script1.py.

14

00:01:37.113  -->  00:01:46.431
Okay we are in the nano text editor, let’s write
python script here, let’s say print hello python.

15

00:01:47.930  -->  00:01:50.916
Print hello world, and others.

16

00:01:53.353  -->  00:02:06.247
Save this, ctrl + x, y, enter. Let’s ls here,
here we can see that we have script1.py,

17

00:02:06.662  -->  00:02:08.379
let’s run this script.

18

00:02:08.593  -->  00:02:17.179
Python script1.py. here we can see that
we get hello python and hello world.

19

00:02:17.638  -->  00:02:25.447
Another way, we can use sublime text.
Sublime text is a desktop text editor,

20

00:02:25.718  -->  00:02:32.859
this is means that the sublime text is
running on host os, not in the guest os,

21

00:02:33.359  -->  00:02:40.768
because the ubuntu server is cli, so we can
not install sublime in the ubuntu server.

22

00:02:41.731  -->  00:02:47.856
So now the question is, how we
can edit the script on our laptop,

23

00:02:47.856  -->  00:02:51.979
but the script will also
saved on the ubuntu server.

24

00:02:52.684  -->  00:02:57.938
This is what we are going to learn
in this video, let’s just start.

25

00:02:58.364  -->  00:03:03.582
To do that, we need to install
additional package in sublime text.

26

00:03:04.753  -->  00:03:10.768
Here in the sublime text, type ctrl + shift + p.

27

00:03:11.513  -->  00:03:19.925
Or if you use mac, you need to type command
+ shift + p. But in the windows or linux,

28

00:03:19.925  -->  00:03:24.043
we need to type ctrl + shift + p.

29

00:03:26.284  -->  00:03:32.288
Here let’s type install and then
choose install package control.

30

00:03:32.851  -->  00:03:35.870
You can click here or just enter.

31

00:03:36.490  -->  00:03:44.179
Wait for a minute. Okay here we get a message that
package control was successfully installed.

32

00:03:45.798  -->  00:03:53.545
Ctrl + shift + p again, here let’s
choose package control: install package.

33

00:03:56.451  -->  00:04:00.944
Here we can see some package that
we can install in sublime text.

34

00:04:03.947  -->  00:04:12.238
Let’s search for sftp. This is the package
that we are going to install. Click here.

35

00:04:15.582  -->  00:04:20.796
Okay here we get a message that
sftp is successfully installed.

36

00:04:21.536  -->  00:04:29.711
Now let’s setup the sftp. First, we need
to open empty folder in the sublime.

37

00:04:32.295  -->  00:04:39.032
File open, and here we can
choose the empty folder.

38

00:04:56.267  -->  00:05:05.413
Right click here, here we have a choice
sftp or ftp. Choose map to remote.

39

00:05:05.828  -->  00:05:10.185
Here we need to define the
information about ubuntu server.

40

00:05:10.993  -->  00:05:20.185
So the host is the ip address of
ubuntu server, which is 192.168.56.2.

41

00:05:23.175  -->  00:05:31.305
and then the username is ubuntu, and then
here for the password, let’s remove the slash.

42

00:05:31.690  -->  00:05:38.825
This slash means comment. And then here
let’s type the password of ubuntu server.

43

00:05:39.175  -->  00:05:42.797
I will change the password of ubuntu server first.

44

00:05:52.947  -->  00:05:58.173
Let’s back to sublime text.
And type the password here.

45

00:06:01.398  -->  00:06:06.133
And then remote path, this is
the path in the ubuntu server.

46

00:06:06.507  -->  00:06:12.327
so later, the local path will be synchronize
to the path in the ubuntu server.

47

00:06:12.850  -->  00:06:17.659
Let’s say I will synchronize to the
home directory in the ubuntu server.

48

00:06:18.074  -->  00:06:24.391
Let’s type pwd here. The path is /home/ubuntu.

49

00:06:27.015  -->  00:06:30.549
So here let’s put /home/ubuntu.

50

00:06:33.735  -->  00:06:39.676
You can see the configuration here and change
some configuration that you want to change.

51

00:06:41.760  -->  00:06:45.739
In this case, I want to change this configuration,

52

00:06:46.193  -->  00:06:52.891
upload on save. This is means that the sublime
will upload the file to the ubuntu server

53

00:06:52.891  -->  00:07:00.290
when we save the file. The default is
false, let’s change this become true.

54

00:07:02.187  -->  00:07:11.466
We have done here, save this. Right
click here in the folder, sftp,

55

00:07:11.685  -->  00:07:19.333
synchronize remote to local. This is means we
synchronize from the ubuntu server to our laptop.

56

00:07:21.342  -->  00:07:29.840
Here we can see that we connect to
192.168.56.2 as ubuntu, wait for a minute.

57

00:07:35.690  -->  00:07:41.817
Here we can see some file from ubuntu
server that will synchronized to our laptop.

58

00:07:43.936  -->  00:07:51.351
Oh I am sorry, this is cancel when I
click here. Right click again, sftp,

59

00:07:51.351  -->  00:07:54.236
and then synchronize remote to local

60

00:07:54.771  -->  00:07:59.055
Here we can see some file that will
downloaded to our laptop.

61

00:07:59.589  -->  00:08:10.265
But here we can see some file that we don’t need in our
laptop, .ssh/config, .ssh/known_hosts and others.

62

00:08:10.816  -->  00:08:13.516
So in this case, I will choose no.

63

00:08:16.073  -->  00:08:24.256
Here in the sftp configuration, we have
ignore regex. We can put file or directory

64

00:08:24.256  -->  00:08:34.539
that we don’t want to synchronize here. In
this case, we want to ignore .ssh. save.

65

00:08:35.222  -->  00:08:47.676
Let’s try to synchronize again. Here we can see
that .ssh is not downloaded anymore. Yes here.

66

00:08:48.319  -->  00:08:54.893
Okay we have done, here we can
see that now we have script1.py,

67

00:08:55.285  -->  00:08:59.533
this is the script that we write
in the ubuntu server before.

68

00:09:00.000  -->  00:09:02.156
Let’s try to edit this,

69

00:09:02.673  -->  00:09:10.529
Print hello java. Save this,
here we can just cancel it.

70

00:09:12.165  -->  00:09:14.076
Back to the terminal,

71

00:09:16.771  -->  00:09:25.942
ls, here we can see that we only have script1.py,
may be some of you have a question,

72

00:09:26.200  -->  00:09:32.101
why when we synchronize in the sublime,
we get a lot of file?

73

00:09:32.677  -->  00:09:44.848
This is because, file that started by dot is hidden file, to
see hidden file in ubuntu, we can use ls -a.

74

00:09:45.724  -->  00:09:52.876
Okay here we can see many file that
started by dot, this is means hidden file.

75

00:09:53.793  -->  00:09:57.060
Okay now let’s run script1.py,

76

00:10:01.204  -->  00:10:05.494
here we can see that now we have hello java.

77

00:10:05.873  -->  00:10:10.922
Remember that we add hello java
from our laptop in the sublime text.

78

00:10:11.313  -->  00:10:19.596
So now when we edit from sublime text, the file
will be saved automatically on ubuntu server.

79

00:10:20.135  -->  00:10:27.951
Let’s try to create new file from
sublime text. Let’s say script2.py,

80

00:10:29.804  -->  00:10:40.368
write a python script here, let’s say print
hello java and then print hello python. Save.

81

00:10:40.667  -->  00:10:48.819
Now let’s go to ubuntu, ls, here
we can see that we have script2.py,

82

00:10:50.000  -->  00:10:55.294
let’s run this script, python script2.py.

83

00:10:56.073  -->  00:11:00.288
Okay here we get hello java and hello python.

84

00:11:00.879  -->  00:11:04.916
So now we can edit the script in the sublime text,

85

00:11:05.205  -->  00:11:09.881
and the script will be automatically
saved in the ubuntu server.

86

00:11:10.576  -->  00:11:15.469
I think enough for this video. In the
next video, we are going to learn

87

00:11:15.469  -->  00:11:18.575
how to install package in python.

88

00:11:18.971  -->  00:11:22.774
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
