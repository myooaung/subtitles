00:00:00.253  -->  00:00:06.099
In the previous video, we have done create
the most simple computer network in Cisco Packet Tracer,

2

00:00:06.099  -->  00:00:12.000
which is connecting two
computer. Here we have PC 0 and PC 1,

3

00:00:12.045  -->  00:00:20.663
and these two PC is connected using UTP
cable. The IP Address of PC 0 is 192.168.1.1,

4

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:25.939
and the IP Address of PC 1 is 192.168.1.2

5

00:00:26.871  -->  00:00:34.054
Now, in this video we are going to learn more
detail about IP Address. If you forget about IP

6

00:00:34.054  -->  00:00:40.876
Address, I already say in the previous video
that IP Address is the name of computer

7

00:00:40.876  -->  00:00:47.752
in the computer network. Computer will use IP
Address to communicate with other computers.

8

00:00:48.576  -->  00:00:56.795
IP Address is consist of 4 parts of number.
Let’s say x.x.x.x

9

00:00:57.410  -->  00:01:03.522
and each part of IP Address is number between 0 and 255.

10

00:01:04.176  -->  00:01:12.000
So there is impossible to have minus number in
IP Address. It is also impossible to have number

11

00:01:12.000  -->  00:01:22.263
more than 255 in IP Address. So, remember that the
number in IP Address always between 0 and 255.

12

00:01:22.640  -->  00:01:30.434
The example of IP Address is that we
used in the previous video, which is 192.168.1.1.

13

00:01:31.280  -->  00:01:38.926
So actually the number is not always 192,
you can use any number between 0 and 255.

14

00:01:39.627  -->  00:01:47.065
And then, in the IP Address we also have
a slash like this, here I have /24.

15

00:01:47.690  -->  00:01:58.280
Slash in IP Address like this is called prefix.
So the prefix for this IP Address is /24.

16

00:01:59.035  -->  00:02:07.085
So what is the function of prefix? Prefix is used
to tell us how many IP Address that we can use.

17

00:02:07.686  -->  00:02:15.448
In this case, the total IP Address that
we can use for prefix /24 is 256.

18

00:02:16.311  -->  00:02:24.216
If you don’t know how to get 256 yet, don’t worry,
we will learn more about this in the next video.

19

00:02:24.907  -->  00:02:31.185
The only thing that you need to know for now
is, that prefix is used to tell us how many IP

20

00:02:31.185  -->  00:02:40.349
Address that we can use. And in this case
we can have 256 IP Address in prefix /24,

21

00:02:41.360  -->  00:02:46.008
so we can have 256 computers in our computer network.

22

00:02:47.120  -->  00:02:55.216
Next, we will also learn about Subnetting. So what
is Subnetting? Subnetting is used to determine

23

00:02:55.216  -->  00:03:02.500
the best prefix we can use in the computer network. Let’s
say we have an office with six computers.

24

00:03:03.696  -->  00:03:12.194
And we want to build a computer network between this six PC.
The question is, which prefix the best we can use?

25

00:03:12.400  -->  00:03:22.221
If we use prefix /24, we know that the Total IP is
256, absolutely this is not suitable for our case.

26

00:03:22.656  -->  00:03:31.925
Because we just need six IP. If we use
prefix /24, we will have 250 IP that not used.

27

00:03:32.561  -->  00:03:40.967
So, which prefix is best for six IP or
six computers? The answer is /29, why?

28

00:03:40.967  -->  00:03:49.592
Because in prefix /29, the Total IP is 8.
This is enough for six IP or six computers.

29

00:03:51.200  -->  00:03:57.846
If you have a question, where we
get 8 from prefix /29? Once again,

30

00:03:57.846  -->  00:04:03.762
you don’t need to worry about that yet, we
will learn more about that in the next video.

31

00:04:04.631  -->  00:04:13.347
Okay so now I hope you understand what is IP
Address, what is prerfix, and what is subnetting.

32

00:04:13.600  -->  00:04:18.085
In the next video, we are going to start learning
about subnetting.

33

00:04:18.445  -->  00:04:21.600
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
