00:00:00.357  -->  00:00:04.670
In this section, we are going
to start learning about routing.

2

00:00:05.324  -->  00:00:11.380
In the simple word, routing is communication
between computer in the different block subnet.

3

00:00:12.409  -->  00:00:21.572
For example, let’s import a router, as
always, I use 2811, let’s also import 2 pc,

4

00:00:24.000  -->  00:00:27.157
and then connecting this two pc to the router.

5

00:00:32.879  -->  00:00:38.257
Remember that router is used to connecting
many pc in the different block subnet,

6

00:00:38.809  -->  00:00:42.842
so this 2 pc must be in
the different block subnet.

7

00:00:43.327  -->  00:00:54.795
Let’s say here we will configure
192.168.1.0/24 and then here 192.168.2.0/24.

8

00:00:55.503  -->  00:01:03.000
Let’s change the name of the pc,
this is pc 2, and this is pc 1.

9

00:01:03.638  -->  00:01:08.868
Let’s configure the ip the ip
address of the pc, start from pc 1,

10

00:01:11.116  -->  00:01:18.922
desktop, ip configuration, the
ip address is 192.168.1.10,

11

00:01:19.638  -->  00:01:25.807
Remember that if computer want to communicate with
others computer in the different block subnet,

12

00:01:25.807  -->  00:01:33.201
so the computer will need a gateway, in this case
the gateway will be the ip address of router,

13

00:01:34.892  -->  00:01:40.687
let’s say the ip address of
router will be 192.168.1.1,

14

00:01:42.293  -->  00:01:48.240
and then the ip address that
connected to pc 2 is 192.168.2.1,

15

00:01:50.560  -->  00:02:01.428
So for pc 1, the gateway will be 192.168.1.1,
and the gateway for pc 2 will be 192.168.2.1

16

00:02:02.329  -->  00:02:10.375
Here for pc 1, the gateway is
192.168.1.1. Next for pc 2,

17

00:02:11.916  -->  00:02:20.522
the ip address is 192.168.2.10,
and the gateway is 192.168.2.1.

18

00:02:21.395  -->  00:02:25.085
Next, let’s configure the
ip address on the router.

19

00:02:27.483  -->  00:02:38.189
No, enable, configure terminal, interface fa0/0,
no shutdown to enable the interface,

20

00:02:38.831  -->  00:02:54.531
okay now the light is green, then ip address 192.168.1.1
255.255.255.0, okay we have done for fa0/0.

21

00:02:55.173  -->  00:03:13.771
Next for fa0/1, int fa0/1, no shutdown, the
ip address is 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0,

22

00:03:15.599  -->  00:03:20.119
Okay now we have done configuring
the ip address in the router,

23

00:03:20.502  -->  00:03:30.903
Now pc 1 and pc 2 should be able to communicate.
Let’s try, ping to pc 2, 192.168.2.10,

24

00:03:34.761  -->  00:03:38.401
okay here we can see that the result is success.

25

00:03:39.769  -->  00:03:44.396
So this is routing, which
is communication between pc

26

00:03:44.396  -->  00:03:48.122
in the different block
subnet or different network.

27

00:03:48.982  -->  00:03:58.734
How routing work? When pc 1 want to send packet
to pc 2, pc 1 will ask the gateway or the router,

28

00:03:59.379  -->  00:04:04.481
"hey router, do you know where is 192.168.2.10?"

29

00:04:06.000  -->  00:04:11.748
When the router recieve a question like
this, the router will check routing table,

30

00:04:12.300  -->  00:04:16.711
To see the routing table, the
command is do show ip route.

31

00:04:18.652  -->  00:04:27.271
Here we can see that we have 2 entry in
the routing table, which is 192.168.1.0/24

32

00:04:27.535  -->  00:04:36.385
in fa0/0, and 192.168.2.0/24 in fa0/1.

33

00:04:37.462  -->  00:04:43.710
Routing table is used to show which
network are able to reach by the router.

34

00:04:45.000  -->  00:04:55.210
In this case router are able to reach
192.168.1.0/24 which is connected to fa0/0,

35

00:04:55.686  -->  00:05:04.855
and also able to reach 192.168.2.0/24
which is connected to fa0/1.

36

00:05:05.875  -->  00:05:14.811
So when pc 1 ping to pc 2, pc 1 will
ask the router where is 192.168.2.10,

37

00:05:17.340  -->  00:05:28.977
the router know that 192.168.2.10 is in the
fa0/1, so the packet will forwarded to fa0/1.

38

00:05:30.281  -->  00:05:35.802
When the packet arrive in pc2,
pc2 will send reply packet,

39

00:05:36.438  -->  00:05:47.201
now the destination is 192.168.1.10 which is the
ip address of pc 1. So pc 2 will ask the router,

40

00:05:47.760  -->  00:05:55.051
"hey router, do you know where is 192.168.1.10?"
the router will see the routing table,

41

00:05:55.350  -->  00:06:07.187
and the router know that 192.168.1.10 is in the
fa0/0, so the packet will be forwarded to fa0/0.

42

00:06:07.792  -->  00:06:09.888
That is how routing work.

43

00:06:10.873  -->  00:06:17.722
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to add 1 more router,

44

00:06:18.320  -->  00:06:21.754
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video.
