00:00:00.392  -->  00:00:05.557
In the previous video, we already learn about sftp
in sublime.

2

00:00:06.939  -->  00:00:16.835
So now we can edit python script from sublime, and when we save the file, the file will automatically saved on ubuntu server.

3

00:00:18.232  -->  00:00:25.837
Next in this video, we are going to learn how to
install python package to do a network automation.

4

00:00:26.632  -->  00:00:31.306
There are many python package that
we can use to do network automation.

5

00:00:31.772  -->  00:00:34.925
But The simplest one is paramiko.

6

00:00:35.693  -->  00:00:39.473
Let’s just see how we can install paramiko.

7

00:00:40.271  -->  00:00:48.448
To install python package, first, we need to
have python package manager, which is pip.

8

00:00:49.482  -->  00:00:59.858
So first, we need to install python pip. Let’s
update first, sudo apt update, type the password.

9

00:01:00.902  -->  00:01:07.057
This is will be update to internet, so make
sure that you have internet connection.

10

00:01:07.802  -->  00:01:09.686
Wait for a minute here.

11

00:01:11.542  -->  00:01:20.251
Now let’s install the python pip, the
command is apt install python3-pip.

12

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:27.267
Here we can see all application
that will be installed,

13

00:01:28.061  -->  00:01:36.925
this will use 200mega of harddrive. Yes
here and then enter. Wait for a minute.

14

00:01:40.192  -->  00:01:48.000
Okay we have done installing pip. To
make sure, we can use pip –version.

15

00:01:50.662  -->  00:01:55.212
Here we have pip version 20.0.2.

16

00:01:56.262  -->  00:01:59.166
Okay now we have python package manager.

17

00:01:59.862  -->  00:02:08.028
Next, We can see all python package that
already installed, using command pip3 freeze.

18

00:02:11.701  -->  00:02:19.146
Here we can see many python package already
installed, but we don’t have paramiko yet.

19

00:02:21.200  -->  00:02:27.747
To install paramiko, the command
is pip3 install paramiko.

20

00:02:36.472  -->  00:02:39.936
Okay done, pip3 freeze again,

21

00:02:44.932  -->  00:02:48.513
here we can see that now we have paramiko.

22

00:02:49.171  -->  00:02:56.006
To make sure that paramiko is installed
correctly, we can go to python interpreter,

23

00:02:56.812  -->  00:03:00.306
and then let’s try to import paramiko here.

24

00:03:01.811  -->  00:03:05.734
Okay this is success. This is means that paramiko

25

00:03:05.734  -->  00:03:13.196
is installed correctly. If the paramiko is
not installed we will get an error here.

26

00:03:13.872  -->  00:03:20.398
Let’s try to import package that not
installed yet. Let’s say netmiko,

27

00:03:21.060  -->  00:03:28.797
netmiko is also python package to do network
automation, but we don’t install netmiko yet.

28

00:03:29.312  -->  00:03:33.335
Let’s try to import it, import netmiko

29

00:03:34.960  -->  00:03:39.535
Here we get an error no module named netmiko.

30

00:03:40.312  -->  00:03:43.008
Okay I think enough for this video

31

00:03:43.314  -->  00:03:46.832
