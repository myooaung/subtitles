00:00:01.020  -->  00:00:07.940
In the previous video, we have created a simple
python script for network automation on cisco router

2

00:00:08.320  -->  00:00:13.680
If you not sure that you understand
what we have covered in the previous video,

3

00:00:13.720  -->  00:00:20.500
I recommend you to back to that video and
play it again. But if you sure that you understand

4

00:00:20.500  -->  00:00:26.580
that topic, you can continue to this video.
In this video, we are going to learn how to

5

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:29.660
doing network automation on mikrotik router.

6

00:00:30.120  -->  00:00:38.280
This is the code that we will use in this
video. I will also show you the code from the previous video

7

00:00:42.960  -->  00:00:46.400
Here we can see that we
don’t have many different.

8

00:00:46.940  -->  00:00:53.720
In the cisco code, we need to import time,
I already explained about time in the previous video

9

00:00:53.720  -->  00:00:58.180
But now, for mikrotik code, we don’t
need to import time

10

00:00:59.400  -->  00:01:06.240
Here we define the ip address, username, and
password of the mikrotik router. We call SSH

11

00:01:06.240  -->  00:01:12.260
Client function from paramiko and then we
connect to the mikrotik router using the ip

12

00:01:12.260  -->  00:01:19.380
address, username, and password that we have
defined before.

13

00:01:21.560  -->  00:01:27.500
The different between this two script is,
that we need to invoke shell in the cisco router

14

00:01:27.860  -->  00:01:34.180
but we don’t in the mikrotik router.
Also the keyword to send the command to the

15

00:01:34.180  -->  00:01:41.640
cisco router is send, but in mikrotik we use
exec_command. And we don’t need to delay

16

00:01:41.640  -->  00:01:48.040
the program in mikrotik, but in cisco, we
must sleep the program or the command will

17

00:01:48.040  -->  00:01:50.640
not send to the router successfully.

18

00:01:51.040  -->  00:01:54.660
Don’t forget to always close the ssh session.

19

00:01:54.660  -->  00:02:06.880
Save the code, open a command prompt, see
that we are in the right directory

20

00:02:07.440  -->  00:02:13.260
Here we can see that we have script2.py. Let’s run
the code.

21

00:02:20.760  -->  00:02:29.760
Okay, we have successfully run the code, In this example code, we will create
a bridge interface in mikrotik

22

00:02:30.660  -->  00:02:36.400
and configure the ip address 10.2.2.1 to that bridge interface.

23

00:02:37.480  -->  00:02:42.360
Let’s go to mikrotik terminal and see if
the script is work.

24

00:02:48.800  -->  00:02:54.480
You can see that now we have bridge interface and new ip address
in the mikrotik

25

00:02:54.480  -->  00:03:02.920
Okay, now we are able to doing Network Automation
on Cisco &amp; Mikrotik routers, In the next video,

26

00:03:02.920  -->  00:03:08.980
we will learn how to doing Network Automation
on Cisco &amp; Mikrotik routers in one code.

27

00:03:08.980  -->  00:03:12.420
Thankyou for watching, and see you on the next
video!
