00:00:00.693  -->  00:00:07.459
In the previous video, we already learn about
inter vlan routing, which is connecting between

2

00:00:07.459  -->  00:00:10.728
pc in the different vlan using router.

3

00:00:11.576  -->  00:00:20.393
And we also already learn about dhcp server,
so all computer can get an ip address automatically.

4

00:00:21.399  -->  00:00:27.239
Now, in this video, we are going to learn
about switch virtual interface.

5

00:00:27.963  -->  00:00:28.778
What is that?

6

00:00:29.361  -->  00:00:36.495
Switch virtual interface or svi is a method
to connecting between pc in the different

7

00:00:36.495  -->  00:00:44.711
vlan without router, but we can using multi
layer switch, or MLS

8

00:00:45.638  -->  00:00:49.704
or some people also call layer 3 switch.

9

00:00:51.038  -->  00:00:58.764
Here we can see that we have two type of switch,
the first one is 2960,

10

00:01:01.943  -->  00:01:05.647
and the second one is 3560.

11

00:01:06.636  -->  00:01:11.295
Here the first number indicate the type of switch.

12

00:01:12.054  -->  00:01:20.601
If the first number is 2 like this, so this
is layer 2 switch, but if the first number

13

00:01:20.601  -->  00:01:25.128
is 3 like this, so this is layer 3 switch.

14

00:01:26.046  -->  00:01:32.199
In the previous video, we already learn that
if we want to connecting between pc in the

15

00:01:32.199  -->  00:01:35.151
different vlan, we need a router.

16

00:01:35.804  -->  00:01:42.353
But now, we are going to learn something new,
which is connecting between pc in the different

17

00:01:42.353  -->  00:01:45.543
vlan using multi layer switch.

18

00:01:46.505  -->  00:01:53.062
If the switch is multi layer switch or layer
3 switch, so we can connecting different network

19

00:01:53.062  -->  00:01:54.228
using switch.

20

00:01:54.705  -->  00:01:59.103
Because the switch have an ability for layer 3.

21

00:01:59.942  -->  00:02:04.934
Remember that layer 3 is connection between
different network.

22

00:02:05.605  -->  00:02:10.017
This is why we call this switch as multi layer
switch.

23

00:02:11.280  -->  00:02:19.614
In cisco switch, if the series number started
by 3, so this is layer 3 switch or multi layer switch.

24

00:02:20.341  -->  00:02:27.379
And if the series number started by 2, this
means that the switch is only layer 2,

25

00:02:27.741  -->  00:02:32.173
which is only use to connecting between pc in the
same network.

26

00:02:33.339  -->  00:02:39.250
If we want to connecting between pc in the
different vlan, we can not use layer 2 switch.

27

00:02:39.771  -->  00:02:46.108
We must use multi layer switch, which is switch
series that started by 3.

28

00:02:47.027  -->  00:02:53.254
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to learn how to connecting

29

00:02:53.254  -->  00:02:57.557
between pc in the different vlan using multi
layer switch.

30

00:02:58.404  -->  00:03:01.709
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
