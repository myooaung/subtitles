00:00:00.555  -->  00:00:06.505
In the previous video, we already learn about
what is IP Address and what is subnetting.

2

00:00:06.695  -->  00:00:11.117
And as I said, now we are going
to learn about subnetting.

3

00:00:11.501  -->  00:00:17.572
But before that, we are going to learn about
Public IP Address and Private IP Address first.

4

00:00:18.127  -->  00:00:24.717
So what is that? Public IP Address is
the IP Address that used in the internet.

5

00:00:25.167  -->  00:00:32.386
For example is the IP Address of google,
facebook, youtube, twitter, and others.

6

00:00:33.291  -->  00:00:36.096
All of that is using Public IP.

7

00:00:36.527  -->  00:00:44.863
Let’s say here we have Internet, and here
we have some server, let’s say facebook.com,

8

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:51.586
youtube.com, google, and others. There is
many server that connected to the internet.

9

00:00:51.716  -->  00:00:57.000
And all of this server is using Public IP Address

10

00:00:57.876  -->  00:01:03.959
The main characteristic of Public IP Address
is that they are accessable from anywhere.

11

00:01:04.353  -->  00:01:12.074
Let’s say we are in home, we absolutely can access
facebook.com, youtube.com, google.com and others.

12

00:01:12.516  -->  00:01:18.384
Let’s say we are in the office, we
will also able to access facebook.com,

13

00:01:18.384  -->  00:01:21.531
youtube.com, google.com and others.

14

00:01:21.926  -->  00:01:28.877
And let’s say again we are in the vacation to
another city or another country. We will still

15

00:01:28.877  -->  00:01:37.705
able to access all of that servers. Why? Because
all of that servers is using Public IP Address.

16

00:01:37.953  -->  00:01:43.531
So remember that Public IP Address is
the IP Address that used in Internet,

17

00:01:43.531  -->  00:01:49.453
the main characteristic of Public IP Address
is that they are accessable from anywhere.

18

00:01:50.152  -->  00:01:57.318
Next, about Private IP Address. If Public
IP Address is IP that used in the Internet,

19

00:01:57.636  -->  00:02:07.086
then Private IP Address is IP that used in the
local Network. Let’s say in the office we have six computers.

20

00:02:07.086  -->  00:02:14.880
Absolutely each of this computer will
have an IP Address, we have IP for computer 1,

21

00:02:14.880  -->  00:02:22.706
computer 2, computer 3, computer 4, computer
5, and also we have IP for computer 6.

22

00:02:23.153  -->  00:02:27.550
And then all of these computer
will be connected to a switch.

23

00:02:29.730  -->  00:02:38.122
From the switch will be connected to a router,
and from router will be connected to

24

00:02:38.122  -->  00:02:45.583
Internet Service Provider or ISP. And finally
from ISP will be connected to Internet.

25

00:02:46.381  -->  00:02:54.760
You need to pay attention on the IP address
of all PC. All of this IP Address is Private IP Address

26

00:02:54.760  -->  00:03:00.285
The main characteristic of Private
IP Address, is that they are only accessable

27

00:03:00.285  -->  00:03:06.932
from the network. We can’t access
this IP Address form another network.

28

00:03:07.515  -->  00:03:11.572
So let’s say that this ISP has another client.

29

00:03:11.837  -->  00:03:16.914
They have a router, they also
have a switch and some PC.

30

00:03:17.777  -->  00:03:24.080
Well, all of this computer will not be able
to communicate with our computers.

31

00:03:25.004  -->  00:03:32.370
Why? Because our computer is using Private IP
Address, and remember that Private IP Address

32

00:03:32.370  -->  00:03:39.691
only accessable from the network it self, we can’t
access Private IP Address from another network.

33

00:03:40.850  -->  00:03:48.000
So now we understand that Public IP Address is
used in the internet and accessable from anywhere.

34

00:03:48.248  -->  00:03:55.296
While Private IP Address is used in the local
network and only accessable from the network it self.

35

00:03:56.033  -->  00:04:01.440
And something that you need to know, is
that if you build a computer network,

36

00:04:01.440  -->  00:04:08.532
make sure that we us Private IP Address. Where
Private IP Address Range is already defined.

37

00:04:08.891  -->  00:04:12.212
Here is the range of Private IP Address.

38

00:04:12.822  -->  00:04:25.147
First, we have 10.0.0.0 until 10.255.255.255.
this is the first range for Private IP Address.

39

00:04:25.887  -->  00:04:36.747
Let’s say we have IP 10.1.1.1, this is Private IP,
why? Because this IP is included in this range.

40

00:04:37.184  -->  00:04:45.760
Another example, let’s say we have IP
10.100.10.1, this is also Private IP Address.

41

00:04:46.488  -->  00:04:54.278
But, if we have an IP Address
11.10.10.10, this is not Private IP Address,

42

00:04:54.728  -->  00:04:59.172
why? Because this IP is
not included in this range.

43

00:04:59.688  -->  00:05:06.507
If the IP is not Private IP Address,
so that IP is Public IP Address.

44

00:05:07.463  -->  00:05:25.023
Okay, the second range is 172.16.0.0 until 172.31.255.255,
let’s say we have IP 172.16.10.10,

45

00:05:25.316  -->  00:05:32.665
this is Private IP Address. Why? because
this IP is included in the second range.

46

00:05:33.131  -->  00:05:40.962
Another example, let’s say we have IP 172.17.100.200,

47

00:05:42.516  -->  00:05:49.026
this is also included in this range,
so this is also Private IP Address.

48

00:05:49.768  -->  00:05:58.852
But If we have IP 172.35.1.10,
this is not Private IP Address,

49

00:05:59.291  -->  00:06:07.666
because this IP is not included in the first range
or second range. So this is Public IP Address.

50

00:06:08.556  -->  00:06:15.655
And finally, the last range for IP Private
  is 192.168.0.0

51

00:06:15.655  -->  00:06:28.800
until 192.168.255.255. For example we have IP
192.168.100.20, this is Private IP Address,

52

00:06:29.004  -->  00:06:33.537
Why? because this IP is included
in the third range.

53

00:06:34.248  -->  00:06:45.752
Another example, let’s say we have IP 192.10.10.10,
this is not Private IP Address. Why? because

54

00:06:45.752  -->  00:06:54.185
this is not included in the first, second, or
third range, so this is Public IP Address.

55

00:06:55.755  -->  00:07:00.806
Okay, so remember that we have three
range for Private IP Address.

56

00:07:01.901  -->  00:07:08.265
And we need to make sure that we will use one
of this range in our local network.

57

00:07:08.877  -->  00:07:10.736
I think enough for this video,

58

00:07:10.736  -->  00:07:15.603
I hope you understand about Public IP Address and Private IP Address.

59

00:07:16.209  -->  00:07:19.901
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
