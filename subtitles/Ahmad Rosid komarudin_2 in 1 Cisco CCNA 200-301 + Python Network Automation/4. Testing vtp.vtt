00:00:00.943  -->  00:00:06.288
In the previous video, we have done configuring
VTP on all switches.

2

00:00:06.822  -->  00:00:17.685
So switch 1 become server, switch 2 become transparent,
switch 3 become client, and switch 4 become server.

3

00:00:19.334  -->  00:00:23.685
Next in this video, we are going to create
a VLAN.

4

00:00:24.515  -->  00:00:31.748
But before that, let’s check on all switches,
make sure that there is no new vlan created yet.

5

00:00:32.793  -->  00:00:45.790
Let’s start with switch 1, do show vlan brief,
okay here we can see that we only have default vlan,

6

00:00:46.131  -->  00:00:49.863
which is vlan 1 and some others vlan.

7

00:00:50.797  -->  00:01:02.302
Next, let’s check on switch 2, do show vlan
brief. Okay here we can see that we also only

8

00:01:02.302  -->  00:01:04.131
have default vlan.

9

00:01:06.088  -->  00:01:12.078
Switch 3, do show vlan brief.

10

00:01:17.251  -->  00:01:26.453
Okay here also only default vlan, and last
switch 4, do show vlan brief.

11

00:01:27.861  -->  00:01:30.736
Okay here also only default vlan.

12

00:01:31.685  -->  00:01:36.028
Now let’s try to create a vlan on VTP server.

13

00:01:37.155  -->  00:01:48.557
Create vlan 2, the name let’s say A, vlan
3 let’s say the name is B, vlan 4,

14

00:01:49.016  -->  00:01:55.416
let’s say the name is C, vlan 5, let’s say the
name is D.

15

00:01:56.201  -->  00:01:59.224
You are free to use anything for the vlan name.

16

00:02:00.099  -->  00:02:09.493
Now Let’s check it, do show vlan brief,
okay here we can see that now in switch 1,

17

00:02:09.493  -->  00:02:14.545
we have 4 new vlan, which is vlan 2 until
5.

18

00:02:15.494  -->  00:02:23.939
Now let’s check on the vtp client, do show
vlan brief.

19

00:02:25.821  -->  00:02:29.902
Okay here we can see that we have 4 new vlan.

20

00:02:30.361  -->  00:02:38.220
We don’t create any vlan here, we only create
a vlan on switch 1, so all of this vlan is

21

00:02:38.220  -->  00:02:40.415
created automatically.

22

00:02:41.259  -->  00:02:47.571
Let’s also check on switch 4, do show vlan
brief.

23

00:02:48.920  -->  00:02:53.332
Okay here we can see that we also have 4 new
vlan.

24

00:02:53.836  -->  00:02:58.301
And all of this vlan is also created automatically.

25

00:02:59.279  -->  00:03:05.230
So the summary is, vtp server also act as
vtp client.

26

00:03:06.905  -->  00:03:14.423
Now let’s try to modify a vlan on switch 4,
let’s try to remove vlan 5,

27

00:03:15.520  -->  00:03:24.220
the command is no vlan 5, let’s check it, do show vlan
brief.

28

00:03:25.806  -->  00:03:29.594
Okay here we can see that vlan 5 is gone.

29

00:03:30.217  -->  00:03:36.681
Let’s chek it on the vtp client, do show
vlan brief.

30

00:03:37.940  -->  00:03:40.992
Okay here vlan 5 is also gone.

31

00:03:41.793  -->  00:03:47.821
Next let’s also check on switch 1, do show
vlan brief.

32

00:03:49.525  -->  00:03:55.470
Okay here we still have vlan5, this is should
be gone.

33

00:03:56.093  -->  00:04:00.000
May be this is need some time for vlan 5 to
gone.

34

00:04:00.550  -->  00:04:11.651
Let’s click fast forward time, let’s check
again, okay here still exist,

35

00:04:12.407  -->  00:04:15.656
I think this is a bug on cisco packet tracer.

36

00:04:16.641  -->  00:04:24.628
To solve this, let’s try to create a new
vlan on switch 4, let’s create vlan 6,

37

00:04:25.221  -->  00:04:33.932
let’s say the name is e. Let’s check it, do show
vlan brief, okay here we have vlan 6,

38

00:04:34.243  -->  00:04:44.260
let’s check on the vtp client, okay we have vlan
6, let’s check on switch 1,

39

00:04:46.409  -->  00:04:53.148
okay here we can see that now vlan 5 is gone and now
we have vlan 6.

40

00:04:54.423  -->  00:05:02.875
Okay, so now we understand that vtp server
also acts as vtp client, if other server doing

41

00:05:02.875  -->  00:05:08.127
vlan modification, the switch will follow
that modification.

42

00:05:09.223  -->  00:05:16.883
Next let’s talk about vtp client, we know
that the vlan on vtp client will follow the

43

00:05:16.883  -->  00:05:19.207
vlan on the vtp server.

44

00:05:19.904  -->  00:05:27.596
So if server create a new vlan or remove vlan,
the vlan on the vtp client will follow that.

45

00:05:28.619  -->  00:05:35.285
So here we can see that we have vlan 2 3 4
and 6 automatically.

46

00:05:36.560  -->  00:05:43.492
Next we need to know that in the vtp client,
we can not doing vlan modification.

47

00:05:44.055  -->  00:05:47.019
We can not create or remove a vlan.

48

00:05:47.849  -->  00:05:51.660
For example, here we want to remove vlan 6.

49

00:05:52.179  -->  00:06:00.388
The command is no vlan 6. Okay here we can
see an error message “vlan configuration

50

00:06:00.388  -->  00:06:09.133
not allowed when device is in client mode”,
this is means that we can not modify vlan configuration.

51

00:06:10.727  -->  00:06:18.305
Okay we can not remove vlan, let’s try to
create vlan, let’s say vlan 7.

52

00:06:19.935  -->  00:06:24.893
Okay here we can see that we also can not
create a new vlan.

53

00:06:26.375  -->  00:06:35.270
Okay now we understand about vtp server and
vtp client, next, let’s learn about transparent.

54

00:06:35.863  -->  00:06:42.416
Vtp transparent not follow also not affect
other switches.

55

00:06:43.439  -->  00:06:50.145
For example here let’s try to see the vlan,
do show vlan brief.

56

00:06:52.650  -->  00:07:00.622
Here we can see that we only have default
vlan, this is means that switch transparent

57

00:07:00.622  -->  00:07:09.600
not follow the vlan configuration of vtp server.
here we don’t have vlan 2, 3, 4 and 6.

58

00:07:11.157  -->  00:07:19.359
But we can create a vlan in vtp transparent,
let’s try to create vlan, vlan 10,

59

00:07:20.456  -->  00:07:32.672
the name let’s say k, vlan 11, let’s say the name
L. Let’s check the vlan, do show vlan brief.

60

00:07:34.836  -->  00:07:39.515
Okay here we can see that now we have vlan
10 and vlan 11.

61

00:07:40.389  -->  00:07:45.352
Now let’s check in the server, do show vlan
brief.

62

00:07:45.975  -->  00:07:52.533
Here we can see that we don’t have vlan
10 and 11, let’s check in the client,

63

00:07:54.712  -->  00:08:02.348
do show vlan brief, here we can see that we also
don’t have vlan 10 and vlan 11.

64

00:08:03.430  -->  00:08:10.087
So remember that vtp transparent not follow
the vlan configuration of vtp server,

65

00:08:10.087  -->  00:08:13.653
but also not affect other switches.

66

00:08:15.195  -->  00:08:18.722
Okay I hope you understand about vtp.

67

00:08:19.641  -->  00:08:21.756
I think enough for this video.

68

00:08:21.963  -->  00:08:25.139
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
