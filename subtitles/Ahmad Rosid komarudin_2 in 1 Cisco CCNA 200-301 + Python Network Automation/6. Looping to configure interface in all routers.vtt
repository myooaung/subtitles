00:00:00.477  -->  00:00:06.127
In the previous video, we have done create
a script to remote multiple router at once

2

00:00:06.127  -->  00:00:07.670
using netmiko.

3

00:00:08.465  -->  00:00:13.238
But the script is only to show interface on
each router.

4

00:00:14.264  -->  00:00:20.402
Now in this video, we are going to do configuration
on all router at once.

5

00:00:21.366  -->  00:00:26.730
Let’s say we will try to create loopback
interface on each router.

6

00:00:27.988  -->  00:00:31.564
Let’s move this script before show ip interface
brief.

7

00:00:32.457  -->  00:00:33.834
Uncomment this.

8

00:00:36.413  -->  00:00:45.845
Okay so here let’s say we will create 2
loopback interface on each router, loopback0

9

00:00:45.845  -->  00:00:52.386
and loopback1, and then let’s just remove
do show ip interface brief.

10

00:00:53.127  -->  00:00:57.732
Because we already show interface brief using
send_command.

11

00:00:58.973  -->  00:01:04.135
And then let’s change the ip address of
loopback based on n.

12

00:01:05.153  -->  00:01:12.506
Let’s say the ip address of loopback 0 will
be 10.1.1 and then the last number will be

13

00:01:12.506  -->  00:01:20.438
based on n. so here we need to use f string,
and then change this to n.

14

00:01:21.714  -->  00:01:29.808
Let’s also change the ip address of loopback1,
let’s say the ip address is 10.2.2.n, we

15

00:01:30.701  -->  00:01:33.253
also need to use f string here.

16

00:01:34.467  -->  00:01:40.672
Okay, next we send this config to the router
using send_config_set.

17

00:01:41.850  -->  00:01:47.185
After configuring the loopback, we send a
command to show interface,

18

00:01:53.094  -->  00:02:00.318
Here we print the divider, let’s move this
divider before print the first output.

19

00:02:04.254  -->  00:02:06.115
Let’s also move this script.

20

00:02:08.757  -->  00:02:14.353
Let’s just change this to Router and then
the ip address of the router.

21

00:02:15.531  -->  00:02:25.698
Okay we have done here, save, back to the
terminal, and then let’s execute the script.

22

00:02:28.626  -->  00:02:51.552
Router 1 success, router 2 success, router 3
success, router 4 success, and router 5 is also succes.

23

00:02:52.150  -->  00:02:58.550
Okay so now we are success to configure multiple
router at once using netmiko

24

00:02:59.540  -->  00:03:01.790
I think enough for this video.

25

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:05.298
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
