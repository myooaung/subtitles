00:00:00.335  -->  00:00:04.115
In the previous video, we have learned about
trunk.

2

00:00:04.591  -->  00:00:09.510
Next in this video, we are going to create
one more topology,

3

00:00:09.796  -->  00:00:13.796
let’s say we will create topology for room 3.

4

00:00:14.544  -->  00:00:16.538
Let’s import a new switch.

5

00:00:17.109  -->  00:00:24.167
But I will not use 2960 again, I will use
3560.

6

00:00:25.092  -->  00:00:32.599
Actually this two switch is similar, but there
are some differences between this two switch.

7

00:00:33.252  -->  00:00:37.235
We will talk more about the differences in
the next video.

8

00:00:38.649  -->  00:00:42.000
Then now let’s add 4 pc like before.

9

00:00:42.896  -->  00:00:51.986
To add some pc at once, here we can type ctrl
or control in the keyboard, click the pc,

10

00:00:52.422  -->  00:00:57.938
release the control button and here we can
add some pc at once.

11

00:01:01.148  -->  00:01:11.119
Now let’s change the name of the pc, here
the last pc is pc 10, so this will be pc 11,

12

00:01:11.935  -->  00:01:18.413
pc 12, pc 13 and last pc 14.

13

00:01:19.270  -->  00:01:22.393
Now let’s connecting the pc to the switch.

14

00:01:23.264  -->  00:01:27.519
Here we also can use ctrl to add some cable
at once.

15

00:01:28.076  -->  00:01:34.874
So type ctrl in the keyboard, click on the
cable, release the ctrl.

16

00:01:35.051  -->  00:01:38.655
And now we can connecting all pc to the switch.

17

00:01:43.539  -->  00:01:46.754
Okay, now let’s configure the vlan in the
switch.

18

00:01:47.367  -->  00:01:52.715
Here we get a question, would you like to
enter the initial configuration?

19

00:01:53.014  -->  00:01:55.061
We can choose no here.

20

00:01:55.592  -->  00:01:59.125
Enable, and then configure terminal.

21

00:01:59.683  -->  00:02:07.773
Let’s create the vlan first, vlan 10 the
name is accounting, and then vlan 20,

22

00:02:07.922  -->  00:02:09.884
the name is marketing.

23

00:02:10.456  -->  00:02:12.061
Let’s verify it.

24

00:02:12.455  -->  00:02:14.152
Do show vlan brief.

25

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:20.243
Okay here we can see that now we have vlan
10 and vlan 20.

26

00:02:20.801  -->  00:02:25.125
But all of the interface is still in the vlan 1.

27

00:02:25.574  -->  00:02:33.655
Now let’s assign fa0/1 and fa0/4 to the
vlan 10.

28

00:02:34.988  -->  00:02:41.260
If you remember in the previous video, we
can use interface range to assign some interface

29

00:02:41.260  -->  00:02:43.062
to the vlan at once.

30

00:02:43.960  -->  00:02:51.200
Let’s say here we want to assign fa0/1 and
fa0/2 to the vlan.

31

00:02:52.288  -->  00:03:02.565
And if we use interface range fa0/1 until
4, so fa0/1, fa0/2, fa0/3,

32

00:03:02.565  -->  00:03:05.451
fa0/4 will be assigned to the vlan.

33

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:14.359
But in this case, we only want to assign the
interface fa0/1 and fa0/4.

34

00:03:15.000  -->  00:03:21.640
Because fa0/2 and fa0/3 is in the vlan 20.

35

00:03:22.171  -->  00:03:33.858
To do this, we can use comma, so interface
range fa0/1, fa0/4 like this.

36

00:03:34.701  -->  00:03:41.569
Then switchport mode access, switchport access
vlan 10.

37

00:03:42.957  -->  00:03:44.374
Let’s verify it.

38

00:03:45.789  -->  00:03:47.536
Do show vlan brief.

39

00:03:48.093  -->  00:03:56.723
Okay here we can see that now fa0/1 and fa0/4
is in the vlan 10.

40

00:03:57.431  -->  00:04:04.315
Next let’s assign fa0/2 and fa0/3 to vlan 20.

41

00:04:05.118  -->  00:04:09.282
Interface range fa0/2-3.

42

00:04:09.731  -->  00:04:16.180
Switchport mode access, switchport access
vlan 20.

43

00:04:18.111  -->  00:04:22.016
Let’s verify it again, do show vlan brief.

44

00:04:23.131  -->  00:04:31.967
Okay here we can see that now fa0/2 and fa0/3
is in the vlan 20.

45

00:04:32.770  -->  00:04:44.082
Last, let’s configure the ip address of
all pc. Here for pc 11, the ip address is 192.168.1.11.

46

00:04:44.816  -->  00:04:50.068
pc 12 the ip address is 192.168.1.12.

47

00:04:51.143  -->  00:05:01.685
pc 13 the ip address is 192.168.1.13, and last, pc14

48

00:05:01.685  -->  00:05:06.078
the ip address is 192.168.1.14.

49

00:05:06.976  -->  00:05:11.743
Now let’s test the connection between pc
in the same vlan.

50

00:05:12.233  -->  00:05:15.195
Let’s ping between pc in the vlan 10.

51

00:05:16.161  -->  00:05:22.302
Okay successful, next let’s test between
pc in the vlan 20.

52

00:05:22.968  -->  00:05:25.679
Okay this is also successful.

53

00:05:26.604  -->  00:05:29.177
Okay I think enough for this video.

54

00:05:29.272  -->  00:05:33.408
Here we already create a new topology for
room 3.

55

00:05:34.238  -->  00:05:40.253
In the next video, we are going to connecting
this room 3 with room 1 and room 2.

56

00:05:40.838  -->  00:05:44.446
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
