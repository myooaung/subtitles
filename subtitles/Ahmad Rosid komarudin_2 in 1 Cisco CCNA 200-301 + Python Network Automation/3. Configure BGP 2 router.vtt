00:00:00.401  -->  00:00:04.884
In the previous video, we
already create topology 2 router.

2

00:00:05.504  -->  00:00:11.086
Next in this video, we are going
to learn how to configure BGP.

3

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:20.906
I already explain that BGP is used to connecting
between autonomous system, so here we will have 2

4

00:00:20.906  -->  00:00:29.743
autonomous system, let’s say router 1 is autonomous
system 1, and router 2 is autonomous system 2.

5

00:00:30.433  -->  00:00:38.133
Let’s just start, let’s start with
router 1, enable, configure terminal,

6

00:00:38.605  -->  00:00:47.148
and then router bgp question mark, here we can see
that we need to define autonomous system number.

7

00:00:47.417  -->  00:00:52.717
We use 1 here, because router 1
is in autonomous system 1.

8

00:00:54.427  -->  00:01:01.806
Next, we need to define a neighbor. In
this case, router 1 will connect to router 2,

9

00:01:02.610  -->  00:01:05.589
so the neighbor will be router 2,

10

00:01:06.168  -->  00:01:14.927
the command is neighbor, and then the ip address
of the neighbor, in this case 10.10.10.2,

11

00:01:15.793  -->  00:01:23.124
then remote-as, here we need to define the
autonomous system number of the neighbor,

12

00:01:23.682  -->  00:01:31.375
in this case, router 2 is in autonomous
system 2, so the remote as is 2.

13

00:01:33.768  -->  00:01:42.818
Next, we can advertise the connected network,
so here we will advertise 10.10.10.0/30

14

00:01:42.818  -->  00:01:57.000
and 192.168.1.0/24, let’s start, network 10.10.10.0
and then mask, here we will need a subnetmask,

15

00:01:57.257  -->  00:02:04.188
this is different with ospf, in ospf
we need to define wildcard bits.

16

00:02:04.765  -->  00:02:08.840
Question mark here, here we
can see that the description

17

00:02:08.840  -->  00:02:12.767
is network mask, so this is subnetmask.

18

00:02:13.442  -->  00:02:20.244
For /30, the subnetmask is 255.255.255.252.

19

00:02:21.781  -->  00:02:34.962
Next let’s advertise 192.168.1.0, so
network 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0.

20

00:02:36.292  -->  00:02:40.486
Okay now we have done configuring BGP on router1.

21

00:02:41.153  -->  00:02:52.106
Next let’s configure on router 2, enable, configure
terminal, router bgp 2, this is means that router 2

22

00:02:52.106  -->  00:03:01.053
is in autonomous system 2. Next let’s define
the neighbor, the neighbor will be router 1.

23

00:03:02.852  -->  00:03:13.178
So neighbor 10.10.10.1, and then the autonomous
system of router 1 is 1, so remote-as 1.

24

00:03:15.000  -->  00:03:18.884
Here we can see a message that the bgp is up.

25

00:03:20.033  -->  00:03:23.481
Next, let’s advertise the connected network,

26

00:03:24.980  -->  00:03:32.425
network 10.10.10.0 mask 255.255.255.252,

27

00:03:34.728  -->  00:03:42.286
And then network 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0.

28

00:03:44.341  -->  00:03:49.590
Okay now we have done configuring
bgp on router 1 and router 2,

29

00:03:50.808  -->  00:03:55.413
let’s verify it, do show ip bgp summary,

30

00:03:58.162  -->  00:04:02.748
Here we can see that we have neighbor 10.10.10.1,

31

00:04:03.245  -->  00:04:10.164
the state is number 4, this is means how
many prefix that received from the neighbor.

32

00:04:11.349  -->  00:04:15.912
If the bgp is not up, the status will be active.

33

00:04:17.344  -->  00:04:24.773
Okay, let’s also check on
router 1, do show ip bgp summary,

34

00:04:26.636  -->  00:04:35.609
here we can see that the status is also 4, this is
means that router 1 receive 4 network from router 2.

35

00:04:36.445  -->  00:04:43.344
Let’s check the routing table, do show
ip route, here we can see that router 1

36

00:04:43.344  -->  00:04:55.523
have route to 192.168.2.0/24, which is the
network of pc 2, the label is B, B is means BGP.

37

00:04:56.421  -->  00:05:04.316
Let’s also check routing table on router 2, do
show ip route, here we can see that router 2

38

00:05:04.316  -->  00:05:12.309
also have a route to pc 1, and the
label is also B, this is means BGP.

39

00:05:13.221  -->  00:05:17.314
Now let’s test ping from pc 1 to pc 2,

40

00:05:20.160  -->  00:05:26.176
the first packet is failed, let’s
test again, okay here success.

41

00:05:27.325  -->  00:05:31.764
Okay so now we have done
configuring bgp on 2 router.

42

00:05:32.457  -->  00:05:39.522
I think enough for this video, in the next video,
we are going to add 1 router to our topology.

43

00:05:40.050  -->  00:05:43.454
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video.
