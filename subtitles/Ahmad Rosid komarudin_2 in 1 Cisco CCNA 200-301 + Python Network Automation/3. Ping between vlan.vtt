00:00:00.417  -->  00:00:05.920
In the previous video, we already
practice with vlan. I said before,

2

00:00:05.920  -->  00:00:12.534
that if the two PC is in the different vlan,
so that two PC is in the broadcast domain.

3

00:00:13.341  -->  00:00:19.040
Now in this video, I will show you that
if two PC is in the different vlan or

4

00:00:19.040  -->  00:00:25.353
different broadcast domain, so that two PC
will not able to communicate each others.

5

00:00:26.222  -->  00:00:34.837
Let’s try it. Here let’s try to ping from PC 1
to PC 3. Here we can see that this is failed.

6

00:00:35.502  -->  00:00:40.802
Why? Because this two PC is in
the different broadcast domain.

7

00:00:41.617  -->  00:00:49.158
This 2 PC, logically connected to different
switch. Here we have logical switch for vlan 10,

8

00:00:50.648  -->  00:01:00.370
and here we also have logical switch for vlan
20. This 2 logical switch is not connected each others.

9

00:01:00.737  -->  00:01:07.840
That is why PC that connected to logical
switch vlan 10 will not able to communicate with

10

00:01:07.840  -->  00:01:16.062
PC that connected to logical switch vlan 20.
Actually we can configure so between vlan

11

00:01:16.062  -->  00:01:22.891
can communicate each others, but we will
learn about that later in the next video.

12

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:30.000
For now, just understand that each vlan
will not able to communicate each others.

13

00:01:30.968  -->  00:01:34.533
For testing again, let’s try to send a packet

14

00:01:34.533  -->  00:01:40.863
from PC 1 to PC 4. Okay here we
can see that this is also failed.

15

00:01:41.928  -->  00:01:48.731
Okay so remember that if two PC is in the
different vlan or different broadcast domain,

16

00:01:49.377  -->  00:01:53.618
so that two PC will not able to
communicate each others.

17

00:01:55.176  -->  00:02:03.527
Although the ip address is in the same block subnet.
So here, we can see that PC 1 and PC 3

18

00:02:03.527  -->  00:02:12.213
is in the same block subnet, the ip address
of PC 1 is 192.168.1.1, and the ip address of

19

00:02:12.213  -->  00:02:21.000
PC 3 is 192.168.1.3, so the ip address of
this two PC is in the same block subnet.

20

00:02:21.662  -->  00:02:29.895
but this two PC is in the different vlan. So this
two PC still can not communicate each others.

21

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:38.560
But You need to remember that each vlan must be
in the different block subnet. So let’s say in

22

00:02:38.560  -->  00:02:49.956
the vlan 10, the ip address is 192.168.10.0, and
in the vlan 20, the ip address is 192.168.20.0.

23

00:02:51.502  -->  00:02:57.700
In this case, we can see that different vlan
using ip address in the same block subnet.

24

00:02:58.053  -->  00:03:00.998
This is because just for learning.

25

00:03:02.079  -->  00:03:07.676
Okay I think enough for this video. Thankyou
for watching and see you on the next video.
