00:00:00.479  -->  00:00:05.791
In the previous video, we have done configuring
ip address on all pc.

2

00:00:06.490  -->  00:00:11.509
But the connection between pc in the different vlan is still failed.

3

00:00:12.140  -->  00:00:18.074
This is because the layer 3 function in the
multi layer switch is not enabled yet.

4

00:00:19.315  -->  00:00:24.826
Now in this video, we are going to activate
the layer 3 function of multi layer switch,

5

00:00:25.436  -->  00:00:29.968
so between pc in the different vlan can communicate
each others.

6

00:00:30.893  -->  00:00:31.933
Let’s just start.

7

00:00:32.762  -->  00:00:35.521
Here go to global configuration mode.

8

00:00:36.152  -->  00:00:39.252
And then type ip routing.

9

00:00:40.239  -->  00:00:45.846
This command is used to activate the layer
3 function of multi layer switch.

10

00:00:46.867  -->  00:00:49.779
Now let’s see the routing table again.

11

00:00:50.808  -->  00:00:55.243
Here we can see that now we have some entry
in the routing table.

12

00:00:56.000  -->  00:01:00.475
This is means that now the layer 3 function
is enabled.

13

00:01:01.949  -->  00:01:05.550
Let’s try ping between pc in the different
vlan.

14

00:01:08.182  -->  00:01:11.132
Let’s try from vlan 10 to vlan 20.

15

00:01:11.914  -->  00:01:13.917
Okay the result is success.

16

00:01:14.596  -->  00:01:19.423
Let’s try from vlan 30 in the room 2 to
the vlan 10 in the room 3.

17

00:01:20.115  -->  00:01:26.695
The first packet is failed, let’s test again,
okay this is success.

18

00:01:27.723  -->  00:01:31.265
Next let’s try from vlan 1 to vlan 20.

19

00:01:32.067  -->  00:01:35.400
First packet is failed, let’s test again.

20

00:01:36.237  -->  00:01:37.924
Okay this is success.

21

00:01:39.240  -->  00:01:44.062
Okay, so now communication between pc in the
different vlan is success.

22

00:01:44.775  -->  00:01:46.804
I think enough for this video

23

00:01:47.195  -->  00:01:50.271
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
