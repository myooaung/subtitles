00:00:00.416  -->  00:00:05.125
In the previous video, we already learn about
violation shutdown.

2

00:00:05.623  -->  00:00:13.229
Remember that we have 3 option for violation,
which is shutdown, restrict, and protect.

3

00:00:13.867  -->  00:00:20.687
If we use violation shutdown, the interface
will be shutdown, the light will become red.

4

00:00:21.709  -->  00:00:27.400
But if we use restrict or protect, the interface
will not shutdown.

5

00:00:27.872  -->  00:00:33.408
The interface will still up, but all of packet
will be blocked.

6

00:00:34.187  -->  00:00:40.727
So even the interface is up, but the hacker
still can not send any packet.

7

00:00:41.519  -->  00:00:46.556
Next, we will talk about the differences between
restrict and protect.

8

00:00:47.450  -->  00:00:54.817
If we use restrict, the security violation
count will be increase every time the violation is reach,

9

00:00:55.596  -->  00:01:01.239
but if we use protect, the security
violation count will never increase.

10

00:01:01.916  -->  00:01:03.260
What is that means?

11

00:01:04.294  -->  00:01:06.165
Let’s go to the switch,

12

00:01:14.849  -->  00:01:22.095
here when we check in the port security, we can see security violation count.

13

00:01:22.644  -->  00:01:30.751
If we use protect, the security violation
count will always 0, but if we use restrict,

14

00:01:30.751  -->  00:01:35.906
the security violation count will increase
every time the violation is reach.

15

00:01:37.387  -->  00:01:41.527
Okay that is the differences between restrict
and protect.

16

00:01:42.472  -->  00:01:46.172
In this video, we are going to try protect
first.

17

00:01:46.823  -->  00:01:52.899
In this case we will configure port security
on interface connected to server 3,

18

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:57.134
which is interface fa0/3.

19

00:01:58.079  -->  00:02:06.511
Let’s open the switch, go to interface fa0/3
and then set the mode to access.

20

00:02:07.315  -->  00:02:13.400
Remember that we need to change the mode to
access before configuring port security

21

00:02:14.779  -->  00:02:18.309
Next, let’s activate the port security.

22

00:02:19.867  -->  00:02:26.809
Now let’s configure the mac address, in
this case, I will configure using sticky,

23

00:02:27.550  -->  00:02:32.132
so the switch will detect the mac address
of server automatically.

24

00:02:33.422  -->  00:02:36.377
Next, let’s configure maximum to 1.

25

00:02:39.735  -->  00:02:42.797
And then we will use violation protect.

26

00:02:44.253  -->  00:02:51.144
Let’s check the configuration, do show port-security
interface fa0/3.

27

00:02:52.114  -->  00:03:00.417
Here we can see that port security is enabled,
the status is secure up, violation mode protect,

28

00:03:00.927  -->  00:03:05.310
and if we see here the sticky mac address
is still 0.

29

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:09.658
This is means that server3 is not registered
yet.

30

00:03:10.437  -->  00:03:13.363
Let’s try to send packet from server 3.

31

00:03:15.470  -->  00:03:22.932
Let’s check in the switch again, okay here
we can see that now sticky mac address is 1,

32

00:03:23.468  -->  00:03:26.517
this is means that server 3 is registered.

33

00:03:27.961  -->  00:03:38.504
Now let’s try to move cable from server 3
to the hacker pc. Let’s try ping from hacker

34

00:03:38.504  -->  00:03:47.887
to server 2, here we can see that the result
is failed, but the light is still orange,

35

00:03:48.461  -->  00:03:50.740
let’s click fast forward time.

36

00:03:51.838  -->  00:03:56.884
Let’s try to ping from hacker again, okay
still failed.

37

00:03:57.255  -->  00:04:05.565
Let’s test again, still failed, let’s
test to server 1, also failed.

38

00:04:06.101  -->  00:04:08.546
Test again, still failed.

39

00:04:09.440  -->  00:04:14.443
This is means that the hacker can not send
any packet to anywhere.

40

00:04:15.643  -->  00:04:23.911
But here we can see that the light is still
green, this is means that the port is not shutdown.

41

00:04:24.369  -->  00:04:31.380
This is because we use violation protect,
remember that if we use violation protect,

42

00:04:31.380  -->  00:04:36.786
the interface is not shutdown, but all of
packet will be blocked.

43

00:04:37.667  -->  00:04:44.611
Let’s check the port security, do show port-security
interface fa0/3.

44

00:04:45.824  -->  00:04:54.573
Here we can see that the status is still secure
up, and security violation count is still 0.

45

00:04:56.116  -->  00:05:03.410
Once again, remember that if we use violation
protect, the security violation count never increased.

46

00:05:04.112  -->  00:05:09.531
But if we use restrict, the security violation
count will increase.

47

00:05:10.949  -->  00:05:15.000
Okay now let’s bring the cable back to server 3.

48

00:05:17.792  -->  00:05:24.416
Fast forward time, and then let’s try to
send packet from server 3 to server 2.

49

00:05:25.412  -->  00:05:28.283
Here we can see that the result is success.

50

00:05:28.871  -->  00:05:35.218
Let’s test again from server 3 to pc, okay
this is also success.

51

00:05:36.584  -->  00:05:44.153
So here, when we bring the cable back to the
right server, the server will able to communicate again.

52

00:05:44.706  -->  00:05:50.493
This is different with violation shutdown,
if we use violation shutdown, we will need

53

00:05:50.493  -->  00:05:55.664
to use command shutdown and then no shutdown
to enable the interface.

54

00:05:56.890  -->  00:06:04.609
But if we use violation protect, the server
will up, without doing any additional configuration.

55

00:06:06.000  -->  00:06:12.376
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video we are going to learn about violation

56

00:06:12.376  -->  00:06:13.375
restrict.

57

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:17.300
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
