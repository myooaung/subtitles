00:00:00.492  -->  00:00:06.455
In the previous section, we already learn
about dynamic routing eigrp and ospf.

2

00:00:07.276  -->  00:00:12.696
Next in this section, we are going to learn
about dynamic routing BGP.

3

00:00:13.592  -->  00:00:27.886
So what is the differences between eigrp ospf and bgp? EIGRP
and OSPF is IGP or interior gateway protocol,

4

00:00:29.545  -->  00:00:36.000
but BGP is EGP or exterior gateway protocol.

5

00:00:36.745  -->  00:00:39.463
What is IGP and EGP?

6

00:00:40.124  -->  00:00:48.440
IGP is used inside autonomous system. And
EGP is used between Autonomous System.

7

00:00:49.206  -->  00:00:56.619
What is Autonomous System? In simple word, we
can say that Autonomous System is a Company.

8

00:00:57.193  -->  00:01:03.245
So let’s say here we have Google,
absolutely google have a network right?

9

00:01:03.795  -->  00:01:10.376
So we have many router inside google. And
we also have many server inside google.

10

00:01:11.007  -->  00:01:17.860
All of server and router is connected each
others. So here we have an autonomous system.

11

00:01:18.735  -->  00:01:22.379
Every autonomous system will have an identifier,

12

00:01:22.505  -->  00:01:29.470
which is a number, so let’s say the
autonomous system number of google is 100.

13

00:01:30.440  -->  00:01:38.551
Next, let’s say here we have facebook, inside
facebook, we also have many router an many server.

14

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:46.017
So here we also have an autonomous
system, let’s say autonomous system 200.

15

00:01:46.646  -->  00:01:53.840
Next, let’s say here we also have twitter,
we have many router and server here,

16

00:01:55.865  -->  00:02:02.212
so here we also have an autonomous
system, let’s say autonomous system 300.

17

00:02:03.078  -->  00:02:08.597
So the summary is, autonomous system
is a network inside a company.

18

00:02:09.404  -->  00:02:16.444
To connecting many router inside autonomous
system, we can use IGP, you are free to choose

19

00:02:16.444  -->  00:02:27.080
between EIGRP or OSPF or actually, we also
have other choices for IGP, which is IS-IS.

20

00:02:28.329  -->  00:02:39.000
So let’s say in google, we use eigrp, ospf,
or is-is. If all of the router is cisco,

21

00:02:39.000  -->  00:02:46.880
we can use EIGRP, but if the router not
only cisco, let’s say we have juniper,

22

00:02:46.880  -->  00:02:53.259
Huawei, hp and others, so
we can use OSPF or IS-IS.

23

00:02:53.804  -->  00:03:00.802
And then to connecting between autonomous
system or between company, we will use EGP.

24

00:03:01.535  -->  00:03:11.429
In EGP, we just have 1 choice, which is
BGP. So to connecting google and twitter,

25

00:03:12.195  -->  00:03:20.053
connecting google and facebook, connecting
facebook and twitter, and others, we must use BGP.

26

00:03:21.468  -->  00:03:25.202
Okay so that is the concept of Autonomous system.

27

00:03:25.520  -->  00:03:32.069
I think enough for this video, in the next video we are going to learn about BGP.

28

00:03:32.638  -->  00:03:36.000
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
