00:00:00.487  -->  00:00:09.734
In the previous video, we have created 2 topology
like this. Here we have room 1 and here we have room 2.

2

00:00:10.167  -->  00:00:18.481
In the room 1, we have 2 vlan, which is
vlan 10 for accounting and vlan 20 for marketing.

3

00:00:18.942  -->  00:00:27.789
In the room 2, we also have same vlan, which is
vlan 10 for accounting and vlan 20 for marketing.

4

00:00:28.501  -->  00:00:34.049
Until now, we know that between different
vlan can not communicate yet.

5

00:00:34.439  -->  00:00:42.605
So PC in vlan 10 can not communicate with
PC in vlan 20. But communication inside

6

00:00:42.605  -->  00:00:50.377
vlan should be ok. Let’s say here PC 1
should be able to communicate with PC 2.

7

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:55.470
Now the question is, how
if two PC in the same vlan,

8

00:00:55.470  -->  00:01:00.257
but in the different room. Can
they communicate each others?

9

00:01:00.953  -->  00:01:08.630
For example, here we want to communicate from
vlan 10 in the room 1 with vlan 10 in the room 2.

10

00:01:09.909  -->  00:01:19.761
Now let’s try to connecting switch 1 and switch 2.
Okay now here room 1 is connected to room 2.

11

00:01:20.671  -->  00:01:27.218
Now let’s try to ping from vlan 10 in
room number 1 to vlan 10 in room number 2.

12

00:01:28.205  -->  00:01:33.380
Okay here we can see that the result is
failed. Let’s try again,

13

00:01:36.085  -->  00:01:37.917
okay still failed.

14

00:01:38.539  -->  00:01:44.525
Why this is failed? This is because the
interface that connecting between switch

15

00:01:44.525  -->  00:01:52.975
is not in the vlan 10. Let’s verify
it, enable, and then show vlan brief.

16

00:01:53.881  -->  00:02:02.689
Oh I am sorry, here we can see that
fa0/5 and fa0/6 is in the vlan 10,

17

00:02:03.193  -->  00:02:09.617
this is because our configuration in the
previous video. Now let’s set this two

18

00:02:09.617  -->  00:02:17.545
interface to the vlan 1 again. Remember that
by default, all interface is in the vlan 1.

19

00:02:18.407  -->  00:02:32.387
Conf t, interface range fa0/5-6, switchport access
vlan 1. Now let’s verify it, do show vlan brief.

20

00:02:33.457  -->  00:02:42.095
Okay here we can see that fa0/5-6 is
in the default vlan, which is vlan 1.

21

00:02:43.551  -->  00:02:46.495
Now let’s see in the switch 2.

22

00:02:49.085  -->  00:02:57.699
Enable, show vlan brief. Here we
can see that fa0/5 is in the vlan 1.

23

00:02:58.320  -->  00:03:05.545
This is why vlan 10 in the room 1 and vlan 10
in the room 2 can not communicate each others.

24

00:03:06.083  -->  00:03:11.159
Because interface that connecting
this two switch is in the vlan 1,

25

00:03:11.610  -->  00:03:19.764
so vlan 10 can not passing this interface.
Because this interface only allow vlan 1 to pass.

26

00:03:20.699  -->  00:03:25.565
Here also same with vlan 20, vlan 20 in the room 1

27

00:03:25.565  -->  00:03:29.893
also can not communicate
with vlan 20 in the room 2.

28

00:03:30.525  -->  00:03:37.851
So the question is, how we can communicate between
vlan 10 in the room 1 to vlan 10 in room 2?

29

00:03:38.577  -->  00:03:45.993
Here we can assign interface fa0/5
in both of switch to vlan 10.

30

00:03:46.709  -->  00:03:57.138
So here let’s go to interface fa0/5, switchport
mode access, and then switchport access vlan 10.

31

00:03:57.871  -->  00:04:08.077
Now let’s verify it, do show vlan brief. Okay
here we can see that fa0/5 now is in the vlan 10.

32

00:04:08.802  -->  00:04:17.151
Next let’s configure in the switch
2. Conf t, go to interface fa0/5.

33

00:04:17.916  -->  00:04:23.204
Switchport mode access, and
then switchport access vlan 10.

34

00:04:24.000  -->  00:04:35.079
Let’s verify it, do show vlan brief. Okay here
we can see that now fa0/5 is in the vlan 10.

35

00:04:35.787  -->  00:04:44.415
Now, vlan 10 in the room 1 should be able to
communicate with vlan 10 in room 2. Let’s try it.

36

00:04:46.827  -->  00:04:50.556
Okay here is still failed, let’s try again.

37

00:04:53.387  -->  00:04:56.878
and here we can see that now is successful.

38

00:04:57.440  -->  00:05:05.201
This is because interface between switch is in
the vlan 10. So vlan 10 can pass this interface.

39

00:05:05.711  -->  00:05:09.672
But the question is, how about vlan 20?

40

00:05:10.091  -->  00:05:11.260
Let’s try it.

41

00:05:13.980  -->  00:05:21.495
Okay here the result is failed. Why? Because interface between switch now Is in the vlan 10.

42

00:05:21.621  -->  00:05:25.563
Absolutely vlan 20 can not pass this interface.

43

00:05:26.647  -->  00:05:30.738
We can assign the interface
between switch to vlan 20,

44

00:05:30.848  -->  00:05:35.079
but vlan 10 will not able to
communicate between rooms.

45

00:05:36.000  -->  00:05:39.575
So the solution for this problem is we can

46

00:05:39.575  -->  00:05:46.950
use trunk. We will configure the interface
that connecting this two switch become trunk.

47

00:05:47.499  -->  00:05:50.213
If we configure the interface to trunk,

48

00:05:50.480  -->  00:05:58.453
so the interface can pass any packet from
any vlan. So vlan 10 can pass the interface,

49

00:05:58.800  -->  00:06:04.523
vlan 20 can pass the interface, and
all of vlan can pass the interface.

50

00:06:05.168  -->  00:06:18.605
Let’s try it. Open switch 1, interface fa0/5, and
then switchport mode trunk. Okay this is how we

51

00:06:18.605  -->  00:06:26.244
can configure trunk in cisco switch. Easy right?
Now let’s move to switch 2,

52

00:06:29.603  -->  00:06:37.298
interface fa0/5, switchport mode trunk.
And now Let’s verify,

53

00:06:37.579  -->  00:06:42.644
to verify the trunk, we can use
command do show interface trunk

54

00:06:44.083  -->  00:06:50.627
Here we can see that we have
trunk interface, which is fa0/5.

55

00:06:51.363  -->  00:06:57.389
Now let’s try to ping from vlan
10 room 1 to vlan 10 room 2.

56

00:06:58.153  -->  00:07:07.577
Okay here we can see that the result is success.
Let’s try for vlan 20. Okay here also success.

57

00:07:08.671  -->  00:07:13.931
So now, same vlan between room can
communicate each others.

58

00:07:14.140  -->  00:07:22.038
Because we already configure trunk between switch.
Okay I think enough for this video.

59

00:07:22.275  -->  00:07:25.655
I hope you understand the function of trunk.

60

00:07:26.059  -->  00:07:29.324
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
