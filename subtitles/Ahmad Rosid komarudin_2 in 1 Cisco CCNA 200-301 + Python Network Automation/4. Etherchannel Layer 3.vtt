00:00:00.533  -->  00:00:06.303
In the previous video, we already configure
etherchannel LACP and PAGP.

2

00:00:06.857  -->  00:00:14.903
That 2 protocol is layer 2 etherchannel, this
is means that we configure trunk in the etherchannel.

3

00:00:15.645  -->  00:00:20.798
Remember that before we configure etherchannel,
we configure trunk first.

4

00:00:22.061  -->  00:00:27.346
Now, in this video we are going to learn
about layer 3 etherchannel.

5

00:00:28.099  -->  00:00:35.145
In layer 3 etherchannel, the interface will
not configured as trunk, but we will configure

6

00:00:35.145  -->  00:00:38.122
an ip address in the etherchannel.

7

00:00:39.307  -->  00:00:45.814
And one thing that you need to know is layer
3 etherchannel only work on layer 3 switch.

8

00:00:46.334  -->  00:00:51.471
So we can not configure layer 3 etherchannel
in switch 2960,

9

00:00:52.855  -->  00:01:00.482
Okay let’s just start, let’s create a
new topology, import two 3560 switch.

10

00:01:03.561  -->  00:01:06.000
And then connecting this 2 switch.

11

00:01:14.557  -->  00:01:20.585
Because this will become layer 3 etherchannel,
so we will configure an ip address.

12

00:01:21.172  -->  00:01:27.727
Let’s say in multi layer switch 1, the ip
address is 10.10.10.1,

13

00:01:28.569  -->  00:01:34.138
and in multi layer switch 2, the ip address is 10.10.10.2.

14

00:01:34.968  -->  00:01:46.145
Let’s start the configuration, enable, here
we can see that the interface is fa0/1-3,

15

00:01:48.625  -->  00:01:56.732
so interface range fa0/1-3, if we want to
configure an ip address in the multi layer

16

00:01:56.732  -->  00:02:03.413
switch, we need to disable the switchport,
the command is no switchport.

17

00:02:04.676  -->  00:02:14.494
Next let’s configure the etherchannel, channel-group
1 mode and then question mark,

18

00:02:15.158  -->  00:02:19.153
to configure layer 3 etherchannel, we can use mode on.

19

00:02:22.287  -->  00:02:29.373
Here we can see creating port channel 1, this
is because we use id 1 for the etherchannel.

20

00:02:30.126  -->  00:02:32.740
Next let’s configure the ip address.

21

00:02:33.238  -->  00:02:44.586
We will configure the ip address on the etherchannel
interface, so interface po1, ip address 10.10.10.1

22

00:02:44.586  -->  00:02:48.000
255.255.255.0,

23

00:02:49.157  -->  00:02:55.604
Okay now we have done in multi layer switch 1,
let’s move to multi layer switch 2.

24

00:03:00.100  -->  00:03:09.573
No, enable, configure terminal, interface
range fa0/1-3.

25

00:03:10.459  -->  00:03:14.877
First let’s disable the switchport, no switchport,

26

00:03:15.951  -->  00:03:21.585
Next let’s configure the etherchannel, channel-group
1 mode on.

27

00:03:24.530  -->  00:03:36.456
Next let’s configure the ip address, interface
po1, ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0,

28

00:03:37.641  -->  00:03:47.580
Okay now we have done configuring layer 3
etherchannel, let’s check it, do show etherchannel summary,

29

00:03:50.204  -->  00:03:58.402
here we have port channel 1, Uppercase
R and uppercase U, uppercase R means Layer 3

30

00:03:58.690  -->  00:04:01.363
and uppercase U means in use,

31

00:04:01.995  -->  00:04:07.872
The protocol is none, and all of interface
is in port channel.

32

00:04:08.724  -->  00:04:14.448
Let’s also check on multi layer switch 2,
do show etherchannel summary.

33

00:04:15.733  -->  00:04:22.039
Here also uppercase R and uppercase U, this
is means layer 3 and in use.

34

00:04:23.058  -->  00:04:33.000
Now let’s test ping, from multi layer switch
2 ping to multi layer switch 1, do ping 10.10.10.1,

35

00:04:34.902  -->  00:04:38.307
okay here we can see that the result is success.

36

00:04:39.470  -->  00:04:41.428
I think enough for this video

37

00:04:41.428  -->  00:04:44.768
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
