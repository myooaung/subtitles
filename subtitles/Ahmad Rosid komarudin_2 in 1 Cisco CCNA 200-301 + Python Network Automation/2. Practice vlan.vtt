00:00:00.230  -->  00:00:06.791
In the previous video, we already learn about
what is vlan and why we need to use vlan.

2

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:11.881
Next in this video, we are going to practice
about vlan.

3

00:00:12.501  -->  00:00:16.211
This is topology that we are going to use
to practice vlan.

4

00:00:16.790  -->  00:00:24.921
I already configure the ip address of pc 1
pc 2 and pc 3, but not for pc 4.

5

00:00:25.221  -->  00:00:33.899
Now let’s configure the ip address of pc 4,
so the ip address is 192.168.1.4.

6

00:00:34.578  -->  00:00:40.480
Let’s make sure the ip address of pc 1, okay
the ip address is correct.

7

00:00:41.019  -->  00:00:47.231
Pc 2 also correct, and pc 3 also correct.

8

00:00:47.690  -->  00:00:55.270
Now let’s try to ping from pc 1 to pc 2, here
let’s go to simulation mode first.

9

00:00:55.650  -->  00:01:00.899
And here let’s ping or send packet from
pc 1 to pc 2.

10

00:01:01.638  -->  00:01:04.630
Here, pc 1 will send arp packet first.

11

00:01:04.630  -->  00:01:10.161
Remember that arp packet is used to ask the
mac address of the destination.

12

00:01:10.700  -->  00:01:15.752
In this case, pc 1 is ask for the mac address
of pc 2.

13

00:01:16.491  -->  00:01:18.430
Here let’s continue.

14

00:01:18.930  -->  00:01:21.921
The arp packet is received by switch.

15

00:01:22.381  -->  00:01:29.491
And then the switch will be broadcast the
arp packet to all pc. But here we can see

16

00:01:29.491  -->  00:01:33.501
that there is x in pc 3 and pc 4.

17

00:01:34.260  -->  00:01:39.731
This is means that these 2 pc will not reply
for the arp packet.

18

00:01:40.151  -->  00:01:44.851
Because the arp packet is to ask the mac address
of pc 2.

19

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:49.601
But here we can see that pc 2 will be reply.

20

00:01:50.081  -->  00:01:54.210
And finally the arp packet is back to the
pc 1.

21

00:01:54.909  -->  00:02:02.270
After the arp is complete like this, now pc 1
know the mac address of pc 2.

22

00:02:02.510  -->  00:02:06.900
And then they will communicate with icmp protocol

23

00:02:07.459  -->  00:02:11.631
Icmp protocol is the protocol that used in
ping.

24

00:02:12.530  -->  00:02:16.752
Okay finally here we can see that the ping
is success.

25

00:02:18.000  -->  00:02:25.951
What I want to show you is, that the arp packet
will be forwarded or broadcasted to all pc.

26

00:02:27.309  -->  00:02:28.210
why?

27

00:02:28.210  -->  00:02:34.781
This is because, by default, all of interface
in the switch is in the same vlan,

28

00:02:35.261  -->  00:02:37.330
which is vlan 1.

29

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:39.831
Vlan 1 is the default vlan.

30

00:02:40.870  -->  00:02:47.919
Because all interface is in the same vlan,
so the arp packet will be forwarded to all pc

31

00:02:48.641  -->  00:02:54.025
Here let’s check it in the switch, to show
the vlan information,

32

00:02:54.025  -->  00:02:56.825
we can use command show vlan brief.

33

00:02:59.761  -->  00:03:06.591
Okay here we can see that all of interface
is in the same vlan, which is vlan 1.

34

00:03:06.711  -->  00:03:11.112
This is why the arp packet will be forwarded
to all pc.

35

00:03:11.871  -->  00:03:19.000
In the previous video, I already said that
one of the advantage if we use vlan is that

36

00:03:19.000  -->  00:03:21.401
separation of broadcast domain.

37

00:03:22.160  -->  00:03:23.849
Now let’s try it.

38

00:03:24.289  -->  00:03:32.730
We will configure so pc 1 and pc 2 will be in
the vlan 10, and the pc 3 and pc 4 will be in

39

00:03:32.730  -->  00:03:34.451
the vlan 20.

40

00:03:35.051  -->  00:03:45.602
Actually you don’t need to use vlan number
10 and 20, the number of vlan is between 1-4095,

41

00:03:46.341  -->  00:03:51.982
so you are free to use any number between
1 and 4095.

42

00:03:52.561  -->  00:03:57.212
But in this example, I will use vlan 10 and
20.

43

00:03:58.051  -->  00:04:02.649
Okay let’s start the configuration, open
the switch.

44

00:04:02.649  -->  00:04:06.123
Always remember that if we want to doing any
configuration,

45

00:04:06.123  -->  00:04:09.791
we need to enter global configuration mode first.

46

00:04:10.090  -->  00:04:15.423
So here let’s type conf t or configure terminal.

47

00:04:16.461  -->  00:04:23.680
Next let’s create the vlan, vlan 10, and
then let’s set the name of the vlan,

48

00:04:23.900  -->  00:04:29.107
let’s say the name is accounting. Exit.

49

00:04:29.607  -->  00:04:34.142
Now let’s verify it first, do show vlan
brief.

50

00:04:34.841  -->  00:04:40.521
Okay here we can see that we have vlan 10
and the name is accounting.

51

00:04:41.251  -->  00:04:44.559
Next let’s create for vlan 20.

52

00:04:45.617  -->  00:04:49.999
And the name let’s say marketing. Exit.

53

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:53.181
Do show vlan brief again to verify.

54

00:04:53.740  -->  00:04:58.672
Okay here we can see that now we have vlan
10 and vlan 20.

55

00:04:59.331  -->  00:05:04.740
But if we see here, all of interface is still
in the vlan 1.

56

00:05:05.060  -->  00:05:09.061
There is no interface in vlan 10 and vlan
20.

57

00:05:09.401  -->  00:05:13.804
So now, we need to assign the interface to
the vlan.

58

00:05:14.383  -->  00:05:22.420
Here fa0/2 and fa0/3 will be assign to vlan 10,

59

00:05:22.799  -->  00:05:31.661
And then here fa0/1 and fa0/4 will be assign
to vlan 20.

60

00:05:32.760  -->  00:05:35.791
Okay let’s start the configuration.

61

00:05:36.251  -->  00:05:47.532
First let’s configure for fa0/2, interface
fa0/2, and then change the mode to access.

62

00:05:48.351  -->  00:05:52.532
If you do not know about mode access, don’t
worry,

63

00:05:52.532  -->  00:05:56.022
I will explain about this later in the next video.

64

00:05:56.841  -->  00:06:01.030
Okay then let’s set the access vlan to 10.

65

00:06:01.590  -->  00:06:09.700
This is means that we assign interface fa0/2
to vlan 10, and then exit.

66

00:06:10.478  -->  00:06:13.912
Let’s verify, do show vlan brief.

67

00:06:14.371  -->  00:06:21.122
Okay here we can see that now, fa0/2 is already
in the vlan 10.

68

00:06:22.380  -->  00:06:30.860
Next let’s configure for fa0/3, this will
also assigned to vlan 10.

69

00:06:31.240  -->  00:06:42.289
So go to interface fa0/3, switchport mode
access and then switchport access vlan 10. Exit.

70

00:06:42.930  -->  00:06:54.251
Let’s verify again, okay here we can see
that now, fa0/2 and fa0/3 is in the vlan 10.

71

00:06:55.010  -->  00:06:58.450
Next, let’s configure for vlan 20.

72

00:06:58.910  -->  00:07:06.601
So here fa0/1 and fa0/4 will be assigned to
vlan 20.

73

00:07:07.120  -->  00:07:21.618
Go to fa0/1, switchport mode access, switchport
access vlan 20, so here we assign fa0/1 to vlan 20.

74

00:07:22.451  -->  00:07:35.669
Next let’s assign for fa0/4, here interface
fa0/4, switchport mode access, oh sorry there

75

00:07:35.669  -->  00:07:45.520
is a typo, so switchport mode access, and
then switchport access vlan 20.

76

00:07:47.516  -->  00:07:49.460
Now let’s verify it.

77

00:07:49.640  -->  00:07:51.643
Do show vlan brief.

78

00:07:53.341  -->  00:08:01.418
Okay here we can see that fa0/2 and fa0/3
is in the vlan 10,

79

00:08:01.598  -->  00:08:08.291
and then fa0/1 and fa0/4 is in the vlan 20.

80

00:08:09.130  -->  00:08:16.021
If we have done configuring vlan like this,
now we have 2 logical switch or virtual switch.

81

00:08:16.660  -->  00:08:25.288
So here we have virtual switch for vlan 10,
and then we also have virtual switch for vlan 20

82

00:08:25.869  -->  00:08:28.921
So physically, we have 1 switch.

83

00:08:29.180  -->  00:08:32.360
But logically, we have 2 switch.

84

00:08:32.360  -->  00:08:37.302
Which is switch for vlan 10 and switch for
vlan 20.

85

00:08:38.001  -->  00:08:42.131
So now we have separation of broadcast domain.

86

00:08:42.591  -->  00:08:51.291
This is mean, when pc1 send arp packet, the
arp packet will not forwarded to pc 3 and pc 4,

87

00:08:51.291  -->  00:08:56.517
but only forwarded to pc 2. Let’s try it.

88

00:08:56.731  -->  00:09:04.460
But before that, we need to remove the arp
table in all pc. ARP table is the mapping

89

00:09:04.460  -->  00:09:10.545
of ip address and mac address, is the pc already
have arp table,

90

00:09:10.545  -->  00:09:14.322
so the pc will not send an arp packet.

91

00:09:15.301  -->  00:09:22.052
Okay here in the pc 1 still have arp table,
now let’s remove it.

92

00:09:22.671  -->  00:09:25.911
Okay now the arp table is empty.

93

00:09:26.231  -->  00:09:34.070
Pc 2, here we have arp table, let’s remove
it, okay now the arp table is empty.

94

00:09:34.330  -->  00:09:40.409
Let’s check in the switch, in the switch
the name is not arp table,

95

00:09:40.548  -->  00:09:42.762
but mac address table.

96

00:09:43.541  -->  00:09:48.944
Okay here there is some entry in the mac address
table, let’s delete it.

97

00:09:50.721  -->  00:09:54.381
Okay now the mac address table is empty.

98

00:09:54.681  -->  00:09:59.003
now let’s send packet from pc 1 to pc 2.

99

00:10:00.581  -->  00:10:04.651
Here we can see that pc 1 will send arp packet.

100

00:10:05.130  -->  00:10:12.951
Continue, the arp packet will be forwarded
to switch, let’s check it, here we can see

101

00:10:12.951  -->  00:10:18.956
that the arp packet will be forwarded only
to fa0/3,

102

00:10:19.256  -->  00:10:22.802
which is the interface that connected to pc 2.

103

00:10:23.341  -->  00:10:29.379
The arp packet will not forwarded to pc 3 and
pc 4, why?

104

00:10:29.379  -->  00:10:36.961
Because pc 3 and pc 4 is in the different vlan,
or in the different broadcast domain.

105

00:10:37.600  -->  00:10:43.320
Let’s continue, here we can see that the
arp packet only forwarded to pc 2.

106

00:10:43.660  -->  00:10:48.741
Pc 2 will answer the arp packet, and then forwarded
to pc 1.

107

00:10:49.160  -->  00:10:55.114
After the arp is complete like this, pc 1 will
send icmp packet,

108

00:10:55.574  -->  00:10:58.700
remember that icmp packet is the ping.

109

00:10:59.384  -->  00:11:01.102
And now successful,

110

00:11:01.900  -->  00:11:03.972
Okay I hope you understand.

111

00:11:05.030  -->  00:11:09.861
For testing again, let’s add one pc again
to vlan 10.

112

00:11:10.221  -->  00:11:14.681
Here let’s add one pc and then connecting
to the switch.

113

00:11:15.321  -->  00:11:24.771
Here we can see that the interface is fa0/5,
by default this interface is in the vlan 1,

114

00:11:25.909  -->  00:11:27.210
let’s check it.

115

00:11:27.749  -->  00:11:29.281
Do show vlan brief.

116

00:11:30.000  -->  00:11:34.922
Here we can see that fa0/5 is in the vlan
1.

117

00:11:35.700  -->  00:11:39.503
Now let’s assign this interface to vlan
10.

118

00:11:40.402  -->  00:11:48.940
Interface fa0/5, switchport mode access and
then switchport access vlan 10.

119

00:11:49.919  -->  00:11:54.241
Let’s show the vlan again, show vlan brief,
okay here we can see that now,

120

00:11:54.241  -->  00:11:58.871
fa0/5 is in the vlan 10.

121

00:11:59.550  -->  00:12:08.142
So now, if pc 1 send arp packet, the arp packet
will be broadcasted to pc 2 and pc 10, why?

122

00:12:08.721  -->  00:12:17.049
Because pc 2 and pc 10 now is in the same vlan
as pc 1, which is vlan 10.

123

00:12:17.808  -->  00:12:25.026
The case is same if we add one more pc, and
then assign the pc to vlan 10,

124

00:12:25.026  -->  00:12:29.761
so the arp packet will also broadcasted to this new pc.

125

00:12:30.360  -->  00:12:31.471
Let’s try it.

126

00:12:31.831  -->  00:12:36.330
Here we can see the interface is fa0/6.

127

00:12:36.570  -->  00:12:39.601
Let’s assign this interface to vlan 10.

128

00:12:40.080  -->  00:12:48.510
So interface fa0/6, switchport mode access,
and switchport access vlan 10.

129

00:12:48.890  -->  00:12:52.621
Let’s verify it, do show vlan brief.

130

00:12:53.081  -->  00:13:06.000
Okay here we can see that fa0/2, fa0/3, fa0/5,
and fa0/6 is in the vlan 10.

131

00:13:06.959  -->  00:13:09.171
Now let’s see the arp packet.

132

00:13:09.490  -->  00:13:13.322
But before that let’s clear the arp table first.

133

00:13:14.067  -->  00:13:22.161
Here we can see some entry in the arp table,
let’s clear it, okay now this is empty.

134

00:13:22.161  -->  00:13:29.791
PC 2, here also have arp table, let’s clear
it, okay now this is empty.

135

00:13:30.191  -->  00:13:38.088
In the switch, here we have some entry in
mac address table, let’s clear it,

136

00:13:41.144  -->  00:13:43.822
and okay now it is empty.

137

00:13:44.841  -->  00:13:53.600
Okay now let’s try to send packet from pc 1
to pc 2, here we can see that pc 1 send a arp

138

00:13:53.600  -->  00:14:00.887
packet to ask the mac address of 192.168.1.2,
which is pc 2.

139

00:14:01.726  -->  00:14:08.210
Continue, the arp packet will be forwarded
to the switch, here we can see that switch

140

00:14:08.210  -->  00:14:20.891
receive arp packet from pc 1, and then will
be broadcasted to fa0/3, fa0/5, and fa0/6.

141

00:14:21.491  -->  00:14:27.802
This is means that the arp packet will be
broadcasted to all pc in the vlan 10.

142

00:14:28.701  -->  00:14:37.010
Continue, here we can see that the arp packet
is broadcasted to pc 2, pc 10, and pc 11.

143

00:14:37.269  -->  00:14:40.771
But pc 10 and pc 11 will not reply it.

144

00:14:41.451  -->  00:14:45.832
The only one will reply this arp packet is
pc 2.

145

00:14:46.151  -->  00:14:52.172
The arp reply will sent to switch, and from
switch will sent to the pc 1.

146

00:14:52.571  -->  00:14:55.781
Next pc 1 will send icmp.

147
