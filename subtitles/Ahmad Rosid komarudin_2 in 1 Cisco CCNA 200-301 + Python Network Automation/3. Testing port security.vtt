00:00:00.708  -->  00:00:06.081
In the previous video, we have done configuring
port security on the switch 1.

2

00:00:06.876  -->  00:00:10.880
Next in this video, we are going to do testing.

3

00:00:12.066  -->  00:00:17.483
So first, let’s configure an ip address for all
server and pc.

4

00:00:19.139  -->  00:00:30.160
Here let’s say the ip address is 192.168.1.1, in this case, we don’t need a gateway, because all of this computer will

5

00:00:30.160  -->  00:00:37.629
be in the same block subnet, remember that we
need a gateway if we want to communicate with

6

00:00:37.629  -->  00:00:44.752
others computer in the different block subnet.
So in this case, we don’t need a gateway.

7

00:00:45.782  -->  00:00:49.789
Next, let’s configure the ip address for server 2.

8

00:00:50.867  -->  00:01:01.694
Desktop, ip configuration, and the ip
address is 192.168.1.2. Next server 3,

9

00:01:03.378  -->  00:01:16.817
the ip address is 192.168.1.3, and last
for the pc, the ip address is 192.168.1.4.

10

00:01:17.869  -->  00:01:22.349
And here for the hacker computer, let’s change
the name,

11

00:01:27.949  -->  00:01:32.541
and the ip address is 192.168.1.5.

12

00:01:33.255  -->  00:01:41.516
Now let’s test the communication between
all server and pc. Server 1 to pc,

13

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:49.767
success, server2 to the pc,
success, and server3 to pc,

14

00:01:49.902  -->  00:01:57.000
this is also success. So now communication
between all server and pc is ok.

15

00:01:58.124  -->  00:02:07.034
Now let’s test the port security on fa0/1,
we can unplug the cable from server1,

16

00:02:08.433  -->  00:02:17.036
and then connecting the cable to the hacker.
Now let’s try to send packet from hacker,

17

00:02:21.371  -->  00:02:29.440
okay here we can see that now the interface is
red, this is means that the interface is shutdown.

18

00:02:30.044  -->  00:02:38.143
Let’s check in the switch, do show
port-security interface fa0/1,

19

00:02:40.193  -->  00:02:45.000
here we can see that now the
status is secure shutdown,

20

00:02:46.189  -->  00:02:49.532
Okay now let’s say we know about the hacker,

21

00:02:49.750  -->  00:02:55.803
so we run to the data center and plug
the cable back to the server.

22

00:02:58.375  -->  00:03:04.920
Okay here the problem is the interface is
still shutdown even we already plug the

23

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:11.785
cable back to the server 1. The question
is, how we can enable this interface?

24

00:03:12.382  -->  00:03:20.501
Let’s try it, go to interface
fa0/1, let’s try no shutdown.

25

00:03:23.229  -->  00:03:29.334
Here we can see that the interface is
still shutdown. The light is still red.

26

00:03:29.869  -->  00:03:34.614
So we can not enable the interface
using command no shutdown.

27

00:03:35.309  -->  00:03:42.469
Let’s try again, no shutdown, here
the interface is still shutdown.

28

00:03:43.444  -->  00:03:45.492
So what is the right command?

29

00:03:46.157  -->  00:03:53.520
To enable the interface shutdown by port security
like this, we need to use shutdown command first,

30

00:03:55.433  -->  00:03:56.925
and then no shutdown.

31

00:04:00.000  -->  00:04:03.636
Okay here we can see that now the interface is up.

32

00:04:04.189  -->  00:04:10.112
So remember, we need to shutdown the
interface first, and then no shutdown.

33

00:04:10.935  -->  00:04:18.532
Now let’s check again, do show
port-security interface fa0/1,

34

00:04:20.807  -->  00:04:28.406
here we can see that now the status is
secure up. So now server 1 is up again.

35

00:04:29.400  -->  00:04:31.544
I think enough for this video

36

00:04:31.751  -->  00:04:35.079
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video
