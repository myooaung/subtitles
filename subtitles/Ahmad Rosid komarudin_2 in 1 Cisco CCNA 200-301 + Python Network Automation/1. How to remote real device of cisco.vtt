00:00:00.238  -->  00:00:04.338
In this video, we are going
to start learning about Cisco.

2

00:00:04.803  -->  00:00:08.295
First we will learn about cisco devices.

3

00:00:08.788  -->  00:00:17.295
There are so many devices provided by cisco, like
switch, router, firewall, access point, wireless

4

00:00:17.295  -->  00:00:25.100
controller, and others. But in this course, we
are going to focus on cisco switch and routers.

5

00:00:25.929  -->  00:00:31.613
Here we can see that we have cisco
router, and this is a cisco switch.

6

00:00:32.202  -->  00:00:40.064
The main different between cisco router and cisco
switch is in the number of ports. In the cisco router

7

00:00:40.064  -->  00:00:47.592
we usually just have some port like this.
But we will have many more port in cisco switch.

8

00:00:48.228  -->  00:00:52.653
So to connecting many PC,
we will use cisco switch,

9

00:00:52.960  -->  00:00:58.717
and then to connecting different block
subnet, or different room, we will use a router.

10

00:00:59.520  -->  00:01:04.085
I hope you remember the function of
switch and router that we already learn

11

00:01:04.085  -->  00:01:10.121
in the previous video. If you forgot,
try to rewatch the earlier video again.

12

00:01:11.354  -->  00:01:18.724
Okay let’s back here, to configure a cisco
devices, either router or switch, we will

13

00:01:18.724  -->  00:01:27.298
use console port. Here we can see that we have
a console port, and this is similar to LAN port,

14

00:01:27.726  -->  00:01:34.450
but if we see here, there is a blue
title that say this is a console port.

15

00:01:35.231  -->  00:01:40.696
And in the switch, the console port
is in the back, we can see it here.

16

00:01:41.402  -->  00:01:46.035
To remote the cisco devices, we
will need a console cable like this.

17

00:01:46.569  -->  00:01:54.487
The first end is just similar like RJ45,
and the other end is a serial port.

18

00:01:55.199  -->  00:02:02.000
This one that similar to RJ45 will be connected
to the console port in the cisco router

19

00:02:02.000  -->  00:02:08.195
or switch. And then the serial port
will be connected to our computer.

20

00:02:09.332  -->  00:02:15.920
But now, I think most of computer don’t
have a serial port. So in this case,

21

00:02:15.920  -->  00:02:23.680
we will need a serial to USB converter like
this. So the serial port of console cable will

22

00:02:23.680  -->  00:02:31.176
be connected to serial port in the converter,
and the USB will be connected to our computer.

23

00:02:32.671  -->  00:02:38.234
If the console cable already connected to
the router or switch, then the serial port

24

00:02:38.234  -->  00:02:44.669
is connected to the converter and from the
converter also connected to our computer,

25

00:02:45.280  -->  00:02:53.114
then we can open a device manager in the
computer. Here in the device manager we will

26

00:02:53.114  -->  00:03:01.395
see serial port like this. We need to remember
the number here, in this case the number is COM3.

27

00:03:02.537  -->  00:03:08.792
Next, we will need an application called
putty to remote the cisco devices.

28

00:03:09.540  -->  00:03:18.130
If you don’t have putty yet, you can download
it from putty.org. Here is the display of putty,

29

00:03:18.586  -->  00:03:26.616
we can choose serial, and then here we can put
the COM number like we see in the device manager,

30

00:03:27.220  -->  00:03:30.883
in this case, the COM number is COM3.

31

00:03:32.282  -->  00:03:39.261
After that we can just open the putty, and then
we can just configure cisco router and switch.

32

00:03:40.340  -->  00:03:47.471
Okay this is how we can configuring the cisco
router and switch. But in this course, we are not

33

00:03:47.471  -->  00:03:55.693
going to use cisco real device, but we will use
software simulation, which is Cisco Packet Tracer.

34

00:03:56.480  -->  00:04:02.335
With Cisco Packet Tracer, we can learn
many thing about cisco without buying

35

00:04:02.335  -->  00:04:09.280
any cisco devices. And don’t worry, if
you are familiar with Cisco Packet Tracer,

36

00:04:09.280  -->  00:04:13.582
you will be able to configuring
the real device of cisco.

37

00:04:14.660  -->  00:04:20.243
Okay I think enough for this video. In the
next video we are going to start learning

38

00:04:20.243  -->  00:04:23.789
about cisco with Cisco Packet Tracer.

39

00:04:25.075  -->  00:04:28.665
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
