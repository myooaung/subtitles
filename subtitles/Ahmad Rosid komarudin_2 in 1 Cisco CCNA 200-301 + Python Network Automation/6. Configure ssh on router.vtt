00:00:00.321  -->  00:00:06.667
In the previous video, we have done connecting
ubuntu server with router inside gns3.

2

00:00:07.254  -->  00:00:13.757
Next in this video, we are going to
configure ssh on the router 1 and router 2,

3

00:00:14.141  -->  00:00:18.490
so we can remote router 1 and router 2 from ubuntu.

4

00:00:19.029  -->  00:00:28.134
Let’s start with router 1. First, we need
to change the domain name, ip doman-name

5

00:00:29.574  -->  00:00:37.880
and then the domain, let’s say here I use
mydomain.local, you are free to use anything.

6

00:00:38.992  -->  00:00:46.418
Next, let’s generate a key for
ssh, crypto key generate rsa,

7

00:00:48.286  -->  00:00:58.646
here for the modulus by default is 512,
but the best practice is to use 1024.

8

00:01:01.597  -->  00:01:08.157
Next let’s create username and password,
username and then the username,

9

00:01:08.157  -->  00:01:19.486
let’s say here I create username cisco, and then privilege
15, if we configure privilege to 15 like this,

10

00:01:19.486  -->  00:01:27.501
when this user login, the user will directly
go to privilege mode, not user mode.

11

00:01:28.069  -->  00:01:35.581
And then secret, here we need to put the
password, let’s say the password is also cisco.

12

00:01:36.898  -->  00:01:40.256
Last let’s configure the vty.

13

00:01:40.475  -->  00:01:46.563
Line vty 0 15, and then login local.

14

00:01:47.238  -->  00:01:51.506
Okay now we have done configuring ssh on router 1.

15

00:01:52.432  -->  00:01:56.496
Let’s try to ssh from ubuntu server to router 1,

16

00:01:58.163  -->  00:02:06.669
ssh cisco@10.10.10.1, this
is the ip address of router 1.

17

00:02:08.018  -->  00:02:13.210
Okay here we get an error,
this is because the router

18

00:02:13.210  -->  00:02:20.354
is to old, so the key between ubuntu
server and router is not match.

19

00:02:20.642  -->  00:02:26.600
To solve this problem, we need to doing
some configuration on the ubuntu server.

20

00:02:27.938  -->  00:02:31.902
nano .ssh/config

21

00:02:33.501  -->  00:02:36.445
Here we need to add some configuration,

22

00:02:36.875  -->  00:02:44.360
Host and then the ip address of
the router. Which is 10.10.10.1

23

00:02:44.926  -->  00:02:51.893
Here we can Tab, and then here
we need to type KexAlgorithms

24

00:02:54.862  -->  00:02:59.554
and then + and then the error message that we get.

25

00:02:59.893  -->  00:03:03.336
You can just type the configuration like this.

26

00:03:04.120  -->  00:03:11.234
Okay we have done here, let’s
save it, ctrl + x , y, enter.

27

00:03:12.054  -->  00:03:22.054
Let’s ssh to router 1 again, okay we
get an error unsupported algorithms.

28

00:03:22.560  -->  00:03:25.917
I think we do a mistake in the configuration.

29

00:03:26.198  -->  00:03:33.896
Let’s edit the file again, here we can
put # to comment the configuration,

30

00:03:34.475  -->  00:03:39.195
so now this configuration is not
used. Save it, ctrl + x, y, enter.

31

00:03:39.901  -->  00:03:41.946
Let’s ssh again,

32

00:03:42.992  -->  00:03:47.230
Okay here we can see the error
message, let’s write this

33

00:03:47.230  -->  00:03:52.078
so we can see the error message
when configuring on ubuntu server,

34

00:04:05.232  -->  00:04:08.394
Now let’s configure ubuntu
server again, nano .ssh/config,

35

00:04:09.661  -->  00:04:11.449
Uncomment this,

36

00:04:14.286  -->  00:04:18.994
And then here we missing I in the algorithms.

37

00:04:23.160  -->  00:04:24.354
Save it, ctrl + x, y, enter.

38

00:04:25.174  -->  00:04:33.291
Now let’s ssh to the router 1 again, okay
here we can see that we get another error,

39

00:04:33.690  -->  00:04:46.142
no matching cipher found, their offer
aes128, 3des, aes192, or aes256.

40

00:04:46.656  -->  00:04:57.488
So we need to add a configuration again, let’s
say we will use the last one, which is aes256-cbc.

41

00:04:58.206  -->  00:05:09.752
Nano .ssh/config, let’s add the
configuration here, cipher +aes256-cbc.

42

00:05:14.861  -->  00:05:15.966
Save it, ctrl + x, y, enter.

43

00:05:17.349  -->  00:05:25.400
Let’s try to ssh to router 1 again, okay here
we can see that we don’t get an error anymore.

44

00:05:25.813  -->  00:05:35.102
Yes, let’s type the password and here we
are success to remote router 1 using ssh.

45

00:05:35.733  -->  00:05:39.582
To exit from router 1, just type exit.

46

00:05:41.035  -->  00:05:49.546
Okay now we have done configuring ssh on
router 1, next let’s configure ssh on router 2.

47

00:05:50.883  -->  00:05:54.019
First let’s configure the domain name,

48

00:05:54.309  -->  00:06:01.682
Ip domain-name and then the domain,
let’s say I use mydomain.local.

49

00:06:02.192  -->  00:06:14.186
Next, let’s create the key, crypto key
generate rsa, for the modulus, I use 1024.

50

00:06:14.789  -->  00:06:23.886
Next let’s create the username, username
cisco privilege 15 secret cisco.

51

00:06:25.189  -->  00:06:33.456
Last, let’s configure vty,
line vty 0 15. Login local,

52

00:06:33.989  -->  00:06:38.083
Okay we have done configuring ssh on router 2,

53

00:06:38.526  -->  00:06:48.786
Let’s try to remote the router 2 from
ubuntu server, ssh cisco@10.10.10.2,

54

00:06:49.552  -->  00:06:53.741
Okay here we get an error like in the router 1.

55

00:06:54.133  -->  00:07:02.555
Let’s configure on ubuntu again, here we
can add the configuration for router 2,

56

00:07:02.976  -->  00:07:10.323
the configuration will be same as router 1,
the only differences is in the host.

57

00:07:11.078  -->  00:07:13.884
But if we have many router,

58

00:07:13.884  -->  00:07:20.506
absolutely this is not effective if we need to
add the configuration for each router.

59

00:07:21.050  -->  00:07:29.237
The solution is, we can change the ip
address become stars. This is means all host.

60

00:07:29.870  -->  00:07:30.829
Save it, ctrl + x, y, enter.

61

00:07:32.701  -->  00:07:40.542
Now let’s try to ssh to router 2
again, okay we are success here.

62

00:07:41.435  -->  00:07:45.179
Okay, now we have done configuring ssh on router 1

63

00:07:45.179  -->  00:07:52.157
and router 2, and now we are success
remote the router from ubuntu server.

64

00:07:52.584  -->  00:07:55.323
I think enough for this video

65

00:07:55.395  -->  00:07:58.955
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
