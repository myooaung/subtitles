00:00:00.880  -->  00:00:07.220
This is what we are going to build in this
course. Here we can see a graph that show

2

00:00:07.220  -->  00:00:16.240
us the devices that we manage. We have total
9 devices with 2 cisco devices and 7 mikrotik devices.

3

00:00:17.140  -->  00:00:24.240
Here we can see last event. This is show us
the 10 last event that our application do.

4

00:00:24.800  -->  00:00:32.240
We have a navbar in the top. If we click Device
List, we will see the list of all devices

5

00:00:32.240  -->  00:00:34.780
that managed by our application.

6

00:00:34.960  -->  00:00:41.340
If we want to add, edit, or delete a device,
we can do that in the django admin.

7

00:00:41.740  -->  00:00:46.960
Here we can edit device by click the device that we
want to edit.

8

00:00:47.520  -->  00:00:52.800
We can also add a new device by clicking
add device here.

9

00:00:53.640  -->  00:00:59.600
Type the IP Address, Hostname, Username, Password, and ssh port.

10

00:00:59.600  -->  00:01:04.720
Also we
need to devine the vendor, is this Mikrotik or Cisco.

11

00:01:05.560  -->  00:01:11.620
Let’s back to our apps. Here we can also
see Configure menu.

12

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:23.080
Here, we can configure our devices. Let’s say we want to configure 10.1.1.1 which is mikrotik device, and 10.1.1.2

13

00:01:23.080  -->  00:01:31.720
which is cisco devices. Here we can type the mikrotik command. And here we can type the cisco command.

14

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:36.920
Later the application will
decide, if the device is mikrotik, so the

15

00:01:36.920  -->  00:01:42.980
application will send the mikrotik command.
And if the device is cisco, so the application

16

00:01:42.980  -->  00:01:48.660
will send the cisco command.
Here we also have verify config menu.

17

00:01:50.400  -->  00:01:57.020
Here we can verify the configuration on all of devices.
Let’s say we want to see the ip address

18

00:01:57.020  -->  00:02:02.640
configuration on all devices. We just need
to check all devices and type the command

19

00:02:02.640  -->  00:02:04.780
to display ip address here.

20

00:02:06.640  -->  00:02:08.640
And this is the result.

21

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:15.500
Last, we have a Log menu here. Here we can
see the history of our application.
