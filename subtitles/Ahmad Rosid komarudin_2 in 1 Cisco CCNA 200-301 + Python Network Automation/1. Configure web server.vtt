00:00:00.168  -->  00:00:04.774
In the previous section, we already learn
about standard access list.

2

00:00:05.048  -->  00:00:10.460
Next in this section, we area going to learn about extended access list.

3

00:00:10.955  -->  00:00:15.517
But before that, we are going to learn about web server first.

4

00:00:15.947  -->  00:00:21.091
For example, when we access facebook.com from
the browser,

5

00:00:21.209  -->  00:00:25.006
actually we access the facebook server in the internet.

6

00:00:25.684  -->  00:00:33.544
So here we will configure this server so we can access it from the browser in the client or pc.

7

00:00:33.984  -->  00:00:45.257
Let’s start, open server 1, service, here
we can see http. Http is a web server.

8

00:00:45.726  -->  00:00:55.741
And https is the secure version of http, so this is also web server. Here we can see that

9

00:00:55.741  -->  00:01:04.902
by default, http and https is already on,
so actually, the web server is already active.

10

00:01:05.567  -->  00:01:14.881
Next, we also able to change the display of the web server, here we can edit index.html.

11

00:01:15.533  -->  00:01:29.312
Let’s change this. Welcome to Server 1,
save, yes, okay we have done on server 1,

12

00:01:29.807  -->  00:01:40.063
Next let’s also change the display of server 2,
go to service, here http and https is already on,

13

00:01:40.493  -->  00:01:46.451
let’s edit index.html, change it to
Welcome to server 2.

14

00:01:52.018  -->  00:01:55.110
Let’s also change the display of server 3.

15

00:01:55.501  -->  00:02:06.221
Go to service, http and https is already on,
and then edit index.html, let’s change this

16

00:02:06.221  -->  00:02:08.680
to Welcome to server 3.

17

00:02:12.878  -->  00:02:20.481
Now let’s access the web server from pc.
But if you remember, now we have access list

18

00:02:20.481  -->  00:02:24.580
on router 2 that only allow from vlan 30.

19

00:02:25.102  -->  00:02:30.176
So vlan 10 and vlan 20 will not able to access
the server.

20

00:02:30.646  -->  00:02:41.857
Let’s unassign the access list first, here
we already in fa0/0, copy the command, no

21

00:02:41.857  -->  00:02:43.919
and then paste the command,

22

00:02:45.000  -->  00:02:52.750
Now let’s ping from the client to the server,
vlan 10 to server, failed, test again,

23

00:02:54.210  -->  00:03:06.474
okay still failed, fast forward time, test again,
okay this is success, vlan 20 to the server,

24

00:03:07.191  -->  00:03:12.364
success, vlan 30 to the server, also success.

25

00:03:12.925  -->  00:03:17.183
Now let’s try to access the server from
web browser.

26

00:03:19.504  -->  00:03:26.199
Put the ip address of the server here, let’s
say we want to access server 2, the ip address

27

00:03:26.199  -->  00:03:37.134
is 192.168.1.20, okay here we can see that
we are success to access the web server of server 2.

28

00:03:37.678  -->  00:03:42.700
But here we use http, this is not secure.

29

00:03:44.212  -->  00:03:49.371
If we want to access https, we can use https
here.

30

00:03:49.854  -->  00:03:58.313
So https:// and then the ip address of the
server, let’s say we want to access server 1,

31

00:03:58.535  -->  00:04:02.206
so here 192.168.1.10,

32

00:04:04.904  -->  00:04:06.912
Okay this is success.

33

00:04:07.603  -->  00:04:19.848
Let’s also try to access from vlan 10, https://192.168.1.30,
this is server 3.

34

00:04:24.476  -->  00:04:26.979
Okay this is also success.

35

00:04:27.488  -->  00:04:30.902
Okay so now we understand about web server.

36

00:04:31.267  -->  00:04:37.104
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to learn about extended

37

00:04:37.104  -->  00:04:38.414
access list.

38

00:04:38.609  -->  00:04:42.023
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
