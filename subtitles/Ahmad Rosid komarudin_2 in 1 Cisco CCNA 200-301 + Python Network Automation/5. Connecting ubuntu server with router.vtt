00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:08.640
In the previous video, we have done installing
ubuntu server, now in this video, we are going

2

00:00:08.640  -->  00:00:14.310
to learn how to connecting ubuntu server with
the router inside gns3.

3

00:00:14.310  -->  00:00:16.760
Let’s just start.

4

00:00:16.760  -->  00:00:30.119
Shutdown the ubuntu server first, we can just
close this, and then choose power off

5

00:00:30.119  -->  00:00:38.430
Click on the ubuntu server and then click
settings, in the network section, here we

6

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:46.610
can see that we have 4 network adapter, but
by default, we only have 1 active network

7

00:00:46.610  -->  00:00:48.820
adapter.

8

00:00:48.820  -->  00:00:58.120
Here adapter 2 is not active, adapter 3 is
not active and adapter 4 is also not active.

9

00:00:58.120  -->  00:01:03.010
So by default, only adapter 1 is active.

10

00:01:03.010  -->  00:01:06.869
And this adapter is attached to nat.

11

00:01:06.869  -->  00:01:10.240
Nat is used to connect to internet.

12

00:01:10.240  -->  00:01:19.159
Now, we want to connecting this ubuntu server
with router inside gns3, to do that, we will

13

00:01:19.159  -->  00:01:22.390
add one more adapter here.

14

00:01:22.390  -->  00:01:30.289
So click enable network adapter, for attached
to, we will leave it as not attached like

15

00:01:30.289  -->  00:01:31.399
this.

16

00:01:31.399  -->  00:01:44.180
Okay, we have done here, let’s go to gns3,
go to preference, in the virtualbox vms sections,

17

00:01:44.180  -->  00:01:48.799
click new to import new virtual machine.

18

00:01:48.799  -->  00:01:59.289
Here gns3 will detect all vm in the virtualbox,
in this case, I just have 1 VM, which is ubuntu,

19

00:01:59.289  -->  00:02:03.999
so choose this and then finish.

20

00:02:03.999  -->  00:02:11.379
Next we need to edit this vm to add new network
adapter, in the network section, here we can

21

00:02:11.379  -->  00:02:19.549
see that by default we only have 1 network
adapter, let’s add this become 2.

22

00:02:19.549  -->  00:02:22.370
Okay we have done here.

23

00:02:22.370  -->  00:02:27.819
Here we can see ubuntu, let’s import this
to the project.

24

00:02:27.819  -->  00:02:32.849
Let’s connecting ubuntu server with router1
and router2.

25

00:02:32.849  -->  00:02:46.530
Let’s remove the cable between router1 and
router2 first, let’s import a switch, connecting

26

00:02:46.530  -->  00:02:57.610
router1 to the switch, router2 to the switch,
and then from switch to ubuntu.

27

00:02:57.610  -->  00:03:01.040
Here we can choose ethernet0 and ethernet1,

28

00:03:01.040  -->  00:03:12.180
Ethernet0 is nat adapter, and ethernet1 is
not attached adapter, in this case, we will

29

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:14.000
choose ethernet1.

30

00:03:14.000  -->  00:03:22.030
Okay we have done, next, here we can see that
the ubuntu is still red, this is means that

31

00:03:22.030  -->  00:03:24.390
ubuntu is not started yet.

32

00:03:24.390  -->  00:03:31.409
Let’s start it, right click and choose start.

33

00:03:31.409  -->  00:03:36.250
Wait for a minute until the ubuntu is started.

34

00:03:36.250  -->  00:03:44.400
While waiting the ubuntu for a booting, Let’s
make sure the ip address on the router,

35

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:56.909
Router1, do show ip interface brief, here
we can see that in the fa0/0, the ip address

36

00:03:56.909  -->  00:03:59.579
is 10.10.10.1,

37

00:03:59.579  -->  00:04:12.150
Router2, do show ip interface brief, here
we can see that the ip address of fa0/0 is

38

00:04:12.150  -->  00:04:13.150
10.10.10.2

39

00:04:13.150  -->  00:04:21.150
And then for ubuntu server, let’s say the
ip address will be 10.10.10.254.

40

00:04:21.150  -->  00:04:30.160
Let’s back to the ubuntu, let’s login,

41

00:04:30.160  -->  00:04:42.290
To check the ip address on the ubuntu, the
command is ip address.

42

00:04:42.290  -->  00:04:50.669
Here we can see that we have 2 interfaces,
enp0s3, this

43

00:04:50.669  -->  00:04:57.930
interface is connected to internet, and then
we also have enp0s8 that connected to the

44

00:04:57.930  -->  00:05:00.800
router inside gns3.

45

00:05:00.800  -->  00:05:13.000
Later, we will configure the ip address of
enp0s8 become 10.10.10.254 . let’s start

46

00:05:13.000  -->  00:05:18.210
the configuration,

47

00:05:18.210  -->  00:05:24.889
nano /etc/netplan/00 and then tab,

48

00:05:24.889  -->  00:05:31.800
we can use autocomplete here, let’s try
to remove this first,

49

00:05:31.800  -->  00:05:40.910
here let’s type et and then tab, here we
can see that this is autocomplete, next let’s

50

00:05:40.910  -->  00:05:50.440
type net and than tab, okay this is not autocomplete,
let’s type p and then tab.

51

00:05:50.440  -->  00:05:53.630
Okay this is autocomplete.

52

00:05:53.630  -->  00:05:59.330
And then 00 tab, okay this is autocomplete.

53

00:05:59.330  -->  00:06:05.889
So this is the command to configure the ip
address on the ubuntu server, let’s enter

54

00:06:05.889  -->  00:06:06.889
here.

55

00:06:06.889  -->  00:06:14.789
Here we can see that by default, enp0s3 is
dhcp client, so the ubuntu server is get an

56

00:06:14.789  -->  00:06:19.509
ip address automatically on enp0s3.

57

00:06:19.509  -->  00:06:28.530
Now let’s configure enp0s8 using static
ip address, here let’s type enp0s8, pay

58

00:06:28.530  -->  00:06:35.740
attention here that we use 0, not o.

59

00:06:35.740  -->  00:06:45.860
And then here we can type the ip address,
10.10.10.254/24,

60

00:06:45.860  -->  00:06:54.190
Okay we have done here, to exit and save this
configuration, we can use ctrl + x, and then

61

00:06:54.190  -->  00:06:57.990
y, and then enter.

62

00:06:57.990  -->  00:07:01.410
Okay here we get an error message permission
denied.

63

00:07:01.410  -->  00:07:08.490
Ctrl + x again here and then choose no to
exit without save.

64

00:07:08.490  -->  00:07:19.360
Here we need to use sudo command, so sudo
nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yml.

65

00:07:19.360  -->  00:07:22.800
enter,

66

00:07:22.800  -->  00:07:26.970
We need to type our password here,

67

00:07:26.970  -->  00:07:45.840
Now let’s configure the ip address of enp0s8
again.

68

00:07:45.840  -->  00:07:52.860
Okay we have done, ctrl + x to exit, y and
then enter.

69

00:07:52.860  -->  00:08:03.009
Okay we are success now, to apply the ip address
configuration, the command is netplan apply.

70

00:08:03.009  -->  00:08:09.010
Okay here we get an error message permission
denied again, remember that we need to use

71

00:08:09.010  -->  00:08:10.860
sudo,

72

00:08:10.860  -->  00:08:14.460
So sudo netplan apply.

73

00:08:14.460  -->  00:08:19.990
Let’s check the ip address again,

74

00:08:19.990  -->  00:08:26.360
Ip address, here we can see that the ip address
of enp0s8 is 10.10.10.254.

75

00:08:26.360  -->  00:08:36.740
Let’s try ping to router1 and router2, ping
10.10.10.1,

76

00:08:36.740  -->  00:08:37.930
Okay this is success.

77

00:08:37.930  -->  00:08:48.050
Let’s try ping to router2, ping 10.10.10.2,
okay this is also success.

78

00:08:48.050  -->  00:08:53.610
Okay so now we are success to connecting ubuntu
server with router inside gns3.

79

00:08:53.610  -->  00:09:00.870
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure ssh on the

80

00:09:00.870  -->  00:09:06.529
router so we can remote the router from ubuntu
server.

81

00:09:06.529  -->  00:09:09.760
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
