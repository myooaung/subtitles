00:00:00.098  -->  00:00:09.404
In this video, we are going to learn about decode.
Here in the line 21, we have decode script.

2

00:00:10.116  -->  00:00:18.080
I said before, that the data type of
output is byte, and if we print the byte,

3

00:00:18.080  -->  00:00:23.936
the output is not good, this
is why we use decode here.

4

00:00:24.916  -->  00:00:28.516
So this decode is used to convert

5

00:00:28.516  -->  00:00:35.794
from byte to string. Let’s try to remove
this decode and see what happened.

6

00:00:36.632  -->  00:00:45.599
Let’s change the loopback to loopback3,
and the ip address is 10.1.1.4. save,

7

00:00:46.516  -->  00:00:56.350
Let’s run the script, clear, and
then python paramiko_basic.py,

8

00:00:58.010  -->  00:01:06.470
Just enter here, the username also just
enter, and the password, also just enter.

9

00:01:07.414  -->  00:01:13.512
Here we can see that we are success login
to router 1, and we also success to send

10

00:01:13.512  -->  00:01:24.666
the configuration, but here we can see b, this is
means byte. And the output is not good like this.

11

00:01:25.423  -->  00:01:30.781
But the command is sent to
the router 1. Let’s check it.

12

00:01:32.498  -->  00:01:36.425
Show ip interface brief exclude unassign.

13

00:01:37.680  -->  00:01:40.398
Here we can see that we have loopback3,

14

00:01:40.712  -->  00:01:48.932
and the ip address is 10.1.1.4, this is
the loopback interface that we just create.

15

00:01:49.850  -->  00:01:58.364
Okay, so once again, the data type of output
is byte, we also can print the data type,

16

00:01:59.547  -->  00:02:03.350
here let’s print type and then output.

17

00:02:04.240  -->  00:02:04.910
Save,

18

00:02:08.632  -->  00:02:17.136
Let’s run the script again, python3
paramiko_basic.py, just enter enter here.

19

00:02:18.000  -->  00:02:21.204
Here we can see that the data type is byte.

20

00:02:22.054  -->  00:02:30.150
Now let’s put the decode again. Remember that
decode is used to convert byte to string.

21

00:02:31.601  -->  00:02:40.247
Save, back to terminal, and run the
script again, just enter enter here.

22

00:02:42.463  -->  00:02:46.639
Here we can see that now the data type is string.

23

00:02:47.236  -->  00:02:49.743
And now the output is good.

24

00:02:50.623  -->  00:02:54.301
Okay I hope you understand the function of decode.

25

00:02:54.729  -->  00:02:57.043
I think enough for this video

26

00:02:57.432  -->  00:03:01.114
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
