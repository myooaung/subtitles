00:00:00.657  -->  00:00:07.078
In the previous video, we already learn how
to configure etherchannel using LACP.

2

00:00:07.759  -->  00:00:14.480
Now in this video, we are going to learn how
to configure etherchannel using PAGP.

3

00:00:14.946  -->  00:00:16.269
Let’s just start.

4

00:00:17.125  -->  00:00:26.667
First, let’s import new switch, let’s
say here we use layer 3 switch, which is 3560.

5

00:00:29.262  -->  00:00:33.000
Now let’s connecting the new switch to switch 1.

6

00:00:40.937  -->  00:00:45.176
Here we can see that we have blocking port
in multi layer switch.

7

00:00:46.108  -->  00:00:51.393
We will configure an etherchannel here soo
all interface will active.

8

00:00:52.136  -->  00:00:55.111
In this case, we are going to use PAGP.

9

00:00:56.056  -->  00:01:02.836
Let’s start the configuration, open switch 1,
here we can see that the interface connected

10

00:01:02.836  -->  00:01:09.580
to multi layer switch is fa0/5 until fa0/7.

11

00:01:10.538  -->  00:01:20.676
So here interface range fa0/5-7, switchport
mode trunk, remember that we need to configure

12

00:01:20.676  -->  00:01:25.624
the interface as trunk first before configuring
etherchannel.

13

00:01:26.619  -->  00:01:33.815
Next let’s configure the etherchannel, so
channel-group and then the id,

14

00:01:34.697  -->  00:01:45.055
remember that id 1 is already used for interface that connected
to switch 0, so here we can not use 1 anymore,

15

00:01:45.635  -->  00:01:48.000
let’s say here we will use 2.

16

00:01:48.908  -->  00:01:50.558
Mode, question mark.

17

00:01:51.200  -->  00:01:56.893
Here we can see that for PAGP we can use mode
auto or desirable.

18

00:01:57.837  -->  00:02:06.076
This is same as active and passive in LACP,
auto is waiting for invitation from the neighbor,

19

00:02:06.529  -->  00:02:11.604
and desirable will invite the neighbor to
activate etherchannel.

20

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:24.884
So if desirable meet with auto, the etherchannel
will up, desirable meet with desirable,

21

00:02:25.338  -->  00:02:34.055
the etherchannel will also up, but if auto meet
with auto, the etherchannel will not up.

22

00:02:36.498  -->  00:02:40.222
In this case, let’s configure switch 1 to
desirable.

23

00:02:44.946  -->  00:02:52.290
Okay now we have done configuring etherchannel
in switch 1, next let’s configure etherchannel

24

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:53.890
in multi layer switch.

25

00:02:54.848  -->  00:02:59.686
Here we can see that the interface is fa0/1
until 3.

26

00:03:04.649  -->  00:03:13.455
No, enable, configure terminal, interface
range fa0/1-3.

27

00:03:13.694  -->  00:03:16.081
And then switchport mode trunk.

28

00:03:17.177  -->  00:03:21.978
Okay here we can see that we get an error
“command rejected”.

29

00:03:23.162  -->  00:03:30.247
Remember that if we configure trunk in multi
layer switch, we must define the encapsulation first.

30

00:03:30.670  -->  00:03:40.143
So here switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q,
and then switchport mode trunk.

31

00:03:41.302  -->  00:03:45.056
Okay here we can see that we don’t get an
error anymore.

32

00:03:46.026  -->  00:03:49.099
Next, let’s configure the etherchannel.

33

00:03:50.245  -->  00:03:58.515
So here channel-group 2, remember that in
switch1, we use id 2, so here we must use

34

00:03:58.515  -->  00:03:59.822
id 2.

35

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:07.825
Mode, in the switch 1 we use mode desirable,
so here we are free to use desirable again

36

00:04:07.825  -->  00:04:09.195
or auto.

37

00:04:10.190  -->  00:04:13.283
In this case we will use desirable again.

38

00:04:14.479  -->  00:04:19.078
Okay now we have done configuring etherchannel,
fast forward time.

39

00:04:20.010  -->  00:04:26.912
Here we can see that all of interface is green,
let’s check in switch 1, do show etherchannel

40

00:04:26.912  -->  00:04:27.954
summary.

41

00:04:29.024  -->  00:04:37.560
Here we have po2, uppercase s uppercase u,
this is means layer 2 and in use,

42

00:04:38.140  -->  00:04:49.877
the protocol is pagp, the port is fa0/5 until 7, and all
of the port is P, this is means in port channel.

43

00:04:50.784  -->  00:04:56.028
Let’s also check in the multi layer switch,
do show etherchannel summary.

44

00:04:57.867  -->  00:05:06.853
Here we also have po2, uppercase s and uppercase
u, this is means layer 2 and in use, the protocol

45

00:05:06.853  -->  00:05:12.607
is pagp, and the interface is fa0/1 until
3.

46

00:05:13.199  -->  00:05:17.018
And all of the interface is in port channel.

47

00:05:18.139  -->  00:05:23.114
Okay so now the etherchannel between switch 1
and multi layer switch is up.

48

00:05:23.693  -->  00:05:31.560
Let’s add a pc for testing, connecting the
pc to multi layer switch, and configure the

49

00:05:31.560  -->  00:05:40.077
ip address, let’s say 192.168.1.3

50

00:05:41.802  -->  00:05:51.807
Let’s ping from pc 1 to pc , okay success,
from pc 2 to pc 0, also success.

51

00:05:52.739  -->  00:06:00.492
Okay so now we have done configuring the etherchannel
using PAGP, and the etherchannel is up!

52

00:06:01.386  -->  00:06:03.386
I think enough for this video

53

00:06:03.386  -->  00:06:06.713
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
