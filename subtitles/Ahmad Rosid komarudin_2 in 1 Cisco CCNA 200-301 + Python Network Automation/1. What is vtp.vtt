00:00:01.173  -->  00:00:07.119
In this section, we are going to learn about
VTP or virtual trunking protocol.

2

00:00:07.721  -->  00:00:12.243
What is vtp and when we need to configure
vtp?

3

00:00:12.984  -->  00:00:16.620
We will learn about vtp with an example case.

4

00:00:17.735  -->  00:00:25.811
For example here we have 12 switch, and in
each switch we need to create 200 vlan.

5

00:00:26.691  -->  00:00:33.672
Absolutely this is not effective if we need
to create a vlan one by one in each switch.

6

00:00:35.572  -->  00:00:43.054
The first problem is time, we will need much
of time to configure 200 vlan in each switch.

7

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:47.067
The second problem is human error.

8

00:00:47.631  -->  00:00:53.322
We as human, will be bored if doing repetitive
job for long time.

9

00:00:54.386  -->  00:00:57.224
And if we bored, we will doing a mistake.

10

00:00:58.038  -->  00:01:00.618
This is why we will use VTP.

11

00:01:01.351  -->  00:01:05.942
If we use VTP, the vlan will be created automatically.

12

00:01:07.101  -->  00:01:11.184
In VTP, we will have mode server and mode
client.

13

00:01:14.653  -->  00:01:21.305
1 switch will be configured as server and
others switch will be configured as client.

14

00:01:22.412  -->  00:01:31.378
For example we configure this switch as vtp
server, and then all others switch will become client.

15

00:01:32.273  -->  00:01:40.523
Later we only need to create 200 vlan on this
vtp server, and then the vlan will be created

16

00:01:40.523  -->  00:01:45.442
automatically on switch which configured as
vtp client.

17

00:01:46.814  -->  00:01:53.605
Okay so that is the concept of vtp, I hope
you understand the concept of VTP.

18

00:01:54.367  -->  00:02:01.145
And I think enough for this video, in the next video we
are going to practice about vtp.

19

00:02:01.907  -->  00:02:04.920
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
