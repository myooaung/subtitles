00:00:00.181  -->  00:00:05.793
In the previous video, we already learn about
the differences between static routing and

2

00:00:05.793  -->  00:00:07.175
dynamic routing.

3

00:00:07.855  -->  00:00:14.472
We know that if we use dynamic routing, each
router will advertise their connected network,

4

00:00:15.251  -->  00:00:25.471
so here router 1 will advertise 10.10.10.0/24
and 192.168.1.0/24.

5

00:00:26.275  -->  00:00:35.149
Router 2 will advertise 10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.

6

00:00:36.410  -->  00:00:41.532
Okay, next for dynamic routing, we have some
protocol that we can use.

7

00:00:42.151  -->  00:00:44.566
The first protocol is RIP.

8

00:00:45.110  -->  00:00:48.130
But this protocol is not used anymore

9

00:00:49.367  -->  00:00:58.179
And then we can use EIGRP, this is cisco proprietary,
so we only can use this protocol in cisco

10

00:00:58.179  -->  00:00:59.297
devices.

11

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:04.633
If we use other vendor, we can not use EIGRP.

12

00:01:05.771  -->  00:01:10.527
Next, we have OSPF, this is open protocol.

13

00:01:10.898  -->  00:01:14.263
So we can use this protocol on any vendor.

14

00:01:15.203  -->  00:01:17.490
Next we have BGP.

15

00:01:17.762  -->  00:01:20.273
This is also open protocol.

16

00:01:21.163  -->  00:01:25.380
But the usage is different with eigrp and
ospf.

17

00:01:25.763  -->  00:01:30.120
We will talk more about bgp later in the next
video.

18

00:01:30.825  -->  00:01:34.555
In this video, we will learn about EIGRP first.

19

00:01:35.891  -->  00:01:48.229
Let’s just start, open router 1, enable,
configure terminal, to configure eigrp,

20

00:01:48.229  -->  00:01:55.986
the command is router eigrp and then question
mark, here we need to define an autonomous

21

00:01:55.986  -->  00:01:57.479
system number.

22

00:01:57.986  -->  00:02:00.153
What is autonomous system number?

23

00:02:00.685  -->  00:02:05.337
We will learn about this later when we learn
about bgp.

24

00:02:06.166  -->  00:02:12.563
For now let’s just choose random number
between 1 and 65535.

25

00:02:13.516  -->  00:02:15.568
Let’s say here I use 10.

26

00:02:16.421  -->  00:02:23.591
One thing that you need to remember is, in
eigrp, all router must use same autonomous

27

00:02:23.591  -->  00:02:33.200
system number, so here if we use 10 in router 1,
later in router 2 also must use 10.

28

00:02:34.832  -->  00:02:42.399
Next, let’s advertise the connected network,
here in router 1, the connected network is

29

00:02:42.399  -->  00:02:49.036
10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24.

30

00:02:49.605  -->  00:02:52.425
So we need to advertise this two network.

31

00:02:52.944  -->  00:03:01.333
The command is network and then the network,
let’s advertise 10.10.10.0 first.

32

00:03:02.470  -->  00:03:07.392
Next let’s advertise 192.168.1.0.

33

00:03:12.215  -->  00:03:15.351
Okay now we have done on router 1.

34

00:03:15.920  -->  00:03:18.907
Next let’s configure on router 2.

35

00:03:19.377  -->  00:03:25.759
Enable, configure terminal, router eigrp 10,
remember that we must use the same autonomous

36

00:03:25.759  -->  00:03:28.177
system number on all router.

37

00:03:33.285  -->  00:03:40.029
Next, let’s advertise the connected network,
here router 2 also have 2 connected network,

38

00:03:40.227  -->  00:03:47.426
which is 10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24.

39

00:03:47.884  -->  00:03:49.540
Let’s advertise it.

40

00:03:50.616  -->  00:03:58.542
Network 10.10.10.0 and then network 192.168.2.0

41

00:04:00.000  -->  00:04:09.298
Here we can see a message neighbor 10.10.10.1
is up, this is means that the eigrp is up.

42

00:04:09.879  -->  00:04:16.185
To verify it, we can use command do show ip
eigrp neighbor.

43

00:04:19.809  -->  00:04:27.677
Here we can see that we have a neighbor 10.10.10.1
which Is the ip address of router 1,

44

00:04:28.802  -->  00:04:37.301
Let’s check the routing table, do show ip
route, here we can see that we have 2 connected route,

45

00:04:37.499  -->  00:04:50.683
which is 10.10.10.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24,
and then here we have d 192.168.1.0/24,

46

00:04:51.425  -->  00:04:55.625
This route is added automatically by eigrp.

47

00:04:56.268  -->  00:05:03.000
Here we can see that the destination is the
network of pc 1, and the next hop is router 1.

48

00:05:04.348  -->  00:05:09.171
The label is D. D is means eigrp.

49

00:05:10.086  -->  00:05:18.949
Now let’s check on router 1, do show ip route,
here we can see that router 1 also have route

50

00:05:18.949  -->  00:05:24.000
to pc 2, and this is also added automatically.

51

00:05:25.525  -->  00:05:36.246
Now pc 1 should be able to communicate with
pc 2, let’s try it, ping 192.168.2.2,

52

00:05:38.855  -->  00:05:42.188
Okay here we can see that the ping is success.

53

00:05:43.004  -->  00:05:48.885
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to add 1 more router to

54

00:05:48.885  -->  00:05:50.345
our topology.

55

00:05:50.926  -->  00:05:54.418
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
