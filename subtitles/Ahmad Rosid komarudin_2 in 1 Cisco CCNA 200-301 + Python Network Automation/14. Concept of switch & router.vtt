00:00:00.708  -->  00:00:06.190
In the previous video we already learn about
the concept of block subnet.

2

00:00:06.674  -->  00:00:11.776
Next in this video, we are going to learn
about networking devices.

3

00:00:12.641  -->  00:00:18.389
In the computer network, we will need some
device to build a computer network it self.

4

00:00:18.847  -->  00:00:24.221
The main devices that we need to build a computer
network is switch and router.

5

00:00:25.048  -->  00:00:32.103
Actually there are many other devices that
we will need in computer network, like firewall,

6

00:00:32.103  -->  00:00:35.900
access point, wirelss controller, and others.

7

00:00:36.765  -->  00:00:43.610
But in this course, we will learn about this
two first, which is switch and router.

8

00:00:44.628  -->  00:00:50.191
Switch is used to connecting many computer
that is in the same block subnet.

9

00:00:50.675  -->  00:00:56.926
And router is used to connecting many computer
that is in the different block subnet.

10

00:00:57.880  -->  00:01:04.040
If you remember in the previous video, I show
you that if 2 pc in the different block subnet,

11

00:01:04.040  -->  00:01:07.556
that 2 pc can not communicate each others.

12

00:01:08.154  -->  00:01:18.248
So here if here we have 2 pc, the ip address
of pc 1 is 10.10.10.10/27, and the ip address

13

00:01:18.248  -->  00:01:22.644
of pc 2 is 10.10.10.60.

14

00:01:23.089  -->  00:01:26.926
Here we can see that pc 1 is in the first block
subnet.

15

00:01:27.244  -->  00:01:30.223
And pc 2 is in the second block subnet.

16

00:01:30.757  -->  00:01:34.826
In this case, pc 1 can not communicate with
pc 2.

17

00:01:35.386  -->  00:01:43.162
But if the ip address of pc 2 also in the first
block subnet, let’s say 20, this two pc

18

00:01:43.162  -->  00:01:46.125
will able to communicate each others.

19

00:01:47.155  -->  00:01:50.287
Okay, now let’s learn more about switch.

20

00:01:50.758  -->  00:01:57.000
Remember that switch is used to connecting
many pc that is in the same block subnet.

21

00:01:57.814  -->  00:02:05.521
In the previous case, we only have 2 pc, but
how if we also have pc 3 and pc 4,

22

00:02:07.010  -->  00:02:09.433
how if we have 100 pc?

23

00:02:09.992  -->  00:02:12.377
This is why we need a switch.

24

00:02:13.026  -->  00:02:19.724
So here we can put a switch, and then all
of computer can connect to the switch.

25

00:02:20.258  -->  00:02:22.628
How many computer can connect to the switch?

26

00:02:23.150  -->  00:02:30.332
This is based on the port in the switch, some
switch have 24 port, and some other switch

27

00:02:30.332  -->  00:02:32.219
have 48 port.

28

00:02:33.123  -->  00:02:38.729
All of this pc that connected to the same
switch, must be in the same block subnet,

29

00:02:39.429  -->  00:02:43.086
so all of pc can communicate each others.

30

00:02:43.684  -->  00:02:51.569
Let’s say we use ip address 10.10.10.x,
the x will be replaced for each computer.

31

00:02:52.154  -->  00:03:09.913
Let’s say for pc 1 the ip address is 10.10.10.2,
pc 2 10.10.10.3, pc 3 10.10.10.4, pc 4 10.10.10.5,

32

00:03:10.231  -->  00:03:15.643
and let’s say here we use ip address 10.10.10.50.

33

00:03:16.610  -->  00:03:23.002
In this case, pc 1 until pc 4 will able to communicate
each others.

34

00:03:23.485  -->  00:03:28.746
But pc 5 can not communicate with pc 1 until
pc 4.

35

00:03:29.612  -->  00:03:30.383
Why?

36

00:03:30.548  -->  00:03:37.530
Because pc 1 until pc 4 is in the same block
subnet, which is first block subnet.

37

00:03:37.963  -->  00:03:44.124
But pc 5 is in the different block subnet,
which is second block subnet.

38

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:52.000
Okay, so that is the function of switch, which
is connecting many computer that in the same

39

00:03:52.000  -->  00:03:53.222
block subnet.

40

00:03:54.062  -->  00:04:01.010
Now let’s learn about router, router is
used to connecting many pc in the different

41

00:04:01.010  -->  00:04:02.243
block subnet.

42

00:04:03.121  -->  00:04:09.637
Now let’s change this first, let’s say
we will use 10, and here let’s say we will

43

00:04:09.637  -->  00:04:12.525
use 20 and 25.

44

00:04:13.569  -->  00:04:18.790
Okay so all of this pc is in the first block
subnet.

45

00:04:20.368  -->  00:04:26.856
Let’s say this is room number 1, now let’s
draw for room number 2.

46

00:04:27.479  -->  00:04:32.801
Here we also have a switch and have some pc
that connected to the switch.

47

00:04:33.539  -->  00:04:38.639
For all pc in the room number 2, we will use
second block subnet.

48

00:04:39.403  -->  00:04:47.867
Here we use 10.10.10.35, remember that 35
is in the second block subnet.

49

00:04:48.363  -->  00:04:57.000
And here we use 40, 41, 42,43, and let’s
say 50.

50

00:04:57.891  -->  00:05:04.514
Here all pc in the room number 1 will be able
to communicate each others, and all pc in

51

00:05:04.514  -->  00:05:09.077
the room number 2 will also able to communicate
each others.

52

00:05:09.714  -->  00:05:14.089
But the question is, how to communicate with
different room?

53

00:05:14.356  -->  00:05:20.436
Let’ say we want to communicate between
pc in the room 1 and room 2.

54

00:05:21.098  -->  00:05:23.741
To do this, we will need a router.

55

00:05:24.543  -->  00:05:27.168
Okay so here I draw a router.

56

00:05:27.576  -->  00:05:33.356
And we need to connecting switch in the room
number 1 to the router, also switch in the

57

00:05:33.356  -->  00:05:35.623
room number 2 to the router.

58

00:05:36.704  -->  00:05:43.029
Okay, now all pc in the room number 1 will
able to communicate with all pc in the room

59

00:05:43.029  -->  00:05:44.137
number 2.

60

00:05:44.887  -->  00:05:50.914
The summary is that switch is used to connecting
many pc in the same block subnet,

61

00:05:51.245  -->  00:05:56.356
while router is used to connecting many pc in the different
block subnet.

62

00:05:57.553  -->  00:06:03.320
I think enough for this video, I hope you
now understand the function of switch and

63

00:06:03.320  -->  00:06:03.926
router.

64

00:06:04.588  -->  00:06:11.133
In the next video we are going to practice
about switch and router in cisco packet tracer.

65

00:06:11.858  -->  00:06:15.453
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
