00:00:00.274  -->  00:00:06.595
In the previous video, we already learn
about trunk. After configuring trunk,

2

00:00:06.595  -->  00:00:13.813
now same vlan between room can communicate each
others. Vlan 10 in the room 1 can communicate

3

00:00:13.813  -->  00:00:22.614
with vlan 10 in the room 2. And vlan 20 in room
1 also can communicate with vlan 20 in room 2.

4

00:00:23.351  -->  00:00:30.285
Next in this video, we are going to learn
about allowed trunk. Let’s just start!

5

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:37.174
Let’s open switch 1, enable,
and show interface trunk.

6

00:00:38.097  -->  00:00:47.237
Here we have interface trunk, which
is fa0/5. Here we can see allowed on trunk.

7

00:00:47.237  -->  00:00:52.339
This is means which vlan
that allowed to pass the interface.

8

00:00:53.440  -->  00:00:58.178
By default, all vlans is allowed
to pass the interface trunk,

9

00:00:59.049  -->  00:01:07.138
here we can see that the allowed on trunk
is vlan 1 until 1005. In the real device,

10

00:01:07.138  -->  00:01:19.298
the allowed on trunk will be 1 until 4095. Because
the number of vlan is between 1 until 4095.

11

00:01:20.399  -->  00:01:24.045
Here we can configure custom allowed trunk.

12

00:01:24.302  -->  00:01:28.721
So we can configure which vlan
can pass the interface trunk.

13

00:01:29.226  -->  00:01:33.761
Let’s say here we only have vlan 10 and vlan 20.

14

00:01:34.284  -->  00:01:42.116
For security reason we want to configure so only
vlan 10 and vlan 20 can pass the interface trunk.

15

00:01:42.773  -->  00:01:54.232
Let’s configure the allowed trunk.
Conf t, and then go to interface fa0/5.

16

00:01:55.000  -->  00:02:04.276
To configure allowed trunk, the command
is switchport trunk allowed vlan 10, 20.

17

00:02:05.351  -->  00:02:08.036
Now let’s see the interface trunk.

18

00:02:08.649  -->  00:02:15.396
Okay here we can see that now allowed
on trunk is only vlan 10 and 20.

19

00:02:16.035  -->  00:02:25.994
Let’s also configure in switch
2. Conf t, interface fa0/5,

20

00:02:26.151  -->  00:02:31.344
and then switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20.

21

00:02:32.258  -->  00:02:33.725
Let’s see the trunk,

22

00:02:33.866  -->  00:02:42.472
do show interface trunk. Okay here we can see that
now the allowed on trunk is only vlan 10 and 20.

23

00:02:43.217  -->  00:02:47.849
Now let’s try to communicate
between PC in the vlan 10.

24

00:02:48.266  -->  00:02:57.938
Okay this is success. Now let’s try between
PC in the vlan 20. Okay this is also success.

25

00:02:58.773  -->  00:03:04.285
So now all PC in the same vlan
still can communicate each others.

26

00:03:04.764  -->  00:03:11.050
This is because vlan 10 and vlan 20 is
allowed to pass the interface trunk.

27

00:03:11.973  -->  00:03:19.867
Now let’s try to add a PC. let’s say
we will configure this PC to vlan 30.

28

00:03:21.315  -->  00:03:26.392
Let’s change the name of the PC. let’s say PC 9.

29

00:03:26.542  -->  00:03:35.752
And here PC 10, let’s connecting this to
switch 2. This PC will also in the vlan 30.

30

00:03:36.613  -->  00:03:46.587
Now let’s configure the switch, here fa0/6 will
be in the vlan 30. Let’s create the vlan first.

31

00:03:47.484  -->  00:03:57.076
Let’s say the name is engineering. And then
assign the interface fa0/6 to the vlan 30.

32

00:03:57.653  -->  00:04:06.090
Interface fa0/6, switchport mode
access, switchport access vlan 30.

33

00:04:08.142  -->  00:04:18.694
Let’s verify it, do show vlan brief. Okay
here we can see that fa0/6 is in the vlan 30.

34

00:04:19.217  -->  00:04:31.974
Next let’s configure on switch 2. Here fa0/6 will
also in the vlan 30. Let’s create the vlan first.

35

00:04:37.431  -->  00:04:48.941
And then assign interface fa0/6 to the vlan
30. Interface fa0/6, switchport mode access

36

00:04:48.941  -->  00:04:52.205
and then switchport access vlan 30.

37

00:04:52.684  -->  00:04:57.114
Let’s verify it, do show vlan
brief.

38

00:04:58.111  -->  00:05:01.585
Oh I'm sorry, here I do a mistake

39

00:05:02.048  -->  00:05:08.720
This is should not fa0/3 but fa0/6.

40

00:05:09.277  -->  00:05:21.815
So let’s bring fa0/3 back to vlan 20. Interface fa0/3, switchport access vlan 20.

41

00:05:22.314  -->  00:05:36.044
Now let’s configure fa0/6, interface fa0/6, switchport mode access, and then switchport access vlan 30.

42

00:05:36.774  -->  00:05:40.945
Let’s verify it again, do show vlan brief.

43

00:05:42.796  -->  00:05:55.783
Okay here we can see that fa0/3 and fa0/4 is in the vlan 20, and then fa0/6 is in the vlan 30. This is correct.

44

00:05:56.406  -->  00:06:01.334
Now let’s try to ping between PC in the vlan 30.

45

00:06:01.975  -->  00:06:09.643
Okay here we get an error PC 10 has no functional
port. This is because we don’t configure the

46

00:06:09.643  -->  00:06:19.879
ip address yet. Let’s configure it first.
For PC 9, let’s say the ip address is 192.168.1.9.

47

00:06:22.160  -->  00:06:32.949
for PC 10, the ip address is 192.168.1.10.
Okay now let’s ping again from PC 9 to PC 10.

48

00:06:35.119  -->  00:06:42.569
Okay here we can see that the result is
failed. Let’s try again, okay still failed.

49

00:06:42.933  -->  00:06:49.476
Why? This is because the allowed
on trunk is only vlan 10 and 20.

50

00:06:49.804  -->  00:06:53.565
Let’s see it again, do show interface trunk.

51

00:06:54.160  -->  00:06:59.023
Here we can see that the allowed
on trunk is only vlan 10 and 20.

52

00:06:59.218  -->  00:07:03.876
Vlan 30 is not allowed to pass the interface trunk

53

00:07:05.000  -->  00:07:11.263
Now let’s configure so vlan 30 will
allowed to pass the interface trunk.

54

00:07:11.858  -->  00:07:19.503
Go to interface fa0/5, and then
switchport trunk allowed vlan,

55

00:07:19.893  -->  00:07:28.205
and here earlier we directly put the
number of vlan, which is 10 and 20 like that,

56

00:07:28.924  -->  00:07:35.431
But if now we directly put the number of
vlan like this, so the allowed on trunk

57

00:07:35.431  -->  00:07:43.385
will be only vlan 30. Vlan 10 and vlan
20 will be removed from allowed on trunk.

58

00:07:43.955  -->  00:07:48.445
Let’s just try it. Now let’s verify it.

59

00:07:49.137  -->  00:07:56.374
Okay here we can see that now vlan 10 and
vlan 20 is removed from allowed on trunk.

60

00:07:56.969  -->  00:07:59.636
So we need to be careful here.

61

00:08:00.675  -->  00:08:06.561
Okay now let’s bring the vlan 10 and
vlan 20 back to allowed on trunk.

62

00:08:08.293  -->  00:08:17.183
Let’s verify it again, okay now here we can see
that the allowed on trunk is vlan 10 and 20.

63

00:08:18.160  -->  00:08:19.440
The question is,

64

00:08:19.440  -->  00:08:26.543
how we can add vlan 30 to the allowed on
trunk without removing the vlan 10 and 20?

65

00:08:27.031  -->  00:08:34.400
Let’s just try it. Actually the
command is similar, so switchport port

66

00:08:34.400  -->  00:08:41.770
trunk allowed vlan, and here we need
to use one more command, which is add.

67

00:08:42.055  -->  00:08:50.303
So switchport trunk allowed vlan add
and then the number of vlan, which is 30.

68

00:08:50.729  -->  00:08:58.880
Let’s verify it. Do show interface
trunk. Okay here we can see that now,

69

00:08:58.880  -->  00:09:07.091
the allowed on trunk is vlan 10 20 and
30. Let’s also configure on switch 2.

70

00:09:08.089  -->  00:09:19.004
Interface fa0/5. Switchport trunk
allowed vlan add 30. Let’s verify it,

71

00:09:19.004  -->  00:09:27.832
do show interface trunk. Okay here we can see
that the allowed on trunk is vlan 10, 20 and 30.

72

00:09:28.915  -->  00:09:36.374
Now let’s try ping between PC in the
vlan 30. Okay now the result is success.

73

00:09:36.951  -->  00:09:40.346
I think enough for this
video, I hope you understand

74

00:09:40.346  -->  00:09:42.554
about allowed on trunk.

75

00:09:42.928  -->  00:09:46.301
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
