00:00:00.320  -->  00:00:07.060
In the previous video, we already create a
home page like this. But this is just a dummy data.

2

00:00:07.060  -->  00:00:12.400
In this video, we are going to create
a database in our project and change this

3

00:00:12.400  -->  00:00:15.080
dummy data by data in the database.

4

00:00:15.760  -->  00:00:17.680
Okay let’s just start.

5

00:00:17.780  -->  00:00:19.900
Open the visual studio code.

6

00:00:21.760  -->  00:00:26.580
Here in the models.py file, we will create a device models.

7

00:00:26.580  -->  00:00:30.420
I will just copy and
paste the script from my note and explain

8

00:00:30.420  -->  00:00:32.480
to you what the script means.

9

00:00:33.460  -->  00:00:39.780
Here we have a devices class. Every class
in models will map to one database table.

10

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:43.220
So in this case, we create a Device table.

11

00:00:43.220  -->  00:00:56.140
The devices table will have some column. Here
we have IP Address, Hostname, Username, Password, SSH Port, and Vendor.

12

00:00:57.680  -->  00:01:02.860
The type of ip address,
hostname, username, and password is charfield.

13

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:05.700
CharField is string in python.

14

00:01:05.700  -->  00:01:09.600
And The type of ssh port will be integerfield.

15

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:17.680
Here we have a choice for vendor, in this
case we have Mikrotik &amp; Cisco.

16

00:01:19.260  -->  00:01:28.140
And here we create a vendor column. The type is CharField and we define the choice here. The choice

17

00:01:28.140  -->  00:01:32.600
is based on vendor choices that we have defined
before.

18

00:01:33.620  -->  00:01:41.160
Last, here we define def str. This script is used
to show the id and the ip address of device

19

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:50.160
in the django admin page. If we don’t do
this, we will see device object 1,2,3 in the django admin page.

20

00:01:50.340  -->  00:01:55.600
I recommend you to pause
this video now and write this code by yourself.

21

00:01:55.700  -->  00:02:00.280
When you have finished writing this code,
you can continue the video.

22

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:09.760
Next, we need to register our models to admin.py,
so we can manage the database in the django admin page.

23

00:02:10.420  -->  00:02:13.260
First we need to import the models.

24

00:02:21.460  -->  00:02:24.620
And then we need to register the database.

25

00:02:30.340  -->  00:02:37.060
Because we modify models.py file, so we need
to doing a migration in our project.

26

00:02:37.320  -->  00:02:47.120
Migration is used to create a database based on models.py file. Open the command prompt, and stop the project.

27

00:02:48.660  -->  00:02:51.460
First let’s do makemigration

28

00:02:56.920  -->  00:02:59.080
and then do migrate.

29

00:03:08.060  -->  00:03:14.080
Okay we have done migrate the project. Now
let’s start the project again.

30

00:03:19.120  -->  00:03:24.000
Let’s open the browser and make sure that our project
is still running well.

31

00:03:24.540  -->  00:03:27.940
Okay our project is still running well.

32

00:03:28.240  -->  00:03:34.560
Now let’s go to django admin page. Here
we can see django admin page.

33

00:03:34.560  -->  00:03:42.380
We need to login here, but we don’t have a username &amp; password yet. So we need to create it first.

34

00:03:42.540  -->  00:03:44.540
Back to command prompt,

35

00:03:46.100  -->  00:03:47.680
stop the server,

36

00:03:49.820  -->  00:03:51.740
and create a super user.

37

00:03:57.420  -->  00:03:59.380
Type the username.

38

00:03:59.560  -->  00:04:05.400
We can left the email blank, type the password and confirm password.

39

00:04:05.800  -->  00:04:14.740
Here we can just ignore it. Okay we have done creating a new user. Let’s start the project again.

40

00:04:19.140  -->  00:04:25.700
Go back to the browser, refresh, and then
login to the django admin page using username

41

00:04:25.700  -->  00:04:28.380
and password that we just created.

42

00:04:30.140  -->  00:04:34.860
Okay now we have successfully login to the django admin page.

43

00:04:35.140  -->  00:04:40.600
Here we can see a Device Table. Let’s create
some new device.

44

00:04:46.180  -->  00:04:49.060
Okay we have some devices here.

45

00:04:50.000  -->  00:04:53.900
Now we will modify home.html file.

46

00:04:55.380  -->  00:04:59.260
In the previous video, we just put a dummy data here.

47

00:04:59.400  -->  00:05:05.380
In this video we will modify the script to
display the infomartion based on the database.

48

00:05:05.940  -->  00:05:10.020
But before that, we need to edit views.py
file.

49

00:05:12.280  -->  00:05:15.720
In the home function, we need to create a context.

50

00:05:16.500  -->  00:05:19.660
First, we need to import device models.

51

00:05:27.720  -->  00:05:32.280
Now let’s create a variable to save all
devices in the database.

52

00:05:42.480  -->  00:05:46.480
Let’s also create a variable to save all cisco devices.

53

00:05:58.260  -->  00:06:02.460
And also we need a variable to save all mikrotik devices.

54

00:06:12.600  -->  00:06:20.680
Okay now we have three variable here, which
is all_devices, cisco devices, and mikrotik devices.

55

00:06:21.220  -->  00:06:28.020
Next we need to creat a context. Remember
that the context must be a dictionary.

56

00:06:28.260  -->  00:06:36.200
The first key will be all_devices, and the value
is len (all_device).

57

00:06:36.480  -->  00:06:45.900
Len is a function that return the total of device. Next we also need to devine a key for cisco &amp; mikrotik device.

58

00:06:59.520  -->  00:07:03.800
Last, we need to put this context in the return
statement.

59

00:07:04.220  -->  00:07:07.680
Now let’s edit the home.html file.

60

00:07:13.200  -->  00:07:19.760
This is total device, so let’s change this to total_devices.

61

00:07:20.160  -->  00:07:24.540
Remember that we need to use
double curly braces if we want to accesss

62

00:07:24.540  -->  00:07:26.360
data from the context.

63

00:07:26.700  -->  00:07:29.620
Let’s change this to cisco devices,

64

00:07:31.400  -->  00:07:35.440
and last, let’s change this to mikrotik devices.

65

00:07:38.780  -->  00:07:44.300
Let’s go to the browser. Refresh.

66

00:07:44.320  -->  00:07:47.580
Here we can see that we have successfully get the

67

00:07:47.580  -->  00:07:50.220
total of cisco &amp; mikrotik devices.

68

00:07:50.420  -->  00:07:57.680
But we failed in total device. Let’s back to the visual studio code and see whats wrong.

69

00:07:58.760  -->  00:08:03.600
Let’s chek in views.py file first, here in the context,

70

00:08:03.600  -->  00:08:06.120
we define all_device.

71

00:08:06.420  -->  00:08:14.700
Now let’s check in home.html file. Look, here I call total_device from the context.

72

00:08:14.840  -->  00:08:19.920
We should call all_devices
here. Let’s change this

73

00:08:22.100  -->  00:08:24.040
Go back to the browser,

74

00:08:25.020  -->  00:08:26.180
refresh.

75

00:08:26.480  -->  00:08:30.900
Okay here we can see that we have 5 total devices.

76

00:08:30.900  -->  00:08:38.880
Which is 2 cisco device and 3 mikrotik device. Let’s
add a new device in the database.

77

00:08:56.920  -->  00:08:59.880
Here I create a mikrotik device.

78

00:09:02.240  -->  00:09:04.340
Let’s back to our app,

79

00:09:06.340  -->  00:09:07.640
refresh.

80

00:09:08.020  -->  00:09:11.260
Okay now we have 6 total devices,

81

00:09:11.260  -->  00:09:15.960
which is 2 cisco devices and 4 mikrotik devices.

82

00:09:16.400  -->  00:09:22.340
This is the end of this video. In the next
video, we are going to create a Device List menu.

83

00:09:22.440  -->  00:09:25.240
Thankyou for watching and see you on
the next video!
