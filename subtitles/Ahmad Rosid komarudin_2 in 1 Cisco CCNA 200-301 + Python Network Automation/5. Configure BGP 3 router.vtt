00:00:00.373  -->  00:00:05.005
In the previous video, we already add 1 new router
to the topology.

2

00:00:05.711  -->  00:00:18.000
Next in this video we are going to configure bgp so pc 1, pc 2, and pc 3 will able to communicate each others. Let’s just start.

3

00:00:19.174  -->  00:00:21.524
Let’s configure on router 2 first.

4

00:00:23.244  -->  00:00:30.911
Router bgp 2, remember that 2 is the
autonomous system number of router 2,

5

00:00:34.054  -->  00:00:41.144
Here we need to add one neighbor, which
is router 3, so here neighbor

6

00:00:41.366  -->  00:00:52.009
and then the ip address of router 3, which is 10.10.10.6,
and then router 3 is in autonomous system 3,

7

00:00:56.415  -->  00:00:59.174
so here remote-as 3.

8

00:01:01.074  -->  00:01:11.492
Let’s also advertise the new connected network,
network 10.10.10.4 mask 255.255.255.252

9

00:01:12.747  -->  00:01:21.368
Okay now we have done configuring bgp on
router 2. Next let’s configure bgp on router 3.

10

00:01:22.036  -->  00:01:28.850
Router bgp 3, this is means that
router 3 is in autonomous system 3.

11

00:01:30.485  -->  00:01:33.189
Next let’s define the neighbor,

12

00:01:33.974  -->  00:01:45.216
in this case router 3 will have 1 neighbor, which
is router 2, so neighbor 10.10.10.5 remote-as 2

13

00:01:46.216  -->  00:01:51.992
Okay here we can see a message that the
bgp between router 2 and router 3 is up.

14

00:01:52.885  -->  00:02:03.225
Next let’s advertise the connected network,
network 10.10.10.4 mask 255.255.255.252,

15

00:02:04.156  -->  00:02:16.598
let’s also advertise the network that connected
to pc 3, so network 192.168.3.0 mask 255.255.255.0.

16

00:02:17.618  -->  00:02:22.770
Okay now we have done configuring
bgp on router 2 and router 3.

17

00:02:23.465  -->  00:02:26.059
Let’s see the routing table on router1,

18

00:02:28.956  -->  00:02:38.118
enable, show ip route, here we can see
that now router 1 have a route to pc 3,

19

00:02:39.596  -->  00:02:44.333
and the label is B, this is means BGP.

20

00:02:45.116  -->  00:02:49.579
Let’s also check on router 3, do show ip route,

21

00:02:52.834  -->  00:02:59.613
here we can see that we have route to
pc 1 and pc 2, and the label is also B.

22

00:03:00.854  -->  00:03:11.151
Okay, so now pc 1, pc 2, and pc 3 should be able to
communicate each others. Let’s try, pc 1 to pc 3,

23

00:03:12.165  -->  00:03:18.101
failed, test again, here success.

24

00:03:18.837  -->  00:03:24.802
Let’s check from pc 2 to pc 3,
okay this is also success.

25

00:03:25.935  -->  00:03:30.843
Okay so now we have done
configuring BGP on 3 router.

26

00:03:31.443  -->  00:03:33.836
I think enough for this video

27

00:03:34.029  -->  00:03:37.342
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
