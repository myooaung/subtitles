00:00:00.414  -->  00:00:07.701
In the previous video, we already learn about
what is IP Address and what is the function of an IP Address.

2

00:00:08.060  -->  00:00:14.084
Now, in this video we are going to learn
how to download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.

3

00:00:14.208  -->  00:00:19.980
As I mention in the previous video, Cisco
Packet tracer is a network simulation tools

4

00:00:19.980  -->  00:00:25.308
that help us to learn about computer network
without have a real devices.

5

00:00:25.691  -->  00:00:27.533
Okay let’s start.

6

00:00:27.835  -->  00:00:32.377
To download cisco packet tracer, we need to
create a NetAcad Account first.

7

00:00:32.541  -->  00:00:37.232
Just go to google and type NetAcad Packet
Tracer like this.

8

00:00:39.754  -->  00:00:44.730
Here we can see Introduction to Packet Tracer,
click here.

9

00:00:44.936  -->  00:00:50.700
Actually this is free course about Introduction
to Packet Tracer from Cisco Netacad.

10

00:00:50.700  -->  00:00:57.118
And we need to enroll at least one course
from Cisco Netacad to download Cisco Packet Tracer.

11

00:00:57.460  -->  00:00:59.887
So let’s just sign up here.

12

00:01:01.819  -->  00:01:07.927
Here we need to fill our first name, last
name, and email address.

13

00:01:07.927  -->  00:01:09.863
Let’s just fill it

14

00:01:13.769  -->  00:01:19.296
Here we can choose, do we want to receive
an update from cisco or no.

15

00:01:19.296  -->  00:01:21.300
I chose no here.

16

00:01:21.708  -->  00:01:27.552
Then here we need to verify that we are 13
years old or more.

17

00:01:28.292  -->  00:01:34.420
And if we are in the Europe, we need to verify
that we are 16 years old or more.

18

00:01:34.845  -->  00:01:36.687
Let’s just mark this.

19

00:01:37.360  -->  00:01:42.661
We also need to solve a captcha here to verify
that we are not a robot.

20

00:01:42.921  -->  00:01:45.723
Here 2 plus 7 is 9.

21

00:01:46.106  -->  00:01:48.875
Okay now let’s submit this form

22

00:01:51.438  -->  00:01:55.468
After submitting the form, we will need to
fill another form.

23

00:01:57.443  -->  00:02:07.044
I am in Indonesia right now. The company is
self, and we need to type our password and

24

00:02:07.044  -->  00:02:08.863
confirm password here.

25

00:02:14.538  -->  00:02:20.280
We also need to solve another captcha here,
but I don’t sure what is this,

26

00:02:20.280  -->  00:02:22.807
so let’s refresh the captcha.

27

00:02:25.178  -->  00:02:33.863
Okay this is much easier, here we have 9 6
5 4 8 2.

28

00:02:35.672  -->  00:02:41.667
“What do you like to update about cisco
promotion, product, and services?”

29

00:02:41.777  -->  00:02:47.301
Here I choose no, because i don’t want to
receive any promotions from Cisco.

30

00:02:47.301  -->  00:02:49.644
And finally register.

31

00:02:50.096  -->  00:02:52.356
Wait for a seconds here.

32

00:02:55.414  -->  00:03:03.000
Okay we have done now, let’s login using
an email and password that we use when sign up.

33

00:03:11.557  -->  00:03:18.916
And then, we need to verify our email, Cisco
already send a verification code to our email.

34

00:03:18.984  -->  00:03:21.150
So let’s just check it.

35

00:03:21.506  -->  00:03:24.852
Here I check on my inbox and refresh it.

36

00:03:26.100  -->  00:03:29.920
But I still haven’t receive the email.

37

00:03:30.057  -->  00:03:32.168
Let’s refresh one more time.

38

00:03:36.170  -->  00:03:39.643
Okay I still don’t receive the email yet.

39

00:03:39.808  -->  00:03:45.836
If you receive the email, you can just verify
the email, but if you don’t, we can skip

40

00:03:45.836  -->  00:03:47.960
the verification for now.

41

00:03:48.193  -->  00:03:50.360
Here we can choose skip.

42

00:03:53.513  -->  00:03:56.780
After login, we need one more form to fill.

43

00:03:57.000  -->  00:04:06.708
Choose the gender, I live in Indonesia, and
the state is Jakarta.

44

00:04:10.463  -->  00:04:14.383
My experience in networking is 3 to 5 years.

45

00:04:14.767  -->  00:04:20.475
I don’t have any disability, and this is
my birth day.

46

00:04:22.504  -->  00:04:24.379
Now let’s create an account.

47

00:04:26.344  -->  00:04:27.965
We have done!

48

00:04:28.225  -->  00:04:29.590
Just close this.

49

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:36.196
To download cisco packet, we can go to resources
and then download Packet Tracer.

50

00:04:38.746  -->  00:04:43.913
Here in the download section, we can download
based on our operating system,

51

00:04:43.913  -->  00:04:52.014
In this case I use Mac, so I will download for Mac OS,
If you use windows download the windows version,

52

00:04:52.220  -->  00:04:55.976
or if you use linux, just download the linux

56

00:05:12.590  -->  00:05:16.714
process will be much easier, you just need

57

00:05:16.714  -->  00:05:20.580
and choose next next next until finish.

58

00:05:21.512  -->  00:05:25.690
Okay now let’s see how we can install Cisco

59

00:05:27.308  -->  00:05:34.807
Let’s go to the finder, and double click
the installer.

60

version 7.3, let’s open this.

65

00:06:28.683  -->  00:06:36.126
We need to login. We can use an email and
password that we use when signup to Netacad.

66

00:06:43.131  -->  00:06:49.950
We need to verify our email address here,
but because my email is not verified yet.

67

00:06:49.950  -->  00:06:52.205
I will skip this for now.

68

00:06:52.205  -->  00:06:58.860
But I suggest you to verify your email if
you already receive the email from cisco NetAcad.
