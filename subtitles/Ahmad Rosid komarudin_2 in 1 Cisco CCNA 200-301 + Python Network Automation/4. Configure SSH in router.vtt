00:00:00.455  -->  00:00:04.756
In the previous video, we have done configuring
telnet in the router.

2

00:00:05.459  -->  00:00:10.376
Next in this video, we are going to configure
ssh in the router.

3

00:00:11.197  -->  00:00:15.000
Remember that ssh is more secure than telnet.

4

00:00:15.768  -->  00:00:20.834
So the best practice is, always use ssh in
the production.

5

00:00:21.322  -->  00:00:23.002
Never use telnet.

6

00:00:24.238  -->  00:00:25.979
Okay let’s just start.

7

00:00:26.593  -->  00:00:30.721
To configure ssh, we need to create a key.

8

00:00:31.677  -->  00:00:36.176
The command is crypto key generate rsa.

9

00:00:38.278  -->  00:00:44.904
Okay here we can see that before generate
a key, we need to change the default hostname first.

10

00:00:45.949  -->  00:00:50.008
Let’s change the hostname, let’s say Core-Router.

11

00:00:51.126  -->  00:00:54.000
Now Let’s try to generate a key again.

12

00:01:00.994  -->  00:01:07.051
Okay here we can see that we also need to
configure domain-name before generate a key.

13

00:01:07.656  -->  00:01:14.073
Let’s configure the domain-name, the command
is ip domain-name and then the domain,

14

00:01:14.551  -->  00:01:17.952
let’s say here I use agunacourse.com

15

00:01:20.478  -->  00:01:23.125
Now let’s try to generate a key again.

16

00:01:26.914  -->  00:01:33.075
Okay here we can see that we don’t have
an error anymore, so remember that before

17

00:01:33.075  -->  00:01:38.483
generating a key, we need to configure hostname
& domain-name first.

18

00:01:41.524  -->  00:01:44.168
Here, how many bits in the modulus?

19

00:01:44.565  -->  00:01:47.115
Let’s use 1024.

20

00:01:48.486  -->  00:01:51.948
Okay now we have done creating a key for ssh.

21

00:01:52.498  -->  00:01:56.765
Next we need to change the transport input
in the line vty.

22

00:01:57.550  -->  00:02:02.492
If you remember, earlier we configure the
transport input to telnet.

23

00:02:03.566  -->  00:02:09.907
If the transport input is telnet, so we can
not remote the router using ssh.

24

00:02:11.080  -->  00:02:20.338
So now let’s change it, go to line vty 0
2, and then transport input ssh.

25

00:02:21.556  -->  00:02:24.717
Now we have done configuring ssh in the router.

26

00:02:25.223  -->  00:02:29.175
Next let’s try to remote the router using
ssh.

27

00:02:30.194  -->  00:02:31.668
Let’s close it first.

28

00:02:33.508  -->  00:02:37.521
And then here let’s open telnet or ssh client
again.

29

00:02:38.594  -->  00:02:45.989
Choose ssh, and then put the router ip address,
and here we need to type the username,

30

00:02:46.304  -->  00:02:48.897
let’s say we will use user1.

31

00:02:49.672  -->  00:02:55.615
Connect, and here we need to type the password,
the password is password1.

32

00:02:57.059  -->  00:03:02.121
Okay here we can see that we have successfully
remote the router using ssh.

33

00:03:03.790  -->  00:03:05.751
I think enough for this video

34

00:03:06.175  -->  00:03:09.261
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
