00:00:00.178  -->  00:00:04.917
In the previous video, we already calculate
Total IP and Subnetmask.

2

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:10.755
Now in this video, we are going to calculate Network IP and Broadcast IP.

3

00:00:11.283  -->  00:00:13.354
Okay let’s just start.

4

00:00:13.935  -->  00:00:18.000
Remember that the Network IP is the first
IP in the network.

5

00:00:18.448  -->  00:00:23.546
So the Network IP is must be 0. Do you remember why?

6

00:00:23.876  -->  00:00:29.684
Because the number in the IP Address is always
between 0 until 255.

7

00:00:30.119  -->  00:00:36.106
So that is why the first IP or Network IP
will always be 0.

8

00:00:37.030  -->  00:00:40.983
Okay now we have network IP in the first block
subnet.

9

00:00:41.247  -->  00:00:46.835
If you remember in the previous video, I already
show you about block subnet.

10

00:00:47.020  -->  00:00:51.657
And here, 0 is the network IP in the first block
subnet.

11

00:00:52.317  -->  00:00:56.339
Now let’s calculate the network in the next
block subnet.

12

00:00:56.827  -->  00:01:03.511
The network in the second block subnet will
be 0 plus by total IP,  which is 16.

13

00:01:03.828  -->  00:01:05.945
The result is 16.

14

00:01:06.591  -->  00:01:13.949
For the third block subnet, the network is
16 plus by total IP again, which is 16.

15

00:01:14.160  -->  00:01:16.792
So the result is 32.

16

00:01:17.347  -->  00:01:25.638
Fourth block subnet, the network is 32 plus
by total IP again, so the result is 48.

17

00:01:26.166  -->  00:01:33.805
Fifth block subnet, the network is 48 plus
by total IP again, the result is 64.

18

00:01:33.963  -->  00:01:41.399
Sixth block subnet, the network is 64 plus
by total IP again, the result is 80.

19

00:01:41.927  -->  00:01:46.076
We can doing this until we found 256.

20

00:01:46.327  -->  00:01:49.952
If we reach 256, we can stop there.

21

00:01:50.177  -->  00:01:56.935
Because remember that the number in IP Address
is only between 0 until 255.

22

00:01:57.357  -->  00:02:01.312
So if we reach 256, we can stop.

23

00:02:01.867  -->  00:02:06.474
But actually we don’t need to calculate
until reach 256.

24

00:02:07.108  -->  00:02:11.567
Sometimes we just need to calculate until
we find some block subnet.

25

00:02:11.739  -->  00:02:15.446
In this case we are enough to have six block subnet.

26

00:02:16.236  -->  00:02:20.169
Okay, now we have Network IP until sixth block
subnet.

27

00:02:20.618  -->  00:02:23.660
Next, let’s calculate the Broadcast IP.

28

00:02:24.149  -->  00:02:31.441
The Broadcast IP in the first block subnet
is 16 minus by 1, the result is 15.

29

00:02:32.087  -->  00:02:37.097
For second block subnet, 32 minus by 1, which
is 31.

30

00:02:37.837  -->  00:02:43.270
Third block subnet, 48 minus by 1, which is
47.

31

00:02:43.838  -->  00:02:49.632
Fourth block subnet, 64 minus by 1, which
is 63.

32

00:02:50.120  -->  00:02:55.787
Fifth block subnet, 80 minus by 1, which is
79.

33

00:02:55.945  -->  00:03:01.812
Okay, now we have Network IP and Broadcast
IP until fifth block subnet.

34

00:03:02.234  -->  00:03:12.946
First block subnet is 0 until 15, second block
subnet is 16-31, third block subnet is 32

35

00:03:12.946  -->  00:03:24.784
until 47, fourth block subnet is 48 until
63, and last fifth block subnet is 64 until 79.

36

00:03:25.536  -->  00:03:30.000
Next, we need to determine, which block subnet
we will use.

37

00:03:30.370  -->  00:03:33.697
In this case, I will use the seconds block
subnet.

38

00:03:34.027  -->  00:03:39.778
So the network IP is 16, and the Broadcast
IP is 31.

39

00:03:40.279  -->  00:03:52.626
Let’s write it, the network IP is 172.16.10.16,
this 16 is the result of our calculation before

40

00:03:53.009  -->  00:04:04.624
and the broadcast IP is 172.16.10.31, this
31 is the result of our calculation before.

41

00:04:05.680  -->  00:04:11.803
Okay now we have done calculating the Network
IP and the broadcast IP, and also we already

42

00:04:11.803  -->  00:04:15.246
determine that we will use the seconds block
subnet.

43

00:04:15.695  -->  00:04:18.894
Last, we need to calculate Range IP.

44

00:04:19.501  -->  00:04:24.528
Remember that Network IP and Broadcast IP
will never can be used.

45

00:04:24.739  -->  00:04:27.290
Let’s try it in cisco packet tracer.

46

00:04:27.594  -->  00:04:38.521
We are going to use the network IP 172.16.10.16
with subnetmask 255.255.255.240,

47

00:04:39.101  -->  00:04:42.139
and we will see that we will get an error.

48

00:04:43.221  -->  00:04:56.515
Go to PC and set the IP to 172.16.10.16 and
the subnetmask is 255.255.255.240,

49

00:05:00.264  -->  00:05:03.206
Okay here we can see that we get an error.

50

00:05:03.549  -->  00:05:06.860
It will also the same if we use broadcast IP.

51

00:05:07.058  -->  00:05:09.000
We will also get an error.

52

00:05:09.259  -->  00:05:20.645
Let’s try it, 172.16.10.31 and the subnetmask
is 255.255.255.240.

53

00:05:21.476  -->  00:05:24.898
Okay here, we can see that we also get an
error.

54

00:05:25.412  -->  00:05:30.777
So the conclusion is that Network IP and Broadcast
IP will never can be used.

55

00:05:31.041  -->  00:05:34.514
And the IP that we can use is the Range IP.

56

00:05:35.161  -->  00:05:38.009
Okay, now let’s calculate the Range IP.

57

00:05:38.220  -->  00:05:47.579
Here we can see that the network is 16, so
the range IP is start from 17 until before 31

58

00:05:47.579  -->  00:05:49.307
which is 30.

59

00:05:49.637  -->  00:06:00.926
So the Range IP is 172.16.10.17 until 172.16.10.30.

60

00:06:01.520  -->  00:06:05.128
We can use these IP for our 12 PC.

61

00:06:05.867  -->  00:06:10.437
Now let’s try to configure the IP address
again in the cisco packet tracer.

62

00:06:10.688  -->  00:06:16.541
But now, we are going to use the right IP,
so we won’t get errors.

63

00:06:16.686  -->  00:06:27.253
Let’s say we use 172.16.10.17 and the subnetmask
is 255.255.255.240.

64

00:06:27.728  -->  00:06:30.958
Okay here we can see that we don’t get an
errors.

65

00:06:31.829  -->  00:06:36.950
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to learn subnetting

66

00:06:36.950  -->  00:06:39.244
again with another case.

67

00:06:39.758  -->  00:06:43.342
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
