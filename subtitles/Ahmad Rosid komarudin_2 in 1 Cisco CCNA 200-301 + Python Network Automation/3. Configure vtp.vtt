00:00:00.668  -->  00:00:06.144
In the previous video, we already create a
topology for practice about VTP.

2

00:00:07.048  -->  00:00:11.656
Now in this video, we are going to practice
about VTP.

3

00:00:12.489  -->  00:00:20.688
In the previous video, I told you that we
have 2 mode in VTP, which is server and client.

4

00:00:21.551  -->  00:00:29.700
Vtp server will create a vlan, and then the
vlan on vtp client will be created automatically.

5

00:00:30.694  -->  00:00:39.170
But actually, we have 3 mode in VTP, which
is server, client, and transparent.

6

00:00:40.194  -->  00:00:42.211
Okay, let’s just start.

7

00:00:43.115  -->  00:00:57.291
Let’s say we will configure switch 1 as server,
switch 2 as transparent, switch 3 as client

8

00:00:59.821  -->  00:01:02.271
and switch 4 as a server again.

9

00:01:03.215  -->  00:01:07.582
In the network, we can have multiple VTP server
like this.

10

00:01:09.058  -->  00:01:12.399
Okay now let’s start configuring VTP.

11

00:01:13.514  -->  00:01:15.721
Let’s start with switch 1.

12

00:01:17.589  -->  00:01:26.637
First we need to configure the mode, the command
is vtp mode switch 1 will become server,

13

00:01:26.637  -->  00:01:28.718
so the mode is server.

14

00:01:30.957  -->  00:01:39.613
Next we need to configure domain, vtp domain
and the domain let’s say agunacourse.

15

00:01:40.668  -->  00:01:44.663
Remember that the domain name must be same
on all switches.

16

00:01:45.878  -->  00:01:48.605
Next we need to configure the password.

17

00:01:49.368  -->  00:01:55.846
Actually this is optional, but for security
reason, let’s configure the password.

18

00:01:56.679  -->  00:02:03.486
The command is vtp password and then the password,
let’s say 123.

19

00:02:05.474  -->  00:02:09.558
Okay now we have done configuring VTP on switch 1.

20

00:02:10.623  -->  00:02:13.971
Next, let’s configure VTP on switch 2.

21

00:02:15.789  -->  00:02:22.779
Here we will configure as vtp transparent,
so vtp mode transparent.

22

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:32.428
Next, let’s configure the domain, vtp domain
and remember that the domain of all switches

23

00:02:32.428  -->  00:02:36.949
must be same, so the domain is agunacourse.

24

00:02:39.439  -->  00:02:46.996
Last let’s configure the password, the password
of all switches is also must be same.

25

00:02:47.709  -->  00:02:51.135
So here vtp password 123.

26

00:02:53.655  -->  00:02:56.592
Next let’s configure on switch 3.

27

00:02:57.907  -->  00:02:59.697
The mode will be client.

28

00:03:00.099  -->  00:03:11.723
So Vtp mode client, vtp domain agunacourse,
and then vtp password 123.

29

00:03:13.299  -->  00:03:15.770
Okay we have done on switch 3.

30

00:03:16.232  -->  00:03:19.216
Last, let’s configure on swich 4.

31

00:03:19.859  -->  00:03:22.766
We will configure this switch as a server.

32

00:03:24.734  -->  00:03:36.098
VTP mode server, vtp domain agunacourse and
then vtp password 123.

33

00:03:37.594  -->  00:03:41.860
Okay, now we have done configuring VTP on
all switches.

34

00:03:42.593  -->  00:03:44.791
I think enough for this video.

35

00:03:45.233  -->  00:03:50.066
In the next video, we are going to do testing the vtp configuration.

36

00:03:50.909  -->  00:03:54.170
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
