00:00:00.472  -->  00:00:04.147
In this section, we are going
to learn about etherchannel.

2

00:00:04.981  -->  00:00:10.849
What is etherchannel? We will learn
about this using an example case.

3

00:00:11.704  -->  00:00:15.920
Let’s add 2 switch, we will use 2960.

4

00:00:19.840  -->  00:00:23.745
And then connecting this 2 switch using 2 cable.

5

00:00:27.912  -->  00:00:32.176
If we see here, one of the interface is orange,

6

00:00:32.792  -->  00:00:37.335
this is means that this interface
is blocked by spanning tree.

7

00:00:38.122  -->  00:00:43.067
Spanning tree is protocol that used
to prevent looping in the network.

8

00:00:43.583  -->  00:00:49.987
This protocol is active by default, so we
don’t need to worry about spanning tree.

9

00:00:51.162  -->  00:00:58.518
Here we can see that the interface blocked
by spanning tree is fa0/2 in the switch 0,

10

00:00:59.353  -->  00:01:07.054
let’s just remove the name of the interface so we
can see the topology clearly. Go to preference,

11

00:01:11.003  -->  00:01:14.656
and then uncheck always show port label.

12

00:01:15.784  -->  00:01:23.797
Okay now we can see the topology clearly. Here
we can see that the blocked port is in switch 0.

13

00:01:24.672  -->  00:01:26.734
Let’s add 1 more cable,

14

00:01:31.252  -->  00:01:36.745
here we can see that two cable or two
interface blocked by spanning tree.

15

00:01:37.691  -->  00:01:43.715
So remember that spanning tree will only
allow 1 cable active between switches,

16

00:01:44.413  -->  00:01:50.463
if there is 3 cable between switches like
this, spanning-tree will block 2 cable,

17

00:01:51.000  -->  00:01:57.586
and if there is 4 cable, so spanning-tree
will block 3 cable, and others.

18

00:01:58.723  -->  00:02:03.906
The case is, let’s say we need
high bandwidth between switches,

19

00:02:04.553  -->  00:02:11.593
let’s say the bandwidth of interface
is only 100 mega, but we need 300 mega.

20

00:02:12.323  -->  00:02:17.433
If we see here, we already connecting
this 2 switches using 3 cable,

21

00:02:17.763  -->  00:02:24.747
but 2 cable is blocked by spanning
tree, so here we just have 100 mega.

22

00:02:25.662  -->  00:02:33.273
but here actually we have 4 cable between
switches, let’s remove 1 cable. Okay so here we

23

00:02:33.273  -->  00:02:42.647
have 3 cable like this, and 2 cable is blocked by
spanning tree, so we only have 100 mega bandwidth.

24

00:02:43.622  -->  00:02:46.554
If we want 300 mega, we can use

25

00:02:46.554  -->  00:02:54.616
etherchannel. If we configure an etherchannel
in this 2 switch, all three cable will active,

26

00:02:55.782  -->  00:03:02.943
because etherchannel will combine this
3 physical cable become 1 logical cable.

27

00:03:03.512  -->  00:03:10.793
With etherchannel, switch will consider this
3 physical cable as only 1 logical cable,

28

00:03:11.521  -->  00:03:18.613
so spanning tree will not block any cable,
because there is only 1 logical cable.

29

00:03:19.322  -->  00:03:22.275
And there is no cable blocked by spanning tree,

30

00:03:22.432  -->  00:03:29.333
so now the bandwidth is 100
multiple by 3, which is 300 mega.

31

00:03:30.483  -->  00:03:33.596
Okay that is the concept of etherchannel,

32

00:03:33.861  -->  00:03:38.463
I think enough for this video, in
the next video, we are going to learn

33

00:03:38.463  -->  00:03:40.854
how to configure etherchannel.

34

00:03:41.198  -->  00:03:44.631
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
