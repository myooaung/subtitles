00:00:00.294  -->  00:00:05.662
In the previous video, we already learn how
to calculate total IP and subnetmask.

2

00:00:06.236  -->  00:00:12.509
Now in this video, we are going to learn about
Network IP, Broadcast IP, and IP Range.

3

00:00:13.138  -->  00:00:16.717
But we will start with Network and Broadcast
IP first.

4

00:00:17.729  -->  00:00:20.314
Okay, so what is Network IP?

5

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:24.165
Network IP is the first IP Address in the
network.

6

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:28.217
And Broadcast IP is the last IP Address in
the network.

7

00:00:28.832  -->  00:00:30.556
Never forget this, okay?

8

00:00:31.089  -->  00:00:37.107
Network IP is the first IP, and Broadcast
IP is the last IP.

9

00:00:37.777  -->  00:00:41.853
Now let’s remember again about the numbers
in IP Address.

10

00:00:42.318  -->  00:00:48.062
I told you in the previous video that the
number in IP Address will be always between

11

00:00:48.062  -->  00:00:50.710
0 to 255.

12

00:00:51.271  -->  00:00:56.532
So the smallest number is 0 and the largest
number is 255.

13

00:00:57.079  -->  00:01:01.189
There are impossible to have minus number
in IP Address.

14

00:01:01.408  -->  00:01:07.404
And it is also impossible to have number higher
than 255 in the IP Address.

15

00:01:07.910  -->  00:01:12.522
Let's say 256, 257, and others. That is imposible.

16

00:01:12.796  -->  00:01:17.064
The numbers will be always between 0 to 255.

17

00:01:18.610  -->  00:01:20.504
Let’s back to here.

18

00:01:20.655  -->  00:01:26.284
Remember that Network IP is the first IP Address,
and the number in the IP Address is started

19

00:01:26.284  -->  00:01:30.906
by 0, so the first IP Address must be 0.

20

00:01:31.604  -->  00:01:36.348
Okay now we have the Network IP, let’s find
the Broadcast IP.

21

00:01:36.690  -->  00:01:41.260
Remember that broadcast IP is the last IP
Address in the network.

22

00:01:41.629  -->  00:01:46.629
To calculate the Broadcast IP, we need to
pay attention at Total IP.

23

00:01:47.026  -->  00:01:57.087
In this case, the total IP is 128, so the
question is 0 to what until the total is 128?

24

00:01:57.647  -->  00:02:06.905
The answer is 127, because 0 until 127, the total
is 128.

25

00:02:07.370  -->  00:02:12.890
May be some of you little confused here, let’s try
another simpler example.

26

00:02:13.382  -->  00:02:20.735
Let’s say the total IP is 4, the first IP
or network IP must be 0 right?

27

00:02:20.735  -->  00:02:23.254
And then what is the broadcast IP?

28

00:02:23.610  -->  00:02:33.258
Here we can calculate 0 to what until the
total IP is 4, let’s write It out, 0, 1, 2,

29

00:02:33.258  -->  00:02:34.697
and then 3.

30

00:02:35.271  -->  00:02:38.424
If you see here, the total is already 4.

31

00:02:38.807  -->  00:02:45.364
Let’s say this is for computer 1, this for
computer 2, this for computer 3, and this for

32

00:02:45.364  -->  00:02:46.620
computer 4.

33

00:02:47.044  -->  00:02:50.478
So 0 until 3 is already 4.

34

00:02:51.066  -->  00:02:52.580
Let’s back to here.

35

00:02:52.580  -->  00:03:01.943
If the total IP 128, so the broadcast is 128
minus by 1, which is 127,

36

00:03:02.422  -->  00:03:06.361
This is same with this, 4 minus by 1 is 3.

37

00:03:07.017  -->  00:03:12.000
Okay I hope you understand about how to calculate
Network IP & Broadcast IP.

38

00:03:12.361  -->  00:03:14.459
But may be you have a question.

39

00:03:14.678  -->  00:03:20.449
I said before that the numbers in the IP Address
is 0 until 255,

40

00:03:20.818  -->  00:03:25.969
but here we only have until 127, why?

41

00:03:26.161  -->  00:03:30.763
In this case, this is the calculation for
the first block subnet.

42

00:03:30.873  -->  00:03:35.437
Or in the simple word, this is the calculation
for the first room.

43

00:03:36.066  -->  00:03:39.294
How about the next block subnet or the next
room?

44

00:03:39.294  -->  00:03:44.773
To calculate the next block subnet, we can
add 0 by the total IP.

45

00:03:45.430  -->  00:03:50.009
So 0 plus 128 is 128.

46

00:03:50.323  -->  00:03:53.010
This is for the second block subnet.

47

00:03:53.557  -->  00:04:00.326
To calculate next block subnet again, we can
add this 128 by the Total IP again,

48

00:04:01.065  -->  00:04:06.430
so 128 plus 128 is 256.

49

00:04:06.772  -->  00:04:08.739
But this is impossible right?

50

00:04:08.917  -->  00:04:14.612
Because the numbers in IP Address is only
between 0 until 255.

51

00:04:14.941  -->  00:04:21.898
So if we have reach 256 like this, we can
stop, because this is impossible to have next

52

00:04:21.898  -->  00:04:23.027
block subnet.

53

00:04:24.000  -->  00:04:27.960
Okay, so here, in the first block subnet or
first room.

54

00:04:27.960  -->  00:04:33.115
The network is 0, and the broadcast is 127..

55

00:04:33.662  -->  00:04:42.000
In the second block subnet or second room,
the network 128, and the broadcast is 255.

56

00:04:42.356  -->  00:04:44.116
How we get 255?

57

00:04:44.417  -->  00:04:48.727
We get this from 256 minus 1.

58

00:04:49.192  -->  00:04:57.000
This is same for 127, we can get this by 128
minus 1.

59

00:04:58.097  -->  00:05:02.830
I think this is the easiest way to calculate
Network IP and Broadcast IP.

60

00:05:03.090  -->  00:05:09.309
So first we calculate the Network IP for all
block subnet, the network in the first block

61

00:05:09.309  -->  00:05:16.005
subnet must be 0, the network in the seconds
block subnet is 0 plus by total IP,

62

00:05:16.005  -->  00:05:18.000
so we get 128.

63

00:05:18.459  -->  00:05:27.153
The network in the third block subnet is 128
plus by total IP again, so we get 256.

64

00:05:27.549  -->  00:05:32.126
And if we already reach 256 like this we can
stop.

65

00:05:33.085  -->  00:05:36.845
Now we already get Network IP for all block
subnet.

66

00:05:37.419  -->  00:05:45.508
For the broadcast IP, we can minus the next
network by 1, let’s say for the first block subnet

67

00:05:45.508  -->  00:05:51.923
the broadcast will be 128 minus by
1, which is 127.

68

00:05:52.524  -->  00:06:00.288
In the seconds block subnet, the broadcast
will be 256 minus by 1, which is 255.

69

00:06:00.588  -->  00:06:06.345
Okay I hope you now understand how to find
Network IP and broadcast IP.

70

00:06:06.769  -->  00:06:13.200
But if you still confused, don’t worry,
try to re watch this video, I believe if you

71

00:06:13.200  -->  00:06:17.263
watch this video 2 or 3 time, you will be
understand!

72

00:06:17.783  -->  00:06:23.268
But if you already watch this video 2 or 3
time and still not understand.

73

00:06:23.268  -->  00:06:25.987
You can just continue to the next video.

74

00:06:25.987  -->  00:06:29.688
After watching next video, you can back to
this video again

75

00:06:29.688  -->  00:06:32.711
and I am sure everything will be make sense!

76

00:06:33.504  -->  00:06:35.174
Okay let’s back here.

77

00:06:35.407  -->  00:06:41.380
So now for prefix /25, we have two block subnets
or 2 rooms.

78

00:06:41.585  -->  00:06:47.745
In the first room, the network is 0 and the
broadcast is 127.

79

00:06:48.183  -->  00:06:54.897
In the seconds room, the network is 128 and
the broadcast is 255.

80

00:06:55.417  -->  00:06:58.025
We can choose any block subnet to use.

81

00:06:58.025  -->  00:07:01.488
But in this case, I will use the first block
subnet.

82

00:07:02.090  -->  00:07:08.322
Okay, I think enough for this video, in the
next video we are going to learn how to calculate

83

00:07:08.322  -->  00:07:09.309
IP Range.

84

00:07:09.746  -->  00:07:12.918
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
