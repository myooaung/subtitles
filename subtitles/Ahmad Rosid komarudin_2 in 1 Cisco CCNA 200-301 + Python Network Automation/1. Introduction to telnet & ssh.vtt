00:00:00.595  -->  00:00:05.152
In this section, we are going to learn about
telnet and ssh.

2

00:00:06.280  -->  00:00:09.365
What is the function of telnet and ssh?

3

00:00:10.007  -->  00:00:17.167
Before we talk about telnet and ssh, we need
to remember that if we want to configure cisco

4

00:00:17.167  -->  00:00:20.331
devices, we need a console cable.

5

00:00:21.236  -->  00:00:27.746
In packet tracer, we can configure the cisco
router or switch using tab CLI like this,

6

00:00:28.494  -->  00:00:33.287
but in the real device, we need to use a console
cable.

7

00:00:33.978  -->  00:00:40.544
Let’s try it, in cisco packet tracer, this
blue cable is console cable.

8

00:00:41.449  -->  00:00:46.774
So here let’s connecting the router to the
pc using console cable.

9

00:00:48.097  -->  00:00:51.282
In the pc choose rs232.

10

00:00:52.469  -->  00:00:59.311
This is a serial port in the pc, and then
in the router let’s choose console port.

11

00:01:00.400  -->  00:01:09.000
Next, to remote the router, we can open the
pc, desktop, and then open the terminal.

12

00:01:09.901  -->  00:01:12.655
Here let’s just choose ok.

13

00:01:13.696  -->  00:01:18.162
Okay here we have successfully remote the
router using console cable.

14

00:01:18.667  -->  00:01:21.471
So we can configure the router from here.

15

00:01:22.627  -->  00:01:28.924
The point is, if we want to configure the
cisco devices, we need to connecting the cisco

16

00:01:28.924  -->  00:01:32.751
devices to our computer using console cable.

17

00:01:33.870  -->  00:01:37.863
This is means if we want to configure the
cisco devices,

18

00:01:38.135  -->  00:01:42.429
we need to come to the location where is the cisco devices.

19

00:01:43.119  -->  00:01:50.146
Let’s say the cisco devices is in the data
center, so every time we need to configure

20

00:01:50.146  -->  00:01:54.195
the cisco devices, we need to come to Data
Center.

21

00:01:55.654  -->  00:02:02.485
Absolutely this is not effective, let’s
say we are in the vacation in another city,

22

00:02:02.952  -->  00:02:10.370
and suddenly there is a problem with our network
so we need to check it in the cisco devices,

23

00:02:10.924  -->  00:02:16.561
there is impossible to go to Data Center because
we are still in another city.

24

00:02:17.708  -->  00:02:21.907
To solve this problem, we can use telnet or
ssh.

25

00:02:22.928  -->  00:02:28.137
With telnet or ssh, we can remote the cisco
devices using network.

26

00:02:29.148  -->  00:02:36.558
For example here let’s say we want to remote
from pc vlan 10 in the room 2 to the router.

27

00:02:37.258  -->  00:02:40.366
This is possible using telnet or ssh.

28

00:02:41.241  -->  00:02:44.308
This is also work for the Data Center case.

29

00:02:45.096  -->  00:02:51.771
Let’s say we are in the another city and
need to remote the cisco devices in Data Center.

30

00:02:52.519  -->  00:02:55.787
This is possible using telnet or ssh.

31

00:02:56.818  -->  00:03:01.570
So we don’t need to come to Data Center
again every time we need to configure the

32

00:03:01.570  -->  00:03:03.103
cisco devices.

33

00:03:03.560  -->  00:03:06.401
But we can use telnet or ssh.

34

00:03:07.597  -->  00:03:12.903
So usually console cable is only used to doing
initial configuration,

35

00:03:13.875  -->  00:03:21.789
after we configure the ip address and enable telnet or ssh, we
no longer need to use console cable

36

00:03:21.789  -->  00:03:27.307
to configure the cisco router or switch, we can use telnet
or ssh.

37

00:03:28.445  -->  00:03:31.291
Okay I think enough for this video,

38

00:03:31.583  -->  00:03:36.000
in the next video we are going to learn how to configure telnet.

39

00:03:36.545  -->  00:03:39.979
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
