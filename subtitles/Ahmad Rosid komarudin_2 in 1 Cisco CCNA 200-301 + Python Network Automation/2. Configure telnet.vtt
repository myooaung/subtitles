00:00:00.649  -->  00:00:06.632
In the previous video, we already learn about
the function of telnet or ssh.

2

00:00:07.260  -->  00:00:14.675
So the point is, we can use telnet or ssh
to remote the cisco devices over a computer network.

3

00:00:15.803  -->  00:00:21.686
Now, the question is, what is the differences
between telnet and ssh?

4

00:00:22.493  -->  00:00:29.555
The differences is in the security level,
ssh is more secure than telnet.

5

00:00:30.183  -->  00:00:33.769
Because in telnet there is no encryption.

6

00:00:34.358  -->  00:00:41.052
This is means, if we remote the cisco devices
using telnet, everything that we type in the

7

00:00:41.052  -->  00:00:48.160
keyboard can easily seen by other people using
packet analyser like wireshark.

8

00:00:49.083  -->  00:00:56.915
But ssh is secure, everything that we type
in the keyboard will be encrypted by ssh.

9

00:00:58.722  -->  00:01:02.901
In this video, we are going to learn how to
configure telnet first.

10

00:01:03.387  -->  00:01:07.069
We will learn how to configure ssh in the
next video.

11

00:01:07.928  -->  00:01:10.028
Okay let’s just start.

12

00:01:10.502  -->  00:01:13.373
We are going to configure telnet on the router.

13

00:01:15.282  -->  00:01:24.507
To configure telnet in the router, first we
need to go to virtual terminal, line vty 0

14

00:01:24.981  -->  00:01:26.339
and then question mark.

15

00:01:26.890  -->  00:01:29.371
Here we can use until 15.

16

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:32.011
Let’s say I use 2.

17

00:01:32.652  -->  00:01:42.000
Here 0 until 2 is 3, this is means at the
same time there will be 3 people who can login

18

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:43.421
using telnet.

19

00:01:45.074  -->  00:01:52.580
Next we need to configure password for telnet,
so here password and then the password,

20

00:01:53.016  -->  00:01:55.594
let’s say telnet123.

21

00:01:56.594  -->  00:01:59.384
Next we can use command login.

22

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:05.596
This command means that if we want to login
to the cisco devices using telnet,

23

00:02:05.788  -->  00:02:11.909
we will need a password, in this case the password
is telnet123.

24

00:02:12.870  -->  00:02:17.814
Last, we need to type command transport input
telnet.

25

00:02:18.827  -->  00:02:27.552
Beside telnet, we can also use transport input
all, if we use all like this, so we can remote

26

00:02:27.552  -->  00:02:30.640
the router using telnet or ssh.

27

00:02:31.307  -->  00:02:39.611
So there is 3 choices, first we can use all,
and remember if we use all so we can remote

28

00:02:39.611  -->  00:02:42.765
the cisco devices using telnet or ssh.

29

00:02:43.765  -->  00:02:50.578
We also can use transport input telnet, this
is means that we only can remote the cisco

30

00:02:50.578  -->  00:02:52.747
devices using telnet.

31

00:02:53.401  -->  00:02:58.090
Last, we also can use transport input ssh.

32

00:02:58.448  -->  00:03:03.656
This is means that we only can remote the
cisco devices using ssh.

33

00:03:04.373  -->  00:03:07.152
In this case I will use telnet first.

34

00:03:09.305  -->  00:03:13.375
Okay now we have done configuring telnet in
the cisco router.

35

00:03:13.939  -->  00:03:20.811
Next let’s try to telnet to the router,
but here let’s remove the console cable first.

36

00:03:21.829  -->  00:03:27.332
Here let’s say we want to telnet to the
router from pc in the vlan 10.

37

00:03:28.524  -->  00:03:34.063
To remote the router using telnet, we can
use telnet or ssh client.

38

00:03:34.999  -->  00:03:40.177
Here we can choose telnet and type the ip
address of the router.

39

00:03:40.920  -->  00:03:47.430
You are free to use which ip address of the
router, remember that the router now have

40

00:03:47.430  -->  00:03:54.135
multiple ip address, which is for vlan 10,
vlan 20, and vlan 30.

41

00:03:55.340  -->  00:04:02.805
And here, we are free to use which ip of the
router, as long as the ip address is accessible

42

00:04:02.805  -->  00:04:04.214
from the pc.

43

00:04:05.573  -->  00:04:11.900
Now let’s try to ping first, close this,
and open command prompt.

44

00:04:12.476  -->  00:04:22.763
Let’s ping to the vlan 10 first, 192.168.10.1,
okay here we can see that the result is success,

45

00:04:23.211  -->  00:04:27.000
so we can telnet the router using this ip.

46

00:04:27.960  -->  00:04:30.961
Let’s also try ping to vlan 20.

47

00:04:31.525  -->  00:04:39.314
192.168.20.1, okay
this is also success, so we also can remote

48

00:04:39.314  -->  00:04:42.000
the router using this ip.

49

00:04:43.041  -->  00:04:53.068
Let’s also try to ping to vlan 30, ping
192.168.30.1, okay this is also success.

50

00:04:53.529  -->  00:04:57.597
So we also can remote the router using this
ip.

51

00:04:59.366  -->  00:05:03.503
Okay let’s back to telnet/ssh client.

52

00:05:04.144  -->  00:05:10.051
Here choose telnet, and put the ip address
of the router, in this case,

53

00:05:10.051  -->  00:05:14.614
let’s say I want to use ip address of the router vlan
20.

54

00:05:15.319  -->  00:05:16.810
Then click connect.

55

00:05:18.053  -->  00:05:24.104
Okay here we need to input the telnet password,
which is telnet123.

56

00:05:26.423  -->  00:05:32.171
Okay here we can see that now we have successfully
login to the router using telnet.

57

00:05:32.530  -->  00:05:33.747
Let’s enable.

58

00:05:34.490  -->  00:05:38.122
Okay here we got an error no password set.

59

00:05:38.776  -->  00:05:43.740
This is because we don’t configure enable
secret yet in the cisco router.

60

00:05:44.649  -->  00:05:51.444
Let’s go to the router, and configure the
enable secret, so enable secret and then the

61

00:05:51.444  -->  00:05:55.155
password, let’s say the password is cisco.

62

00:05:55.950  -->  00:06:05.885
Now let’s back to the pc, enable, the password
is cisco, and okay here we are success to

63

00:06:05.885  -->  00:06:07.832
enter privilege mode.

64

00:06:08.870  -->  00:06:15.838
Okay I think enough for this video, so now
you are able to configure telnet on the cisco router.

65

00:06:16.518  -->  00:06:19.787
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
