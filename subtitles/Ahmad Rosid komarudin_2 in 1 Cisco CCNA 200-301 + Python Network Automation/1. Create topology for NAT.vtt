00:00:00.203  -->  00:00:05.565
In this section, we are going to learn
about nat or network address translation.

2

00:00:06.568  -->  00:00:12.000
But before learn about what is nat, we
are going to create the topology first,

3

00:00:12.897  -->  00:00:17.610
so we will learn with an
example case. Let’s just start.

4

00:00:18.266  -->  00:00:28.935
Let’s import 3 router, this is router 1,
this is router 2, and this is router 3.

5

00:00:33.315  -->  00:00:36.367
Then, let’s also import 1 server,

6

00:00:42.160  -->  00:00:46.632
1 switch, and some client.

7

00:00:56.285  -->  00:00:59.140
Router 1 will be the router in the google,

8

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:12.856
router 2 will become ISP or internet service
provider, and then router 3 is the customer.

9

00:01:16.363  -->  00:01:19.140
Let’s connecting router 1 to the server,

10

00:01:19.972  -->  00:01:29.566
let’s say this is a google, and then
from google router to ISP router,

11

00:01:32.515  -->  00:01:35.469
and from ISP to the customer.

12

00:01:36.408  -->  00:01:42.775
In the customer, we will have 2
vlan, let’s say vlan 10 and vlan 20.

13

00:01:45.884  -->  00:01:53.121
For the ip addressing, here
will be 172.16.10.1/24,

14

00:01:54.098  -->  00:01:59.833
and then the server will be 172.16.10.2/24,

15

00:02:01.360  -->  00:02:07.361
From google that connected
to ISP will be 10.10.10.1/24,

16

00:02:08.150  -->  00:02:13.059
and here in ISP will be 10.10.10.2/24,

17

00:02:14.240  -->  00:02:20.659
From ISP that connected to
customer will be 10.20.20.1/24,

18

00:02:21.430  -->  00:02:27.237
and here in the customer will be 10.20.20.2/24.

19

00:02:33.000  -->  00:02:46.811
For vlan 10, we will use 192.168.1.0/24, and
for vlan 20, we will use 192.168.20.0/24,

20

00:02:48.000  -->  00:02:54.774
Okay so this is the topology that we are going to
use to learn about network address translation.

21

00:02:55.484  -->  00:03:02.233
I think enough for this video, in the next video,
we are going to start configuring this topology.

22

00:03:02.799  -->  00:03:06.000
Thankyou for watching and
see you on the next video.
