00:00:00.368  -->  00:00:05.230
In the previous video, we already learn about
the concept of VTP.

2

00:00:05.799  -->  00:00:12.142
The point is, VTP is used to create VLAN automatically
on many switches.

3

00:00:13.006  -->  00:00:17.641
Next in this video, we are going to practice
about VTP.

4

00:00:18.382  -->  00:00:23.209
But first, let’s create the topology for
practice about VTP.

5

00:00:24.281  -->  00:00:32.116
Let’s import some switch, we will use 2960,
let’s say we will need 4 switches.

6

00:00:35.475  -->  00:00:38.300
Now let’s connecting all the switches.

7

00:00:45.940  -->  00:00:51.175
Okay, this is the topology that we are going
to use to learn about VTP.

8

00:00:52.190  -->  00:00:59.763
Next, the first thing that we need to do before
configure VTP is configuring trunk on all

9

00:00:59.763  -->  00:01:03.280
interfaces that connected to other switches.

10

00:01:04.229  -->  00:01:05.337
Let’s just start.

11

00:01:06.239  -->  00:01:08.762
Let’s change the name of the switches first.

12

00:01:09.464  -->  00:01:22.890
This is switch 1, this is switch 2, this is
switch 3, and last this is switch 4.

13

00:01:24.085  -->  00:01:30.908
Okay now let’s start configuring trunk on
switch 1, here we can see that the interface

14

00:01:30.908  -->  00:01:38.889
that connected to switch 2 is fa0/1, we will
configure this interface as trunk.

15

00:01:39.886  -->  00:01:49.809
Enable, configure terminal, go to interface
fa0/1, and then switchport mode trunk.

16

00:01:51.166  -->  00:02:00.877
Okay next let’s configure switch 2, we will
configure fa0/1 and fa0/2 as trunk.

17

00:02:01.788  -->  00:02:11.776
Let’s go to cli, enable, configure terminal,
interface range fa0/1 until 2,

18

00:02:13.180  -->  00:02:15.620
and then switchport mode trunk.

19

00:02:17.679  -->  00:02:25.158
Next, for switch 3, here we will also configure
fa0/1 until 2 as trunk.

20

00:02:26.591  -->  00:02:36.995
Go to CLI, enable, configure terminal, interface
range fa0/1 until 2,

21

00:02:37.754  -->  00:02:40.082
and then switchport mode trunk.

22

00:02:41.449  -->  00:02:49.610
Last, let’s configure for switch 4, here
we will only configure fa0/1 as trunk,

23

00:02:52.799  -->  00:03:01.341
enable, configure terminal, interface fa0/1, and then
switchport mode trunk.

24

00:03:02.783  -->  00:03:08.010
Okay, now we have done create a topology for
practice about VTP.

25

00:03:08.865  -->  00:03:14.837
So here we just connecting 4 switches and
configure all interfaces that connected to

26

00:03:14.837  -->  00:03:16.658
other switches as trunk.

27

00:03:17.854  -->  00:03:25.530
Okay, I think enough for this video, in the
next video we are going to practice about vtp.

28

00:03:26.096  -->  00:03:29.328
Thank you for watching and see you on the
next video.
