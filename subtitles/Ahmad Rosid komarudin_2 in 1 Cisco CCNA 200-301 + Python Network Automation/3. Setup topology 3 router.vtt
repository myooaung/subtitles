00:00:00.584  -->  00:00:05.360
In the previous video, we already configure
ospf on 2 router.

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:11.191
Next in this video, we are going to add 1 new router to the topology.

3

00:00:11.889  -->  00:00:21.467
Let’s just start, import 1 new router, let’s
say the name is Router 3, let’s also import new pc.

4

00:00:23.520  -->  00:00:29.056
Next, we need to connecting router 2 and router 3,
but before that,

5

00:00:29.056  -->  00:00:32.092
we need to add new interface on router 2.

6

00:00:33.110  -->  00:00:43.939
Let’s save the configuration, go to physical,
shutdown the router, add new interface,

7

00:00:46.305  -->  00:00:48.611
and then turn on the router again.

8

00:00:49.649  -->  00:00:52.612
Now let’s connecting router 2 and router 3.

9

00:00:53.523  -->  00:00:56.741
And also connecting router 3 and pc 3.

10

00:00:58.661  -->  00:01:09.524
Next, for ip addressing, here the ip address
will be 10.20.20.1, but here let’s use prefix /30.

11

00:01:10.912  -->  00:01:20.714
For router 3, the ip address will be 10.20.20.2/30,
and router 3 that connected to pc 3,

12

00:01:20.840  -->  00:01:26.153
the ip address will be 192.168.3.1/24.

13

00:01:27.559  -->  00:01:35.125
Okay now let’s start the ip address configuration,
let’s start with router 2, enable,

14

00:01:35.367  -->  00:01:44.574
configure terminal, here the ip address of fa1/0 will
be 10.20.20.1/30,

15

00:01:45.350  -->  00:01:55.129
So here interface fa1/0, no shutdown, and
then the ip address is 10.20.20.1

16

00:01:55.226  -->  00:02:02.625
and for prefix /30, the subnetmask is 255.255.255.252.

17

00:02:04.070  -->  00:02:13.969
We have done on router 2, next let’s configure
router 3, no, enable, configure terminal,

18

00:02:14.483  -->  00:02:27.528
let’s configure fa0/0 first, so interface fa0/0,
no shutdown, and then the ip address is 10.20.20.2

19

00:02:28.808  -->  00:02:32.251
255.255.255.252.

20

00:02:34.181  -->  00:02:47.687
Next for fa0/1, the ip address will be 192.168.3.1/24,
so here interface fa0/1, no shutdown,

21

00:02:47.959  -->  00:02:54.549
ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0.

22

00:02:55.868  -->  00:03:00.869
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
on router 2 and router 3.

23

00:03:01.761  -->  00:03:05.835
Last, let’s configure the ip address of pc 3.

24

00:03:06.998  -->  00:03:15.854
The ip address is 192.168.3.2 and the gateway
is 192.168.3.1

25

00:03:16.581  -->  00:03:21.677
Okay, so now we have done add 1 new router
to the topology.

26

00:03:22.356  -->  00:03:24.848
I think enough for this video.

27

00:03:24.984  -->  00:03:34.493
In the next video we are going to configure ospf so pc 1, pc 2, and pc 3 will able to communicate each others.

28

00:03:35.298  -->  00:03:38.748
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
