00:00:00.046  -->  00:00:04.795
In the previous video, we already
learn about what is computer network.

2

00:00:05.595  -->  00:00:10.901
The point is, that computer network is
connection between two or more computer

3

00:00:10.901  -->  00:00:17.920
that can share information each others.
Pay attention to my sentences, I say

4

00:00:17.920  -->  00:00:25.595
two or more computers. This is means that we can
build computer network with only two computers.

5

00:00:25.893  -->  00:00:31.499
For example, here we have two
computers that connected using cable.

6

00:00:32.251  -->  00:00:36.000
In the computer network, the
cable that we usually use

7

00:00:36.000  -->  00:00:43.375
is UTP cable. So this is UTP cable
that we use to connecting these two computers.

8

00:00:44.080  -->  00:00:51.537
If you never see UTP cable yet, here is
the example. This blue cable is UTP cable.

9

00:00:52.282  -->  00:01:00.987
And in the end of each cable, we will have RJ45 like this. So we have RJ45 here,

10

00:01:01.125  -->  00:01:10.139
and in the another end, we also have RJ45. This
is small, but we can see here that we have RJ45.

11

00:01:10.704  -->  00:01:15.195
This RJ45 will be connected to LAN port in the computer

12

00:01:15.840  -->  00:01:21.072
If you see on your computer or laptop,
you may be have a LAN port like this.

13

00:01:22.032  -->  00:01:28.939
So in the PC 1 will be connected to LAN port and
in the PC 2 also will be connected to the LAN port.

14

00:01:29.525  -->  00:01:33.824
Now PC 1 and PC 2 already connected using UTP cable,

15

00:01:34.560  -->  00:01:42.400
this is mean that we already have computer network
between these two PC. So now, PC 1 and PC 2 can

16

00:01:42.400  -->  00:01:49.451
share information each others like I show you in
the previous video. Now, if we want to share data

17

00:01:49.451  -->  00:01:55.403
between these two PC, we don’t need flashdisk
anymore, but we can use computer network!

18

00:01:57.344  -->  00:02:05.089
May be some of you have a question, the newest
laptops now usually don’t have LAN port like this anymore,

19

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:11.460
how we can connect this laptop which
don’t have LAN port to the computer network?

20

00:02:12.079  -->  00:02:18.704
If the laptop or computer don’t have LAN port,
we can use USB to LAN converter like this.

21

00:02:20.363  -->  00:02:23.438
The USB will be connected to our laptop,

22

00:02:25.498  -->  00:02:29.131
and the LAN port will be connected to UTP cable.

23

00:02:29.280  -->  00:02:35.258
This is how we can connecting our laptop which
don’t have LAN port to the computer network.

24

00:02:35.771  -->  00:02:40.470
Or we also can use wireless to connecting
our laptop to the computer network.

25

00:02:41.040  -->  00:02:45.291
I think all of laptop must be
have a wireless adapter on it,

26

00:02:45.573  -->  00:02:49.691
so we can use it to connecting the
laptop to the computer network.

27

00:02:50.507  -->  00:02:55.072
The simplest example of computer
network that built using wireless

28

00:02:55.072  -->  00:02:59.067
is when you use bluetooth to
connecting two smartphones.

29

00:02:59.440  -->  00:03:05.761
For example here we have smartphone 1, and
we want to share photo to the smartphone 2,

30

00:03:07.472  -->  00:03:14.400
So we can connecting these two smartphones
using bluetooth, after that we can share

31

00:03:14.400  -->  00:03:20.819
photo from smartphone 1 to smartphone 2. This
is also the example of computer network.

32

00:03:21.267  -->  00:03:27.775
Until now, we understand that to build a
computer network, we can use wired or wireless.

33

00:03:32.480  -->  00:03:40.245
If we use wired, we will need UTP Cable,
RJ45, and LAN port, and if we use wireless,

34

00:03:40.245  -->  00:03:43.579
we just need to have a
wireless adapter on the laptop.

35

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:51.360
Okay I think enough for this video. In the next
video, we are going to learn about IP Address.

36

00:03:51.573  -->  00:03:54.884
Thank you for watching and
see you on the next video!
