00:00:00.522  -->  00:00:06.283
In the previous video, we already learn how
to download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.

2

00:00:06.752  -->  00:00:13.480
Now in this video, we are going to build the most
simple computer network using cisco packet tracer,

3

00:00:13.894  -->  00:00:16.521
which is connecting two computers .

4

00:00:17.597  -->  00:00:24.109
Here in the left buttom, we can go to
end device, and here we can see a PC

5

00:00:24.545  -->  00:00:31.609
I think this is to small, to zoom everything in
packet tracer, we can go to cisco packet tracer

6

00:00:31.609  -->  00:00:33.107
and then preferences.

7

00:00:34.267  -->  00:00:38.695
If you use windows,
this preference menu will be under file.

8

00:00:39.280  -->  00:00:43.840
But if you use mac, the preference is
under cisco packet tracer like this.

9

00:00:44.752  -->  00:00:53.017
Go to preference, in the font tab, we can
change this font size, let’s change this to 14.

10

00:00:56.590  -->  00:01:02.871
Apply, and here we are, we can see
that everything is zoom in now.

11

00:01:03.230  -->  00:01:08.184
Let’s back to end devices, and
add two PC to the workspace.

12

00:01:09.680  -->  00:01:16.443
Here we have PC 0 and PC 1. Now let’s
connecting this two PC using UTP Cable.

13

00:01:20.339  -->  00:01:25.533
Okay now PC 0 and PC 1 is connected using UTP cable.

14

00:01:26.477  -->  00:01:31.677
As I explain in the previous video,
each computer in the computer network

15

00:01:31.677  -->  00:01:35.264
will need an IP Address to
communicate each others.

16

00:01:35.653  -->  00:01:47.370
So now we need to configure the IP Address on PC 0
and PC 1. The IP Address of PC 0 will be 192.168.1.1

17

00:01:49.473  -->  00:01:54.783
and the IP Address of PC 1 will be 192.168.1.2

18

00:01:56.640  -->  00:02:03.909
Now let’s configure the IP Address on PC 0
first. Go to desktop and then IP Configuration.

19

00:02:05.440  -->  00:02:16.996
Here we can put the IP Address, 192.168.1.1.
For subnetmask, just leave it default like this.

20

00:02:17.680  -->  00:02:20.909
We will talk more about subnetmask in
the next video.

21

00:02:21.314  -->  00:02:23.306
Now let’s move to PC 1.

22

00:02:25.697  -->  00:02:33.528
Go to desktop, IP configuration. The IP
Address is 192.168.1.2,

23

00:02:34.012  -->  00:02:37.491
and again, just leave the subnetmask as default.

24

00:02:38.528  -->  00:02:43.059
Okay now PC 0 and PC 1 already have an IP Address.

25

00:02:43.837  -->  00:02:48.256
To test the connection between these two PC, we can do ping.

26

00:02:49.941  -->  00:02:54.000
Here in the desktop section, we can see command prompt.

27

00:02:54.640  -->  00:02:59.716
I think this is to small, let’s go to
cisco packet tracer and preference again.

28

00:03:00.400  -->  00:03:05.704
Here in the font section,
change the CLI font size to 14.

29

00:03:08.160  -->  00:03:09.980
Let’s back to the PC,

30

00:03:14.099  -->  00:03:20.493
Okay here the font is little bit
bigger, but I think this is not enough,

31

00:03:20.800  -->  00:03:25.467
let’s back to the preference
again and change the size to 18.

32

00:03:31.553  -->  00:03:37.085
Now let’s back to the PC, Okay
this is much butter right?

33

00:03:37.680  -->  00:03:41.304
Now let’s test connection between PC 0 and PC 1.

34

00:03:41.482  -->  00:03:50.045
just type ping and then the IP Address of PC that we
want to ping. In this case, we do ping from PC 1,

35

00:03:50.143  -->  00:04:00.768
so we want to ping to PC 0. Let’s put the IP
Address of PC 0 here, 192.168.1.1, and enter.

36

00:04:01.552  -->  00:04:08.549
Great! Our ping is success, here
we can see reply from 192.168.1.1,

37

00:04:08.549  -->  00:04:15.773
which is the IP Address of PC 0. This is mean
that the connection between this two PC is OK!

38

00:04:16.513  -->  00:04:22.431
Besides ping, we can use another way to test
connection between two PC in packet tracer.

39

00:04:22.875  -->  00:04:29.876
We can send a packet. So let’s
click here, and then click on PC 1

40

00:04:30.555  -->  00:04:38.807
and then PC 0, this is mean that we send a
packet from PC 1 to PC 0. And here we can see

41

00:04:38.807  -->  00:04:46.377
that this is successful, this is mean that
PC 1 is successfully send the packet to PC 0.

42

00:04:47.390  -->  00:04:53.429
Okay so now we have two way to test the connection
between two computer in the Cisco Packet Tracer.

43

00:04:53.760  -->  00:04:58.866
The first one is using command prompt,
and the second one is using packet.

44

00:04:59.600  -->  00:05:05.520
But in the real devices, we don’t have
packet features, so we just have one way

45

00:05:05.520  -->  00:05:11.681
to test connection between two PC in real
devices, which is ping from command prompt.

46

00:05:12.240  -->  00:05:17.120
Okay I think enough for this video,
congratulation! Now you are able to

47

00:05:17.120  -->  00:05:19.210
build your own computer network!

48

00:05:19.505  -->  00:05:22.750
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
