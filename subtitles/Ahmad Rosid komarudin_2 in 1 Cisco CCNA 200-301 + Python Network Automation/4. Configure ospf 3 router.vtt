00:00:00.500  -->  00:00:09.000
In the previous video, we already add 1 new router
to the topology, so now we have 3 router here.

2

00:00:09.756  -->  00:00:18.581
Next in this video, we are going to configure ospf
so all pc will able to communicate each others.

3

00:00:19.181  -->  00:00:27.820
Because for now pc 1 and pc 2 should not able
to communicate with pc 3. Let’s test it.

4

00:00:28.539  -->  00:00:42.873
Pc 2 to pc 3, failed, test again, still failed,
pc 1 to pc 3, failed, test again, still failed.

5

00:00:43.499  -->  00:00:48.938
Okay so now pc 1 and pc 2 can
not communicate with pc 3.

6

00:00:49.566  -->  00:00:53.271
This is why we need to configure an ospf.

7

00:00:53.937  -->  00:00:58.294
The question is, where we need
to add ospf configuration?

8

00:00:59.434  -->  00:01:07.353
Here in router 1, we don’t add any ip address,
so there is no new connected network,

9

00:01:07.816  -->  00:01:12.953
this is means we don’t need to
add any configuration on router 1.

10

00:01:14.686  -->  00:01:25.761
In the router 2, we add new ip address, which
is fa1/0, the ip address is 10.20.20.1/30,

11

00:01:26.500  -->  00:01:37.480
so we have new connected network here,
which is 10.20.20.0/30 connected to fa1/0.

12

00:01:38.286  -->  00:01:44.564
Because router 2 have new connected network,
so we will need to add new configuration here.

13

00:01:45.271  -->  00:01:52.030
And last router 3, we don’t configure
ospf yet, so absolutely we will need

14

00:01:52.030  -->  00:01:58.551
to add ospf configuration here. Let’s
write the connected network of router 3.

15

00:01:59.122  -->  00:02:02.019
Router3 should have 2 connected network,

16

00:02:03.220  -->  00:02:16.536
10.20.20.0/30 connected to fa0/0, and
192.168.3.0/24 connected to fa0/1.

17

00:02:17.674  -->  00:02:24.949
Okay now let’s configure ospf. Let’s
start with router 2. Remember that here

18

00:02:24.949  -->  00:02:35.218
we use ospf process id 2, if you forgot the ospf
process id, you can check it first, do show run,

19

00:02:38.407  -->  00:02:42.000
here we can see that we use process id 2.

20

00:02:43.168  -->  00:02:50.384
So here router ospf 2, next
let’s advertise the new network,

21

00:02:52.515  -->  00:03:02.776
network 10.20.20.0 and then the
wildcard bits. Here we use prefix /30,

22

00:03:03.424  -->  00:03:10.653
and the subnetmask for
prefix /30 is 255.255.255.252,

23

00:03:13.300  -->  00:03:24.999
let’s calculate the wildcard bits,
255.255.255.255 minus by subnetmask .

24

00:03:25.608  -->  00:03:39.946
255 minus by 252 is 3, 255 minus by 255 0, 255
minus by 255 0 and 255 minus by 255 is also 0.

25

00:03:40.686  -->  00:03:50.882
So for prefix /30, the wildcard bits is
0.0.0.3. Let’s back to the configuration.

26

00:03:54.513  -->  00:04:03.682
Here let’s put the wildcard
bits, 0.0.0.3. and then area 0.

27

00:04:06.381  -->  00:04:12.590
Okay now we have done for router 2,
next let’s configure router 3.

28

00:04:13.553  -->  00:04:21.617
Router ospf and then the process id, you
are free to use anything, but in this case,

29

00:04:21.617  -->  00:04:28.845
let’s say we will use 3. And then next,
let’s advertise the connected network.

30

00:04:29.382  -->  00:04:41.684
Network 10.20.20.0 and the wildcard bits
for prefix /30 is 0.0.0.3 and then area 0.

31

00:04:42.554  -->  00:04:47.176
Next let’s advertise the
network that connected to pc 3,

32

00:04:47.844  -->  00:05:00.776
so network 192.168.3.0 wildcard bits for
prefix /24 is 0.0.0.255 and then area 0.

33

00:05:02.102  -->  00:05:09.000
Okay now we have done configuring ospf
on router 2 and router 3. Let’s check it,

34

00:05:09.341  -->  00:05:13.068
First, let’s see the routing table on router 1,

35

00:05:13.527  -->  00:05:21.883
enable, show ip route. Here we can see
that router 1 have route to the pc 3,

36

00:05:22.363  -->  00:05:29.792
and this route is added automatically
by ospf. Let’s also check on router2,

37

00:05:33.760  -->  00:05:41.693
here we can see that router 2 also have route
to pc 3 automatically. Here the label is O,

38

00:05:41.816  -->  00:05:44.004
this is means ospf.

39

00:05:44.915  -->  00:05:49.113
Let’s also check on router 3, do show ip route,

40

00:05:50.100  -->  00:05:57.146
here we can see that on router 3 also
have route to pc 1 and pc 2 automatically.

41

00:05:57.767  -->  00:06:06.229
So for now pc 1, pc 2, and pc 3 should be
able to communicate each others. Let’s try.

42

00:06:06.813  -->  00:06:17.446
Pc 1 to pc 2, success, pc 2 to pc 3,
failed, test again, okay here success.

43

00:06:18.340  -->  00:06:23.217
Okay so now we have done
configuring ospf on 3 router.

44

00:06:23.713  -->  00:06:26.048
I think enough for this video

45

00:06:26.165  -->  00:06:29.598
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
