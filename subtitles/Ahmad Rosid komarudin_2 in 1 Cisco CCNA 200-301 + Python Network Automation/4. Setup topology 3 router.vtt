00:00:00.388  -->  00:00:05.017
In the previous video, we have
done configuring BGP on 2 router.

2

00:00:05.639  -->  00:00:11.081
Next in this video, we are going to
add 1 new router to our topology.

3

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:19.145
Let’s just start, let’s import 1 new
router, the name let’s say router 3.

4

00:00:20.334  -->  00:00:22.388
Let’s also import new pc.

5

00:00:24.700  -->  00:00:31.190
We will need to connecting router 2 and
router 3, so let’s add interface on router 2,

6

00:00:32.629  -->  00:00:37.526
save the configuration, go to physical,

7

00:00:39.980  -->  00:00:47.463
shutdown the router, add new
interface, and then turn on the router.

8

00:00:49.534  -->  00:00:57.639
Now let’s connecting router 2 and router 3.
And also connecting router 3 and pc 3.

9

00:01:00.887  -->  00:01:09.482
For the ip addressing, here in router 2,
let’s say the ip address is 10.10.10.5/30,

10

00:01:10.229  -->  00:01:16.009
and in router 3, the ip address is 10.10.10.6/30,

11

00:01:16.780  -->  00:01:28.722
Let’s start the configuration, enable,
configure terminal, interface fa1/0,

12

00:01:29.038  -->  00:01:37.503
no shutdown, the ip address
is 10.10.10.5 255.255.255.252.

13

00:01:38.565  -->  00:01:41.449
Next, let’s configure router 3,

14

00:01:45.196  -->  00:01:51.770
enable, configure terminal,
let’s start with fa0/0.

15

00:01:52.583  -->  00:02:05.309
So interface fa0/0, no shutdown, ip
address 10.10.10.6 255.255.255.252.

16

00:02:06.807  -->  00:02:20.550
Next for fa0/1, the ip address will be
192.168.3.1/24, and pc 3 will be 192.168.3.2/24.

17

00:02:22.901  -->  00:02:37.400
Interface fa0/1, no shutdown, ip
address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0,

18

00:02:38.270  -->  00:02:42.329
Last, let’s configure the ip address of pc 3,

19

00:02:44.069  -->  00:02:52.034
the ip address is 192.168.3.2,
and the gateway is 192.168.3.1

20

00:02:53.321  -->  00:02:57.750
Okay now we have done add 1
new router to our topology.

21

00:02:58.281  -->  00:03:06.320
I think enough for this video, in the next
video we are going to configure BGP so pc 3

22

00:03:06.320  -->  00:03:09.886
will able to communicate with pc 1 and pc 2.

23

00:03:10.525  -->  00:03:13.970
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
