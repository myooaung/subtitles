00:00:00.989  -->  00:00:06.559
In this video, we are going to learn how to
install python, paramiko, and Django in our

2

00:00:06.559  -->  00:00:08.250
computer.

3

00:00:08.250  -->  00:00:15.110
I will use windows in here, if you all use
mac or linux, I think, the installation process

4

00:00:15.110  -->  00:00:16.970
will be much easier.

5

00:00:16.970  -->  00:00:18.330
Okay.

6

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:24.710
To download python, you can go to python.org/download.

7

00:00:24.710  -->  00:00:31.960
Here we can download the latest version, in
this case the latest version is version 3.7.2,

8

00:00:31.960  -->  00:00:42.530
or if you want to download another version,
you can go to all releases then here we can

9

00:00:42.530  -->  00:00:47.760
see all versions so we can download the version
that we want.

10

00:00:47.760  -->  00:00:56.260
but in this course, We will use the latest
version, which is version 3.7.2.

11

00:00:56.260  -->  00:01:00.950
now let’s download the python version 3.7.2
...

12

00:01:00.950  -->  00:01:03.940
If the download is complete.

13

00:01:03.940  -->  00:01:10.410
you can just open the python installer, when
we click the Python installer, we will get

14

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:12.329
display like this.

15

00:01:12.329  -->  00:01:17.960
I recommend you to check "Add python 3.7 to
path".

16

00:01:17.960  -->  00:01:26.409
Then click install now, yes ... then the installation
process will take place.

17

00:01:26.409  -->  00:01:33.119
We just need to wait until the installation
process is complete.

18

00:01:33.119  -->  00:01:37.820
The installation process is complete.

19

00:01:37.820  -->  00:01:48.810
To ensure that Python is installed on our
computer, we can open a command prompt, then

20

00:01:48.810  -->  00:01:54.479
type python --version.

21

00:01:54.479  -->  00:01:58.750
Here we can see that we have python version
3.7.2.

22

00:01:58.750  -->  00:02:07.969
This is means that we have successfully installed
Python on our computer.

23

00:02:07.969  -->  00:02:11.870
Next we will learn how to install paramiko.

24

00:02:11.870  -->  00:02:17.560
If you don't know about paramiko yet, you
can see the paramiko documentation at paramiko.org.

25

00:02:17.560  -->  00:02:32.380
here we can see that paramiko is a python
library, it supports python version 2.7 or

26

00:02:32.380  -->  00:02:42.040
3.4 and above, the goal of paramiko is to
be able to implement ssh version 2, both as

27

00:02:42.040  -->  00:02:44.370
a client and as a server.

28

00:02:44.370  -->  00:02:52.870
On this course, we will use paramiko as a
ssh client, the paramiko will act as a library

29

00:02:52.870  -->  00:02:58.300
that will do SSH to Cisco routers and mikrotik
routers.

30

00:02:58.300  -->  00:03:12.400
Okay let’s install paramiko, open a command
prompt, then type pip install paramiko.

31

00:03:12.400  -->  00:03:17.490
Wait until the installation process is complete.

32

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:28.180
Here we can see a warning that we are using
pip version 18.1, while for now, pip already

33

00:03:28.180  -->  00:03:40.420
has version 19.0.3, so we are recommended
to upgrade pip.

34

00:03:40.420  -->  00:03:46.760
Okay we have finished installing paramiko
and upgrading pip, to prove that paramiko

35

00:03:46.760  -->  00:03:53.600
has been installed correctly on our computer,
we can enter the python interpreter by typing

36

00:03:53.600  -->  00:04:02.970
python, then here we can try to import paramiko.

37

00:04:02.970  -->  00:04:10.250
Okay here we don't get an error, meaning the
paramiko has been successfully installed on

38

00:04:10.250  -->  00:04:11.420
our computer.

39

00:04:11.420  -->  00:04:20.260
We can exit from this python interpreter by
typing exit.

40

00:04:20.260  -->  00:04:24.090
Next we will learn how to install Django.

41

00:04:24.090  -->  00:04:36.129
If you don't know about Django yet, you can
see the Django documentation in djangproject.com,

42

00:04:36.129  -->  00:04:43.259
... here we can see that Django is a python
web framework, so we can use Django to build

43

00:04:43.259  -->  00:04:46.189
a website with python.

44

00:04:46.189  -->  00:04:55.039
Okay, let's install Django, it's similar to
how to install paramiko, we only need to open

45

00:04:55.039  -->  00:05:05.020
the command prompt and type pip install Django.

46

00:05:05.020  -->  00:05:12.300
To prove that Django is installed properly
or not, we can enter the Python interpreter,

47

00:05:12.300  -->  00:05:15.919
then type import django.

48

00:05:15.919  -->  00:05:22.820
Okay here we also don't get an error, meaning
that Django is successfully installed on our

49

00:05:22.820  -->  00:05:24.150
computer.

50

00:05:24.150  -->  00:05:30.580
Now, we have successfully installed python,
paramiko and Django on our computer.

51

00:05:30.580  -->  00:05:33.990
Thankyou for watching, and See you on the
next video.
