00:00:00.373  -->  00:00:04.580
In this video, we are going to learn the last
case of subnetting.

2

00:00:05.082  -->  00:00:08.958
In this case, we have 15 PC in our network.

3

00:00:09.657  -->  00:00:16.610
As usual, we are going to calculate the best
prefix we will use, The total IP, subnetmask,

4

00:00:16.610  -->  00:00:20.463
network IP, broadcast IP, and Range IP.

5

00:00:21.475  -->  00:00:23.324
Okay let’s just start.

6

00:00:24.204  -->  00:00:28.630
First let’s determine the best prefix for
15 PC.

7

00:00:29.379  -->  00:00:37.310
Let’s write the powers, 2 to the power of
1 is 2, 2 to the power of 2 is 4, 2 to the

8

00:00:37.310  -->  00:00:46.877
power of 3 is 8, 2 to the power of 4 is 16,
2 to the power of 5 is 32, and so on.

9

00:00:47.461  -->  00:00:56.117
Here now we already have 16 and 32, may be
some of you think that we can use 16 for 15 PC.

10

00:00:56.643  -->  00:01:04.090
But actually, this 16 will be minus by 2,
so the actual is only 14 PC.

11

00:01:04.633  -->  00:01:05.896
Why minus by 2?

12

00:01:06.422  -->  00:01:09.805
Because we will have network IP and broadcast
IP.

13

00:01:10.216  -->  00:01:14.435
And remember that Network and broadcast IP
never can be used.

14

00:01:15.085  -->  00:01:24.922
Once again, if the total IP 16, the IP that we
can used is only 14, this is not enough for 15 PC

15

00:01:25.610  -->  00:01:28.787
So we will use 2 to the power of 5.

16

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:35.070
And the prefix is 32 minus by 5, which is
/27.

17

00:01:39.446  -->  00:01:42.595
Okay now we have the best prefix we can use.

18

00:01:43.130  -->  00:01:46.536
Next let’s determine which IP we will use.

19

00:01:47.030  -->  00:01:54.484
We can use either 10.0.0, or 172.16, or 192.168

20

00:01:55.298  -->  00:01:59.294
In this case, I will use the first range,
which is 10.

21

00:01:59.911  -->  00:02:05.940
Let’s say the IP is 10.10.10.0/27.

22

00:02:06.821  -->  00:02:11.777
Remember that the last number here will be
change between 0 until 255.

23

00:02:12.246  -->  00:02:15.266
And the third first number will be never change.

24

00:02:15.628  -->  00:02:21.737
And the prefix here is /27, this is result
of our calculation before.

25

00:02:22.716  -->  00:02:29.246
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to calculate total ip,

26

00:02:29.616  -->  00:02:34.094
subnetmask, network ip, broadcast ip and range
ip.

27

00:02:34.744  -->  00:02:37.877
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video
