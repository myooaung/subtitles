00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:06.990
In the previous video, we already learn about
the basic command in cisco.

2

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:15.290
Now in this video, we are going to learn how
to configure an ip address in cisco router.

3

00:00:15.290  -->  00:00:16.890
Okay let’s just start.

4

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:19.010
Let’s add a PC.

5

00:00:19.010  -->  00:00:26.770
Let’s say we will use 3 pc.

6

00:00:26.770  -->  00:00:31.000
And we will connecting the pc to the switch
and router.

7

00:00:31.000  -->  00:00:37.280
We will connecting this 2 pc to the switch,
from the switch to the router.

8

00:00:37.280  -->  00:00:42.710
And then this pc will be directly connected
to the router.

9

00:00:42.710  -->  00:00:44.680
Okay let’s just start.

10

00:00:44.680  -->  00:00:53.579
Connecting this 2 pc to the switch, and from
the switch to the router.

11

00:00:53.579  -->  00:00:58.809
And finally, connecting the router directly
to the computer.

12

00:00:58.809  -->  00:01:06.520
In the topology like this, pc3 and pc4 will
be in the same block subnet, but pc5 will

13

00:01:06.520  -->  00:01:08.980
be in the different block subnet.

14

00:01:08.980  -->  00:01:17.650
For example, we will use 192.168.1.0/24 for
pc3 and pc4.

15

00:01:17.650  -->  00:01:27.520
And then for pc5, we will use 192.168.2.0/24.

16

00:01:27.520  -->  00:01:37.170
So the ip address of router interface that
connected to pc3 and pc4 will be 192.168.1.1,

17

00:01:37.170  -->  00:01:48.079
the ip address of pc3 will be 192.168.1.2,
and the ip address of pc4 will be 192.168.1.3.

18

00:01:48.079  -->  00:01:55.650
Next, fa0/1, which is the interface that connected

19

00:01:55.650  -->  00:02:07.700
to PC5, the ip address will be 192.168.2.1..
and then the ip address of pc5 will be 192.168.2.2.

20

00:02:07.700  -->  00:02:14.019
Let’s start configuring ip address on the
router.

21

00:02:14.019  -->  00:02:20.719
In the networking basic section, we already
learn how to configure ip address in cisco

22

00:02:20.719  -->  00:02:24.260
router, but we use the config menu.

23

00:02:24.260  -->  00:02:30.559
We just need to click the interface that we
want to configure, turn the interface on,

24

00:02:30.559  -->  00:02:34.060
and then configure the ip address.

25

00:02:34.060  -->  00:02:40.129
But we can not use this method to configure
ip address in the real device.

26

00:02:40.129  -->  00:02:46.760
If we want to configure an ip address in the
real device, we need to type cisco command.

27

00:02:46.760  -->  00:02:50.030
In this case we need to use CLI tab.

28

00:02:50.030  -->  00:02:56.790
Okay, so in this video, I will show you how
we can configure ip address in cisco router

29

00:02:56.790  -->  00:02:57.790
from CLI.

30

00:02:57.790  -->  00:02:59.319
Okay, so here let’s go to cli.

31

00:02:59.319  -->  00:03:03.230
Here let’s exit, and exit again.

32

00:03:03.230  -->  00:03:05.609
Here now we are in the privilege mode.

33

00:03:05.609  -->  00:03:10.169
Let’s go to global configuration mode.

34

00:03:10.169  -->  00:03:15.409
To configure an ip address, first we need
to go to the interface first.

35

00:03:15.409  -->  00:03:23.329
In this case, we are going to configure an
ip address for fa0/0 first.

36

00:03:23.329  -->  00:03:29.760
So here let’s type interface fa0/0.

37

00:03:29.760  -->  00:03:33.199
If you see here, this is the shortened command.

38

00:03:33.199  -->  00:03:44.319
The actual command is interface, but we can
shortened the command become int like this.

39

00:03:44.319  -->  00:03:51.629
Next if we see here, the light colour is still
red, this is means that the interface is still

40

00:03:51.629  -->  00:03:52.819
disabled.

41

00:03:52.819  -->  00:03:58.659
To enable the interface we can use command
no shutdown.

42

00:03:58.659  -->  00:04:02.849
Okay here we can see that now the light is
green.

43

00:04:02.849  -->  00:04:09.499
Now let’s configure the ip address, the
command is ip address 192.168.1.1 and then

44

00:04:09.499  -->  00:04:23.560
the subnetmask, the subnetmask for prefix
/24 is 255.255.255.0.

45

00:04:23.560  -->  00:04:27.150
Okay let’s enter here.

46

00:04:27.150  -->  00:04:33.990
For now we are done configuring the ip address
of fa0/0.

47

00:04:33.990  -->  00:04:39.669
Next let’s configure the ip address of fa0/1.

48

00:04:39.669  -->  00:04:48.460
So interface fa0/1, no shutdown to enable
the interface.

49

00:04:48.460  -->  00:04:54.039
Okay here we can see that the light of the
interface is already green.

50

00:04:54.039  -->  00:04:57.009
Next let’s configure the ip address.

51

00:04:57.009  -->  00:05:10.030
The ip address is 192.168.2.1 and the subnetmask
is 255.255.255.0.

52

00:05:10.030  -->  00:05:15.160
Okay now we have done configuring the ip address
in the router.

53

00:05:15.160  -->  00:05:23.270
For the verification, we can use command do
show ip interface brief.

54

00:05:23.270  -->  00:05:33.330
Here we can see that the ip address of fa0/0
is 192.168.1.1, the status is up.

55

00:05:33.330  -->  00:05:44.539
And the ip address of fa0/1 is 192.168.2.1
and the status is also up.

56

00:05:44.539  -->  00:05:49.940
Next let’s configure the ip address of all
PC. let’s start from pc3.

57

00:05:49.940  -->  00:06:07.439
Go to desktop, ip configuration, the ip address
is 192.168.1.2, the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0,

58

00:06:07.439  -->  00:06:18.410
and the gateway is the router ip address that
connected to pc3, which is 192.168.1.1,

59

00:06:18.410  -->  00:06:32.139
Next let’s configure for pc4, go to desktop,
ip configuration, the ip address is 192.168.1.3,

60

00:06:32.139  -->  00:06:40.289
and the gateway is same as pc3, which is 192.168.1.1.

61

00:06:40.289  -->  00:06:42.840
Okay done for pc4.

62

00:06:42.840  -->  00:06:48.909
For the switch, we don’t need to configure
anything, so we can skip it.

63

00:06:48.909  -->  00:06:52.039
Last let’s configure the ip address of pc5.

64

00:06:52.039  -->  00:07:04.480
Go to desktop, ip configuration, the ip address
is 192.168.2.2, and then the gateway is 192.168.2.1

65

00:07:04.480  -->  00:07:13.690
Okay now we have done configuring IP Address
on all of PC. now let’s try test the connection

66

00:07:13.690  -->  00:07:18.439
using ping, so go to command prompt.

67

00:07:18.439  -->  00:07:23.689
Here we are going to test from pc5 to pc3
first.

68

00:07:23.689  -->  00:07:37.680
So ping 192.168.1.2, okay here we can see
that the first result is timeout, but the

69

00:07:37.680  -->  00:07:40.360
others is success.

70

00:07:40.360  -->  00:07:47.220
This is means that connection between pc5
and pc3 is ok.

71

00:07:47.220  -->  00:08:03.229
Now let’s also test from pc5 to pc4, so
ping 192.168.1.3, okay here we can see that

72

00:08:03.229  -->  00:08:07.409
the result is also successful.

73

00:08:07.409  -->  00:08:13.150
Okay so now we have done configuring ip address
in the cisco router.

74

00:08:13.150  -->  00:08:15.580
And I think enough for this video.

75

00:08:15.580  -->  00:08:18.970
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
