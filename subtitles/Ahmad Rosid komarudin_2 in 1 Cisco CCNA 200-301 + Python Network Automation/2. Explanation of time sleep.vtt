00:00:00.487  -->  00:00:04.605
In the previous video, we already
learn the basic of paramiko.

2

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:11.518
So now we are able to do a simple
network automation using paramiko.

3

00:00:12.200  -->  00:00:17.151
Next in this video, we are going
to learn more about time sleep.

4

00:00:17.827  -->  00:00:26.274
As I said in the previous video, that the function
of time sleep is to stop the script for 1 second.

5

00:00:27.107  -->  00:00:34.489
We need to stop the script for a second to
wait the cisco command is executed correctly.

6

00:00:35.615  -->  00:00:38.707
Now let’s try to remove the time sleep.

7

00:00:39.436  -->  00:00:48.903
Let’s put hash here. Remember that hash means
comment. So this script is not used anymore.

8

00:00:49.882  -->  00:00:59.445
And then we will create loopback1, the
ip address let’s say 10.1.1.2, save.

9

00:01:00.227  -->  00:01:08.078
Now let’s run the script again,
python paramiko_basic.py.

10

00:01:09.296  -->  00:01:17.129
We will remote router 1, username
cisco, and the password is also cisco.

11

00:01:19.278  -->  00:01:26.385
Here we can see that the cisco command is
not send correctly, we only get a hash here.

12

00:01:27.313  -->  00:01:33.936
Let’s check in the router, here we can
see configure from console by cisco.

13

00:01:34.682  -->  00:01:42.872
So actually the python is already login to the
router. But the command is not send correctly.

14

00:01:43.855  -->  00:01:48.351
Let’s see the interface,
do show ip interface brief,

15

00:01:51.873  -->  00:01:55.409
here we can see that we don’t have loopback1 yet.

16

00:01:56.360  -->  00:01:59.525
Now let’s put the time sleep again.

17

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:12.069
Run the script again, let’s clear this
first, and then python paramiko_basic.py,

18

00:02:14.273  -->  00:02:23.343
let’s remote router 1, username is
cisco and the password is also cisco.

19

00:02:25.678  -->  00:02:30.800
Here we can see that we are
success login to 10.10.10.1,

20

00:02:30.800  -->  00:02:35.731
which is router 1, and we also
success to send the cisco command,

21

00:02:36.185  -->  00:02:43.740
configure terminal, interface loopack1,
and the ip address is 10.1.1.2,

22

00:02:44.449  -->  00:02:49.277
Let’s check on router 1, do
show ip interface brief,

23

00:02:53.269  -->  00:03:00.585
here we can see that we have loopback1,
and the ip address is 10.1.1.2,

24

00:03:01.680  -->  00:03:05.354
Okay I hope you understand
the function of time sleep,

25

00:03:05.820  -->  00:03:08.305
I think enough for this video

26

00:03:08.614  -->  00:03:12.000
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
