00:00:00.416  -->  00:00:05.200
In this video we are going to start
learning about basic computer network.

2

00:00:05.200  -->  00:00:07.680
We are going to start from the very basic,

3

00:00:08.240  -->  00:00:13.117
which is learning about what is computer
network and the function of computer network

4

00:00:13.840  -->  00:00:17.440
So what is computer network? In the simple term,

5

00:00:17.440  -->  00:00:22.240
computer network is used to help us
to share information between computer.

6

00:00:22.240  -->  00:00:30.000
For example, here I have a picture of computer
network. Here we can see that we have a laptop,

7

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:37.806
computer, printer, playstation,
smartphone, and another computer

8

00:00:38.480  -->  00:00:44.880
And we can see that all of these devices is
connected to the router. Some devices connected

9

00:00:44.880  -->  00:00:50.598
to the router using cable, and some another
devices connected to the router using wifi.

10

00:00:51.920  -->  00:00:56.640
After all of these devices connected
to the router, now we have a computer

11

00:00:56.640  -->  00:01:02.709
network here. And all of these devices
now can share information each others.

12

00:01:03.200  -->  00:01:08.379
So this is a computer network, to help
us share information between computers.

13

00:01:08.880  -->  00:01:12.639
Now let’s talk more about how
computer network can help us

14

00:01:13.120  -->  00:01:15.600
In the past, before computer network exists,

15

00:01:16.240  -->  00:01:21.563
let’s say we have a room and in
this room we have six computer.

16

00:01:24.560  -->  00:01:29.228
For example all of this computer
want to print in the same time,

17

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:31.977
before computer network exists,

18

00:01:31.977  -->  00:01:36.900
if we want to print, we need to have
a printer connected to our computer.

19

00:01:37.280  -->  00:01:44.095
So if we have six computers like this, we will
need six printers that connected to each computer.

20

00:01:44.736  -->  00:01:48.861
We need a printer in computer 1, computer 2,

21

00:01:48.960  -->  00:01:57.142
computer 3, computer 4, computer 5, and also
we need a printer in computer 6 like this.

22

00:01:57.846  -->  00:02:04.444
Now let’s imagine, we just have six computers
right now, and we need six printers that

23

00:02:04.444  -->  00:02:11.751
connected to each computers. How if we have
100 computers, so we will need 100 printers right?

24

00:02:12.320  -->  00:02:15.388
This is absolutely not cost effective.

25

00:02:16.080  -->  00:02:22.080
But now, with computer network, we don’t
need to buy a printer for each computer.

26

00:02:22.080  -->  00:02:28.793
We just need to have 1 printer that connected to
computer network, and then all of computers can

27

00:02:28.793  -->  00:02:35.283
print with this printer using computer network.
Doesn’t matter if we have 10 computers,

28

00:02:35.283  -->  00:02:40.880
50 computers, or even 100 computers,
we just need to have 1 printer

29

00:02:40.880  -->  00:02:47.589
that connected to the computer network, and all
of that computers, can print using this 1 printer.

30

00:02:48.256  -->  00:02:55.173
So this is one of the function of computer
network. Absolutely, this is help us much right?

31

00:02:56.400  -->  00:03:02.069
Another example of the function of computer
network is to share data between computers.

32

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:10.240
In the past, or actually now we still use this
method. You know about flashdisk right? We can

33

00:03:10.240  -->  00:03:15.243
use flashdisk to share data from
one computer to another computer.

34

00:03:15.760  -->  00:03:20.270
For example we want to share data
from the computer to the laptop.

35

00:03:20.880  -->  00:03:25.916
Before computer network exists, we need
to connecting a flashdisk to the computer,

36

00:03:27.820  -->  00:03:33.811
then copy the data from the computer
to the flashdisk. When this is done,

37

00:03:33.920  -->  00:03:40.640
we need to bring the flashdisk to the laptop.
And then now we can copy the data from the

38

00:03:40.640  -->  00:03:47.039
flashdisk to the laptop. Now we have successfully
share the data from the computer to the laptop.

39

00:03:47.600  -->  00:03:54.937
But we have a problem here. Which is we need
to bring the flashdisk from the computer to the laptop.

40

00:03:54.937  -->  00:04:00.000
Let’s imagine that the computer
is in the 1st floor in the building,

41

00:04:00.550  -->  00:04:06.800
and the laptop is in the 10th floor.  So
we need to walk to bring this flashdisk

42

00:04:06.800  -->  00:04:11.705
from the computer to the laptop.
This is absolutely not efficient!

43

00:04:12.240  -->  00:04:19.040
But now, if we use computer network, we don’t need
to do that. We can share data between computer

44

00:04:19.040  -->  00:04:25.360
and laptop using computer network, as long as
computer and laptop is connected to the same

45

00:04:25.360  -->  00:04:31.842
computer network. In this example, computer
and laptop is connected to the same router,

46

00:04:32.240  -->  00:04:36.892
so absolutely, we can share data
between this computer and laptop.

47

00:04:37.840  -->  00:04:44.240
So this is some of example how computer network
can help us. First we can use computer network

48

00:04:44.240  -->  00:04:49.996
for sharing a printer, and also we can
use computer network to sharing data.

49

00:04:50.560  -->  00:04:56.265
Besides these two example, we usually use
computer network to access the internet.

50

00:04:56.416  -->  00:05:04.160
For example, we can access facebook.com from
the smartphone here. When we access facebook.com

51

00:05:04.160  -->  00:05:11.840
from the smartphone like this, we already use a
computer network. Why? Because our smartphone is

52

00:05:11.840  -->  00:05:18.240
connected to the router using wifi, and the router
is connected to ISP or

53

00:05:18.240  -->  00:05:24.342
Internet Service Provider, and then
the ISP is connected to the internet.

54

00:05:26.880  -->  00:05:31.573
And absolutely, we have a facebook.com
that also connected to the internet.

55

00:05:32.720  -->  00:05:38.543
When we access facebook.com from the smartphone,
the packet will be forwarded to the router,

56

00:05:38.720  -->  00:05:45.040
from the router will be forwarded to the ISP,
from the ISP will be forwarded to the internet,

57

00:05:45.040  -->  00:05:49.106
and somehow the packet will be
forwarded to the facebook.com.

58

00:05:49.247  -->  00:05:55.516
So this is how we use computer network to
access facebook.com from our smartphone.

59

00:05:55.660  -->  00:06:00.303
Not only facebook.com, when we
access internet like youtube,

60

00:06:01.100  -->  00:06:07.599
twitter, or when you watch this
video, you are using computer network!

61

00:06:08.960  -->  00:06:15.671
Okay I hope you now understand what is computer
network and how computer network can help us.

62

00:06:16.124  -->  00:06:21.316
In the next video, we are going to
learn about the most simple computer network.

63

00:06:21.433  -->  00:06:24.537
Thankyou for watching
and see you on the next video!
