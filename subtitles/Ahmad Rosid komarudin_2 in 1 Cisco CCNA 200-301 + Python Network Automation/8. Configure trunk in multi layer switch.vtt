00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:05.411
In the previous video, we have created new
topology for room 3.

2

00:00:05.887  -->  00:00:12.377
Now in this video, we are going to connecting
room 3 with room 1 and room 2.

3

00:00:12.760  -->  00:00:14.286
Let’s just start.

4

00:00:14.722  -->  00:00:19.203
Let’s connecting between switch room 2 to
switch room 3.

5

00:00:20.300  -->  00:00:25.372
Remember that interface between switch should
be configured as trunk.

6

00:00:25.821  -->  00:00:36.151
So here in the switch room 2, interface fa0/7
will become trunk, and in the switch room 3

7

00:00:36.151  -->  00:00:40.244
interface fa0/5 will become trunk.

8

00:00:40.878  -->  00:00:43.475
Let’s start with switch room 2.

9

00:00:44.493  -->  00:00:47.509
Enable, configure terminal.

10

00:00:48.000  -->  00:00:53.301
Interface fa0/7, switchport mode trunk.

11

00:00:55.045  -->  00:00:58.474
Next let’s configure switch room 3.

12

00:00:58.949  -->  00:01:05.687
Let’s go to interface fa0/5, and then switchport
mode trunk.

13

00:01:07.326  -->  00:01:13.929
Okay here we get an error “command rejected,
an interface whose trunk encapsulation is

14

00:01:13.929  -->  00:01:17.598
auto can not be configured to trunk mode”

15

00:01:18.669  -->  00:01:23.210
So here we failed to configure this interface
become trunk.

16

00:01:24.253  -->  00:01:32.545
Before we talk about this, let’s talk about
protocol in trunk, actually we have two protocol

17

00:01:32.545  -->  00:01:40.043
in trunk, which is ISL and 802.1q.

18

00:01:42.924  -->  00:01:52.045
ISL is cisco proprietary, this is means that
ISL is only used if cisco switch meet with

19

00:01:52.045  -->  00:01:53.122
cisco switch.

20

00:01:53.823  -->  00:01:59.211
If cisco switch meet with others vendors,
we can not use ISL.

21

00:02:00.202  -->  00:02:03.711
But now ISL is no longer used.

22

00:02:03.803  -->  00:02:07.512
I never see the implementation of ISL.

23

00:02:08.107  -->  00:02:12.183
But 802.1q is open standard.

24

00:02:12.580  -->  00:02:16.433
This is means that all vendors can use this
protocol.

25

00:02:16.975  -->  00:02:20.939
And this is the protocol that we will use
in trunk.

26

00:02:22.300  -->  00:02:33.554
In the switch 2960, it’s only support 802.1q.
switch 2960 not support ISL.

27

00:02:34.206  -->  00:02:40.256
So remember that switch 2960 is no longer
support for ISL.

28

00:02:40.944  -->  00:02:48.000
This is why when we type switchport mode trunk,
there is no error, because the switch only

29

00:02:48.000  -->  00:02:50.559
support 802.1q.

30

00:02:51.206  -->  00:03:00.000
But when we configure switchport mode trunk
in switch 3560, we got an error, this is because

31

00:03:00.246  -->  00:03:07.582
switch 3560 is still support for ISL and 802.1q.

32

00:03:08.586  -->  00:03:14.703
So before configuring mode trunk, we need
to specify which protocol we want to use.

33

00:03:15.536  -->  00:03:22.657
Absolutely we want to use 802.1q. because
ISL is no longer used.

34

00:03:23.490  -->  00:03:30.681
So here before switchport mode trunk, we need
a command to specify the protocol we will use

35

00:03:31.196  -->  00:03:36.237
the command is switchport trunk encapsulation
dot1q.

36

00:03:40.479  -->  00:03:44.057
And then here we can type switchport mode trunk.

37

00:03:44.929  -->  00:03:46.480
Okay we have done.

38

00:03:46.943  -->  00:03:48.498
Now let’s verify it.

39

00:03:48.842  -->  00:03:50.561
Do show interface trunk.

40

00:03:51.209  -->  00:03:58.376
Okay here we can see that now we have interface
trunk, which is fa0/5.

41

00:03:59.222  -->  00:04:01.835
Let’s also check in the switch room 2.

42

00:04:04.795  -->  00:04:06.491
Do show interface trunk.

43

00:04:07.179  -->  00:04:15.862
Okay here we have 2 interface trunk, which
is fa0/5 that connected to switch room 1 and

44

00:04:15.862  -->  00:04:20.517
fa0/7 that connected to switch room 3.

45

00:04:21.297  -->  00:04:26.171
Now let’s ping between pc in the same vlan
but different room.

46

00:04:26.620  -->  00:04:33.410
Let’s start from pc vlan 10 in the room
3 to the pc vlan 10 in the room 2.

47

00:04:34.190  -->  00:04:37.143
Here we can see that the result is success.

48

00:04:37.936  -->  00:04:44.611
Now let’s try from pc vlan 10 room 3 to
the pc vlan 10 room 1.

49

00:04:45.298  -->  00:04:49.273
Okay here we can see that the result is also
success.

50

00:04:49.590  -->  00:04:52.428
Next let’s try for vlan 20.

51

00:04:52.917  -->  00:04:57.068
From room 1 vlan 20 to the room 3 vlan 20.

52

00:04:57.874  -->  00:05:00.361
Okay here the result is success.

53

00:05:01.167  -->  00:05:06.680
From room 3 to the room2, here the result
is also success.

54

00:05:07.909  -->  00:05:11.868
Okay so now we have done configuring trunk
in all switch.

55

00:05:12.225  -->  00:05:18.100
So between pc in the same vlan but different
room can communicate each others.

56

00:05:19.329  -->  00:05:21.319
I think enough for this video.

57

00:05:21.372  -->  00:05:24.749
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
