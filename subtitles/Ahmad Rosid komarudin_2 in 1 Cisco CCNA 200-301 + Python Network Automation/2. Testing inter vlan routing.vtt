00:00:00.289  -->  00:00:07.040
In the previous video, we have done configuring
inter vlan routing. Now in this video,

2

00:00:07.040  -->  00:00:11.186
we are going to configure an ip address for all pc

3

00:00:11.325  -->  00:00:16.115
and test communication between
vlans. Let’s just start.

4

00:00:16.875  -->  00:00:26.061
Let’s start from PC 1, this is vlan 10,
so the ip address will be 192.168.10.2,

5

00:00:26.445  -->  00:00:35.000
and the gateway is 192.168.10.1. Remember
that if the pc want to communicate with

6

00:00:35.000  -->  00:00:42.536
others pc in the different network, the pc
will be need a default gateway like this.

7

00:00:43.519  -->  00:00:58.081
Next let’s configure for PC 2. The ip address will
be 192.168.10.3, and the gateway is 192.168.10.1.

8

00:00:59.489  -->  00:01:10.941
Next let’s configure this pc, this is in
vlan 1, so the ip address is 192.168.1.2,

9

00:01:11.325  -->  00:01:19.696
and the gateway is 192.168.1.1, which
is the router address for vlan 1.

10

00:01:20.429  -->  00:01:33.176
Next here, this is vlan 30. The ip address is
192.168.30.2, and the gateway is 192.168.30.1.

11

00:01:34.529  -->  00:01:47.416
Next here for vlan 20, the ip address is
192.168.20.2, and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

12

00:01:49.794  -->  00:02:02.761
Next here PC 4, also vlan 20. The ip address is
192.168.20.3, and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

13

00:02:03.839  -->  00:02:09.136
Okay now we have done configuring the ip
address of all pc in the room 1.

14

00:02:09.362  -->  00:02:18.316
Let’s try communicate between pc in the different vlan. But
before that let’s try from pc in the same vlan.

15

00:02:19.199  -->  00:02:28.106
Okay here success. Now let’s try ping different
vlan. Okay here failed, let’s test again,

16

00:02:28.765  -->  00:02:36.306
and here the result is success. So vlan 10
and vlan 20 can communicate each others.

17

00:02:36.874  -->  00:02:44.506
Let’s try from vlan 10 to vlan 30. The first
packet will be failed, let’s test again,

18

00:02:44.867  -->  00:02:55.716
and here also success. Now let’s try from vlan 20 to vlan
1, the first packet is failed, let’s test again,

19

00:02:58.189  -->  00:03:01.531
and here the result is also success.

20

00:03:02.209  -->  00:03:08.366
Okay, so now between pc in the different
vlan can communicate each others.

21

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:14.716
Next let’s configure the ip address
of pc in the room 2 and room 3.

22

00:03:15.379  -->  00:03:25.941
Here vlan 10, the ip address is
192.168.10.4. the gateway is 192.168.10.1.

23

00:03:28.354  -->  00:03:38.041
Next here, the ip address is
192.168.10.5, the gateway is 192.168.10.1.

24

00:03:39.629  -->  00:03:51.801
Next this is vlan 1, the ip address is
192.168.1.3, the gateway is 192.168.1.1,

25

00:03:52.629  -->  00:04:04.776
Next here vlan 30, the ip address is
192.168.30.3, and the gateway is 192.168.30.1

26

00:04:08.559  -->  00:04:19.466
This is vlan 20, the ip address is
192.168.20.4, and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

27

00:04:20.079  -->  00:04:32.406
Next this also vlan 20. The ip address is
192.168.20.5, and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

28

00:04:33.139  -->  00:04:39.469
Okay we have done for room 2. Next let’s configure for room 3.

29

00:04:40.000  -->  00:04:50.671
Here vlan 10, the ip address is
192.168.10.6 and the gateway is 192.168.10.1,

30

00:04:53.549  -->  00:05:04.726
here also vlan 10, the ip address is
192.168.10.7 and the gateway is 192.168.10.1

31

00:05:05.984  -->  00:05:18.331
Next here vlan 20, the ip address is
192.168.20.6 and the gateway is 192.168.20.1.

32

00:05:21.669  -->  00:05:34.121
Here also vlan 20, the ip address is
192.168.20.7 and the gateway is 192.168.20.1

33

00:05:35.469  -->  00:05:43.391
Okay now we have done configuring the ip
address for all pc. Next let’s test ping.

34

00:05:43.835  -->  00:05:48.025
Here let’s test from vlan 20 in the room 1

35

00:05:48.025  -->  00:05:57.116
to vlan 10 room 2. The first packet is failed,
let’s test again, and okay here success.

36

00:05:57.965  -->  00:06:03.921
Now let’s test from vlan
30 room 1 to vlan 20 room 2.

37

00:06:04.589  -->  00:06:13.280
The first packet is failed, let’s test again,
and here success. Next let’s try from vlan 1

38

00:06:13.584  -->  00:06:25.681
room 2 to the vlan 10 room 3. The first packet is
failed, let’s test again. Okay here also success.

39

00:06:26.159  -->  00:06:31.311
Let’s test again from vlan 30
room 2 to the vlan 20 room 3.

40

00:06:32.700  -->  00:06:38.301
The first packet is failed, let’s
test again, and here also success.

41

00:06:39.305  -->  00:06:45.920
Okay now all pc in the different vlan can
communicate each others. This is means our

42

00:06:45.920  -->  00:06:52.480
configuration is success. I think enough
for this video, in the next video we are

43

00:06:52.480  -->  00:06:55.642
going to learn about DHCP server.

44

00:06:56.138  -->  00:06:59.713
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
