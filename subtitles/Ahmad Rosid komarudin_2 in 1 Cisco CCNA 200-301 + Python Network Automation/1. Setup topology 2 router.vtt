00:00:00.475  -->  00:00:05.722
In the previous section, we already learn
about dynamic routing eigrp.

2

00:00:06.381  -->  00:00:11.929
Next in this section, we are going learn about
dynamic routing ospf.

3

00:00:12.783  -->  00:00:18.215
But before that, let’s setup the topology
first, as always,

4

00:00:18.215  -->  00:00:21.372
we will learn ospf with 2 router first.

5

00:00:21.948  -->  00:00:30.216
So here let’s import 2 router, and let’s
also import 2 pc. Let’s change the name,

6

00:00:30.566  -->  00:00:33.836
this is router 2 and this is router 1.

7

00:00:34.700  -->  00:00:39.498
This is pc 2, and this is pc 1.

8

00:00:47.143  -->  00:00:56.066
Let’s connecting router 1 to router 2, router 1
to pc 1, and router 2 to pc 2.

9

00:00:57.000  -->  00:01:09.416
For ip addressing, here router 1, the ip address
is 10.10.10.1/24, here 10.10.10.2/24,

10

00:01:11.351  -->  00:01:22.388
router 1 that connected to pc 1 is 192.168.1.1/24, pc1
192.168.1.2/24,

11

00:01:24.662  -->  00:01:35.384
router 2 that connected to pc2 is 192.168.2.1/24, and pc2 192.168.2.2/24.

12

00:01:36.516  -->  00:01:44.091
Okay now let’s configure the ip address
on all router and pc. Let’s start with router 1.

13

00:01:47.446  -->  00:02:00.565
No, enable, configure terminal, let’s start
with fa0/0, so interface fa0/0, no shutdown,

14

00:02:01.192  -->  00:02:08.418
the ip address is 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0,

15

00:02:09.364  -->  00:02:23.432
Next for fa0/1, interface fa0/1, no shutdown,
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0.

16

00:02:24.513  -->  00:02:30.646
Okay now we have done on router 1, next let’s
configure router 2.

17

00:02:31.778  -->  00:02:40.496
No, enable, configure terminal, let’s start
with fa0/0, interface fa0/0, no shutdown,

18

00:02:41.957  -->  00:02:56.605
ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.0, next
for fa0/1, interface fa0/1, no shutdown,

19

00:02:58.138  -->  00:03:04.466
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0

20

00:03:05.784  -->  00:03:12.935
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
on router 1 and router 2, next let’s configure

21

00:03:12.935  -->  00:03:24.540
the ip address on pc 1 and pc 2, let’s start
with pc 1, the ip address is 192.168.1.2

22

00:03:26.187  -->  00:03:30.093
and the gateway is 192.168.1.1,

23

00:03:31.060  -->  00:03:43.056
Next for pc 2, the ip address is 192.168.2.2
and the gateway is 192.168.2.1

24

00:03:44.043  -->  00:03:49.184
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
on all router and pc.

25

00:03:49.750  -->  00:03:57.059
I think enough for this video. In the next video, we are going to
configure dynamic routing ospf

26

00:03:57.265  -->  00:04:01.896
so pc 1 and pc 2 will able to communicate each others.

27

00:04:02.503  -->  00:04:06.102
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
