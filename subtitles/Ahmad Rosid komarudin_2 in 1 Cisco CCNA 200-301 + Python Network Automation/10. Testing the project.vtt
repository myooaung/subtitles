00:00:00.680  -->  00:00:04.480
In this video, we are going to test our application.

2

00:00:04.960  -->  00:00:12.040
I already create a topology in gns3 with 3 mikrotik routers and 3 cisco routers.

3

00:00:12.840  -->  00:00:17.000
I already configure The IP Address in all of routers.

4

00:00:17.840  -->  00:00:23.560
I also already add all of devices in gns3
to django admin.

5

00:00:24.740  -->  00:00:33.740
Now let’s try to test our application. Let’s do a configure first. Let’s check all devices,

6

00:00:38.220  -->  00:00:40.980
and then put the mikrotik command here.

7

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:47.480
In this case, we will create a new bridge
interface and configure the ip address to that bridge.

8

00:01:05.440  -->  00:01:13.520
Next. let’s put the cisco command here.
We will create loopback0 and configure an IP Address to that loopback.

9

00:01:18.380  -->  00:01:20.860
Okay let’s submit.

10

00:01:26.580  -->  00:01:33.320
Okay we have done. But if we see here, we
already success in mikrotik device,

11

00:01:34.160  -->  00:01:41.840
but we got an error in cisco devices. For the detail
information, we can see in the log menu.

12

00:01:44.120  -->  00:01:48.200
Here we can se the message is “time is not defined”.

13

00:01:48.200  -->  00:01:55.160
Let’s go to visual studio code and see whats wrong. Let’s go to configure function.

14

00:01:55.180  -->  00:02:04.100
We can see here that if the device is cisco, we use time function. But we forget to import it.

15

00:02:04.100  -->  00:02:10.620
That’s why we got an error “time is
not defined”. Let’s import it

16

00:02:12.540  -->  00:02:16.400
Now let’s try to configure the cisco device
again.

17

00:02:24.800  -->  00:02:26.920
The command is still same,

18

00:02:44.620  -->  00:02:51.840
Okay now we have successfully configure the
cisco device. Let’s do a verify config.

19

00:02:54.580  -->  00:02:56.520
Check all devices,

20

00:03:01.640  -->  00:03:06.800
and in the mikrotik, let’s
put a command “ip address print”,

21

00:03:08.780  -->  00:03:14.420
and in the cisco let’s put command “show ip
interface brief”

22

00:03:23.000  -->  00:03:30.280
Okay, this is the result. We can see that
now we have loopback interface in all of routers.

23

00:03:30.740  -->  00:03:33.380
Let’s take a look in the log menu.

24

00:03:35.500  -->  00:03:40.760
Here we can see that we have a verify_config with success status.

25

00:03:43.640  -->  00:03:46.380
Let’s also take a look in the home.

26

00:03:48.680  -->  00:03:52.280
Here we can see the last 10 event.

27

00:03:52.600  -->  00:03:57.260
Okay.  Now Our project is done, and running
well!
