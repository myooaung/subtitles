00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:06.120
In this video, we are going to learn how to
connect the mikrotik router and Cisco router

2

00:00:06.140  -->  00:00:14.920
to our computer. If we look at this topology,
note that the computer is connected to a switch,

3

00:00:15.440  -->  00:00:23.600
then the mikrotik and Cisco router are also
connected to the switch. Later we will configure

4

00:00:23.740  -->  00:00:34.800
the ip address 192.168.1.1 on the computer,
192.168.1.2 on the mikrotik, and 192.168.1.3

5

00:00:34.800  -->  00:00:45.120
on cisco. Here we know that mikrotik and cisco
are on gns3, meaning we need to create a virtual

6

00:00:45.220  -->  00:00:55.560
interface on our computer, why? Because gns3
is virtual, so we must make a virtual interface

7

00:00:55.620  -->  00:01:01.480
on our computer to connecting our computer
with router on gns3.

8

00:01:02.660  -->  00:01:13.299
To create a virtual interface, you can enter
start, then type hdwwiz, this stands for hardware

9

00:01:13.300  -->  00:01:32.640
wizard. next, here, chose recommended, next,
next, choose network adapters, , select Microsoft

10

00:01:32.760  -->  00:01:47.940
on the left, and on the right, choose loopback
adapter, next, next, and finish.

11

00:01:48.940  -->  00:01:56.420
After create a virtual interface, we need
to restart our computer. But before that let’s

12

00:01:56.420  -->  00:01:59.760
save our project on gns3 first.

13

00:02:04.340  -->  00:02:12.280
Okay, I'm done restarting my computer. To
prove that our virtual interface is already up

14

00:02:12.280  -->  00:02:20.800
We can enter the open network and sharing
center. Then change adapter settings

15

00:02:22.080  -->  00:02:30.020
here we can see that we have Microsoft loopback
adapter, which is the Local area connection 2

16

00:02:30.030  -->  00:02:37.960
Now let’s configure the ip address for
this interface. According to our topology,

17

00:02:37.960  -->  00:02:42.400
the IP Address is 192.168.1.1.

18

00:02:50.900  -->  00:03:04.120
Next, let’s open our project on gns3. enter
the project library, select our project, then ok

19

00:03:06.940  -->  00:03:14.640
Okay here we see mikrotik and cisco router.
Next we need to import a cloud

20

00:03:15.560  -->  00:03:25.920
the cloud will act as our computer. We also need to
import an Ethernet switch.

21

00:03:27.740  -->  00:03:36.320
Next we need to configure this cloud to act
as our computer. Right click on it, and choose configure

22

00:03:37.460  -->  00:03:42.400
Here we have to check show special
Ethernet interface

23

00:03:43.020  -->  00:03:53.120
Here select local area connection 2, local area connection 2 is our
loopback adapter interface. Then choose add

24

00:03:53.120  -->  00:03:59.280
and okay. Finally, let’s connect the cable
from our computer to the switch

25

00:04:01.600  -->  00:04:14.360
from the switch to the mikrotik, from Cisco to the
switch. Now let’s turn on the mikrotik &amp; cisco router

26

00:04:20.580  -->  00:04:27.520
if the cpu usage reach 100%, we can do auto
idle pc on Cisco router.

27

00:04:36.220  -->  00:04:43.200
Now let’s try to configure the IP address
on the mikrotik and Cisco router, but before

28

00:04:43.200  -->  00:04:49.880
that it is strongly recommended to look at
the interface that is installed on the mikrotik

29

00:04:49.880  -->  00:04:58.420
and Cisco, by clicking this icon, here we
can see that the mikrotik is in Ether 0

30

00:04:58.640  -->  00:05:06.820
but the interface naming on mikrotik router is
started from ethernet1, so ether 0 here means

31

00:05:06.820  -->  00:05:14.360
ether1, then on the cisco, the interface is
fa0 / 0.

32

00:05:14.360  -->  00:05:19.400
Ok, let’s configure the ip address on the
mikrotik router first.

33

00:05:23.380  -->  00:05:38.760
The mikrotik ip address will be 192.168.1.2. Next let’s configure
the ip address on the Cisco router.

34

00:05:42.120  -->  00:05:47.920
The ip address of cisco router will be 192.168.1.3.

35

00:05:57.160  -->  00:06:02.800
Now, let’s try to ping from our computer
to the Mikrotik and Cisco router.

36

00:06:03.000  -->  00:06:13.820
Open the command prompt, let’s ping the mikrotik
first, which is 192.168.1.2, okay it works,

37

00:06:14.460  -->  00:06:27.900
then let’s try ping to the Cisco router.
Okay, it also works. Now we have successfully

38

00:06:27.900  -->  00:06:31.960
connected our computer with Cisco and Mikrotik
routers.

39

00:06:32.740  -->  00:06:39.220
In the next video, we are going to learn how
to configure ssh on mikrotik &amp; cisco.

40

00:06:39.520  -->  00:06:43.160
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video
