00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:04.540
In the previous video, we alredy create a
device models.

2

00:00:04.620  -->  00:00:13.420
Now, in this video, we are going to creat a device list menu. This menu will display all of devices from the database.

3

00:00:13.760  -->  00:00:21.520
Okay let’s just start. Open the visual studio
code. First we need to create a new url.

4

00:00:21.520  -->  00:00:25.320
Open the urls.py file inside our app.

5

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:32.620
Here let’s create a new url, let’s say devices.

6

00:00:33.780  -->  00:00:39.240
This url will be redirected to devices function
inside views.

7

00:00:40.340  -->  00:00:45.080
Next, we need to create device function inside
views.py.

8

00:00:56.120  -->  00:01:00.860
We need to create a variable to save all devices from the database.

9

00:01:09.380  -->  00:01:12.280
Let’s use this variable as a context.

10

00:01:21.920  -->  00:01:25.760
We will return a template file devices.html,

11

00:01:30.240  -->  00:01:32.360
and don’t forget to use the context

12

00:01:32.380  -->  00:01:34.320
in the return statement.

13

00:01:36.100  -->  00:01:45.780
Last, we need to create a devices.html file. I already upload devices.html file in the resource section.

14

00:01:45.800  -->  00:01:51.380
So you can just download
it and put the file to the template directory.

15

00:01:53.820  -->  00:02:02.060
Okay now we have devices.html in the templates
directory. Let’s understand the code here.

16

00:02:02.120  -->  00:02:09.780
First we extend from base.html. In the block
content, we have a table.

17

00:02:11.320  -->  00:02:17.200
We have a looping statement here. We need
to change this variable with our context,

18

00:02:17.200  -->  00:02:25.460
in this case, the name of our context is all_device.
Here we display ip address, hostname, and

19

00:02:25.460  -->  00:02:27.540
vendor of each device.

20

00:02:28.080  -->  00:02:36.960
Let’s go to the browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/devices.

21

00:02:38.300  -->  00:02:44.740
Here we can see that we have successfully get the list of device from the database.

22

00:02:44.740  -->  00:02:48.940
To make sure, let’s create 1 new device
in the database.

23

00:03:03.580  -->  00:03:07.680
Let’s back to the device list menu, refresh.

24

00:03:08.840  -->  00:03:14.420
And here we are ! Now we
can see 1 new device that we just created.

25

00:03:14.420  -->  00:03:18.260
This is mean that our device list menu is
work!

26

00:03:18.420  -->  00:03:24.620
This is the end of this video, in the next
video, we are going to create a Configure Menu

27

00:03:24.760  -->  00:03:27.940
Thankyou for watching and see you on
the next video!
