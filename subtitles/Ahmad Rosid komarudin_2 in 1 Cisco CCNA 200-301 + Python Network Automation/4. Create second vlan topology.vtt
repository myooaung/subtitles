00:00:00.461  -->  00:00:04.145
In the previous video, we already learn about
vlan.

2

00:00:04.813  -->  00:00:09.000
Next in this video we are going to learn about
trunk.

3

00:00:09.656  -->  00:00:11.338
So what is trunk?

4

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:19.234
We will about learn trunk by doing, but before
that, we need to create another topology first.

5

00:00:19.842  -->  00:00:24.970
Here let’s add one more switch, and then
add some pc,

6

00:00:26.306  -->  00:00:29.291
let’s say here we will need 4 pc.

7

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:36.307
But here I just add 2 new pc, and bring this
2 pc here.

8

00:00:37.297  -->  00:00:48.608
Let’s also change the name of the PC. Here
the last is pc 4, so this is pc 5, pc 6, pc 7,

9

00:00:48.608  -->  00:00:50.714
and this is pc 8.

10

00:00:51.943  -->  00:00:58.026
Okay now here we will configure this new switch
exactly same with the old switch.

11

00:00:59.648  -->  00:01:08.144
So here we will configure pc 5 and pc 6 to vlan
10, and pc 7 and pc 8 to vlan 20.

12

00:01:08.979  -->  00:01:15.471
Before configure the vlan, let’s change
the name of the switch first, this is switch 1

13

00:01:15.471  -->  00:01:17.501
and this is switch 2.

14

00:01:18.323  -->  00:01:21.485
Now let’s configure the vlan in switch 2.

15

00:01:22.273  -->  00:01:31.455
Here we can see fa0/1 and fa0/2, so this two
interface will be in the vlan 10.

16

00:01:31.777  -->  00:01:41.214
And here we have fa0/3 and fa0/4, this two
interface will be in the vlan 20.

17

00:01:42.275  -->  00:01:43.678
Okay let’s start.

18

00:01:44.465  -->  00:01:50.185
Enable, configure terminal, and then create
the vlan.

19

00:01:51.103  -->  00:01:57.479
Vlan 10, the name is accounting, next let’s
create for vlan 20.

20

00:01:58.064  -->  00:02:01.960
Vlan 20, and then the name is marketing.

21

00:02:03.000  -->  00:02:06.600
Let’s see the vlan, show vlan brief.

22

00:02:08.281  -->  00:02:12.787
Okay here we can see that we have vlan 10
and vlan 20,

23

00:02:13.240  -->  00:02:16.905
but all of interface is still in vlan 1.

24

00:02:17.752  -->  00:02:25.473
Next, let’s assign interface fa0/1 and fa0/2
to vlan 10.

25

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:36.632
Interface range fa0/1-2 . In the previous
video, I show you how to assign interface

26

00:02:36.632  -->  00:02:38.636
to vlan one by one.

27

00:02:39.185  -->  00:02:49.883
So we go to interface fa0/1, assign the interface
to vlan 10, then go to interface fa0/2 and

28

00:02:49.883  -->  00:02:53.026
assign the interface again to vlan 10.

29

00:02:53.742  -->  00:02:59.822
But now, here I show you how to assign multiple
interface to a vlan at once,

30

00:02:59.822  -->  00:03:03.000
here we can use range.

31

00:03:03.613  -->  00:03:11.557
So interface range fa0/1-2, then switchport
mode access,

32

00:03:13.191  -->  00:03:16.730
and finally switchport access vlan 10.

33

00:03:17.720  -->  00:03:25.552
This is means that we assign interface fa0/1
and fa0/2 to vlan 10.

34

00:03:25.719  -->  00:03:27.207
Now let’s verify it.

35

00:03:27.577  -->  00:03:36.452
Here we can see that now
interface fa0/1 and fa0/2 is already in the vlan 10.

36

00:03:37.485  -->  00:03:41.513
Next let’s assign the interface for vlan
20.

37

00:03:42.181  -->  00:03:53.655
Interface range fa0/3-4, switchport mode access,
and then switchport access vlan 20.

38

00:03:54.239  -->  00:03:55.559
Let’s verify it.

39

00:03:57.992  -->  00:04:07.408
Okay here we can see that interface fa0/3
and fa0/4 is already in the vlan 20.

40

00:04:08.649  -->  00:04:15.620
Next let’s configure the ip address of all
pc. In this case, we will configure the ip

41

00:04:15.620  -->  00:04:18.687
address of all vlan with same block subnet.

42

00:04:19.355  -->  00:04:25.780
But always remember that in the production,
each vlan must be use different block subnet.

43

00:04:26.591  -->  00:04:30.739
Here I use same block subnet for all vlan
just for learning.

44

00:04:31.896  -->  00:04:37.931
Okay here pc 5 the ip address is 192.168.1.5,

45

00:04:38.909  -->  00:04:54.724
pc 6 the ip address is 192.168.1.6, pc 7 the ip address
is 192.168.1.7 and last pc 8 the ip address

46

00:04:54.724  -->  00:04:58.371
is 192.168.1.8.

47

00:04:59.659  -->  00:05:01.491
Okay now we have done.

48

00:05:01.932  -->  00:05:06.136
For the testing, let’s send packet between
pc in the same vlan.

49

00:05:08.271  -->  00:05:09.666
Okay here success.

50

00:05:10.024  -->  00:05:12.898
So between pc in the vlan 10 is ok.

51

00:05:13.363  -->  00:05:16.185
Next let’s test for vlan 20.

52

00:05:16.877  -->  00:05:19.046
Okay here also success.

53

00:05:20.048  -->  00:05:26.173
Okay I think enough for this video, in the
next video, we are going to learn about trunk.

54

00:05:26.531  -->  00:05:29.900
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video.
