00:00:00.616  -->  00:00:04.863
In this section, we are going to learn about
port security.

2

00:00:06.287  -->  00:00:15.880
Port security is used to securing interface in switch. We are going to learn with an example case, let’s just start.

3

00:00:17.616  -->  00:00:28.952
Let’s import 1 switch. We are going to use 2960.
Next let’s import some server, let’s say 3 server.

4

00:00:32.552  -->  00:00:42.728
And then for testing, let’s also import 1 pc. Now
let’s connecting all server and pc to the switch.

5

00:00:48.080  -->  00:00:54.160
Okay done, let’s change the name
of the server, this is server 1,

6

00:00:55.920  -->  00:01:00.056
this is server 2, and this is server 3.

7

00:01:01.408  -->  00:01:10.183
Here we can see that server 1 is connected
to fa0/1, server 2 is connected to fa0/2,

8

00:01:10.663  -->  00:01:24.360
and server 3 is connected to fa0/3. So here we
know that fa0/1 until fa0/3 is used for server.

9

00:01:25.680  -->  00:01:34.616
For example, someday there is a hacker go to
Data Center, so let’s say this computer is hacker.

10

00:01:35.856  -->  00:01:42.752
The hacker unplug the cable from server 1
and then connecting the cable to their computer.

11

00:01:44.640  -->  00:01:51.273
Here let’s unplug the cable from the server
and then connect the cable to the hacker pc.

12

00:01:54.264  -->  00:02:03.640
In this case, switch should block fa0/1, so
the hacker can not send packet to anywhere.

13

00:02:04.560  -->  00:02:11.304
To block fa0/1 if there is an illegal
computer connected to it like this,

14

00:02:11.568  -->  00:02:15.168
we will need to configure
port security on the switch.

15

00:02:16.288  -->  00:02:20.068
Okay so that is the concept of port security.

16

00:02:20.644  -->  00:02:25.092
In the next video we are going to practice about port security.

00:02:25.772  -->  00:02:28.976
