00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:08.120
In this video, we are going to learn about
models in Django. models is used to save the

2

00:00:08.160  -->  00:00:13.720
database information. Each model maps to a
single database table.

3

00:00:13.880  -->  00:00:20.320
Let’s just start coding. Open models.py
file inside app1 directory.

4

00:00:22.940  -->  00:00:26.700
Let’s say we want to create a Friends table.

5

00:00:33.860  -->  00:00:37.940
This table
will save the name &amp; the age of our friends.

6

00:00:38.480  -->  00:00:40.560
The type of name will be CharFields. When
we use CharFields, we need to define max_length.

7

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:52.520
For the age, we will use IntegerField.

8

00:00:58.900  -->  00:01:07.140
After create a models, we need to makemigrations
and migrate our Django project. Open the command prompt

9

00:01:07.480  -->  00:01:17.780
stop the project by use a combination
key ctrl+c, and then type python manage.py makemigrations

10

00:01:24.560  -->  00:01:28.180
and then python manage.py
migrate.

11

00:01:33.340  -->  00:01:39.600
Okay our database is created successfully.
Let’s Start the project again.

12

00:01:44.840  -->  00:01:48.780
Let’s see that our project still working in browser.

13

00:01:55.680  -->  00:01:59.020
Okay, all of page is still working.

14

00:01:59.960  -->  00:02:06.780
Now I will show you about admin page in Django. This is admin page.

15

00:02:06.940  -->  00:02:13.860
In this page, we can manage our database,
include a Friends database that we just created.

16

00:02:14.580  -->  00:02:22.380
But we don’t have a username &amp; password
yet. Let’s create it first. Open the command prompt

17

00:02:23.300  -->  00:02:29.860
stop the project, and type python
manage.py createsuperuser.

18

00:02:35.540  -->  00:02:45.760
Here we can type your username, for email address, you can
leave it blank. Type your secure password.

19

00:02:47.080  -->  00:02:53.720
If your password is not secure, you will get
a warning like this. In this case, I will

20

00:02:53.720  -->  00:02:57.680
ignore the warning and bypass the password
validation.

21

00:02:58.700  -->  00:03:01.860
Okay, now we have a user.

22

00:03:01.860  -->  00:03:04.520
Don’t forget to run the project again.

23

00:03:09.400  -->  00:03:17.740
Now let’s back to the browser and try to
login to Django admin page using a user that we just created

24

00:03:20.640  -->  00:03:25.840
Good ! Now we are successful
login to Django admin page

25

00:03:26.380  -->  00:03:29.900
but we can’t find Friends database here.

26

00:03:30.920  -->  00:03:37.900
To display friends database to the Django admin
page, we need to register the friend database first.

27

00:03:38.800  -->  00:03:48.680
Open visual studio code and go to admin.py
file, here we need to register our friends database

28

00:03:49.180  -->  00:03:52.600
Firstly import the Friends from
models

29

00:03:56.100  -->  00:03:58.180
and then register it.

30

00:04:14.220  -->  00:04:17.660
Now let’s open Django admin page again.

31

00:04:20.360  -->  00:04:24.680
Here we can see that now we have friends database.

32

00:04:25.100  -->  00:04:28.040
Let’s add some friends to the database.

33

00:04:38.280  -->  00:04:46.480
Okay we have some friends here, but the display
will be Friend object 1, 2, 3 like this.

34

00:04:47.060  -->  00:04:52.500
We want to display the name of our friends instead
just friend object like this.

35

00:04:52.940  -->  00:04:58.380
Open visual studio code again and go to models.py file

36

00:05:02.480  -->  00:05:05.980
we need to create def str like this

37

00:05:09.640  -->  00:05:11.620
and return the name.

38

00:05:14.280  -->  00:05:17.220
Let’s look at Django admin page again.

39

00:05:22.140  -->  00:05:26.420
Cool !
Now we can see the name of our friends.

40

00:05:28.160  -->  00:05:33.400
This is the end of this video. In the next
video, we are going to learn how to display

41

00:05:33.400  -->  00:05:36.400
all of our friend to the hello_world page.

42

00:05:36.400  -->  00:05:39.520
