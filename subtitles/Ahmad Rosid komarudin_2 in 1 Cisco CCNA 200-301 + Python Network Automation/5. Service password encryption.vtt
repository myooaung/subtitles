00:00:00.730  -->  00:00:07.080
In the previous video, we already learn about
some basic command of cisco.

2

00:00:07.080  -->  00:00:13.559
One of command that we already learn is enable
password and enable secret.

3

00:00:13.559  -->  00:00:20.449
If you remember, the enable password command
is not secure, this is because the password

4

00:00:20.449  -->  00:00:24.810
is shown clearly when we show running-config.

5

00:00:24.810  -->  00:00:30.460
But the enable secret is secure, because the
password is encrypted.

6

00:00:30.460  -->  00:00:39.100
Let’s see in the router, here we can see
that the password of enable secret is encrypted.

7

00:00:39.100  -->  00:00:48.289
Okay now let’s go to the switch, and here
we are going to configure enable password,

8

00:00:48.289  -->  00:00:54.590
here when we go to privilege mode, we don’t
need to type any password.

9

00:00:54.590  -->  00:00:57.269
This is means that the password is not configured
yet.

10

00:00:57.269  -->  00:01:03.339
Okay, go to configuration mode.

11

00:01:03.339  -->  00:01:06.860
And then here we will configure the password.

12

00:01:06.860  -->  00:01:12.750
Enable password, and then the password let’s
say 123.

13

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:17.580
Now let’s exit, and then show run.

14

00:01:17.580  -->  00:01:21.570
Here we can see that the password is 123.

15

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:27.390
Once again, the password of enable password
will not encrypted like this.

16

00:01:27.390  -->  00:01:30.750
So actually this is not secure.

17

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:38.920
There is a command in cisco that we can use
to encrypt unencrypted password like this.

18

00:01:38.920  -->  00:01:45.970
Okay let’s try, go to global configuration
mode again, and here let’s type service

19

00:01:45.970  -->  00:01:49.040
password-encryption.

20

00:01:49.040  -->  00:01:56.030
Okay now let’s try to show run again, remember
to use do.

21

00:01:56.030  -->  00:02:00.150
Here we can see that the password is encrypted.

22

00:02:00.150  -->  00:02:02.970
But actually we can decrypt this easily.

23

00:02:02.970  -->  00:02:10.950
Let’s try to decrypt this, copy the encrypted
password.

24

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:14.629
And We can googling cisco password decrypt.

25

00:02:14.629  -->  00:02:21.629
Let’s choose the first one.

26

00:02:21.629  -->  00:02:28.099
And here we can just paste the encrypted password.

27

00:02:28.099  -->  00:02:33.049
Okay here we can see that we can decrypt the
password easily.

28

00:02:33.049  -->  00:02:36.829
The password is 123.

29

00:02:36.829  -->  00:02:43.400
Okay so the conclusion is, we can encrypt
the password of enable password with service

30

00:02:43.400  -->  00:02:45.290
password-encryption.

31

00:02:45.290  -->  00:02:51.499
But the encrypted password is very weak, this
is means that we can decrypt the password

32

00:02:51.499  -->  00:02:53.709
easily.

33

00:02:53.709  -->  00:03:01.450
That is why, the best practice is to use enable
secret rather than enable password.

34

00:03:01.450  -->  00:03:06.620
Because the encrypted password of enable secret
is very strong.

35

00:03:06.620  -->  00:03:09.340
Okay I think enough for this video.

36

00:03:09.340  -->  00:03:14.409
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next
video!
