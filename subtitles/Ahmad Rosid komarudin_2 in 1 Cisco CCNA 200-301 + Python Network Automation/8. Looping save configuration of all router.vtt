00:00:00.580  -->  00:00:07.546
In the previous video, we have done looping to
do configuration on multiple router at once.

2

00:00:08.202  -->  00:00:13.895
Next in this video, we are going
to learn about write configuration.

3

00:00:14.530  -->  00:00:20.413
Remember that in cisco, the
configuration is not saved automatically.

4

00:00:21.000  -->  00:00:22.371
Let’s check here,

5

00:00:26.821  -->  00:00:30.666
do show ip interface brief exclude unassign.

6

00:00:32.050  -->  00:00:39.272
Here we can see that we have loopback0 until
2, but we don’t save this configuration yet.

7

00:00:40.034  -->  00:00:48.089
If the router is suddenly restart or shutdown,
the configuration will be gone. Let’s try,

8

00:00:48.514  -->  00:00:52.467
stop the router, and then start again.

9

00:01:00.265  -->  00:01:06.472
Let’s see the interface again, do show
ip interface brief exclude unassign.

10

00:01:08.892  -->  00:01:18.106
Here we can see that loopback0 until
3 is gone. But fa0/0 is not gone,

11

00:01:18.610  -->  00:01:27.256
why? This is because we already save the
configuration after configuring fa0/0,

12

00:01:27.996  -->  00:01:35.823
so the last time we save the configuration
is after configuring fa0/0 and ssh.

13

00:01:36.543  -->  00:01:42.211
After configuring loopback0 until 3,
we don’t save the configuration yet.

14

00:01:42.728  -->  00:01:53.043
This is why loopback0 until 3 is gone. But
configuration on fa0/0 and ssh is not gone.

15

00:01:54.720  -->  00:02:05.002
Let’s check it, ssh cisco@10.10.10.5,
this is the ip address of router 5,

16

00:02:05.608  -->  00:02:14.501
Okay this is success, so the configuration
on fa0/0 and ssh is still exists.

17

00:02:15.263  -->  00:02:20.021
But the configuraiton of
loopback0 until 2 is gone.

18

00:02:20.960  -->  00:02:29.052
Okay, so now, let’s add the script to save the
configuration. So here after configuring the

19

00:02:29.052  -->  00:02:36.653
loopback, let’s save the configuration
Here let’s add the command, do write.

20

00:02:41.040  -->  00:02:50.423
Change the interface, let’s configure
loopback3, the ip address is 10.4.1.x, save.

21

00:02:51.465  -->  00:02:53.891
Let’s execute the script again.

22

00:03:00.063  -->  00:03:02.120
Just enter enter here.

23

00:03:04.585  -->  00:03:11.600
Okay here we can see that we in router 1,
we success to save the configuration,

24

00:03:12.118  -->  00:03:16.639
but in router 2, we are not
success to save the configuration,

25

00:03:19.141  -->  00:03:26.666
router 3 success, router 4 success,
router 5 is also not success.

26

00:03:27.318  -->  00:03:33.148
This is because we forget to
use time sleep after do write.

27

00:03:33.768  -->  00:03:40.232
Let’s put time sleep here, let’s say
we will stop the program for 2 second.

28

00:03:41.040  -->  00:03:49.078
Save, execute the script again, enter enter here.

29

00:03:54.366  -->  00:03:58.702
Router 1 is success, so here configuring loopback,

30

00:04:01.427  -->  00:04:06.914
do write is success, and we can
see the result of show interface.

31

00:04:07.608  -->  00:04:14.880
router 2 is still failed to save the
configuration. Router 3 is also failed, router 4 is

32

00:04:14.880  -->  00:04:26.198
success, router 5 is also failed. And also the show
is not success. so the time sleep is not enough.

33

00:04:26.894  -->  00:04:32.089
Let’s edit the script again, let’s change
this become 3, and then in the show interface,

34

00:04:32.450  -->  00:04:42.000
let’s change this to 1, save, execute
the script again, enter enter here.

35

00:04:46.800  -->  00:04:58.616
Router 1 is success, router 2 is
success, router 3 is success,

36

00:05:00.601  -->  00:05:02.523
router4 is success,

37

00:05:06.000  -->  00:05:09.271
and router 5 is also success.

38

00:05:10.067  -->  00:05:14.152
Okay so now we are success
to save the configuration.

39

00:05:15.814  -->  00:05:25.739
Let’s check it, let’s say router 5, show
ip interface brief exclude unassign.

40

00:05:28.434  -->  00:05:31.390
Here we can see that we have loopback3,

41

00:05:31.852  -->  00:05:38.080
Shutdown the router, and then start again.

42

00:05:46.737  -->  00:05:54.725
Now let’s check the interface again, do
show ip interface brief exclude unassign.

43

00:05:57.090  -->  00:06:01.030
Here we can see that the loopback3 is still exist.

44

00:06:01.688  -->  00:06:04.889
Okay I think enough for this video.

45

00:06:04.889  -->  00:06:08.650
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
