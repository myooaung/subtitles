00:00:00.440  -->  00:00:05.595
In the previous video, we already learn how
to find the best prefix we can use in the

2

00:00:05.595  -->  00:00:06.631
computer network.

3

00:00:07.377  -->  00:00:14.051
Here we have 100 computers, and we know from
the previous video that the best prefix for

4

00:00:14.051  -->  00:00:17.177
100 computers is /25.

5

00:00:18.092  -->  00:00:23.486
Now, in this video, we are going to determine
which IP Address we will use.

6

00:00:24.473  -->  00:00:30.126
In the previous video, I also already tell
you about Public and Private IP Address.

7

00:00:30.500  -->  00:00:36.232
And we need to remember that we must use
Private IP Address in the local network.

8

00:00:36.798  -->  00:00:41.925
Here is the range of Private IP Address, we
are free to use which range.

9

00:00:42.346  -->  00:00:50.890
we can use 10, or 172.16 or 192.168, we
can use whatever we want.

10

00:00:51.371  -->  00:00:55.933
In this case, I want to use 192.168.0.0.

11

00:00:56.571  -->  00:01:01.086
This IP is included in the third range of
Private IP Address.

12

00:01:01.868  -->  00:01:05.918
Now, remember that we need to pay attention
on the last number.

13

00:01:06.351  -->  00:01:09.676
The first third number will never change.

14

00:01:09.976  -->  00:01:12.664
But the last number will be change.

15

00:01:13.254  -->  00:01:18.773
If you remember, the number of IP Address
is between 0 until 255.

16

00:01:19.411  -->  00:01:25.120
So the last number have a chance to change
become 0 until 255.

17

00:01:26.239  -->  00:01:28.218
Okay let’s start learning.

18

00:01:28.928  -->  00:01:31.807
In this case we will search for several thing.

19

00:01:31.987  -->  00:01:38.882
Which is Total IP, Subnetmask, IP Network,
IP Broadcast, and IP Range.

20

00:01:39.604  -->  00:01:42.337
We will learn about all of this one by one.

21

00:01:42.914  -->  00:01:45.508
First let’s search for the total IP.

22

00:01:45.869  -->  00:01:53.563
We already learn about this, to find the total
IP is 2 to the power of 32 minus prefix,

23

00:01:53.876  -->  00:02:04.622
in this case, the prefix is /25, 32 minus 25
is 7, and 2 to the power of 7 is 128.

24

00:02:05.332  -->  00:02:09.822
So the total IP for prefix /25 is 128.

25

00:02:10.869  -->  00:02:16.697
If you forget about the powers, I recommend
you to always write it, so 2 to the power

26

00:02:16.697  -->  00:02:19.568
of 1 until 2 to the power of 8.

27

00:02:20.266  -->  00:02:25.203
Later, if you get used to this, you will never
need to write the powers again.

28

00:02:26.009  -->  00:02:30.433
You will able to calculate subnetting without
even writing anything.

29

00:02:31.179  -->  00:02:36.256
So don’t worry to write everything if you
just start learning about computer network.

30

00:02:37.242  -->  00:02:43.488
Okay, now we know that the total IP for prefix
/25 is 128.

31

00:02:44.065  -->  00:02:46.948
Next we are going to find the subnetmask.

32

00:02:47.321  -->  00:02:51.732
But before that, we will learn about what
is subnetmask first.

33

00:02:52.237  -->  00:02:56.215
Actually, the function of subnetmask is same
as prefix.

34

00:02:56.853  -->  00:03:04.267
Some vendor will need prefix when configure
an IP Address, but some vendor will need subnetmask.

35

00:03:06.168  -->  00:03:08.192
Let’s say we have mikrotik.

36

00:03:09.467  -->  00:03:13.772
In Mikrotik we will need prefix when configuring
IP Address.

37

00:03:14.229  -->  00:03:21.000
But in cisco, we don’t need prefix, we need
subnetmask when configuring IP Address.

38

00:03:21.881  -->  00:03:30.659
Another example, in windows, we need subnetmask,
but in linux, some times we will use prefix

39

00:03:30.659  -->  00:03:32.383
rather than subnetmask.

40

00:03:32.805  -->  00:03:36.154
But some time we also use subnetmask in linux.

41

00:03:36.768  -->  00:03:41.217
The point is, that the function of subnetmask
is same as prefix.

42

00:03:41.530  -->  00:03:46.319
Some vendor using prefix, but some vendor
using subnetmask.

43

00:03:46.848  -->  00:03:49.382
Now let’s see in cisco packet tracer.

44

00:03:49.791  -->  00:03:54.690
In the previous video, we already build a
simple computer network like this.

45

00:03:55.171  -->  00:03:57.925
Let’s take a look again to the PC 0.

46

00:03:58.334  -->  00:04:01.706
Go to desktop and then IP Configuration.

47

00:04:02.801  -->  00:04:07.718
Here we can see that when we configure an
IP Address, we will also need to configure

48

00:04:07.718  -->  00:04:08.874
subnetmask.

49

00:04:09.440  -->  00:04:16.699
But here we don’t see any field to put prefix.
So in this case, we will need subnetmask instead

50

00:04:16.699  -->  00:04:18.149
of prefix.

51

00:04:19.124  -->  00:04:22.383
Okay, now you understand what is subnetmask.

52

00:04:22.684  -->  00:04:27.000
Next, let’s calculate subnetmask for prefix
/25.

53

00:04:27.633  -->  00:04:32.069
The formula is 256 minus by Total IP.

54

00:04:34.355  -->  00:04:37.961
In this case, the total IP is 128.

55

00:04:38.851  -->  00:04:46.007
So 256 minus 128, the answer is 128.

56

00:04:46.922  -->  00:04:54.000
If we see in the cisco packet tracer again,
the subnetmask is contains of 4 part of numbers.

57

00:04:54.391  -->  00:05:00.161
In this case the subnetmask is 255.255.255.0.

58

00:05:00.823  -->  00:05:07.077
Well for prefix /25, we already find that
the subnetmask is 128.

59

00:05:07.583  -->  00:05:11.911
This 128 is used in the last number of subnetmask.

60

00:05:12.693  -->  00:05:20.666
So the subnetmask for prefix /25 is 255.255.255.128.

61

00:05:21.809  -->  00:05:26.342
Okay now I hope you understand how to calculate
total IP and subnetmask.

62

00:05:26.751  -->  00:05:32.271
In the next video, we are going to learn about
Network IP, Broadcast IP, and IP Range.

63

00:05:32.849  -->  00:05:35.662
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video!
