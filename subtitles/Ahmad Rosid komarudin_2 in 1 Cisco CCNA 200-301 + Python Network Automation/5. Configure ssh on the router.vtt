00:00:00.680  -->  00:00:06.000
In the previous video we have successfully
connecting mikrotik and Cisco router to our

2

00:00:06.000  -->  00:00:15.400
computer, then in this video we will learn
how to configure SSH on Cisco and mikrotik router

3

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:21.260
so we will able to remote the router
from our computer.

4

00:00:22.280  -->  00:00:30.680
Okay, now let’s configure SSH on Cisco router
first. To configure SSH on Cisco

5

00:00:30.680  -->  00:00:40.320
first we must create a username, in this case we will
create a username cisco and passcword cisco.

6

00:00:41.000  -->  00:00:45.220
Also, we need to set the user privileges to
15.

7

00:00:49.420  -->  00:00:57.680
Then we have to set a domain name, for example,
I will set the domain name to mydomain.local

8

00:01:02.240  -->  00:01:15.120
Next we need to create a key by typing crypto
key generate RSA, use 1024 modulus

9

00:01:17.480  -->  00:01:30.220
Last, go to line vty 0 15, then type Login local
and Exit, login local mean that we need to

10

00:01:30.220  -->  00:01:36.000
use local username &amp; password database to
login to the router by ssh

11

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:43.760
Until now, we have finished configure SSH
on the Cisco router, Now let’s try to remote

12

00:01:43.760  -->  00:01:46.380
the cisco router using SSH,

13

00:01:47.040  -->  00:02:03.640
Open a putty. Type the cisco router address,
then select SSH and Open . Yes, login as cisco,

14

00:02:03.640  -->  00:02:06.640
and the password is cisco.

15

00:02:06.640  -->  00:02:12.520
Oke, now we have successfully remote the cisco
router using ssh,

16

00:02:13.960  -->  00:02:23.280
Okey, we have done with cisco, now let’s
take a look to mikrotik. In the mikrotik,

17

00:02:23.280  -->  00:02:29.440
SSH is active by default, so we don't need
to configure anything.

18

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:43.380
just open a new putty, then type mikrotik
address, choose ssh and open. Yes

19

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:54.100
login as admin, and the password is blank. Okey, we
have successfully remote the mikrotik router

20

00:02:54.100  -->  00:02:55.440
using SSH.

21

00:02:56.580  -->  00:03:02.700
This is the end of this video. In the next
video we will discuss about basic network

22

00:03:02.700  -->  00:03:11.940
automation, so this is the last video in the
lab setup section. Thankyou for watching and

23

00:03:11.940  -->  00:03:13.740
See you on the next video.
