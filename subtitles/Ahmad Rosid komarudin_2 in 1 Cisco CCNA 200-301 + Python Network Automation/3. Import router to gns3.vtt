00:00:08.860  -->  00:00:17.199
If you don't have gns3 installed on your computer
yet, you can download from gns3.com, here

6

00:00:34.070  -->  00:00:41.180
I assume that you already have gns3 installed

00:00:51.240  -->  00:01:05.080
Open the gns3, create a new project, in this
case, I create project1.

10

00:01:10.240  -->  00:01:15.900
To import a mikrotik router and cisco, you
must download the image first.

11

00:01:15.900  -->  00:01:23.180
I have uploaded a mikrotik and cisco image
in the resource section, you can just download it

12

00:01:25.080  -->  00:01:32.380
The chr will be used for mikrotik, and the
another image will be use for cisco.

13

00:01:32.400  -->  00:01:36.340
Now I have those two image in my computer.

14

00:01:36.340  -->  00:01:47.900
Let’s start importing mikrotik &amp; cisco router
to gns3. Go to edit and preference, we will

15

00:01:47.900  -->  00:01:57.580
try to import the Cisco router first, you
can go to IOS router, then choose new, here

16

00:01:57.590  -->  00:02:01.780

before.

17

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:08.440
choose yes.

18

00:02:10.340  -->  00:02:18.380
Then next, We don't need to set anything,
we will use default configuration, so we just

19

00:02:18.380  -->  00:02:22.200
stay next, next, next, until finish.

20

00:02:22.200  -->  00:02:27.840
Okay, now we have successfully import cisco

21

00:02:28.740  -->  00:02:36.940
Next let’s try to import mikrotik router
to gns3, we have to enter the qemu vms menu,

22

00:02:38.320  -->  00:02:47.560
then click new, we get a warning here, but
we can ignore it, enter the name here,

23

00:02:47.560  -->  00:03:02.940

256MB, next, next, here we must select new

26

00:03:19.320  -->  00:03:30.980

can enter the edit menu, then there is a symbol,

27

00:03:30.980  -->  00:03:35.670
select browse, then you can choose as you
like.

28

00:03:35.670  -->  00:03:44.780
Here I will use the router firewall icon ... okay,
okay, and okay.

29

00:03:48.300  -->  00:03:56.220
If we see here, we will see mikrotik and cisco,
we can import our router to the project by

30

00:03:56.220  -->  00:04:09.020
drag and drop, we also import a Cisco, to
turn on the router, we can right-click and

31

00:04:09.020  -->  00:04:24.920
choose start, here we can see the green icon,
which means both of routers are running.

32

00:04:25.420  -->  00:04:30.960
And if we look here, notice that the CPU load
is 100%.

33

00:04:31.320  -->  00:04:38.600
To decrease the cpu usage, we can do it by
right-click on cisco router and then select

34

00:04:38.740  -->  00:04:40.580
auto idle pc.

35

00:04:50.820  -->  00:04:56.440
Here we can see that now the usage of CPU
is decreased.

36

00:04:57.580  -->  00:05:02.460
To console the router, we can just double
click on the router.

37

00:05:02.880  -->  00:05:11.000
Here the terminal will open automatically,
the username for mikrotik is admin, and the

38

00:05:11.000  -->  00:05:12.680
password is blank.

39

00:05:13.480  -->  00:05:17.780
Okey, now we have entered the mikrotik router.

40

00:05:18.680  -->  00:05:30.240
let’s try to enter cisco, here we can also
see that we have entered the Cisco router.
