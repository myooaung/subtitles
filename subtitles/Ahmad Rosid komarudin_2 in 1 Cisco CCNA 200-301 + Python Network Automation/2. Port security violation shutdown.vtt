00:00:00.932  -->  00:00:06.061
In the previous video, we already learn the
concept of port security.

2

00:00:06.940  -->  00:00:12.852
The summary is, port security is used to securing
switch interfaces.

3

00:00:13.720  -->  00:00:21.612
So if one day there is hackers unplug the
cable and connecting the cable to their computer,

4

00:00:21.894  -->  00:00:24.574
the switch interface should be blocked.

5

00:00:25.258  -->  00:00:29.383
So the hackers can not send any packet anywhere.

6

00:00:30.730  -->  00:00:35.306
In this video, we are going to practice about
port security.

7

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:48.059
Let’s just start, open the switch, go to
CLI, enable, configure terminal,

8

00:00:48.894  -->  00:00:57.580
next let’s go to the interface connected to the server 1,
in this case fa0/1,

9

00:00:58.069  -->  00:01:02.250
we will configure port security on fa0/1 first.

10

00:01:03.096  -->  00:01:06.428
Here interface fa0/1.

11

00:01:08.370  -->  00:01:15.883
To configure port security, we need to change
the mode to access first, because by default,

12

00:01:15.883  -->  00:01:26.037
the mode on the switch is dynamic auto, let’s
check it, do show interface fa0/1 switchport,

13

00:01:27.708  -->  00:01:32.450
here we can see that the administrative mode
is dynamic auto.

14

00:01:33.286  -->  00:01:40.682
And remember that we need to change the mode
to access first before configuring port security.

15

00:01:41.474  -->  00:01:44.836
So here, switchport mode access.

16

00:01:46.779  -->  00:01:55.195
Okay next to activate port security, the command
is switchport port-security like this.

17

00:01:56.822  -->  00:02:02.569
Remember that this command is used to activate
port security in this interface.

18

00:02:04.153  -->  00:02:08.309
Next we need to register the mac address of
the server 1.

19

00:02:08.906  -->  00:02:17.095
Go to server 1, config section, and then go
to fa0.

20

00:02:18.060  -->  00:02:20.268
Here we can see a mac address.

21

00:02:20.702  -->  00:02:22.108
Let’s copy this,

22

00:02:24.571  -->  00:02:30.743
Back to the switch, and then let’s register
the mac address of server 1,

23

00:02:31.373  -->  00:02:40.136
the command is switchport port-security mac-address and then
paste the mac address of server 1.

24

00:02:41.428  -->  00:02:50.303
Okay, so now the server or computer that allowed
to connect to fa0/1 is only server 1.

25

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:56.096
This is because we input the mac address of
server 1 here.

26

00:02:57.149  -->  00:03:04.201
Next we need to configure the maximum computer
who are allowed to connect to this interface,

27

00:03:04.863  -->  00:03:15.240
the command is switchport port-security maximimum
1, this is means that only 1 server or computer

28

00:03:15.240  -->  00:03:19.170
who allowed to connect to fa0/1.

29

00:03:20.277  -->  00:03:28.242
Last, we need to configure violation, violation
is an action if there is an illegal computer

30

00:03:28.242  -->  00:03:30.172
connected to the interface.

31

00:03:31.127  -->  00:03:38.937
The command is switchport port-security violation
and then question mark, here we can see that

32

00:03:38.937  -->  00:03:47.787
we have 3 option for violation, which is shutdown,
restrict, and protect.

33

00:03:48.590  -->  00:03:54.697
In this case we are going to use shutdown
first, we will learn about restrict and protect

34

00:03:54.697  -->  00:03:56.223
in the next video.

35

00:03:57.949  -->  00:04:03.479
If we use violation shutdown like this, if
there is an illegal computer connected to

36

00:04:03.479  -->  00:04:08.237
the interface, the interface will be automatically
shutdown.

37

00:04:08.888  -->  00:04:12.847
In packet tracer, the light of cable will
become red.

38

00:04:14.702  -->  00:04:20.794
Okay now we have done configuring port security
on fa0/1.

39

00:04:21.597  -->  00:04:29.227
I think enough for this video, in the next video, we are going to test our port security configuration.

40

00:04:29.672  -->  00:04:33.056
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
