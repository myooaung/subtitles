00:00:00.640  -->  00:00:05.840
In the previous video, we already&nbsp;
learn about how switch and router work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:12.320
The summary is that switch is used to&nbsp;
connecting many computer that in the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:12.320  -->  00:00:19.920
block subnet. And router is used to connecting&nbsp;
many computer that in the different block subnet.

4

00:00:21.440  -->  00:00:28.320
And then, now in this video, we are going to&nbsp;
practice about switch in cisco packet tracer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

5

00:00:29.120  -->  00:00:30.320
Let’s just start!

6

00:00:31.440  -->  00:00:38.640
Let’s import a switch to our project. Go to&nbsp;
network devices, here we can see a router,&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:39.200  -->  00:00:49.040
switch, hub, wireless, and others. Click on&nbsp;
the switch. Here we can use cisco switch 2960.

8

00:00:50.720  -->  00:01:01.280
Next let’s add some pc. Go to end device, and add&nbsp;
some more pc. Let’s say here we want to have 5 pc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

9

00:01:02.480  -->  00:01:07.200
And here we can remove cable between pc0 and pc1.

10

00:01:08.640  -->  00:01:11.840
Now let’s connecting all of the pc to the switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:01:20.320  -->  00:01:23.520
Okay now all of pc already&nbsp;
connected to the switch.

12

00:01:24.400  -->  00:01:31.520
Next let’s configure the ip address of all&nbsp;
pc with the same block subnet. Let’s say&nbsp;&nbsp;

13

00:01:31.520  -->  00:01:37.120
we will use the first block&nbsp;
subnet. Let’s start with pc0,&nbsp;&nbsp;

14

00:01:39.520  -->  00:01:54.400
the ip address is 10.10.10.1, and the&nbsp;
subnetmask is 255.255.255.224. next for pc1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

15

00:01:57.840  -->  00:02:04.160
the Ip address is 10.10.10.2&nbsp;
and the subnetmask is correct.

16

00:02:06.640  -->  00:02:21.840
Okay next for pc2, the ip address is 10.10.10.3&nbsp;
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224.

17

00:02:22.720  -->  00:02:36.800
Next for pc3, the ip address is 10.10.10.4 and the&nbsp;
subnetmask is 255.255.255.224. and last, for pc4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

18

00:02:38.720  -->  00:02:42.160
the ip address is 10.10.10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:02:42.720  -->  00:02:54.320
and the subnetmask is 255.255.255.224. Okay we&nbsp;
have done configuring ip address for all pc.

20

00:02:55.520  -->  00:03:02.240
Now let’s test the connection between&nbsp;
all pc. Here we can test using packet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

21

00:03:03.200  -->  00:03:06.400
Let’s test from pc0 to pc1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22

00:03:14.480  -->  00:03:21.200
Okay here we can see that the result is&nbsp;
successful, here we can see many result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:03:21.200  -->  00:03:32.320
we can just delete it. Now let’s test again&nbsp;
from pc0 to pc1, okay success, from pc1 to pc2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:03:32.320  -->  00:03:42.080
also success, from pc3 to pc4, also&nbsp;
success, and from pc4 to pc5 also success.

25

00:03:43.520  -->  00:03:46.320
Okay so now all pc can communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

26

00:03:46.320  -->  00:03:52.000
each others. This is because all&nbsp;
of pc is in the same block subnet.

27

00:03:53.040  -->  00:03:57.680
For the testing, now let’s&nbsp;
change the ip address of pc4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:03:58.640  -->  00:04:07.120
Let’s say we want to change to 10.10.10.40,&nbsp;
and if we see our calculation before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

29

00:04:08.400  -->  00:04:18.000
10.10.10.40 Is in the second block subnet. so pc4&nbsp;
should not be able to communicate with others pc.

30

00:04:20.080  -->  00:04:28.080
Let’s send packet from pc4 to pc3, here&nbsp;
we can see that the result is failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:04:28.080  -->  00:04:35.760
Now let’s test again from pc4 to&nbsp;
pc2, also failed. From pc4 to pc0,&nbsp;&nbsp;

32

00:04:38.240  -->  00:04:45.760
and this is also failed. Okay, so remember&nbsp;
that switch is used to connecting many pc&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:04:47.360  -->  00:04:53.520
that is in the same block subnet. If there&nbsp;
is a pc that in the different block subnet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

34

00:04:54.160  -->  00:04:57.920
so that pc can not communicate with other pc.

35

00:04:59.440  -->  00:05:03.120
Okay now let’s change the ip address of pc4 again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

36

00:05:04.320  -->  00:05:16.960
let’s change this to 5 again. Let’s try ping from&nbsp;
pc3 to pc4, and okay now the result is success.

37

00:05:18.160  -->  00:05:24.640
Okay I think enough for this video. In the next&nbsp;
video, we are going to practice with router.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38

00:05:25.760  -->  00:05:29.920
Thankyou for watching and&nbsp;
see you on the next video
