00:00:01.528  -->  00:00:06.983
In the previous video, we already learn about
some basic cisco command,

2

00:00:07.250  -->  00:00:12.925
we also already learn how to configure an ip address in the
cisco router.

3

00:00:13.480  -->  00:00:19.209
Next in this video, I will show you how to
save configuration in cisco.

4

00:00:19.809  -->  00:00:21.861
Let’s start with the switch.

5

00:00:22.394  -->  00:00:26.050
Here let’s enable, and then show run.

6

00:00:27.000  -->  00:00:30.169
Okay here we don’t configure anything yet.

7

00:00:30.647  -->  00:00:34.606
For testing, let’s try to configure a hostname.

8

00:00:34.983  -->  00:00:38.660
Let’s say the hostname is sw like this.

9

00:00:39.749  -->  00:00:42.664
Now let’s try to restart the switch.

10

00:00:43.120  -->  00:00:47.223
To restart the switch, we can use command
do reload.

11

00:00:48.212  -->  00:00:55.943
Here we get a question system configuration
has been modified, save, yes or no.

12

00:00:56.287  -->  00:01:03.000
If we choose yes, the configuration will be saved,
but in this case, we will choose no.

13

00:01:03.610  -->  00:01:09.728
Here I want to show you the case how if suddenly
our switch is restarted,

14

00:01:10.150  -->  00:01:13.658
let’s say there is a problem with electricity.

15

00:01:14.058  -->  00:01:16.964
So the switch will be shutdown or restart.

16

00:01:18.214  -->  00:01:26.100
Okay here the booting is done, let’s enter,
and here we can see that the hostname is back

17

00:01:26.100  -->  00:01:27.412
to the default

18

00:01:28.168  -->  00:01:34.565
This is what will be happened if the cisco
devices is suddenly shutdown or restart.

19

00:01:35.065  -->  00:01:37.281
The configuration will be gone.

20

00:01:38.414  -->  00:01:44.780
For another example, let’s try to add a
router, we will not using this one,

21

00:01:44.869  -->  00:01:48.256
because we already have many configuration here.

22

00:01:49.178  -->  00:02:00.564
Okay let’s import a new router, choose no
here, enable to go to privilege mode,

23

00:02:00.564  -->  00:02:04.823
and conf t to go to global configuration mode.

24

00:02:05.723  -->  00:02:13.553
Here let’s configure the hostname, let’s
say the hostname is R, and then let’s also

25

00:02:13.553  -->  00:02:15.388
configure the password.

26

00:02:16.921  -->  00:02:23.125
Here if we try to show run, we can see the
configuration that we already do, which is

27

00:02:23.125  -->  00:02:25.813
hostname and enable secret.

28

00:02:26.268  -->  00:02:31.923
After doing configuration like this, let’s
say suddenly the electricity is down,

29

00:02:32.301  -->  00:02:34.799
so our router must be shutdown right?

30

00:02:35.677  -->  00:02:41.008
Okay let’s try to shutdown the router, here
we can go to physical.

31

00:02:41.286  -->  00:02:44.758
And here we can see on off button.

32

00:02:45.447  -->  00:02:49.562
Let’s click the button, and now the router
is shutdown.

33

00:02:50.040  -->  00:02:54.236
So let’s say now there is a problem with
the electricity.

34

00:02:55.125  -->  00:02:58.082
And then now let’s turn on the router again.

35

00:02:58.816  -->  00:03:04.683
Now let’s go to cli again, here let’s
wait for the booting process.

36

00:03:08.704  -->  00:03:16.204
Okay the booting is done, and now if we see
here, the hostname is back to the default,

37

00:03:16.871  -->  00:03:21.841
and if we try to enable, we don’t need to
input any password.

38

00:03:22.730  -->  00:03:26.370
The configuration that we already do before
is gone.

39

00:03:27.414  -->  00:03:28.196
Why?

40

00:03:28.196  -->  00:03:34.001
This is because the configuration of cisco
devices is not saved by default.

41

00:03:34.679  -->  00:03:38.903
This is why we need to save the cisco configuration.

42

00:03:40.214  -->  00:03:44.811
Now let’s try to learn how to save the cisco
configuration.

43

00:03:45.556  -->  00:03:53.826
For testing, let’s configure the hostname,
let’s say R. Let’s also configure the password.

44

00:03:55.190  -->  00:03:58.027
Okay, now let’s save the configuration.

45

00:03:58.827  -->  00:04:04.104
To save the configuration in cisco, we can
use write command.

46

00:04:04.615  -->  00:04:07.315
Okay now the configuration is saved.

47

00:04:08.103  -->  00:04:12.610
Now let’s shutdown the router, and then
turn on again.

48

00:04:14.299  -->  00:04:18.636
Let’s go to CLI, wait for a second for booting.

49

00:04:22.114  -->  00:04:27.209
And okay here we can see that the configuration
is not gone.

50

00:04:28.009  -->  00:04:35.427
The hostname is still R and if we try to enable,
here we need to input the password.

51

00:04:35.904  -->  00:04:39.828
This is means that the configuration is already
saved.

52

00:04:41.150  -->  00:04:43.502
Okay I think enough for this video

53

00:04:43.613  -->  00:04:47.041
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
