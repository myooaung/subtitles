00:00:00.482  -->  00:00:05.329
In the previous video, we already learn
about sequence number in access list.

2

00:00:05.898  -->  00:00:11.050
Next, in this video, we are going to
learn about named access list.

3

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:18.407
With named access list, we can configure
access list with a name, not only with id.

4

00:00:19.283  -->  00:00:25.103
If you remember, in the previous video,
we configure access list with id 1,

5

00:00:26.606  -->  00:00:36.407
remember that id 1 until 99 is standard access
list and 100 until 199 is extended access list.

6

00:00:37.319  -->  00:00:43.158
Beside using number like this, we can
also configure access list with a name.

7

00:00:43.627  -->  00:00:48.555
absolutely we still able to configure
standard or extended access list

8

00:00:48.555  -->  00:00:56.028
with named access list. In this case, we are going
to learn about named standard access list first.

9

00:00:56.803  -->  00:01:04.179
Okay let’s just start learning about named access
list with an example case. Let’s say we want to

10

00:01:04.179  -->  00:01:12.550
block everything and only permit from vlan 30,
so vlan 10 and 20 to server should be blocked.

11

00:01:13.535  -->  00:01:19.939
Let’s unassign access list 1 first,
let’s see the configuration, do show run,

12

00:01:22.550  -->  00:01:29.277
here in fa0/0, we assign the access
list. Let’s remove this configuration,

13

00:01:31.554  -->  00:01:34.471
no ip access-group 1 out.

14

00:01:35.283  -->  00:01:37.345
Let’s see the configuration again,

15

00:01:39.174  -->  00:01:44.913
okay here there is no access-group
configuration anymore in fa0/0.

16

00:01:45.590  -->  00:01:51.643
But the access list configuration is still
exist. This configuration will not used,

17

00:01:52.051  -->  00:02:00.167
because the access list is not assign to any
interface, let’s try ping from vlan 20 to server,

18

00:02:02.483  -->  00:02:08.082
okay here the ping is success. So
access list 1 is not used anymore.

19

00:02:09.000  -->  00:02:16.518
Let’s also ping from pc0 to the server,
success, from vlan 30 to the server,

20

00:02:16.730  -->  00:02:22.851
also success. Okay so now all pc is
able to ping to the server again.

21

00:02:23.518  -->  00:02:29.183
Now let’s create named access
list to only permit from vlan 30.

22

00:02:30.766  -->  00:02:37.347
If we configure access list with number, we
can just type access-list and then the number,

23

00:02:38.054  -->  00:02:46.167
but if want to configure named access list,
the command is ip and then access list,

24

00:02:46.914  -->  00:02:53.725
Then here we need to define which access list
we want to configure, standard or extended.

25

00:02:54.458  -->  00:02:58.678
In this case, we are going to
configure standard access list.

26

00:02:59.455  -->  00:03:07.443
And then here we need to define the name of access
list. Or actually here we also still can use

27

00:03:07.443  -->  00:03:16.555
a number. Let’s say the name is permit
vlan 30. And then question mark here,

28

00:03:16.790  -->  00:03:22.506
if we configure named access list like
this, we can define a sequence number.

29

00:03:23.079  -->  00:03:26.567
But for now I will not define the sequence number,

30

00:03:26.870  -->  00:03:30.770
so the sequence number will
be created automatically.

31

00:03:31.763  -->  00:03:39.658
The case is to only permit from vlan 30,
so let’s create a rule to permit vlan 30,

32

00:03:40.114  -->  00:03:52.094
so here permit and then the network of
vlan 30, which is 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255.

33

00:03:52.827  -->  00:04:00.150
Let’s see the access list, do show access-list.
Here we can see that we have access list 1,

34

00:04:00.427  -->  00:04:07.318
but this is not used anymore, and then
here we have access list permit vlan 30,

35

00:04:07.990  -->  00:04:12.303
and here we have a rule to permit from vlan 30.

36

00:04:13.203  -->  00:04:21.794
remember that the case is to only permit from
vlan 30, so vlan 10 and vlan 20 should be blocked.

37

00:04:22.550  -->  00:04:30.000
If you remember, I already said that in access
list, there is a default rule to deny any.

38

00:04:30.507  -->  00:04:37.571
So for now from vlan 10 and vlan
20 is already blocked, because here

39

00:04:37.571  -->  00:04:44.807
we only create a rule to permit vlan 30. So
now the access list configuration is done.

40

00:04:45.670  -->  00:04:49.306
Next let’s assign this
access list to the interface,

41

00:04:49.874  -->  00:04:54.942
let’s say we will assign the access list to fa0/0,

42

00:04:57.000  -->  00:05:04.894
So interface fa0/0, ip access-group
and then the name of the access list,

43

00:05:05.418  -->  00:05:07.663
let’s just copy and paste,

44

00:05:08.310  -->  00:05:13.515
And the direction is out.. okay
we have done configuring access

45

00:05:13.515  -->  00:05:18.470
list and assign the access list
to the interface. Let’s test it,

46

00:05:18.919  -->  00:05:30.000
vlan 30 to server, success, vlan 20 to the
server, failed, vlan 10 to the server also failed.

47

00:05:30.327  -->  00:05:33.990
Okay so now we have done
configuring named access list.

48

00:05:34.483  -->  00:05:36.667
I think enough for this video

49

00:05:36.945  -->  00:05:40.214
Thank you for watching and see you on the next video.
