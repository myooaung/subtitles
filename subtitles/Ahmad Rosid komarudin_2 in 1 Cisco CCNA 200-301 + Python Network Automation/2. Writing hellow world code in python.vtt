00:00:01.120  -->  00:00:06.630
in this video, we are going learn how to write
a simple script using python.

2

00:00:06.630  -->  00:00:13.390
Here I will use a visual studio code, you
are free to use your favorite code editor

3

00:00:13.390  -->  00:00:22.110
But if you want to follow me, you can
download visual studio code for free at code.visualstudio.com.

4

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:29.540
Okey, now let’s start writing a simple python
script.

5

00:00:29.540  -->  00:00:36.230
First create a new file, then save the file.

6

00:00:36.230  -->  00:00:42.000
Don't forget to use .py extension, because
this is a python script.

7

00:00:45.600  -->  00:00:52.440
To display a simple word in python, we can
use print keywords, for example we want to

8

00:00:52.449  -->  00:00:56.249
display a “hello world”.

9

00:00:56.249  -->  00:01:03.569
With a very simple script like this, we can
display the “hello world”, okay now save

10

00:01:03.569  -->  00:01:07.500
the file, and then open the command prompt.

11

00:01:07.500  -->  00:01:15.740
go to the directory where we save the python
script, in this case I save it in the document,

12

00:01:17.800  -->  00:01:27.240
try to dir to make sure that the python script
is in this directory, okay we can see the

13

00:01:27.250  -->  00:01:29.710
python script here.

14

00:01:29.710  -->  00:01:37.450
We can run the python script by typing python
script.py, script.py is the name of our file.

15

00:01:37.450  -->  00:01:43.040
When we enter, we will get hello world like
this.

16

00:01:43.040  -->  00:01:48.420
now let’s try to manipulate the script,
let’s add hello python.

17

00:01:53.540  -->  00:02:04.760
Save the file, open the command prompt and
run the script again, here we get hello world

18

00:02:04.770  -->  00:02:06.820
and hello python.

19

00:02:06.820  -->  00:02:12.670
Okay, we have successfully write a simple
script using python.

20

00:02:12.670  -->  00:02:13.670
Congratulations!

21

00:02:13.670  -->  00:02:21.359
in the next video, we will learn how to import
mikrotik &amp; cisco router to gns3.

22

00:02:21.359  -->  00:02:23.939
Thankyou for watching and See you in the next
