00:00:00.447  -->  00:00:06.468
In this section, we are going to learn about
access list, what is access list?

2

00:00:06.940  -->  00:00:12.895
Access list is a policy to accept or block
any packet in the network.

3

00:00:13.671  -->  00:00:17.688
We are going to learn about access list with
an example case.

4

00:00:18.464  -->  00:00:20.750
Let’s create the topology first.

5

00:00:21.439  -->  00:00:31.135
Let’s import 2 router, change the name,
this is router 1 and this is router 2.

6

00:00:32.000  -->  00:00:42.171
And then let’s also import switch, let’s
change the name, this is switch 1

7

00:00:44.000  -->  00:00:46.000
and this is switch 2.

8

00:00:47.695  -->  00:00:56.075
Connecting router 1 to switch 1, router 2 to
switch 2, and router 1 to router 2.

9

00:00:57.003  -->  00:01:06.953
Now let’s also import some pc, let’s say
here we need 6 pc, this will be separated to 3 vlans.

10

00:01:07.331  -->  00:01:10.108
And let’s also import 3 server.

11

00:01:10.855  -->  00:01:21.068
Let’s connecting switch 1 to all pc, and
then connecting switch 2 to all server.

12

00:01:23.892  -->  00:01:46.421
Here we will create 3 vlan for pc. This is
vlan 10, this is vlan 20, and this is vlan 30.

13

00:01:47.239  -->  00:01:50.576
For the server, we will don’t configure
a vlan.

14

00:01:54.000  -->  00:02:07.549
For the ip addressing, vlan 10 will use 192.168.10.0/24,
vlan 20 will use 192.168.20.0/24,

15

00:02:07.932  -->  00:02:13.263
and vlan 30 will use 192.168.30.0/24.

16

00:02:14.996  -->  00:02:21.198
For the server, let’s say we will use 192.168.1.0/24.

17

00:02:22.758  -->  00:02:29.316
For the interface between routers, here will
be 10.10.10.1/30,

18

00:02:32.093  -->  00:02:37.210
and in the router 2 will be 10.10.10.2/30.

19

00:02:38.091  -->  00:02:42.824
So this is topology that we are going to use
to learn about access list.

20

00:02:43.619  -->  00:02:51.216
This is a task for you, try to configure this
topology, the goal is all pc will able to

21

00:02:51.216  -->  00:02:53.161
communicate with servers.

22

00:02:53.860  -->  00:02:59.752
I will show you the solution in the next video,
but before you watch the solution,

23

00:02:59.887  -->  00:03:02.176
make sure that you try it first.

24

00:03:03.162  -->  00:03:06.000
Okay I think enough for this video.

25

00:03:06.239  -->  00:03:09.519
Thankyou for watching and see you on the next video.
