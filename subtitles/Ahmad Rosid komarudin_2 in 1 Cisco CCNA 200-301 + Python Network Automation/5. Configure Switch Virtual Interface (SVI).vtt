00:00:00.257  -->  00:00:07.082
In the previous video, we already talk about
multi layer switch or layer 3 switch.

2

00:00:07.770  -->  00:00:15.746
Next in this video, we are going to learn
how to configure SVI or switch virtual interface,

3

00:00:16.396  -->  00:00:22.234
which is connecting between pc in the different
vlan using multi layer switch.

4

00:00:23.063  -->  00:00:25.222
Okay let’s just start.

5

00:00:25.872  -->  00:00:28.538
Here let’s remove the router.

6

00:00:31.717  -->  00:00:39.640
Okay now we don’t have a router anymore,
and if you remember, we also already configure

7

00:00:39.640  -->  00:00:42.192
dhcp server in the router.

8

00:00:42.957  -->  00:00:47.874
So now the pc can not get an ip address automatically
anymore.

9

00:00:48.244  -->  00:00:49.420
Let’s try it.

10

00:00:50.389  -->  00:00:54.125
Here let’s click static and dhcp again.

11

00:00:56.866  -->  00:00:58.384
Okay here failed.

12

00:00:58.499  -->  00:01:01.946
This is because the dhcp server is gone.

13

00:01:02.481  -->  00:01:07.150
Now let’s start configuring svi on multi
layer switch.

14

00:01:07.724  -->  00:01:13.295
Later, the communication between vlan will
go through this multi layer switch.

15

00:01:14.149  -->  00:01:21.674
If you remember, I already said that if computer
want to communicate with other computers that

16

00:01:21.674  -->  00:01:27.418
in the different network, the computer will
be need a default gateway.

17

00:01:27.915  -->  00:01:34.418
So in this case, the default gateway will
be the ip address of multi layer switch.

18

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:41.297
So now we need to configure an ip address
in the multi layer switch.

19

00:01:42.445  -->  00:01:43.357
Let’s start.

20

00:01:43.880  -->  00:01:52.149
Go to CLI, enable, and then go to global configuration
mode.

21

00:01:52.838  -->  00:01:56.611
We will need to configure an ip address for
each vlan.

22

00:01:57.618  -->  00:02:03.685
In the router, we need to create sub interface
to configure ip address for each vlan.

23

00:02:04.157  -->  00:02:13.977
So let’s say fa0/0.10 for vlan 10, fa0/0.20
for vlan 20 and others.

24

00:02:14.933  -->  00:02:20.311
But in the multi layer switch, we don’t
need to create sub interface.

25

00:02:20.719  -->  00:02:24.666
We can configure the ip address in the vlan
interface.

26

00:02:25.559  -->  00:02:27.802
Let’s configure for vlan 1 first.

27

00:02:28.439  -->  00:02:39.873
So interface vlan 1, and then the ip address
is 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0.

28

00:02:40.919  -->  00:02:45.484
Okay here we have done configuring the ip
address of vlan 1.

29

00:02:46.274  -->  00:02:49.382
Next let’s configure for vlan 10.

30

00:02:49.867  -->  00:03:02.256
So go to interface vlan 10, and then the ip
address is 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

31

00:03:03.531  -->  00:03:06.665
Next let’s configure for vlan 20.

32

00:03:07.609  -->  00:03:19.796
The ip address is 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0,
and last let’s configure for vlan 30,

33

00:03:20.318  -->  00:03:28.483
the ip address is 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0

34

00:03:30.000  -->  00:03:34.428
Okay now we have done configuring ip address
for all vlan.

35

00:03:35.053  -->  00:03:36.365
Let’s verify it.

36

00:03:36.926  -->  00:03:39.097
Do show ip interface brief.

37

00:03:41.469  -->  00:03:44.699
Okay here we can see a lot of interface.

38

00:03:45.745  -->  00:03:48.564
And the interface vlan is in the buttom.

39

00:03:49.724  -->  00:03:57.392
Okay here we can see the ip address for vlan1,
vlan 10, vlan 20, and vlan 30.

40

00:03:58.285  -->  00:04:06.849
But here we can see that for vlan 1, the status
is administrative down, this is means that

41

00:04:06.849  -->  00:04:10.411
we need to use no shutdown in vlan 1.

42

00:04:11.418  -->  00:04:19.875
And here for vlan 30, the status is down,
this is because we don’t have vlan 30 yet

43

00:04:19.875  -->  00:04:21.480
in this multi layer switch.

44

00:04:21.862  -->  00:04:25.073
Let’s check it, do show vlan brief.

45

00:04:25.825  -->  00:04:29.768
Okay here we can see that we don’t have
vlan 30 yet.

46

00:04:30.635  -->  00:04:38.407
If we see in the topology, actually we don’t
have vlan 30 that attached to multi layer switch.

47

00:04:39.000  -->  00:04:47.311
But because this multilayer switch will become
gateway and in the room 1 we have vlan 30,

48

00:04:47.642  -->  00:04:52.653
so we also need to create vlan 30 in this
multi layer switch.

49

00:04:53.520  -->  00:04:54.962
So let’s create it.

50

00:04:55.625  -->  00:04:59.243
Vlan 30, the name is engineering.

51

00:05:01.105  -->  00:05:08.888
Let’s check the vlan again, okay here we
can see that now we have vlan 30.

52

00:05:09.870  -->  00:05:15.749
Now let’s see the ip address again, do show
ip interface brief.

53

00:05:16.642  -->  00:05:20.288
Okay here we can see that vlan 30 is up.

54

00:05:21.117  -->  00:05:29.158
For vlan 1, this is still administrative down,
remember that if the status is administrative

55

00:05:29.158  -->  00:05:34.824
down like this, this is means we need to no
shutdown the interface.

56

00:05:35.589  -->  00:05:40.068
Let’s go to interface vlan 1, and then no
shutdown.

57

00:05:41.203  -->  00:05:46.234
Let’s check again, do show ip interface
brief.

58

00:05:48.351  -->  00:05:52.510
Okay here we can see that the status is already
up.

59

00:05:54.065  -->  00:06:00.377
Okay for now we have done configuring the
ip address for all vlan in the multi layer switch.

60

00:06:00.981  -->  00:06:07.260
I think enough for this video, in the next
video, we are going to configure the ip address

61

00:06:07.260  -->  00:06:11.302
in all pc and test connection between vlan.

62

00:06:12.156  -->  00:06:16.486
Okay thankyou for watching and see you on
the next video.
