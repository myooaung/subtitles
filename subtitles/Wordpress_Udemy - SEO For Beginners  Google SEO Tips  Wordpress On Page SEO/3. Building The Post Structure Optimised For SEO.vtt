I mean this lesson we're going to take the content that we created when we go into structure or post

00:09.890 --> 00:16.470
it will be fairly detailed because I want to show you exactly how I built the post and how I rank on

00:16.470 --> 00:17.840
google page 1.

00:18.260 --> 00:18.830
Let's go

00:25.350 --> 00:34.290
search and download five or six relevant images from pixelate rename them to contain the focus Keywood

00:34.650 --> 00:35.780
and variations

00:51.550 --> 00:56.500
search youtube with the post focus keyword and copy the you are Al

01:19.950 --> 01:27.000
convert the video into an MP 3 file online download and save

01:34.820 --> 01:42.440
convert the punctuated post text into a file and name it as a focus key word var.

02:01.720 --> 02:08.700
you also need the list of related keywords discovered in you just as described in the video list.

02:08.830 --> 02:15.550
Keywords strategy these keywords have to be separated by commas.

02:18.860 --> 02:23.060
Open WordPress dashboard and click add a new post

02:30.860 --> 02:36.530
at the title which should contain your focus keyword.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.560
The keyword itself should be the first words in that title.

02:45.950 --> 02:52.150
Paste the YouTube video you are l into the post when the post is published.

02:52.220 --> 02:58.770
The lazy load for video plugin will display a thumbnail and load the video if it is clicked

03:02.350 --> 03:11.940
now click Add media and upload the MP 3 of the video or you WordPress will automatically display a simple

03:11.950 --> 03:26.450
MP 3 player underneath the video.

03:26.570 --> 03:32.560
I normally type YouTube channel in text here and link out to the video created channel

03:36.560 --> 03:40.130
now paste the whole text of the video transcript into the post

03:53.720 --> 03:55.810
on the PTF and

04:23.150 --> 04:31.070
post the images throughout the article I think he were variations as the old text for each one.

05:08.010 --> 05:14.250
Two or three paragraphs down the article at an age to title with the key word variation.

05:30.190 --> 05:36.520
Throughout the text he was bold phoned from time to time for variety and then close certain passages

05:36.850 --> 05:38.690
in quotation marks.

06:05.880 --> 06:13.540
Link out with relevant keyword variations to post on your own site and link out to two authorities sites

07:18.300 --> 07:23.670
choose a category for the post and add the comma separated key words as tax

07:37.720 --> 07:45.340
scrolling down to the three in one SBO in fields and the title of the show description containing the

07:45.340 --> 07:46.760
focus keyword.

08:40.080 --> 08:46.170
Lastly add three or four keywords using method tagged manager at the bottom of the page

09:05.340 --> 09:13.800
go back to the top of the post check you or else look for the post generated automatically by Word Press.

09:13.890 --> 09:17.190
The system uses the title as the basis for this slug.

09:17.430 --> 09:21.480
We need to check it and shorten it so that is your main focus.

09:21.480 --> 09:27.040
Key word or a very close variation.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.820
Now preview the post

09:40.310 --> 09:42.740
make any adjustments necessary.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.000
I'm probably.
