Although choosing a domain name and installing Wordpress is not the focus of this course I'm going to

00:06.640 --> 00:10.100
include the short section describing just how to do that.

00:11.820 --> 00:16.730
I normally buy domain names from Go Daddy and you can also host your account there.

00:18.930 --> 00:25.530
Go daddy uses user interface for their hosting service called C panel and this is what we're going to

00:25.530 --> 00:35.760
use to install our basic WordPress site.

00:35.780 --> 00:42.010
This is the C panel interface provided by my hosting provider.

00:42.200 --> 00:50.330
The user interface facilitates several functions from a file accessed to e-mail account access and creation

00:50.720 --> 01:01.170
and also the installation of content management systems CMOS such as Wordpress.

01:01.260 --> 01:09.860
If you are familiar with the basics you can skip this video and pass on to the next scrolling down.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.910
We can see that the Wordpress environment can be installed using software on the C panel called Software

01:16.990 --> 01:25.280
Kilis simply click on WP and on the next screen click install.

01:25.280 --> 01:25.700
Now

01:37.130 --> 01:39.790
there are a few settings that need our attention.

01:41.140 --> 01:47.770
Assuming you don't yet have an SSL certificate installed choose h TTP

01:50.300 --> 01:57.320
the system automatically creates and decides the Wordpress installation files to a directory called

01:57.620 --> 02:01.990
WP for this demonstration.

02:01.990 --> 02:09.810
I'm using a temporary directory called WP one but this space should be left blank.

02:09.910 --> 02:13.650
To install the setup files into the root of your domain

02:16.820 --> 02:21.210
name the site and also add a short description

02:34.710 --> 02:41.270
pay particular attention setting your username and your password.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.330
The password should be very strong.

02:44.530 --> 02:50.920
I recommend using nonsensical words mixed with special characters and numbers.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.490
Into an email field notifications and scroll down

03:25.000 --> 03:30.090
ignore the plug in the section as will be adding plug ins for security later on.

03:32.290 --> 03:33.880
Now click install

03:48.250 --> 03:50.990
installation takes three to four minutes.

03:52.540 --> 04:05.130
When it's finished click the administration link provided an empty your Wordpress dashboard.

04:05.170 --> 04:12.930
First of all remove example posts and pages that have already been installed by the system as a guideline.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.470
Install a theme that you like.

04:41.610 --> 04:45.760
This one is active Velho bicolor lib which is free.

04:48.420 --> 04:52.750
Install the theme activate and we're ready to move all

05:02.490 --> 05:09.410
click customize to check your theme settings.

05:09.420 --> 05:16.590
This is where you can choose which side you prefer your side bar and how your post exits will appear

05:16.860 --> 05:18.100
on your home page.

05:27.030 --> 05:37.850
Content options should be left at the default settings and the slider turned off image sliders and carousels

05:38.090 --> 05:43.170
seemed to be popular at the moment but they do nothing for the site.

05:43.280 --> 05:49.260
Oh they just serve to push your main content further on down the page.
