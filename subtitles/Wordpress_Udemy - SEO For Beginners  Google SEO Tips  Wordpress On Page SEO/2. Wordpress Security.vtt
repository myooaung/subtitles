00:00.620 --> 00:07.290
Web site security is becoming more and more important attacks are on the increase.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.620
And there are millions every single day.

00:11.410 --> 00:18.580
My own Web site the one that see the subject of this case study is attacked hundreds of times a month.

00:20.120 --> 00:27.610
The attacks vary in intensity and style but there always a danger to unprotected sites.

00:28.220 --> 00:34.520
Fortunately it's quite easy for us to protect our size against most of the common attacks.

00:38.950 --> 00:47.990
Hackers trying to gain access to your sites for a variety of reasons an obvious one is to add text or

00:47.990 --> 00:53.390
bandeau links to your site which redirect to their own sites or offers

00:57.510 --> 01:00.470
thousands of sites are hacked and used to launch.

01:00.660 --> 01:10.490
D O S or denial of service attacks on another site these attacks operate my sending so much traffic

01:10.580 --> 01:16.100
to a Web site that the hosting server just can't cope and the site knows down

01:19.100 --> 01:27.650
someone with illegal files such as pornographic images may try to store them on your server to escape

01:27.650 --> 01:28.630
discovery.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.710
Some hackers simply like the challenge.

01:34.710 --> 01:35.780
They do it for fun

01:38.700 --> 01:40.260
whatever the reason.

01:40.260 --> 01:48.210
There are millions of attacks every year and currently there are almost 180000 WordPress sites successfully

01:48.210 --> 01:49.820
hacked every year.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.880
So what are these attacks.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.580
The three main attacks account for almost 80 percent of all the attempts.

02:00.600 --> 02:11.130
These are hosting server vulnerability brute force attacks unplugging vulnerability.

02:11.290 --> 02:18.970
Make sure you use a well-established hosting company send them an email asking about their record and

02:18.970 --> 02:25.290
what are the defenses against hacking just by using a reputable host.

02:25.300 --> 02:33.760
Your risk is reduced considerably a brute force attack is when a board attempts to get your admin user

02:33.760 --> 02:38.530
name and password as you can imagine.

02:39.620 --> 02:47.720
If you leave the username as the default which is admin and use a simple password you'll soon be hacked.

02:50.050 --> 02:57.640
As I said during the installation video username password should be random over 12 characters and mixed

02:59.490 --> 03:05.910
plugins should be kept to a minimum and only choose ones that are actually supported and compatible

03:05.910 --> 03:11.040
with the latest version of your Wordpress theme.

03:11.040 --> 03:17.460
Be sure to change your Wordpress dashboard from time to time and update the theme and plugins whenever

03:17.460 --> 03:18.620
you are notified.

03:21.090 --> 03:25.810
This is important as updates include fixes for vulnerabilities.

03:25.950 --> 03:27.360
Just recently discovered

03:30.140 --> 03:38.470
the security plugin that I use is called word fence which has a free and a pro plan if guards against

03:38.560 --> 03:41.620
brute force attacks as well as many others.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.740
And even with the free plan I have never been hacked.
