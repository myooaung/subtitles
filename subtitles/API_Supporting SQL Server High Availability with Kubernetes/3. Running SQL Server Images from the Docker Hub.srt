00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,360
After Docker Support has been installed, you're ready to run Docker containers.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,540
To run a Docker container, you can pull a Docker image from the Docker Hub.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,010
Docker images are templates for containers,

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,060
and they contain the software that makes up the container.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,380
That software can include OS binaries, as well as the application software,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,940
applications like SQL Server.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,170
The docker pull command will retrieve the image from the Docker

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,020
Hub and execute that image on the local system,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,440
instantiating a Docker container.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,680
In this slide, you can see the Docker Hub,

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,830
and you can see that a microsoft/mssql‑server‑linux

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,040
container is listed at the top,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,470
along with a microsoft/mssql‑server‑windows‑express container and a

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,680
microsoft/mssql‑server‑windows‑developer edition container.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,420
By selecting one of those images and using the docker pull command,

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,280
you can run that image.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,820
And when you do that,

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,630
the container that has SQL Server preinstalled on it is ready to run.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,630
And then SQL Server will essentially be running on that

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,140
container that you've downloaded to your system,

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,440
with no need to install anything.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,990
So to actually run a container, you use the docker run command.

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,210
The docker run command has a few important parameters for SQL Server.

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,750
It's actually a pretty simple command to run.

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,160
Here, the ‑d switch means the container will run detached,

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,400
which means it will run in the background rather than on the host desktop.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,430
The ‑p parameter specifies which ports to map from

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,960
the host system to the container.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,540
In this case, it's mapping port 1433 on the host to the same port,

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,850
1433, in the container.

31
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,620
That is the default port for SQL Server.

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,320
While the values match in this case, they don't have to match.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,980
And then, the ‑e parameter allows you to specify environment variables.

34
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,940
These can change depending on what containers you're running.

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,150
In this case, two environment variables are used.

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,180
The ACCEPT_EULA=Y key pair tells SQL Server that you

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,540
will accept the licensing agreement.

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,740
The SA_PASSWORD variable sets the SQL Server system administrator,

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,640
or SA password.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,910
And finally,

41
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,780
the docker run command passes the name of the

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,250
container image that you're going to run.

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,920
And this would map to one of the container images that you

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,640
saw listed earlier on the Docker Hub.

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,570
In this case,

46
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,940
the command will run a microsoft/mssql‑server‑windows‑express image.

47
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,840
So, let's go ahead and see a quick demo of this in action.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,290
First,

49
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,650
we're going to go ahead and list the various Docker images that are out

50
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,740
there on the Docker Hub so you can see where they're at.

51
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,930
Next, we're going to use that pull command,

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,210
and we're going to pull down a SQL Server image,

53
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,090
and then we're going to run it.

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,710
Then we're going to go ahead and connect to that SQL

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,440
Server instance running in the container,

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,330
where you'll see that running a containerized version of

57
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,200
SQL Server is almost exactly like running a standard SQL

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Server standalone instance. So, let's go ahead and jump into it.
