1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,400
Okay.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,440
Now let's get ready to jump into the SQL Server portion of this code.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,350
First,

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,340
we're going to go ahead and look at creating the

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,940
primary availability group replica.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,630
Then we're going to take the master key we create there and copy that

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,910
master key to the two different secondary replicas.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,720
Next, we're going to go ahead and create the first secondary replica.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,140
Then we're going to create the second secondary replica.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,200
Then we're going to test the availability group,

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,920
and we're going to watch it replicate some transactions

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,540
between the primary node and the secondaries.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,470
And then we're going to test a failover to see how Kubernetes

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,140
is providing availability for this cluster.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay, at this point, we have our three‑node Kubernetes cluster up and running,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,980
but we don't have an availability group onto it.

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,540
So let's go ahead and connect into it,

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,740
and we're going to go ahead and create our availability group.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,520
So first,

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,400
let's go ahead and fire up Azure Data Studio, and here, we're going to

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,260
go ahead and you can see we're going to collect the IP addresses for

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,930
each of the different nodes, then we're going to go ahead and start

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,690
Azure Data Studio, so it's waiting for us to hit Enter, and now here

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,340
comes Azure Data Studio.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,940
Next, let's go ahead and connect into our primary node.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,460
Okay,

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,680
so here it is in our list of servers, remember, we connected to it just a

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,940
little while ago, so let's go ahead and give it the password.

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,110
And now that we have our connection into the primary or

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,440
what's going to be the primary server,

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:49,790
let's go ahead and open up our script that's going to

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,000
go ahead and create the primary, and that's what we can see here.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,030
Let's scroll to the top. At the top, you can see where we're creating that

34
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,890
master database and inserting a few rows into it, setting our database

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,040
recovery to full and backing up the database,

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,240
creating a login, and then below that, our master key and certificate.

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,220
And then we're backing up that certificate to a file that we're

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,640
going to later share with the secondaries.

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,740
If we scroll down a little bit,

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:27,340
you can see where we're going to go ahead and create our endpoint on Port 5022,

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,200
and after that, we're going to go ahead and create our availability

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,340
group called K8S, or Kubernetes S availability group.

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,460
Then we're going to add our different replicas, our primary replica,

44
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,550
and we're going to set it up as a synchronous, our

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,960
seeding is going to be automatic,

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,680
which means it's going to copy the database that we add to it automatically to

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
the secondaries, and our failover mode is going to be manual because this is a

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,270
cluster list availability group. Beneath that,

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,160
you can see where we create the two secondary replicas,

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,390
mssql‑secondary1, mssql‑secondary2. Secondary1 is a

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,450
synchronous availability replica,

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,000
while secondary2 is using asynchronous commit mode. And then at the bottom,

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,130
you can see where we're going to go ahead and add a database to

54
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,220
our availability group and this is our sample database that we

55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,540
loaded a few rows into earlier.

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,600
Alright, let's go ahead and run it. So at this point,

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,420
it's going to go ahead and go through our script lines, it is going to add the

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,010
rows to the database, it's going to back up the database,

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,610
and then it's going to go ahead and create our

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,240
endpoint and our availability group.

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,580
If we go over and look at our server objects, now you'll

62
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,040
be able to see our endpoint out there,

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,210
and there is our AG_endpoint that we created.

64
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:02,140
Now, the next thing is to copy that certificate over to the secondary replicas.

65
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:09,340
To do that, we're going to go back to Visual Studio Code,

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,800
and we're going to open up step11_copy_certificate, and you can

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,970
see if we look at this, we are getting the different pod names

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,440
for our primary and two secondaries.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,850
We're going to copy the certificate first to our local system,

70
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,440
and then we're going to turn around and copy it to each of the secondaries.

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,710
And again, we have to do that because, unfortunately,

72
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,210
I was not able to copy from pod to pod, so that's a workaround for that.

73
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,470
And here you can see it's going ahead and copying the

74
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,290
certificates. And at that point,

75
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,420
the certificate is on each of those secondary nodes. And next,

76
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:59,440
we're going to open up a connection to our secondary servers.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,480
So there that should be our first secondary. We're going to

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,240
log in to it as SA, give it our password.

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
Okay,

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,930
and there is our first secondary replica that is now up and you can

81
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,720
check out our computer name mssql‑secondary1.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,740
Now we're going to run a query on this system, our script that's

83
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,020
going to create it out of S1 and here we go,

84
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,750
create_secondaryAG. And you can see, again here, it's going

85
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,600
to use the master database, it's going to create a login,

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
it's going to create a certificate.

87
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,720
In this case,

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,680
it's creating the certificate based upon our

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
certificate that has been backed up,

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,230
and it's going out to the file system to find that certificate,

91
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,440
and we copied it in here just a little bit ago.

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,140
Then it's going to go ahead and create the endpoint,

93
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,730
and at that point, it's going to go ahead and add this replica.

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,640
So let's go ahead and run this.

95
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,740
Now it's going to go ahead and it's working at creating our secondary replica,

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,440
and it has gone ahead and finished it.

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,360
Now we're going to do the same thing on secondary replica 2. So first,

98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,900
let's open a connection to our other server,

99
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,340
and this is our secondary replica, so we'll put in its IP address.

100
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,830
We'll give it on its sign on.

101
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,580
And now we're connected to secondary Replica 2. Now,

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,940
let's go ahead and open the script to add it up to our availability group,

103
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,660
and here, you can see this is very much like the one we ran on secondary

104
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,430
replica 1. Again, we're going to create the log in, we're going to create

105
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,030
the master key, we're going to use a certificate from the file, and then

106
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,940
we're going to create our endpoint.

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,840
So let's go ahead and run it.

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,780
At this point, it has gone ahead and completed,

109
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,540
and now our availability group is completed.

110
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,770
So if we now go ahead and look at databases,

111
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,520
let's see our sample database should definitely exist on the

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,890
primary, so we're opening up our primary databases,

113
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,550
and there it is.

114
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,740
Remember, we used automatic seeding,

115
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,350
so it should take it just a second before that database and

116
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,560
makes it out to both of the secondaries,

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,140
and you can see that it is definitely there.

118
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,920
Now let's go back to the primary,

119
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,040
and we're going to insert some additional data into this database.

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,140
So let's take a sample insert statement and let's go ahead and run it.

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,120
And now we've gone ahead and we've inserted 49 rows into our database.

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Now let's go ahead and take a quick look over at let's say

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,640
the one in secondary replica number two.

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,680
So let's go ahead and open up our table and let's

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,520
select the top 1,000 rows here.

126
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,570
And at this point, there is all our data.

127
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,400
You can see it duplicated over very quickly.

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,740
Now, at this point, we're ready to go ahead and test a failover.

129
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,800
So I flipped back to Azure Data Studio.

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
So here is our code that's going to go ahead and demo a failover.

131
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,310
We're going to retrieve the pod name.

132
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,590
We're going to go ahead and kill a pod.

133
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,460
We're going to wait a couple of seconds and then

134
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,740
we're going to see the running pods.

135
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,440
So let's go ahead and execute this, step14.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:57,240
So now it's going to go ahead and delete the pod, this takes it just a second.

137
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,440
Now it's going to wait a couple seconds,

138
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
and at this point, it has gone ahead and retrieve the pod.

139
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Now our pod is in container creating, that won't take it long to

140
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,470
do. So let's go back over now, and in Azure Data Studio, we'll go

141
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,250
back to our primary, we'll bring up our database, and we'll

142
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,840
retrieve the rows from here.

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,060
We'll open up our database and you can see it's responding just like

144
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,750
it normally would so the container is already created, and we'll

145
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,160
select the top 1,000 rows from the container,

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,640
and there they are.

147
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,790
Now Azure Data Studio is not capable of managing availability groups, it's

148
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,420
really more of a development tool, but SQL Server does have another

149
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,840
management tool called SQL Server Management Studio,

150
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,920
and that's what you see here. And now, we're going to

151
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
take SQL Server Management Studio,

152
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,240
and we're going to connect in to our availability group,

153
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,300
and we are going to see how you can manage it from SQL Server Management Studio,

154
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,740
just like any other availability group.

155
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,240
And it's connecting.

156
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,180
And if we go down and we expand always on availability,

157
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,690
you can see our availability groups.

158
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,640
There is the one we just created K8sAG. We can go down and expand our replicas.

159
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,270
You can see there is our primary replica, our secondary replica

160
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,740
1, and secondary replica 2. And if we look at our availability

161
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,240
databases, there is our test database.

162
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,470
We have the ability to manage it from here. We can also show the dashboard,

163
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,790
which basically shows the health of our availability group.

164
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,770
And again,

165
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,550
this is our availability group that is spanning our Kubernetes cluster, and

166
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,270
you can see that at this point, all the nodes are basically healthy and you

167
00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:00,000
can see our primary and our two secondaries, and at this point, you can see that they're both synchronized.
