1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,770
So now,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,800
let's have a quick demo of using some of these interactive

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,930
tools that we can use for troubleshooting.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,480
First, we're going to look at running that Kubernetes dashboard.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,990
Next,

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,350
we're going to look at using kubectl exec to run

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,340
commands on a singular type of basis.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,430
And then we're going to look at using kubectl exec to open a

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,590
remote shell that we can use for navigation,

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,240
running commands, and other troubleshooting tasks.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:27,920
Okay.

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,060
First let's look at running the dashboard, and here's the code that can do that.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,880
At the top,

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,050
you can see the kubectl proxy command and then a URL that

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,980
we could use to open up the browser.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,100
That will work for most instances.

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,850
Azure has another way to do this when you're using AKS and that's by

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,340
using the aks browse command that you see here.

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,740
About Azure, there are a couple things that have to be done to use it.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,530
You have to run the kubectl create clusterrolebinding command that you see here.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,060
And in addition, the dashboard is about to be deprecated in Azure,

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,180
as the same functionality is offered through the Azure AKS portal.

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,940
This means you need to explicitly enable it in the current release.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,140
And the code that we see at the bottom, the az aks enable‑addons,

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,270
will enable the dashboard for this present release.

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,410
In the next release of Azure it will be gone.

27
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,140
So in order to run this let's pop down here, and we'll run our dashboard.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:36,350
And at first it starts up a tunnel between our local system and AKS.

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,340
Then it asks us how we're going to authenticate.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,720
So we'll go in and choose our config file,

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,120
which has our authentication information that we've been using.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,640
At that point, we can sign in.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
And here comes our workloads display.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,760
And the dashboard is primarily focused on performance issues.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,330
At the top we see the workloads.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,440
If we scroll through, we can see the deployments that are out there.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,940
If we continue to scroll, we can see the various pods that are available.

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,540
We can also have a look at the replica sets that are in use out here,

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,840
as well as the services that are running.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,330
And the services show the cluster IP,

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,540
as well as the external IP address for each of our pods.

42
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,500
If we want to look at our nodes we can click the Nodes command over here.

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,030
And again, we'll see the CPU and memory usage for our nodes.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,540
And if we scroll down, we can list our various nodes.

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,740
And if we want to look at our persistent volumes,

46
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,170
we can click those over here,

47
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,240
and you can see the different volumes that are in use.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,600
Okay, now let's look at running some commands.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,430
You can see the code to do it here.

50
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,240
We're using the kubectl exec command.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,860
We're passing it that ‑it flag for interactive.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,040
We're giving it a pod name, which we're retrieving into a variable at the top.

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,390
And, first here, we need to close up our tunnel.

54
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,230
And then we can go ahead and run our commands.

55
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,640
So, let's run them.

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,890
The first command is going to be running the top command that you can see here.

57
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,950
And this is retrieving the status of the top running

58
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,040
commands within our container.

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,780
Ctrl+C will cancel that.

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,640
And then it will go ahead and run the command that you see at the bottom here.

61
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,930
And if we expand our view, you can see it.

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,820
We're running kubectl exec, and then we're running sqlcmd,

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,170
which is passing a SQL statement into our pod that is actually

64
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,440
retrieving the SQL Server version that you see here.

65
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,040
Okay.

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Now let's look at using a shell.

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,250
And the shell is very similar.

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,520
We're using kubectl exec again, passing in that ‑it,

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,440
or interactive switch, giving it the pod name,

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,140
and in this case the command we're running is going to be the bash command.

71
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,460
And here you can see our shell is opened up.

72
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,740
We'll expand our window a little bit.

73
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,670
And again, this shell is running in the container.

74
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,570
So, let's go ahead and have a look at our file system there.

75
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,240
We could perhaps change directories into the SQL Server file

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:28,240
system and check our data files there.

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,140
And there you can see the different database files that are in our pod.

78
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,940
We could go back to our root.

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:43,940
We could do other things, like perhaps look at the contents of our hosts file.

80
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,940
And there you can see it.

81
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,040
Or we can do other commands like run the top command like you just saw.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,240
And here we can continue to do this until we can navigate to

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,070
where we want and view the things we want or run the commands

84
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:07,000
that we might need to see out here. And when we get done we can type exit to return to our localhost.
