1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,490
So in this module, we looked at the importance of updating your

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,170
tools and saw some of the advantages that Visual Studio Code with

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,730
its Kubernetes extension provides.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,800
We looked at getting some important Kubernetes information using kubectl.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,960
We also looked at troubleshooting Kubernetes deployments using the

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,040
interactive tools, like the dashboard or using kubectl exec.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,370
Then, we dug into some of the techniques for troubleshooting SQL Server,

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,540
along with SQL Server availability groups.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,030
Finally,

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,660
we looked at some tips and some additional places for

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,650
information that you can go to to learn more about Kubernetes

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,100
and SQL Server availability groups.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,000
And that's it for this module. Thanks for watching.
