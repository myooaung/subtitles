00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.270
Now,

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.300
let's go ahead and look at using these DMVs and SQL Server Management

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.570
Studio to go ahead and troubleshoot our availability groups.

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.910
First,

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.340
we're going to look at the DMVs that retrieve the status of the

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.640
availability group itself and the primary replica.

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.050
Next,

8
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.050
we're going to check the DMVs that retrieve the

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.620
status for the secondary replicas.

10
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.550
After that,

11
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.650
we're going to run the DMVs that retrieve the status for the

12
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.180
databases that are part of those availability groups.

13
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.960
Then we're going to connect into the availability group with

14
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.230
SQL Server Management Studio, and look at the health status and

15
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.840
other information that it returns.

16
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720
Now, let's go ahead and see what it looks like to use these

17
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.320
DMVs to query our availability group.

18
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.310
Here is Azure Data Studio, and we have a connection into our primary replica.

19
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.740
So let's open up a query that has first, our availability group query,

20
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.390
and that would be this one. And you can see that it's going to

21
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.820
select the name from the availability group, and then it's going to

22
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.430
inquire about the primary replica status.

23
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240
So let's go ahead and run it.

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.640
And here you can see, we have the one availability group, K8sAG, and then

25
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.040
our primary replica is online, and its state is healthy.

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.710
Now let's go ahead, and we're going to query the secondary replicas.

27
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.240
So we'll go ahead and open up our next query,

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.390
and this query, we'll go ahead and retrieve the roles in

29
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.130
health for the secondary replicas, in fact,

30
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.720
all the replicas, and then it's going to give us the

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.390
configuration information about the endpoints.

32
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.440
So let's go ahead and run that.

33
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.640
And there you can see, we have the three different

34
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.310
replicas, primary and two secondaries.

35
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.410
They're all connected, and at their current state,

36
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.990
they're all healthy. And in the bottom, we can see

37
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020
the configuration information.

38
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.590
The primary is synchronous, the first secondary is synchronous,

39
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.540
and the second secondary is asynchronous.

40
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.170
Now, let's go ahead and query the actual availability group

41
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.900
database. So we'll open up this query, and this is,

42
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.220
this joins with the sys.databases table, and the sys.availability_replicas to

43
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.240
retrieve the names. Other than that, it is going ahead and retrieving the

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.870
synchronization state and health, the last log sequence number, as well as the

45
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.390
redo_queue_size and the log_send_queue_size,

46
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.330
which in this case, is 0, but if those values were high,

47
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.540
you could tell there might be a problem with the replication.

48
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.290
Now, let's flip over, and we're going to look at

49
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.340
using SQL Server Management Studio.

50
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.400
And here's an example of SQL Server Management Studio.

51
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.130
Remember,

52
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.020
SQL Server Management Studio is actually a Windows

53
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.290
application, so we're running this on a Windows server that's

54
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.610
connected into our Kubernetes cluster,

55
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.240
and our Kubernetes cluster is running the SQL Server Linux editions.

56
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.190
So we're managing it with SQL Server Management Studio,

57
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.030
just like we would any SQL Server system.

58
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.720
This is the server dashboard.

59
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.870
You can see we're connected to the mssqlâ€‘primary system, and if

60
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.650
we want to get information about our Always On Availability

61
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.070
Groups, we can go ahead and expand our Always On Availability

62
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.940
Groups node in Server Explorer.

63
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.360
And there you can see the availability group that we have, the K8sAG group.

64
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.570
If we go ahead and expand it again, we can look at the replicas

65
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.320
that are out there, and there's our primary and our two secondary

66
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.760
replicas, and our availability database,

67
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.440
which is the DevTestAG database.

68
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.250
If we want to get information about this availability group, we can use the

69
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.390
Show Dashboard report that you can see here, and Show Dashboard gives us an

70
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.410
overview of the health of our availability group.

71
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.440
So at this point, you can see our availability group is healthy.

72
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.560
We can see the different replicas that are out there,

73
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:17.000
the roles that they have, and the availability modes that they're using, and we can look into the different states that they have.
