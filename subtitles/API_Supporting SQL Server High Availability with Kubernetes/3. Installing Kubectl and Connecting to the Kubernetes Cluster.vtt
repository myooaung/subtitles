00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.780
Once the Kubernetes cluster has been created and you're familiar

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.270
with the tools and concepts that we'll be using,

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.120
it's time to install those tools and get started

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.340
creating your SQL Server deployment.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.650
If you're using AKS and have installed the Azure CLI,

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.770
installing kubectl is a simple one‑step command.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.740
You can see it here, az aks install‑cli.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.470
In addition,

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.630
while I don't use it is part of this example, Azure has a

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.040
command shell where kubectl is pre‑installed.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.990
It also can be installed in a lot of other kinds of platforms.

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.770
For more information about installing kubectl on different platforms,

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.070
you can Google install and setup kubectl,

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.270
and that will show you the instructions for all the different

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.340
platforms where kubectl can be implemented.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.160
After you've installed kubectl,

17
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.420
you're ready to connect kubectl to the Kubernetes cluster.

18
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.200
To do that,

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.400
you need to first retrieve the login credentials for the

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.480
cluster using the az aks get‑credentials command like you see

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.790
here, where you supply the command,

22
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.440
the resource‑group name, and the cluster name.

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.970
After retrieving the cluster credentials,

24
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.310
kubectl can now connect to the cluster and manage it.

25
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.000
Here you can see an example of how kubectl can list the different nodes in the cluster.
