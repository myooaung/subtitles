While updating your tools might not seem like the first

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.710
place to look when you run into problems, I ran into an

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.050
issue where everything looked right, but I was still running into errors.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
For me, it turned out that Azure CLI needed to be updated.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.980
After updating it, these errors disappeared.

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.440
A simple fix once I knew to do it.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.140
While this was an Azure Kubernetes Services‑specific issue,

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.340
I'm sure this could certainly occur with other Kubernetes providers as well.

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.620
For AKS,

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.000
the current version of the Azure CLI is 2.16.0. You can check the version

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.940
you're using by running the az version command, like you see here. And you

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
can update the tool using the az upgrade command.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240
Quite simple to upgrade.

14
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.470
Another tool that I found to be helpful was the Visual

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.240
Studio Code Kubernetes extension.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.710
You know,

17
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.550
you certainly don't need to use Visual Studio Code to

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430
develop your Kubernetes projects.

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.170
You can use any text editor to create YAML files, and

20
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.110
you can run them directly from Bash.

21
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.040
However, Visual Studio Code does offer a feature rich editing experience,

22
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.240
and the Kubernetes extension provides some really helpful features.

23
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.350
It provides YAML syntax checking, as well as indentation marking,

24
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.980
which can be surprisingly useful because YAML is quite sensitive to indentation.

25
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.420
It also enables you to view your clusters in an Explorer tree

26
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.590
view and provides IntelliSense for Kubernetes resources. You

27
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.500
can install it by clicking on the Extensions icon that you can

28
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.310
see on the left‑most pane, then selecting Extensions/Kubernetes.

29
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.000
If you're working with Azure Kubernetes Services then you can choose Extensions/Azure Kubernetes Service to install that as well.
