00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,840
Hello this is Carol from for example dot com.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,130
And welcome to the 14th tutorial in our series of tutorials on algorithmic trading for complete beginners

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,010
and the previous tutorial we discussed basic algorithmic trading system design.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:30,350
And we had a look at a couple of approaches to constructing your automated trading systems.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:39,320
In this tutorial we're going to understand how we can incorporate trader input into our algorithmic

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,150
trading systems.

7
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:50,690
By that I mean how we can structure our trading approach training programs in such a way that the trader

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:59,300
can actually input certain parameters into them and adapt them to the market conditions in which he

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,440
wants to utilize these programs.

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,660
What are we going to do is we're going to take this trading strategy that we discussed in the previous

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:19,220
Tauriel and we're going to start a script in which we will allow the trader to put these two parameters

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,110
the 10 pips take profit and the 10 pips Stop-Loss and then in the future Charles will build upon this

13
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:40,430
script and actually add trading functionality to it and turn it into a proper algorithmic trading system.

14
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:48,600
But for now we'll just focus on the trader input because it is a crucial part of the strategy.

15
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:57,810
So I'm just going to switch to marriage here and as usual we're going to create a new script using the

16
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,060
kill for Wizard.

17
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,840
I'm going to give it a name

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,280
called Tauriel 14.

19
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:19,660
And so as we usually do we will we're going to code the body of the script and here in the on start

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,910
function.

21
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:35,100
However we first need to add a property to the script which will allow the script to show the inputs

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,960
when it is launched and I will explain this when we start testing it.

23
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,390
But for now it was just to add a line here which is property scriptural input.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,960
All right.

25
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:59,370
So here we know that we are going to be using Ask price the bid price and then to calculate the stop

26
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,240
loss and take profit.

27
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:09,030
We're going to need these external parameters of 10 pips to actually get these values.

28
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,920
So it will start creating

29
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:25,570
an internal parameter which we'll call double take profit level and another one which we will call double

30
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,720
stop loss level.

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:36,230
And these two variables are going to represent this blue line this red line.

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,110
So now we know from previous lessons that the ask price.

33
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,360
So we will need the bit price the bid prices kept and be bearable.

34
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:57,070
So we are going to use that we're going to use that to calculate out take profit take profit level equals

35
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:11,980
to bid plus 10 multiplied by point and point is a variable which is stores number of decimals.

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,220
On this given financial instruments or in our case point is 0.00 1.

37
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:27,150
So 4 digits after the decimal point as we can see here 1 2 3 4.

38
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,060
So that will give us a take profit and hopefully we'll put it over there.

39
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,430
And the Stop-Loss

40
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:45,660
is you can see em kill for is already prompting us for the existing variable stop loss level.

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Stop-Loss will be bid more.

42
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,390
So we did minus 10 multiplied by point

43
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,320
and we can compile that no errors or warnings.

44
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:10,060
And of course we have to add an alert statement which will actually tell us these values profit level

45
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,810
equals and we'll do another one for the Stop-Loss level

46
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,620
just that we can check that the values are correct.

47
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,370
We'll compile that nor's or warnings or go back to the trading terminal.

48
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,650
We will find our script sort of 14.

49
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,900
Drag it to the chart.

50
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,080
And as you can see here this this is different to what we use.

51
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,730
What we would expect.

52
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,260
We have this window which is the parameter window for the script usually the scripts start working right

53
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,500
away as you can remember.

54
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,920
But in this particular case because because we did add that line at the top show script show inputs

55
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,470
it's first showing us this window which will learn to use in a minute and I'll just click OK.

56
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:20,110
And as you can see here take profit level is 1.3 6 1 6 as expected and Stop-Loss level is one point

57
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,230
3 5 9 6 x expected.

58
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,110
So the script is taking the bid price.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,300
It's adding 10 points to get the take profit and it's subtracting 10 points to get the stop loss going.

60
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,380
We're going to click OK here and now we'll go back to the script.

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:46,260
And now what we want to do is we want to change this 10 to a user user defined variable and to do that

62
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,790
we need to introduce this variable so we'll call it Xorn.

63
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:04,460
And because it's an integer variable and we'll call it take profit.

64
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,290
Get a value of 10 and extend it.

65
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,500
Stop loss on the value of 10 as well.

66
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,880
Compile that.

67
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,890
Oh that's right.

68
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,660
This is has to go outside of the stock function.

69
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:35,520
All external variables have to go outside the main function and they just sit up here.

70
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,940
So it's simple act quickly no errors or warnings and will just take take profit and put it four instead

71
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,300
of 10 for the take profit level and stop loss and put a stop loss.

72
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,390
Compile that.

73
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,550
And if we go back to the terminal the results should be identical to what we just saw.

74
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,840
OK.

75
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,170
And 1 3 6 1 6 same thing 1 3 5 9 6.

76
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,750
So I was just luncher again and here you can see a new tablet here which is called inputs.

77
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,670
And here we have take profit and stop loss and we can actually now change them right here in this window

78
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,250
without having to go into the code.

79
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:28,170
So say for example if I want to change my take profit to 20 I will just put 20 here and if I want to

80
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:36,370
change my stop loss to say 15 pips for example put 15 then I'll just click OK.

81
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,960
Now when the script launches you can see that the take profit level is now 3 6 2 6.

82
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,950
So it's not 10 Pip's it's 20 pips away and the Stop-Loss level is 1 3 5 9 1.

83
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,370
So it's not 10 Pip's it's actually 15 peep's away.

84
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,330
And in that way you can you now have control over your program.

85
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,530
Let's try this again for example.

86
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:10,930
So if I want take profit of 100 pips and I want to conservative stop loss of 25 pips click OK.

87
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,870
And what we can see here the Stop-Loss level is take profit there was 1 3 7 06 So it's a hundred pips

88
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,690
higher than the bid price and the stop loss level was 1 3 5 8 1.

89
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,420
So it's 25 Pip's below and that is exactly what we're looking for.

90
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:42,090
So this these externe parameters allow us to give the user the trader control of the program so therefore

91
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:48,990
he doesn't actually need to know how to code to be able to adapt his program or the program that you

92
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,570
have created to market conditions.

93
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,490
And also just to fast away instead of opening the code and compiling a program every time you can actually

94
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,140
now you can actually just drag and drop and then change the parameters that you need.

95
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:10,100
So that is a very convenient and efficient way of structuring your algorithmic trading systems.

96
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,560
I think that's enough for this time and I hope you have fun with that.

97
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,210
And I really hope that you join me again for the next tutorial.

98
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:27,230
And don't forget to check check me out on forewings bomb dot com.

99
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,660
Until then happy coding.
