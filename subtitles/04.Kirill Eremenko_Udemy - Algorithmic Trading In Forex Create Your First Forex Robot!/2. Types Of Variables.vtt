00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.950
Hello this is Carol from for export dot com.

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.100
And this is the second tutorial in our series of em kill for tutorials for complete beginners.

3
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.890
And today we're going to be talking about variables.

4
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.030
Just before we started I wanted to quickly say that if you've gotten this far you are doing a great

5
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:35.790
job and just don't get put off if you find that you not being able to understand everything in this

6
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.180
tutorial tutorial right away and that's fine that that's absolutely normal and especially if this is

7
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
the first programming language you learn.

8
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.770
And it's because programming languages are not simple to understand right away.

9
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.770
But as you practice more and more and you write more bits of code the knowledge will kind of sink in

10
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.350
and make more sense.

11
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.040
So basically practice make practice makes perfect.

12
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.030
And I'm always here to help you out if you if you get stuck.

13
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.100
Now moving on to my own two variables there are many different types of variables in them kill for but

14
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.110
we will start by focusing on six of them six main ones.

15
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.960
And I'm going to be using the code that we started last time in our previous tutorial.

16
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.950
All all I did was as you can see here story of one to foster one tutorial too.

17
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.020
Well I did was in tutorial when I clicked File Save As and I saved it as tutorial too.

18
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.660
And I changed this one over here to two.

19
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.920
And that kind of allows us to say the previous one and start working in tutorial too.

20
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.250
All right.

21
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:15.440
So what we're going to do is we're going to move this down just a few new lines by clicking enter.

22
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.260
Also I'm going to extend this window because I find it easier to work like this.

23
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:37.170
And so variables variables are like boxes and boxes were into which you can put some some sort of data

24
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.510
for storage.

25
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:51.450
For example we can have a integer box which is declared or created by using the word int and then we

26
00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.560
type in the name of the box say here will say my integer 1 and then we have to put a semi-colon on and

27
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:12.210
a semicolon kind of completes an operation and turns this line into like an executable line.

28
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:26.640
And so basically my integer is a variable or box which can store in a value an integer value.

29
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.000
That means that it can store any other values it can store a piece of text or store a color or anything

30
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.830
else but it can store an integer.

31
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.680
So how do we put an integer in there.

32
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.020
Well it's pretty simple.

33
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.600
All we have to do is we go by integer one he calls and then we put in an integer value say for example

34
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:59.610
we want to put a 5 in there and that's how we store integers in in this variable.

35
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.150
Now in order to check that this variable has been recorded properly.

36
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.740
We can print what this this got.

37
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.190
The variable is actually what we can print its value and to do that.

38
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.210
We're going to use this alert and we're going we're going to get rid of this hello world part.

39
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.940
Or actually even better are we going to practice using common So we're just going to comment this line

40
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.520
by putting two slashes.

41
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.020
You can see it's turn gray that means it won't be executed anymore.

42
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.060
And we're going to add an alert.

43
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.210
You're going to say alert as last time.

44
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.930
Brackets semicolon and inside it were followed in the quotation marks.

45
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.860
We just going to copy the name of this variable my teacher wanted to make this bit prettier

46
00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.850
and so alert mind teacher one should print the value of my teacher one.

47
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.310
So we're going to compile.

48
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.340
They're going to go back to the terminal.

49
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.690
That's from our last Tauriel.

50
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.200
Here we see each Tauriel to drag and drop.

51
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.800
And as you can see we've got a new message saying 5.

52
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.780
Perfect.

53
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.080
Now we'll go back to our

54
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.010
code and we'll create a new variable.

55
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.720
When and this time we'll create a different variable.

56
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:39.750
This one will be a double double in programming is a variable which can store a decimal point.

57
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.320
So we're going to format this.

58
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.700
OK.

59
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:55.020
So my double one and we're going to give my double one of value and say we're going to get a value of

60
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:10.140
ten point fifty six semi-colon and let's print my double one value and we'll do it in a similar fashion

61
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.690
one.

62
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.510
All right.

63
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.780
And compile.

64
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.880
So we're going to compile we're going to go to the terminal and we're going to drag and drop as you

65
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.430
can see we've got two messages now.

66
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.570
A five and ten point fifty six which is great.

67
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:43.980
Now we'll go back to the program and let's look at what other types of variables we can have we can

68
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:51.290
have a string of something that will be useful in the future.

69
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.080
My strong one then we can have

70
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.690
boolean type of variables which are declared as bull.

71
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.520
This is mind boggling.

72
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.070
And one thing we can have white collar type

73
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.900
or so.

74
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.620
And please notice that you spell it in the American way.

75
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.180
Color for you.

76
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:36.540
And the last time is the time my dear one.

77
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.270
All right.

78
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:45.390
So let's try giving these a few values for example we'll give my string.

79
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.510
And you can see him cowhorse quite smart very prompting us to choose this variable.

80
00:07:52.550 --> 00:08:00.350
And that kind of says tired from typing enter my string 1 and then here you can give a string as you

81
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.710
remember from previous Turrell strings are have to be in quotation marks.

82
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:20.950
So here you can specify a string like you find a cure all and my boolean one it can be a true or false

83
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.350
value.

84
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.360
So true for example.

85
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:31.020
And yet we're not going to worry about color and date time at this stage.

86
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.200
We'll just stop them.

87
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:49.550
These so called alert that alert here will put in my string in my bill and we'll compile that and see

88
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.640
how it runs.

89
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:59.580
We've got two warnings saying that these variables are not used and that's fine we'll just comment these

90
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:07.220
out because we're not using them at this stage just compile that no errors no warnings.

91
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.860
And hopefully we should see four messages this time.

92
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.580
Go to the terminal drag and drop to Tauriel turn.

93
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.300
And here we can see.

94
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.360
So that was the end of our last message.

95
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:27.050
You can see based on time and then this time we got four messages and we got five ten point fifty six.

96
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.630
My name is Carol and true.

97
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.150
So basically that's how you create and use variables.

98
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.490
Don't forget to flip it.

99
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.630
Think of them as boxes of different types.

100
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:48.880
So each box can only store variables of its own type and certain values of it's on time.

101
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.480
And that's all for today.

102
00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.310
Have a play around with that and the source code is available will be available on.

103
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.110
For example dog home and until the next tutorial at decoding.
