Hello this is Carol from forewings about dot com.

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.210
And welcome to this 13th tutorial in our course on algorithmic trading for complete beginners.

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.870
And today we're starting a new section in our course which is going to be about system design and trading

4
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.620
function and sending orders working with prices and so on.

5
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.930
So is a very exciting part and I'm really glad that you've made it this far.

6
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.180
We're going to be delving deeper into the actual Forex market and finally starts to do some basic algorithmic

7
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.730
trading today in today's tutorial we're not going to actually code anything right away.

8
00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.380
We're going to focus on understanding how systems are designed and what what basically goes into the

9
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.370
foundation of a programming system or an algorithmic trading system.

10
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:21.090
And I think it is an important part and it illustrates this tutorial illustrate that if any kind of

11
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.960
algorithmic system development you first have to sit down and understand what you need to do what you

12
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.280
want to create.

13
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.690
And sometimes I even recommend writing these things down on a paper for yourself so that you when you

14
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.620
do start coding you understand exactly what the requirements are and what the algorithm will look like

15
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:56.970
because clear requirements will always make your programming experience much more pleasurable and seamless

16
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.300
and you won't have to stop and rethink things along the way.

17
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.010
So here I have a Eurodollar chart open in front of me.

18
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.060
And pretty lucky that today is actually the weekend it's Saturday so the markets are not working and

19
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.440
we're going to take advantage of that.

20
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.060
So the prices are still and we're going to just discuss what would happen what what we'd want to do

21
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300
if we could trade now.

22
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.750
But because the market is still we will not have this problem the price moving around so it kind of

23
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.700
discussing a freeze frame of the market.

24
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:47.520
This is a bar chart and I'm just going to change it to a line line graph so that it's easier to discuss.

25
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.260
So there's less clutter on the chart.

26
00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:02.130
Right now the price prices 1.3 6 0 8 for your dollar and the big price is one point thirty six or six.

27
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.850
So the surprise I'm sure you're aware of this but I'll just recap to ask prices are always higher than

28
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.860
the bid price.

29
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.160
And basically the ask price is the price and it's the dearer price.

30
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.610
If you want to buy euros for dollars you're going to have to do it at the ask price.

31
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:34.520
So for every one euro you're going to have to pay one point thirty six 0 8 American dollars and conversely

32
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.470
the price is always less than ask price it's the cheaper of the two.

33
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.820
So basically if you're one if you want to sell a euros for dollars you're going to get this amount of

34
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.980
dollars for every euro.

35
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.960
And the difference between them is called the spread so that in essence the spread is is what at what

36
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:06.240
disadvantage are ordered that the price you pay for conducting these transactions has an important part.

37
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.100
Because in how algorithms we're going to have to take into account both the ask the big price and understand

38
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.790
where to use which one.

39
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:25.850
So let's see what oh let's try to understand what kind of system we would possibly want to design in

40
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.140
this particular instance.

41
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.420
We can really from from what we see we can't really tell whether the price is going to go up or is going

42
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.080
to go down.

43
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.810
So for argument's sake let's suggest that the price is going to go up.

44
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:49.750
So what would we need in a algorithmic trading system that is going to buy euros euros against dollars.

45
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.220
And because the prices are going up we want to buy Euro's cheap and then when the price goes up we want

46
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.310
to sell them.

47
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:04.670
So first of all we're going to have to understand how far do we think the prices go up by.

48
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.710
And let's for example think say there's going to be 10 pips that the price is going to increase by.

49
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.290
And so basically it will get to the level of 1.3 6 1 6.

50
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.840
And if you notice here I'm using the bid price.

51
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.660
So how this works is influenced by euros for dollars.

52
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:37.120
We're going to have to use the ask price to buy them and for every for every one euro we are going to

53
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.480
have to pay one point three six or eight dollars.

54
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.400
But then if we want to sell them we're going to be selling at the big price.

55
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:50.260
So this gap over here is it's already our disadvantages already what we lose just by initiating this

56
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.310
transaction and therefore we have to take into account so if we want to earn 10 pips on the movement

57
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.440
upward movement of your dollar we're going to have to base our calculations on the bid price.

58
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.550
So their initial transaction will occur at the ask price but further on we are going to be dealing with

59
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:18.120
the bid price and we will be trying to close the transaction at the bid price.

60
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.230
So if we're 110 Pipps is going to be a 1.3 6 1 6.

61
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:32.890
So that's the first part and you'd think that that is the full extent of the trading system but that

62
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:40.270
wouldn't be correct because if we also have to take into account a possible downward movement and we

63
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.780
have to protect our position from very high losses.

64
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.560
So let's see what is the maximum that we can afford to lose.

65
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.340
Let's say it's also 10 pips.

66
00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:04.290
So in that case we need to set a stop loss at bid minus 10 pips which is one point 3 5 9 6.

67
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:15.190
So as you can see a simple trading system that suggests an upward movement has to have certain factors

68
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.870
built into it.

69
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.830
It has to open a position at the ask price then has to have a take profit at the bid price plus 10 pips

70
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.650
and has to have a stop light and stop loss at the bid price minus tenpins.

71
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.940
Now let's look at a different situation where for example here on the A Canadian dollar where we see

72
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.400
more of the chart and we've made some.

73
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.910
We're going to make some and now we can do some analysis and try to understand the future movements

74
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.290
and predict exactly where it's going to where the Chaska is going to move.

75
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.910
So here marked the asking price.

76
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:05.100
And here you can see the differences a bit higher it's actually a Pip's between the Oskin bit and then

77
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.640
because this is not a euro or Canadian dollar is not a major paper it's across.

78
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:23.200
So here we can see that there's been a substantial move upward and the price has reached this level

79
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.890
of uncertainty around the one point for six zeros is just across that and previous experience suggests

80
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.910
that sometimes the price can turn around at this level and go backwards.

81
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.950
And so that's what we're going to bet on.

82
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:47.340
We're going to suggest we're going to speculate that the price is going to go down from here.

83
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:55.880
And it is going to reach a certain level and we're going to try to capitalize on that.

84
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:04.000
So here we here I've identified a level where there was another uncertainty at one point four five four

85
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.410
or five or somewhere around there where historically the price has experienced you know turn turning

86
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:19.710
points or some kind of uncertainty around where it's going to move.

87
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.750
So what we will do is we'll use that level and we'll expect the price to go down to that level but we

88
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.770
will exit the position just before the price gets there and that will put us on the safe side.

89
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:42.210
So we'll exit the position at the blue line and then that way we can avoid getting into this.

90
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:48.840
Getting close to this level where the price may turnaround and may not turn around so exiting at the

91
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.820
blue line is being on the safe side.

92
00:09:51.870 --> 00:10:00.510
So if we have a sell position which will open here at the big price then the take profit we're going

93
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:06.090
to set at one point 4 5 5 5 percent.

94
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:13.400
As the previous example we need a stop loss and for sell position stop loss goes up to the top.

95
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.560
So here we see a level where the price has previously turned around.

96
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:28.560
So what we'll do is we will speculate that if the price does go up or against our position there is

97
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.680
a probability that it will actually turn around at the yellow line and then go down like you do here

98
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.170
and reach our take profits so we can actually still make money.

99
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:47.520
So in that case we would want to set the Stop-Loss above the yellow line so we don't lose this opportunity

100
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.460
of the price actually turning around and that says that means that the stop loss would be set at around

101
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.170
1 point 4 6 4 5.

102
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:10.320
So in this case you see that take profit is around 50 pips and the stop loss is around 40 pips or basically

103
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.860
to be more correct.

104
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.710
We have to be working with the ask price.

105
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:28.530
So the take profit is fifty seven pips up losses around 33 pips.

106
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:38.370
So to sum up this strategy even though it is similar to the previous one which we discussed here these

107
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:46.120
strategies have different requirements in the first strategy we would say choosing an entry level level

108
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.120
based on the market price and then we were setting the stop loss and take profit take profit and stop

109
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.030
loss based on a fixed number of pips which was 10 pips for both.

110
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.540
In this strategy this approach is different.

111
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:08.800
We are still using the market price to enter but to exit we're not using a fixed stop loss or take profit

112
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.760
to exit.

113
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:18.850
We're actually using prices price levels which we see on the market and we're moving away a little bit

114
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.720
from them.

115
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:29.770
So that means that the algorithmic trading systems will be similar but will be different from each other

116
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:38.950
in the sense that the parameters of these systems in the first case it will be the levels or the absolute

117
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.890
values distances of the stop loss and take profit from the market price.

118
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:52.360
But in the second situation the input parameters will actually be fixed prices which the trader chooses

119
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.100
based on his analysis of the current of the currency pair.

120
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.670
So that's in a nutshell what algorithmic trading system design is about.

121
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.860
And of course it gets more complex and more involved and has much more aspects to it.

122
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:21.990
But these are the basics and I hope you found that helpful and maybe you could look at some of the charts

123
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:32.790
in your trading platform and try to understand what strategy you would apply as in each situation and

124
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.880
in the next tutorial we're going to look at how we can actually turn this logic into code and how we

125
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.920
can create scripts will which will implement this logic for us.

126
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.180
And I think you will find the next Tauriel very exciting.

127
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.210
So that's it for the Statoil.

130
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.390
So for now until next time happy coding.
