00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,030
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to briefly discuss how to get help for it.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,750
Ash Now usually the best way and most useful way to get help with cash is to reference the documentation

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:22,250
online directly where you can do is also quickly generate help with two separate methods.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:28,000
One is the help function call inside of Python and the other is a pie doc call at your terminal.

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,600
Let's discuss how these both work by jumping over to our editor.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,080
OK here we are at our editor what I want to now point out is let's imagine you were going to import

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,570
Dasch each team as components as each team.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,480
And you had a question on each team L that.

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,870
You just weren't sure and you want more information about it something you can always do and you can

10
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,990
do this for any component object as you can print out the results of the help function call on this

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,990
particular object.

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,420
And each of these components is well documented.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,780
That way you can actually see the entire documentation for whatever Dasch component you're interested

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,440
in.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,130
So I'm going to run this but I'm going to zoom out a little bit in our call here so I can see the entire

16
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:12,820
result.

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,580
So down at the bottom I'm running just a file here Python base that pi or whatever you happen to call

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,240
this.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,910
And as a result you should be able to see help on class div in module built ins and I'll say more.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,500
So what you do is here it's terminal.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,930
You keep hitting enter and eventually it will if I expand this show you the entire documentation for

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,180
this particular component.

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,560
So essentially all the keyword arguments that this class can take things like style and also show you

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,730
different links that are useful to you.

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,050
Available events and a lot more information.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,870
So this sort of kind of an API information that you can get off any component in Dasch keep any answer

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,960
you'll get all this information here.

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,960
OK.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,380
So that's one way to do it.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,620
Again it's just simply calling the help function and then printing out the results of that and when

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,460
type CLX to clear this.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,940
Or if you're on Mac or Linux you can type clear.

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:11,240
Let's zoom back in the other way you can quickly generate help for any component is by doing the following.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,660
Let's imagine again you wanted help with the divx component that's inside.

35
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:23,410
Each time components at your command line where you can do is say P-doc dasht W for right and then type

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,980
in the actual library that you're importing from.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,380
HTL components and then dot and then whatever object you're interested in.

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,180
For example the div..

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,600
So let's make sure we spell this right components.

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,190
So here I'm saying PI dock space dash w space Dash 8 to components that.

41
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,120
And when you run this what's going to happen is this will automatically generate an H team L5 for you.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
So let's go to our file browser and open up a steam file.

43
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,280
When you click on it it should automatically open in your browser.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,210
OK so here I am and examples.

45
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,780
And now I see this dash HTL components that that HCM l file and if I double click on this you should

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,020
then see something that ends up looking like this.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,720
Essentially all the information that was in the help call except now it's nicely formatted as HVM.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,880
So that's another option that you can have in case you want to quickly generate documentation based

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,910
off what's available to you in your downloaded version of HTL components or really any Dasch components.

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,130
As always I would recommend you check online first but maybe you're on a train or something or just

51
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,280
a quick help and you don't have access to the Internet at that point.

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,060
You can always run these commands that we just showed you here.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,280
All right thanks very much and we'll see you at the next lecture.
