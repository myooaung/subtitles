00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.550
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.240
It's time again to test your new skills for Bartsch hurts in this lecture.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.220
We'll have a quick overview of the exercise and then the following lecture will go over the solutions.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.550
Let's get started by going over your exercise.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.400
Hi ascript.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.110
All right so here we are at the exercise that PI script the objective for this exercise is to create

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.520
a stacked bar chart from a data file and that data file is underneath the data folder it's called the

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.750
maake surveyed thought CSP.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.770
And we should note that the questions appear in the index of this thought see as we file.

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.620
So you can use that for the x axis while responses appear as column labels.

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.570
Now is extra credit.

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.070
You can go ahead and make a horizontal bar chart.

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.930
Let's take a quick look at what this should appear like.

14
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.520
Once you've actually created the figure and then if you want I'll give you a couple more hints or we

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.830
can skip forward to try it yourself and then go to the solutions.

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.090
First off let's see what the actual bar charts should look like.

17
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.380
All right.

18
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.180
So this is what the completed bar charts should look like.

19
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.090
We have a bar question one question to question three and then we can see the stacks of strongly agree

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.180
somewhat disagree all the way to neutral and strongly agree here.

21
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.330
And if you do the extra credit which is to make this a horizontal bar plot it would then look something

22
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.970
like this.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.060
It's the same thing just the axes have been switched.

24
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.120
All right.

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.280
Now if you want you can go ahead and attempt that yourself.

26
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.120
But what I'm going to do now is give you a couple of hints on how to work with the actual CFE file that

27
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.950
may help you out a bit if you're having trouble at the panda section as far as creating the traces for

28
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.730
each of these bar plots.

29
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.550
So let's go back to that script.

30
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.500
OK let's give you a few hints as far as dealing with this CACP file because the pand those for this

31
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.710
may be a little tricky especially if you're new to panderers.

32
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.060
Once you've done your imports you're going to want to read in your data frame.

33
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.070
But keep in mind that for this particular CXXVI file that the questions appear in the index and you

34
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.290
can use that for the x axis.

35
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.920
So what I mean by that is when you're reading in your data frame you should do the following.

36
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.350
You can say Dhia physical to PD read V and set that equal to that dataset member it's muk survey.

37
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.360
And then as an additional parameter you can say Index underscore C L and set an index column.

38
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.220
And if you set that to 0 then when you read in this data frame you're going to have access to those

39
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.520
actual questions through the index.

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.580
So that means during your list comprehension of data is equal to.

41
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.990
And you would create a list comprehension go that bar and then inside here you'll be able to do something

42
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.430
now that you have the index column set to 0.

43
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.340
That's going to be the very first column that CSP file.

44
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:50.500
You can be able to set X as equal to DFT index here and that's going to be something like for response

45
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.410
in the columns and then I'll let you try to figure out why I should be here.

46
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.910
But it's essentially going to be just calling that response column in your data frame.

47
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.900
If you get stuck on this feel free to check out the solutions.

48
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.140
A lot of this is basically just using tricks with pandas and list comprehension more so than plot Lee.

49
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.540
And to be honest that happens quite a bit.

50
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.950
Usually I have to massage your data a little bit in order to fit platies syntax.

51
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.500
OK.

52
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.870
We'll see you at the solutions.
