00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,250
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,830
Let's quickly go over the solution for the bubble chart exercise.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,080
OK here we are at the exercise file.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,870
The main objective was really just create a bubble chart from the NPG that CXXVI data set and you had

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,880
a lot of leeway over what the three features you wanted to use were.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,550
So let's go ahead and walk over or walk through one quick example of how you may have done that.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,670
First we want to do our imports.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,820
I will just copy and paste this from the solution.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,760
It's as always Polly off line graph objects empanadas.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,230
PD then we want to create a data frame from RC A C file.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:48,230
So PD read C S V and we'll go ahead and say from that data folder and Peachi that CSP and then we want

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,180
to create our data.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,590
So here we creer data lists and inside of this we'll have a call to scatter.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,890
And for example we'll use the displacement column.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:10,840
So we'll say if displacement and then we'll say why is acceleration so acceleration.

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,500
And then finally let's say text is going to be equal to f name.

17
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,630
And now it's up to us to really decide what we're going to choose for that marker in order to do that.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,880
We first need to set our mode to be equal to marker or markers and then we can decide what we're going

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,170
to find that marker by.

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,540
So for this we pass in a dictionary and we'll say size is equal to.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,360
And let's go ahead and use the weight of the car.

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,120
So we'll say weights and because weights is such a large value in that column we're going to need to

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,580
divide it by some factor in order for the diameters to make sense.

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,060
So we can divide it by for instance 400 and you can play around with that division and you can play

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,530
around with this marker size really.

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,980
It's up to you which one of these fields or columns you want to use so please wait.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,060
And we did an example of this very similar intellectual lecture and then we'll create our layout.

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,330
So we'll say lay out is equal to go that way.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,480
And here we'll just say hover mode is equal to closest

30
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,340
closest and we can also give it a title.

31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,740
So it's that as well.

32
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,440
We'll say titles equal to my bubble solution.

33
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,390
OK we'll save that.

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,370
And if you want you can also add an x axis and y axis title.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,730
But really this is almost the recreation of what we did in the actual lecture.

36
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,460
So say figure is equal to go figure.

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:56,630
Passing data equal to data and lay out equal to lay out helps and we'll plot this out.

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,820
We'll say plot and plot out that figure.

39
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,200
Let's save this and make sure it works.

40
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,390
Basic thought PI run that.

41
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,290
And here I can see my solution.

42
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,810
So your solution may look differently the pending on what you actually decided to plot but you can see

43
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,900
here as we hover over we get to see the actual differences between the three features that we decided

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,140
on.

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,730
Weight displacement and acceleration.

46
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,280
OK.

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,610
So that's really all there was to it.

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,570
It was kind of up to you what's the pasand for x y.

49
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,550
And then how to deal this size.

50
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,030
If you were having issues of the bubbles not showing up or the bubbles being too small it's most likely

51
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,850
that you need to adjust the actual size parameter there either by dividing it or by multiplying it depending

52
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,630
on what actual values that column or feature had.

53
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,990
All right.

54
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,940
If you have any questions feel free to check out the solution that postscript or post the Q&amp;A forums.

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,320
We'll see you at the next lecture.
