00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,190
Now that we understand how to create distribution plots with politely Let's quickly test your skills

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,840
with an exercise in this lecture or go over the exercise file and show you what the end result should

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,620
look like.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,920
OK here we have the exercise for the distribution plot and the objective here is using the famous Iris

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,400
dataset which is a data set containing some information about flowers.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,370
We want to develop a distribution plot that compares the pedal lengths of each class so the file itself

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,110
is underneath the data folder it's Iris CXVII.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,350
It has several fields or columns which are basically simple length simple with pedal length and pedal

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,520
with and then a class call them and the classes that are available in that column are Irus Tosa Iris.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,380
First color and Iris virginica.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,880
And in case you're not familiar with this iris dataset basically what it is is every row contains measurements

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,370
of the length and width and pedal length and pedal width of a particular instance of flour.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,750
And that instance of flour can be three different species of Iris.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,650
Iris Tosa Iris first color and Iris virginica.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,750
So what we want you to do is create a distribution plot for the pedal lengths feature so that pedal

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,900
underscore length for each of these separate classes.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,630
So you're going to perform your imports create a data frame to find the traces.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,580
Now we've left you a little hints here as far as how to actually grab the pedal length column for a

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,060
particular flower.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,880
Probably the easiest way to do it if I uncomment this is to say grab the data frame were they to frame

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,460
class happens to be equal to Irus and then whatever particular species or flower class you want and

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,440
then off of that in the same line you can then grab the pedal length column.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,490
So this could be the pedal length information for this particular class.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,260
All right so that's a little hint for you.

26
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,270
Again it's mostly deals of pandas.

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,160
Once you've done that you should end up with three traces set up at a variable and then you'll have

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,870
three traces one for each ires species.

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,720
So let me show you quickly what that should look like at the end.

30
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,150
OK so this is what the finished distribution plot should look like.

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,790
So we see here the distribution for Iris the Tosa and Iris virginica and Iris versicolor as well as

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,240
the rug plot and basically the main idea behind this is we can see the iris at Tosa as far as its length

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,010
is concerned.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,430
This blue one is quite different than Iris virginica and Iris versicolor so we can clearly see the iris

35
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,110
Tosa has quite a different pedal length than these two other species of irises.

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,730
All right.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,130
Do you have any questions feel free to post to any forums in the next lecture.

38
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,690
We'll go over an example solution.
