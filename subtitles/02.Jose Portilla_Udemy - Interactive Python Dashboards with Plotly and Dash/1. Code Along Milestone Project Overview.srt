00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,380
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,030
It's finally time to combine everything you learned in the course so far to a larger milestone project.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,310
In this lecture we're going to do an overview of that project basically we're going to be building as

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,570
a stock price dashboard project where you will be able to pick a different stock ticker from a dropdown

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,110
menu and then once you hit submit and choose your dates you'll be able to see the actual historical

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,180
prices of that stock.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,220
Now there's two main approaches you can do.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
The first approach is for the more independent and ambitious student where you like to tackle projects

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,940
on your own so you can do is at the end of this lecture once you seen what the dashboard looks like

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,790
try to recreate that yourself without actually looking at the scripts to start out with.

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:53,380
So you get an idea of what a dashboard looks like either by seeing it online such as in this video or

12
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,550
by thinking about it in your head and then you try to use what you already know about plotless and dash

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,290
to recreate that actual dashboard.

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,600
Keep in mind there's going to be a few new elements that we haven't discussed yet for this dashboard

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,970
but it's always nice to tackle on that challenge just like you would in a real world situation.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,100
And if you ever need a hint you can use the various scripts we have for you in the hub repo.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,900
The second approach you can take is just follow along with the lectures for this larger code along project.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,510
We've broken down this project into more manageable benchmarks so you can go along and test everything

19
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,410
you've gone so far that way you can make sure that you're building a true understanding of plotless

20
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,410
and dash.

21
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,650
It's really up to you what approach you prefer.

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,120
Different students are going to like different approaches.

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,250
Now keep in mind there is a separate guidebook for this project as a resource.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,580
Definitely check out the resource link for this lecture on the overview and you'll be links to a separate

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,600
google doc for the stock ticker project.

26
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,660
The other thing I want to mention is that this project is dependent on the internet especially in the

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,560
later phases of the project and the Panas data reader library.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,940
If you're not familiar with the pandas data reader library basically it's an additional library for

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,050
Pancho's that allows you to grab stock price information and historical information online.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,540
However the panda data reader library is updated really often because a lot of times the API calls for

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,480
stock information change.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,950
For example it used to be really popular to use the Google API or the Yahoo API for the pandas data

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,770
reader library but now those API has change enough so that it's broken.

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,150
So now we're using API such as eye X for the investors exchange or Morningstar.

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,600
However in the future maybe you're watching this six months from now or one week from now you never

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:34,900
know.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
It may change or update.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,570
So we're going to want to do is be highly aware of the later half of this project.

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,430
We're using Panas data reader you may need to look up the latest documentation of Hannas data reader

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,830
as far as what stream codes provide to actually read API stock data.

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,570
The other question I'm often asked is how you can use Panas data reader to grab international stock

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,530
information.

43
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,280
That also changes quite often.

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,190
So the best reply I can give you at this time is to check out the panda's data reader documentation

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,430
to see what availability there is for international stock markets.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,800
As of right now I'll just officially say that only supports U.S. stock.

47
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,580
But I really encourage you to check the documentation.

48
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,990
It is a project that changes very quickly.

49
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,400
So I'm sure there's updates to help people looking at international stock markets.

50
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,810
Now with all that being said let's check out the dashboard that we're going to be building in this milestone

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,660
project.

52
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:26,970
OK.

53
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,800
Here we are what the final dashboard is going to look like.

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,060
Keep in mind we're really focusing on functionality here not styling.

55
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,240
So it's not the prettiest looking dashboard in the world but it definitely gets the job done.

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:44,170
The main ideas behind what this dashboard can do is you can select stock symbols from either a dropdown

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,840
menu.

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,950
So here all the essentially all the stocks listed on the Nasdaq as of this recording.

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,140
And you can actually search this dropdown menu.

60
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,540
For example if I'm isted and Apple stock begin begin to search the Apple stock ticker AAPL and then

61
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,220
select from the dropdown and add that on.

62
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,280
Then there's also a date picker core component here from dash reken choose the dates that are relevant

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,180
to me.

64
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,160
So maybe I want information from November 2017 to January 2018.

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,060
A third.

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,780
Then I hit submit it will reload grab that information from the Internet and then I get to see the historical

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,310
prices and compare them in this graph here.

68
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,490
And that's really all this dashboard does.

69
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,130
But hopefully I can see here that it's already a lot of really cool ideas and a lot of things that we've

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
already implemented in the past.

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,600
We've already implemented things like dropdown menus but we haven't actually implemented a date picker

72
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,890
but you should know now how to look in the documentation for those core components that we mentioned

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,670
earlier.

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,350
Pick out the date picker and then just plug it into its own div and we've definitely seen how we can

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,520
use callbacks and how we can use callback state to have things execute once you hit submit.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,410
OK.

77
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,820
That's really all this dashboard is going to be doing and we're going to break it down in the next series

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,890
of lectures step by step.

79
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,160
All right let's get started.

80
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,410
I'll see you at the next lecture.
