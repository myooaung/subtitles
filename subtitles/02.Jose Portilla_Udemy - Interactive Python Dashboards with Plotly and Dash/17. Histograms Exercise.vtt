Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.770
Now that we understand how to work with histograms politely Let's test your skills and exercise and

3
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.460
this lecture will quickly over the exercise file and then the next lecture will go over the solutions.

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.080
All right.

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.590
So for the histogram exercise file what we want you to do is create a histogram that plots the length

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.910
field from that abalone dataset that you've worked with before.

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.400
So we're going to set the range from 0 to 1 with has been size of 0.02.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.690
So make sure you add those parameters when you're doing your call for the histogram.

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.470
So you're going to do your imports your data variable create your data frame at the left.

10
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.630
And as always then plot the figure from the data and layout.

11
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.950
So let's see a quick example of what this may look like once you're done.

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.250
So here's the histogram of the show lengths from that dataset.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.050
So we can see here that bin size that we worked out as well as the x axis range goes from zero to 1.

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.830
All right.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.450
If you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums in the next lecture.

16
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.020
We'll go over an example solution.
