00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,430
Welcome back in this section of the course we're going to be talking about deploying your dashboards

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,660
lives to the Web.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,700
But before we talk about deployment is probably a good idea to talk about authentication and authorization

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,050
for your dashboards.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,740
Often when you deploy your dashboards to the Web you're not going to want them to be available to the

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,590
public and dashboard has a separate library that allows you to have a little bit of authentication capability

7
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,970
with your dashboards.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,610
So let's discuss your options as I just mentioned authentication for Dash apps is actually provided

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,520
three separate dash off package and dash off provides two methods of authentication.

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,040
One is the basic auth and the other is Plumley.

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:50,540
Olof ECP basic auth is one of the simplest forms of authentication available on the web as a dash developer.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,400
What you do is you hard code a set of username and password combinations in your actual code and then

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,820
send those user Mansa passwords to your viewers.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,800
There's definitely a few limitations to HTP basic authorization.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,360
One is that user can't really log out of an application.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,230
Two is that you're actually responsible for sending the usernames and passwords to your viewers over

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,430
a secure channel.

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,750
So in your code once you've set up your username and password combination it's up to you to figure out

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,530
how to get those username and passwords to your actual users the other limitations.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,520
Our Your viewers can create their own accounts and they cannot change the password and you're responsible

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,220
for safely storing the username and password pairs in your code.

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,290
Now the other alternative is using Motley's oath and that provides authentication through your online

23
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,450
plotless account or through your company's partly on premise server and as a developer that actually

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,610
requires a paid plotless subscription.

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,520
So this is a big part of how plotless actually runs a business and a service as we just saw basic HTP

26
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,640
authorization has a lot of limitations.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,130
So plotless service is to really give you a full authentication platform through their paid subscription

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,730
or we're going to do now is because we are not going to assume that you want to do a paid subscription

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,030
is going to show you how to add a basic HTP authorisation to your dashboard.

30
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,940
It's actually quite simple.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,180
Just essentially a few lines of code so we're going to take an already existing application and then

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,250
show you how you could add the import statements and the username password pairs in order to have users

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,950
log in and be authorized to use your dashboard.

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,450
Let's get started by jumping over to our text editor.

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,720
All right here I am at my dash application.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,880
Notice I have dash dash core components ex-teammate components and my dependencies import input and

37
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,840
output.

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,000
So as a quick note we've already set this up for you as a file in the actual authorization folder section

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,660
and the basic idea here is we have a range slider and it creates some sort of product.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,270
We've actually created this before.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,650
Let's quickly run this make sure it works well say Python and I've called that basic pie so I'm going

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,470
you hit enter.

43
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,970
Let's see if it runs and then we're going to go visit this dashboard in our browser or here we are a

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,490
browser with this product range slider.

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,080
We've actually seen this before and it appears to be working but right now if I were to deploy this

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,900
life to the Web anyone would have access to this dashboard.

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,460
As long as they knew what your L to visit So it's that we're going to do now is show you how you can

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:16,640
add authorization to your dashboard using the dash off the package if you want more secure authorization.

49
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,720
Praties off well you're going to have to do is pay and sign up for their service.

50
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,060
And at that point it's actually quite easy to implement.

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,970
Essentially you just follow these instructions there.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,130
But let's go back to our text editor and show you how this can be done.

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,620
OK.

54
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,670
So here we are back at our text editor.

55
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,000
We're going to first start doing is our import a dash underscore Auth. and it's quick.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,190
In case you haven't installed it yet.

57
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:44,860
All you need to say is Pipp install dash off at your command line keep in mind when you import it it's

58
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,420
an underscore when you actually Pippin's Thall It's dash.

59
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,860
Once you've important dash off after you've installed it we want to do is set up your username password

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,820
pairs.

61
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:02,230
Technically this can be any variable name but by convention and in the documentation they call it username

62
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,620
password pairs in all caps.

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,130
And then this is where you're actually going to store the list pairs of username and password combinations

64
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,500
and you'll first provide the username and then you'll provide the password that works for it.

65
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,460
Here for example we can see that if someone went with a username they would need to provide the string

66
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,920
password to log into the dashboard.

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
Let's do one more.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:35,240
He will say James Bond and will say their password is the string 0 7 and that's the basic idea behind

69
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,050
your username password pairs.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,980
You set up a username password and then it's going to be up to you how you're actually going to store

71
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,900
this username password combination.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,430
Right now we're just storing it as a list inside or a script which may or may not be secure enough for

73
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,390
your use case.

74
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:55,010
And then it's up to you also to send this username and password pair to whoever is going to be using

75
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,390
your application.

76
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,520
So you can already see that there are definitely limitations here.

77
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,070
And the big reason for that is because plotless service for the dashboard is kind of taking care of

78
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:10,700
all these issues with HTP authorization now that we've imported dash off and set up a username password

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,310
pairs.

80
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,950
The last step that we need to do is create a variable called off and then set that equal to dash off

81
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:28,660
dot and we're going to say basic auth and then we will say pass the application and pass our username

82
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,980
password pairs.

83
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,440
Now all you have to do in order to register these username password pairs to your application for basic

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,760
authorization.

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,930
Once you've done that we're going to run this and see what the dashboard looks like.

86
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:48,580
Now let's head over to her browser OK once you're in your browser you're going to notice now it's asking

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,380
for authentication required so let's provide a username and then I'm going to type out password here.

88
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,440
Click log in and then you'll have access to what you have here.

89
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,220
And Google Chrome may ask you when as you say never here but that's the basic idea behind authorization.

90
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,640
You just store your username password combinations in your code or maybe on your environment variable

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,280
somehow it's really up to you.

92
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,350
And then you send that to wherever your users are and then log in for plotless own authorization.

93
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,700
All you need to do is sign up for their services and they basically have a graphical user interface

94
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,990
free to use to really quickly and easily set up your dashboards there.

95
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,370
And often they have an onboarding process to help you of that as well.

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
I should just clarify I don't work for Lee.

97
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,040
So it's really up to you if you want to buy their services or not.

98
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:34,810
OK.

99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,440
Thanks.

100
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,030
And you can check out the guidebook for more information as far as accessing authorization and also

101
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,930
signing up for the oath.

102
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,290
We'll see you at the next lecture where we go over the placement.
