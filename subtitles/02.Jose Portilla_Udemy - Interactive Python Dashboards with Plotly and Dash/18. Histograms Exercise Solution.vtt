Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.880
Let's now go over the solution for the histogram exercise.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.200
All right.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.790
So this exercise should have been pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.400
And in general his rooms usually are straightforward.

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.860
The only things you have to really deal with are choosing a correct size.

7
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.310
So we'll just quickly do our imports.

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.370
That's partly off line as I know.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.000
And then in poor Plott lead graph objects as go and then import.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.810
So let's fix that import panderers as PD then we'll read in our dataset so I'll say DNA is equal to

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.390
PD.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.790
Read CXXVI and began working with that abalone dataset thought cxxviii file and time to create our data

13
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.580
variable.

14
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.470
So for this inside our data variable list we will create go that histogram then we'll just say x is

15
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.580
equal to the length column of that data frame and we just need to provide X bins.

16
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.190
So these arguments were actually asked up here and they objected.

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
So we want to set the range from 0 to 1 with the size of 0.02.

18
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.330
So let's go ahead and do that.

19
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.840
That means we create dictionary inside of X bins or say start is equal to zero and is equal to 1.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.970
Size is equal to zero point zero to.

21
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.720
And that's really all we need to do.

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.090
If you wanted to add in a lay up you can do that as well.

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.420
So we can say lay out go that lay out and here you can just say like a title.

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.920
So my histogram.

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.700
And finally let's go ahead we'll say fig is equal to go figure passen data is equal to data and layout

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.730
layout is equal to Leo.

27
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.090
And then Pyu Wyo. the plot that Fig.

28
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.010
Let's save that and run it and make sure everything worked out.

29
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.860
And here you can see my results so I get this Mr. Graham.

30
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.910
The range looks correct as well as the bin size.

31
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.820
OK.

32
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.870
That's all there is to it.

33
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.000
Remember that if you start resizing this window it may start to appear a little different too.

34
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.590
But overall you've been size should have been a point zero or two and you can check that these ranges

35
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.900
as you move your cursor if you have any questions feel free to post the Q Any forums.

36
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.910
We'll see you at the next lecture.
