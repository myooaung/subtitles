00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,730
And this lecture we're going to talk about box plot's box plots visualize the variation of a feature

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,500
by depicting the continuous numerical data through core tiles.

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,880
We could then separate data based on a categorical feature to compare the continuous feature based off

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,230
the category.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,480
So basically what this means is you may have a case where you have one column of continuous data such

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,300
as the weights of a person then right next to it you have another column of a category such as gender

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,420
male or female.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,720
What you would then be able to do using a box plot is compare the distribution of weights between the

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,660
territories male weights versus female weights.

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,710
So we're going to see a visual example very similar to that in just a little bit but let's talk a little

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,060
more detail about this quartiles.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,660
So the box plot is a way of visually displaying that data distribution through their core tiles where

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,830
core tiles separate the data into four equal parts.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,130
So you have your bottom 25 percent then the next upper 25 percent.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,950
The 25 percent of data points on top of that and then your top 25 percent.

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,620
And what the box plot likes do is show the top and bottom 25 percent and then it fills in the little

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,850
box of the middle 50 percent.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,130
So you have 25 top 50 middle and then 25 bottom.

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,320
So let's see what that actually looks like visually.

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,620
Here you can see the box plots where we're doing a comparison of two categories.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,280
Sample a and sample B all the x axis and we have a continuous y axis feature.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,830
So there's some continuous scale feature we want to compare between sample A and sample B.

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,420
And we can already see here some information about the distributions in comparison to each other.

25
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,590
So let's talk about what these actual lines and markers mean on your box.

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,970
What's nice about plot Li is that as you hover over one of these boxes it's going to show you the actual

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,490
information of this box plot.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,490
So the middle line that's the median So the median recall that's the values separating the higher half

29
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,980
of a data sample from the lower half.

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,890
So that's kind of right in the middle of your data that we have.

31
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,520
Q1 and Q3.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,630
So between between Q1 and Q3 that's the filled in box that's where the middle 50 percent of your data

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,460
lies.

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,450
And then you have the min and the max and those are sometimes called wiskers so often a box plot is

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,430
called a box and a whisker plot because you have that middle 50 percent inside the box and then the

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,100
wiskers that expand to the top and bottom 25 percent.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,870
Up for 100 percent of your data.

38
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,970
So that box range between Q3 and Q1 that's often known as IQ.

39
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,340
So that's the intercourse tile range and that's basically the middle 50 percent of your data.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Now depending on the styling max and min values are going to be shown with whiskers.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,320
So we can see here those whiskers that extend from that box we that minimum value and the maximum value

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,150
a box plot identifies outliers from the median compared to the rest of the data.

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,230
So in this particular image there are no outliers but in just a second where we actually start coating

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,480
the box plots we'll be able to see examples of outliers that are displayed as markers beyond the whisker

45
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,340
so outliers for box plots those are defined for the upper outliers.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,620
Those are values that are larger than the Q3 value bet least 1.5 times the IQ are.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,120
So recall the I.Q. are that's going to be Q3 minus Q1.

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,390
So the actual length of that box.

49
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,960
And if you're an outlier then if you multiply the value of Q3 minus Q1 otherwise known as I.Q. are by

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,990
1.5 times you have to be larger than Q3 by at least 1.5 times the IQ are.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,250
So those are upper outliers and for smaller or lower outliers so things that go below that bottom whisker

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,310
there's going to be values that are smaller than Q1 the bottom of the box by at least 1.5 times the

53
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:59,210
I.Q. or so outliers are going to be displayed as singular markers outside the wiskers.

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,370
What's really cool about box plots is that we can actually use box plots to perform a real analysis.

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,690
So we're going to be exploring not just how to create the box plots but also how to apply them to a

56
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,630
real problem.

57
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,130
To discuss this problem for a second it really classic forensic example of using Box plots and Applied

58
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,010
Statistics is there's this famous case where Mark Twain was accused of being a confederate deserter

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,500
during the Civil War.

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,370
And the evidence that was given for that were 10 essays that were published in the New Orleans daily

61
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,880
daily Crescent under the name Quintus Curtius Snodgrass.

62
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,210
However in 1963 a researcher published an article in The Journal of American Statistical Association

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,120
where he used word frequencies and a chi squared test to show that the essays were almost certainly

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,040
not Mark Twain's because of the different usage of the length of words.

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,980
And what we can do is we can use box plots to compare to collections of samples to each other and analyze

66
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,450
or distributions for example in this case for Mark Twain and this other author that people are saying

67
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,740
is also Mark Twain.

68
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,750
What we can do is compare the word length accounts between the two authors and see how related there

69
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,130
are.

70
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,180
And if we notice that one author uses word lengths that are much higher than another author then we

71
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,280
can begin to make an analysis depicting that these are probably two different authors or at least two

72
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,170
very different writing styles.

73
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,980
So we're going to start off of some simple examples of Bach's plot features and then we'll show the

74
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,770
Mark Twain analysis for the data used in these examples look at the lists created underneath the box

75
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,800
plot folder inside the box plot that PI script.

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,320
So instead of having really small CXXVI files instead we're just going to manually copy and paste the

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,780
Python list that's already provided for you underneath the box plot that PI script.

78
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,180
So there in the coding if you see me suddenly copy and paste something it's coming from the top Paice

79
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,600
group that's underneath the box plot folder.

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,690
So just be aware that as you follow along with the coding.

81
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,140
OK let's hop over to the text editor.

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,460
OK.

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,920
Here we are at the text editor.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,900
I've gone ahead and put it off line and graph objects when I'm going to do now is set up an array of

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,060
20 data points.

86
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,490
Again you can just copy and paste these from box 1 pi.

87
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,730
So I will do that now.

88
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,820
And then we're going to start off by creating a very simple box plot and adding more and more features

89
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,800
to it.

90
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,160
So for a box plot you create our data list and say go box

91
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,350
and in this case we're gonna just say Y is equal to y notice and we just have one array of data.

92
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,010
We don't need to specify some categorical X column.

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,600
So then we're just going to do that and say p p so that plot and pass in our data and that's all we

94
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,390
do.

95
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:50,390
So I'll say Python basic about pi enter and check out the plot that comes out of this so Uno's as you

96
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,000
bring in your plot we have a very simple box plot and you can see those minimum values and those max

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,780
values.

98
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,160
And the reason we have a minimax values is because that middle value is at least 1.5 times IQ are less

99
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,560
than the bottom of q 1.

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,300
So that allows us to set these little points here so we can see 54 and 1 on the bottom and then we have

101
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,840
the median values Q One.

102
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:22,250
Q 3 and then what they call the upper fence and lower fence in order to clearly show where are the actual

103
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,080
25 percent 50 percent.

104
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,180
That middle box of your data is.

105
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,800
So we're going to add a couple more features.

106
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,140
Box plot to give it a little more kick.

107
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,240
So we're going to do now instead of just saying why is equal to y.

108
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,640
We can say something like Bach's points is equal to all.

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,530
And what this does is it's going to display all the original data points.

110
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,280
So now when you run this you'll be able to see dots for every point which gives you a little more insight

111
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,910
into the distribution and it's going to if you just do box points all will show all the points right

112
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,980
next to them here.

113
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,800
So you can see the various points here to the left of the actual box plus.

114
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,040
So you get see now both all the data and essentially a summary of the data which is kind of nice and

115
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,960
we can continue doing here is adding more features.

116
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,910
And one of them is called jitter so jitter what it's going to do is you can choose a value somewhere

117
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,300
between like 0 and 1.

118
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,160
So it's going to spread them all out so they all appear.

119
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,430
If you have a lot of data points that's actually a really nice thing to do.

120
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,120
And what you can do is you can actually choose their offset position.

121
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,000
So if you want.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,810
You can say points POS.

123
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,200
So that's point position and set that equal to.

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,900
If it's negative it's going to be offset from the box.

125
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,080
If it's positive it's going to be offset to the right.

126
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,380
So negative is offset to the left positive is offset to the right.

127
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,780
And if you set 0 here what it's going to do is it should put them right on top of that box.

128
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,950
So let's run Python based on PI again.

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
And now we can see here that we have the points right on top of the box.

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,840
So sometimes that's not really useful.

131
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,580
So maybe we want to move to the right.

132
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:08,380
What I can do is say point position is equal to something like 2.0 and that's going to position them

133
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,060
over to the right of that box plot.

134
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,570
And there we can see positions to the right.

135
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,740
So the more jitter value add the more spread out these points are going to be left and right.

136
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,080
So illin they'll maintain the y values.

137
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,140
But if you have a lot of points if they're kind of stacked right next to each other you'll just see

138
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,020
a bunch of points on top of each other.

139
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,910
So you can use jittered to add a little bit of noise to spread them out.

140
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,480
OK.

141
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,380
So that's the very basics of the options that are available to you.

142
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,520
For a box plot we're going to do now is move on to the code for box to that pi and we're going to do

143
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:49,890
is set box points to only display outliers.

144
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,320
And then we run this.

145
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,630
It basically shows you what we had before.

146
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,320
So it's a python base but PI and now typically this is what you're going to do for a box plot you'll

147
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,270
just say okay only show me the outliers as points sometimes you want to see all the results for the

148
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,520
box points sometimes you don't.

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,740
It's really up to you.

150
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,620
But keep in mind if you see this box points equal to outliers you're basically specifically asking to

151
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,570
only show me the outliers on those points.

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
So now we're going to do is finally do that Mark Twain analysis.

153
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,880
So for that we're going to grab some data from a box 3 that pi.

154
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,020
So I have Snodgrass and Twain and what these numbers actually represent.

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,660
These are the relative frequencies of three letter words from the Snodgrass letters.

156
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,210
So we have basically each number here represents the relative frequency of using three letter words

157
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,490
per each letter that Snodgrass wrote.

158
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,920
And here we have the same calculation.

159
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,590
But first some other works that we know are Barnhardt by Mark Twain.

160
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,300
So again this is the relative frequency of three letter words from various letters of Snodgrass and

161
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,400
here various works of Mark Twain.

162
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,760
And you can check out the google doc for a link to the publication that we're actually referring to.

163
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,440
For Snodgrass versus Twain.

164
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,240
And then we're going to do here is do a little bit of plotting.

165
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,980
So for this we're going to need to box plots.

166
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:24,260
So we'll say for the first one that y is equal to Snodgrass and then another thing we can passen for

167
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:34,750
our box plot is give it a name so I'll say the name is Snodgrass and then we'll add in a box plot to

168
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,880
this list go the box and here will set Y is equal to Twain.

169
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,950
And we'll get this name Twain.

170
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,040
So when we hover over it we can see the twain.

171
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,140
OK so if you want you can do a layout to give this a title.

172
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,630
But since we already know what's happening here Lucias go ahead and plot this out.

173
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,570
We'll say Python basic but PI enter analyse this comparison.

174
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,880
So if we take a look again the relative frequencies of three letter words in their writing we can see

175
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,490
here that it looks like there's a different distribution between Snodgrass and Twain.

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,880
And so just by this simple analysis we can probably start getting an idea that these two people are

177
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,620
not the same author.

178
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:27,260
So Snodgrass is probably not Mark Twain unless Twain really specifically changed his writing style for

179
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,460
three letter words for writing letters by Snodgrass which is quite a complex and difficult thing to

180
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,010
do.

181
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,480
So you'll be able to check out the link to the publication from that researcher from 1960s to actually

182
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,550
see his full analysis of comparing these two authors and showing that distinctly Twain is probably most

183
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,200
likely not Snodgrass.

184
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,880
And here we can see even just through a simple example of their relative frequencies of using three

185
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,880
letter words that Twain is probably not going to be Snodgrass based off their usage.

186
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,710
OK so that's an example of using a real analysis with a visualization.

187
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,540
And there's much more complex examples that we could do for Bach's plots but hopefully this is a nice

188
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,920
easy one to understand.

189
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,980
And later on in the exercises you'll get your own data sets to play around with for box plots.

190
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,610
OK.

191
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,040
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,490
I'll see you at the next lecture.
