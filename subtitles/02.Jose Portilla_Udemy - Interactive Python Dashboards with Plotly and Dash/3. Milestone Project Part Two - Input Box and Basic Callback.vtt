00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.260
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.120
In part two we're going to add a callback function to our script here.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.570
We're still going to keep it simple.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.890
We're just going to have the plot title update we'll put over the text in the input box is.

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.860
Let's get started.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.360
OK.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.820
Here we are back at our script.

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.990
Remember sort of figure we have this data list.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.300
What I'm also going to do is inside that dictionary I'm going to add a key for lay out and let's say

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:44.150
that lay out is just going to have a title and we're going to have this be default title.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.500
So when it starts up we get to see this data and some default title.

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.590
Now we're going to do is have that title be updated depending on whatever's being provided into this

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.180
input.

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.790
Sold in the fall and will say app thought callback

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.380
and we're going to take in an output and member input is a list so we'll say input here.

16
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560
And let's check out what the output should be.

17
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.630
The output we're essentially going to output to this my graph and the figure will say my graph

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.510
and then the figure and then the input.

19
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.600
Well that's going to come from this input for now.

20
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.820
So we'll say that comes from my ticker symbol or sees me in my stock ticker picker.

21
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.110
So this idea right here my stock picker my stock picker and we want the value itself.

22
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.010
So we're just going to grab this value and then we're going to set that to be the title.

23
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.940
Still pretty simple.

24
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.350
Let's now come back here and set up our function that has this decorator.

25
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.840
It's called update graph and then we take in stock ticker or any variable name we decide on stock ticker

26
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.320
and that's going to then update the figure.

27
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.590
So create a variable inside update graph called fig that has data for it.

28
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.290
Now let's keep the data the same.

29
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.530
So we're essentially just going to pass in the same dictionary.

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.750
So you won't see the actual plot itself change.

31
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.440
So there's a data but we're going to do here is have the layout change.

32
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.120
So take the layout and then we'll see that title is going to be equal to whatever that stock ticker

33
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.740
happens to be because remember the stock ticker is just a value being passed in here.

34
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.580
So this value gets passed in a stock ticker and then stock gets set as the title for this figure and

35
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.850
then it is going to return that present or that variable fig to this output in my graph figure let's

36
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.770
save this and run it just so we can make sure that we're successfully adding callbacks and interacting

37
00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.850
for plot type python basic that pie and enter looks like output is not defined.

38
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.510
So that's right we still need to import that.

39
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.550
Let's come back up here and hopefully you already have this memorized but if not no worries it's just

40
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.180
dash dependencies import.

41
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.570
And when you import input and output and then later on we'll also import state fact.

42
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.580
I'll just do that right now.

43
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.410
And let's run this again.

44
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.770
I'm basically up pie.

45
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.570
Good.

46
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.120
Now let's jump over to the dashboard and make sure everything's working OK.

47
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.440
Here's our stock ticker dashboard.

48
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.440
Everything looks good right now.

49
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.160
Have Tesla.

50
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.820
So let's update this.

51
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.850
So looks like it's interacting with our input.

52
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.600
And in fact it looks like it never even got a chance to have the default because we're not actually

53
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.000
updating this upon a state.

54
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.960
The input is happening live.

55
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.800
So as I update this update live and since I had a default value it automatically updated it to begin

56
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.740
with as Tesla.

57
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.830
OK so it looks like we successfully added in a callback.

58
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.140
We're going to do now in stock ticker Part three is add in a date reader and date time functionality

59
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.150
to help define a data frame.

60
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.940
We'll see there.
