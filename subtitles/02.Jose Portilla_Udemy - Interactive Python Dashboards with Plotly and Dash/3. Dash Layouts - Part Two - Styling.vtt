00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.570
We're going to continue off with the example we left off last time and we're going to show you how to

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.790
customize that basic Daschle out of just a little bit of styling for the text and some color.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.410
So let's go back going the same pie file as before and then add on some style calls to it.

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.620
Let's go back to that text editor.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.890
OK.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.800
Here we are back at the dash component.

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.410
Remember we already had our imports we created that object and we edited the layout.

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.460
What I want to show you now very quickly is how you can add style calls to HTL components specifically

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.800
CSSA styling calls.

11
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.870
If you're already familiar of aist him see SS You can dive deeper and really customize these components.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.490
And then I want to show you how you can add style to a graph and to the style of this layout itself.

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.980
What we're going to do here is underneath app I'm going to create a colour's dictionary and this Koehler's

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.640
dictionary.

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.530
Technically you don't need to have a dictionary.

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.850
This is just for convenience for myself.

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.330
So I can assign colors consistently.

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:18.230
So I always say the background key in this caller's dictionary is the hex code hash tag 1 1 1 1 1 1.

19
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.150
So that's going to be the color black and I will say text and I'm going to make this kind of a teal

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.450
colors will say hash tag 7 F D B F F.

21
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.620
OK.

22
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.410
So again this colour's dictionary.

23
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.510
This is just going to allow me to do things like say colors and then call text in order to quickly grab

24
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.750
whatever text color I decided on.

25
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.370
And this is a nice way to organize your specific styling calls throughout your dashboard application

26
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.910
instead of having to manually input the strings every time.

27
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.770
The other thing I could do is assign the strings to variables but often it's nice to be able to call

28
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.810
it with a dictionary.

29
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.300
That way it's relevant.

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.940
What this text is referring to it's the colors of the text.

31
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.430
So that's what we'll be doing.

32
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.200
And let's start off by showing you how you could style a one or div element.

33
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.810
So these HVM all components to do that.

34
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.740
What I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to delete this middle one right here.

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.440
So we'll just have H-1 at the top that says Hello dash and inside of H-1 just like we have this string

36
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.880
right here.

37
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.360
Children equals Hello dash so technically saying children hello.

38
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.980
Dash is just the first component.

39
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.450
So we don't have to provide it.

40
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.330
What I'm going to provide here is style and we're going to say style and this is where you can pass

41
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.020
in a dictionary of various CSSA styling components.

42
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.650
So if you already are an expert in HTL and see SS You can really customize these Estill components to

43
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.230
very specific degrees of whatever you want and later on we're also going to show you how you can make

44
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.710
your own CSSA styling templates and connect them to your dashboard.

45
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.890
Again this is mainly for people who already have a background H.M.S. assess.

46
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.320
Again the main point of that though is that you don't have to know that stuff in order to make a nice

47
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.270
looking dashboard.

48
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.440
But I do want to share these options just in case you do know them.

49
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.370
So you can do style calls such as text the line and then we can say center here and that allows us to

50
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.060
grab this html component and align its text to the center and then we can also do things like a CSSA

51
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.980
call to assign color.

52
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.810
So I could say color and then assign that to either string directly or the dictionary call.

53
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.990
So I could say inside here colour's and then say text which is eventually going to grab the string so

54
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.240
that you can grab any HTML component and add style to it based off essentially what is a C S S call.

55
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.970
All right.

56
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.990
Now let's see how we can affect things such as style and color for the core components.

57
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.330
We just saw how we can work with the male components.

58
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.060
And this is essentially just passing in a style dictionary with CSSA calls for core components because

59
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.790
it is a higher level abstraction.

60
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.130
It's going to have to be a little more customized of a call than just direct CSX.

61
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.150
So we're going to say here is inside of lay out we have this dictionary and we're going to add in a

62
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.660
few more things here.

63
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:29.230
So we're going to say plots underscore B.G. color and that stands for the background color of the actual

64
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.370
plot.

65
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.880
And you could do this phenomenal plot in plot as well.

66
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.330
So we have this lay out parameter plot B.G. color and this is where you can provide any background colors

67
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.150
you want.

68
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.610
We're just going to go ahead and say colors and call background again which is remember just essentially

69
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.570
a hexadecimal code for the color black.

70
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.720
And then we can also call paper background color.

71
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.970
And this is for stuff that's not directly on the plot itself but things like outside of the actual grid

72
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.630
lines.

73
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.620
And again we can call colors and we'll say background here.

74
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.000
And then finally let's go ahead and color the font.

75
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.260
So here the way we do this is a little more convoluted we say font.

76
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.790
And then inside of this we passen yet another dictionary and we say color and here we're just going

77
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:33.110
to say colors and grab the next color that we previously defined let's say that and we want to make

78
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.080
sure we have a comma here so that we don't screw up this overall dictionary for the layout.

79
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.920
I'm going to save that.

80
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.520
And if you ever get any typos here you can go ahead and copy and paste from the file you provided which

81
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.230
should be called layout to that pie and all the way at the bottom here.

82
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.880
We're also going to do is give style to this entire layout itself.

83
00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:02.550
So to basically this app layout and the way we do that is right after this giant list that we provided.

84
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.830
We're going to say

85
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:17.490
Khama and call style here and this where we can say something like background's color and say colors

86
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:26.540
background a common complaint about plotline dashboards in general is the fact that you end up having

87
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.550
to use a lot of nested dictionaries and nested lists.

88
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.820
It can be really confusing in the beginning but I would just say be really patient with it and eventually

89
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.350
you'll start to pick up on the patterns and you'll be able to just easily copy and paste and insert

90
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.330
your own code.

91
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.550
You don't need to be a master of memorizing everything here.

92
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.430
As far as what the dictionaries go where the lists go etc. you should just become familiar with being

93
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.670
able to look up information copy and paste and then add it to your own needs.

94
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.700
Because I myself wouldn't have memorized where the dictionary lay out goals or where the lists go.

95
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.490
I know those can be quite confusing especially as a beginner.

96
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.830
So keep in mind patience is the key here.

97
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.190
And in just a little bit in the very next lecture you're going to see how we can simplify all this by

98
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.470
simply putting our past plot plots.

99
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.780
But I'm going to save this for now.

100
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.940
You can go and PAS the video in case you need to get a better idea of what we just did here but we should

101
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.810
be make sure you fix that typo.

102
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.010
Background color.

103
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.510
We should be ready to go.

104
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:33.010
I'm going to bring back my terminal and let's run this again basic thought by and let's visit it in

105
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.660
our browser.

106
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.560
So that's going to be at 1 2 7 0 0 1 850.

107
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.360
And now when I bring it over I should be able to see it mostly in black and then that kind of teal color.

108
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:49.910
So here I see now the background has been changed as well as the text colors and those here that technicolor

109
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:55.140
have also changed on the plot itself for the grid lines and the legend over here on the right.

110
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.960
I want to quickly review what we just did although I wouldn't be too concerned about memorizing the

111
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.040
sort of thing.

112
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.000
So let me zoom out a little bit so we can see the saw clearly all we did at this lecture was show you

113
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.100
some methods of affecting the styling and the coloring of what's in your dashboard.

114
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.440
What I like to do is set up the colors dictionary that we can do things like how they background color

115
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.340
and have a text color.

116
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.330
They can constantly call for HTB components.

117
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.450
It's actually quite easy to affect the style.

118
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.810
All you need to do is add a style call with a dictionary that the particular type of is styling want

119
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.200
to do.

120
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.550
And then the value you want to give it.

121
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.240
So things like text a line or color those will directly connect to this HTL component for Dash core

122
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.940
components it's a little harder.

123
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.450
But basically where you're going to do inside your layout dictionary you're going to look up in the

124
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:49.450
documentation for plot Lee what the actual terms are for common things like background color or fonts

125
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.400
and some of these required dictionaries themselves where you can get a little convoluted but hopefully

126
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.920
you get the idea that the way to affect styling for a core component is that somewhere in your graph

127
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.560
object you're going to find it lay out dictionary and then put in the right keywords and passen the

128
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.830
right values there.

129
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.870
We're going to show you lots and lots of examples of this during the course.

130
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.560
So by the end of the course you're going to feel really familiar with customizing things making colors

131
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.070
right.

132
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.810
But right now this is more just to show you what is possible.

133
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.120
Don't worry about memorizing everything you've seen here.

134
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.410
I think in the very next lecture where you actually could use a polygraph and insert to a dashboard

135
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.940
things are really going to click there and you're going to see the real power of dash and creating dashboards.

136
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.530
All right.

137
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.000
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and we'll do our best to help you out.

138
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.660
Thanks.

139
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.790
And we'll see at the next lecture.
