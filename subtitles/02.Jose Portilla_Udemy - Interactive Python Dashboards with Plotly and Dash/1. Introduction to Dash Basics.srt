00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,720
Welcome everyone to the dash basics section of the course now that we understand the basics of creating

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,590
visualizations with politely it's time to finally begin creating dashboards with cash.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,560
Remember to use the provided requirements textfile shown in the installation lecture video to install

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,480
the required libraries for cash.

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,200
If you already set up your environment like we showed in the installation video then you're good to

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,610
go.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,340
So the section goals for this portion of the Course are to again understand what is used for.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,740
Understand the very basics of dash and create our first dashboard web application with platies dash

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,670
library sulcus started remembering what that was for.

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,820
Recall that dashes for creating dashboards purely in Python typically for things in the past you would

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,470
have had to have known all the front end technologies to create a dashboard web applications such as

12
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,180
T.M. C Ss and Javascript.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,320
But dash allows you to do this all purely in Python and then these dashboards are served as web applications

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,360
so you'll actually be visiting what is essentially a web server hosted locally on your machine that

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,540
later on will show you how did the Poitou a Web site.

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,950
They're not just static HTL files like we previously saw with the regular plotless library.

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,340
We can then connect and interact with those dashboards that apps are mainly composed of two parts.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,330
The first part is the layer of the app and it describes what the application actually looks like.

19
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,360
Basically where your visualizations are going to go inside your dashboard.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,400
The second part of that describes the interactivity of the application.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,240
For example if you move a slider in your dashboard How does that affect the visualization.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,610
Now the good news is you don't actually need to know any T.M. or CSSA to use that.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,100
As we've mentioned many times before we get to do all of this purely in Python.

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,880
Most HTL tags are provided as Python classes within that.

25
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,090
So for example in-dash you would type something like HTL dot H-1 and then children equals haloed dash

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,790
and that would actually then from your script result in H.T. elements in the web browser.

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,510
It would end up automatically creating a header for you.

28
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,240
So we had to H-1 Hello dash H-1 and that's an H table element so you don't actually need to be able

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,880
to write.

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,670
H t m l.

31
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,940
You're going to do that all within Python now bash offers two distinct component libraries that previous

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,520
code we just showed that comes from the dash underscore aist underscore component's library which essentially

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,920
has a python component for every single possible aist him LTI such as that first level heading H-1 the

34
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,110
other library that contains is the dash core components.

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,320
And this was really nice to work with because it offers a higher level interactive component system

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,840
where it's going to generate things like javascript HTML and see us through the re-act thought JS library.

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,180
All in Python.

38
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,750
So we're going to be using and leveraging the power of Dash core components a lot throughout this course.

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:05,050
That way we can even abstract further from HTL and really focus on creating dashboards quickly and easily

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:12,460
with pure python so dash components whether H T M L base or core base is describe entirely through keyword

41
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,260
attributes.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,090
That means that is declarative.

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,750
All you need to primarily do is just describe your application through these attributes just like you

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,140
would with normal Python.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,200
OK so that's the very basics of what bash conceptually is going to do.

46
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,620
But let's really understand that by building our first dashboard We'll see you in the next lecture where

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,810
we actually start coding this out.
