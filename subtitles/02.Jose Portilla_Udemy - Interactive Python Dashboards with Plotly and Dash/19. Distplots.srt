00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,570
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:14,770
We're going to talk about distribution plots distribution plots or plots for short typically layer 3

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,870
plots on top of one another.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,780
The first plot is a histogram for each datapoint is placed inside of bin of similar values.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,600
The second is a rogue plot.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,520
This is where marks are placed along the x axis for every single data point which lets you see the actual

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,070
distribution of values inside each bin.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,440
Then the third plot the distribution plot shows is going to include a kernel density estimate plot or

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,440
Kaytee for short and this is basically just a line that tries to describe the general shape of the distribution.

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,900
So this is what this plot actually looks like here.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,150
And we can see the three plots on top of each other and if we look at the very bottom of this chart

12
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,680
we can actually see the plot and the plot is just a very simple idea.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,120
You're going to have a mark where each data points value is.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,620
So remember here we're just plotting out one continuous single variable.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,010
So at the very bottom we have that scale and we're just going to draw a mark for every single point.

16
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,680
So you can see where the actual marks are per been.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,830
For example if we look at the histogram all the way on the left hand side we have a bin that goes from

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,590
like negative 3 to negative 2.

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,340
However within the bin we don't know the distribution from just the histogram alone.

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,330
However that Roug plot actually lets us see that we have more values towards negative 2 than we have

21
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,830
towards negative 3.

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,990
So that's the difference or what the rogue shark trying to show you that the histogram itself cannot

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,280
show.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,230
Then on top of the histogram we see this curve.

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:57,280
And this is basically showing us what a general distribution looks like for all the data points and

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,150
here we can see a distribution plot for various sets of data.

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,080
Essentially we see the same continuous value but now based on four different categories.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,530
So this is sometimes commonly shown to see the various distributions between two categories for the

29
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,830
same variable.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,260
All right let's go ahead and explore the distribution plot further with plotless.

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,850
All right.

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,320
Here we are at the text editor something I want to point out is that our imports and our labels are

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,070
going to be slightly different than before.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,610
So first we're going to import like we've done before.

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,370
Plot lead off line as Pyu wyo.

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:39,040
But now we're going to say import plot lead dots and we're going to call figure underscore factory which

37
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,720
is basically a special special section of poly that does more complex figures like distribution plot.

38
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,430
We're going to import this as F-F and then create some data we'll say important up-I as N.P..

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,300
So let's create our actual random data.

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,820
Remember we just need some continuous variable so to do this will say we thought random thought Rand

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,280
and to create some normally distributed data that's random and will create a thousand data points.

42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,850
And then what we need here is similar to overcalling calling go dot and then a particular plot type

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,210
where we had a list with data.

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,920
We're going to say just underscore data and set that equal to a list.

45
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,990
And here is where you would pass in your data points.

46
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,930
So we just have one.

47
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,310
So we're just going to have a list of a single set of data which will call hist underscored data.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,380
So our histogram data and then the other thing we need to define is group labels.

49
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,830
And this is just the actual label for this x so we're going to call this for now this plot kind of up

50
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,140
to you what you want to label that string later on we'll see.

51
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,330
Kind of a more real realistic example of actually naming that x.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,670
But here we're going to say figure is equal to.

53
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,790
And then we say f f dot and we call create underscore.

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,640
And you notice already that underscore has a lot of different advance plot types like violin plots bullit

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,320
plots chart's open high low close plots for stock market stuff.

56
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:12,710
But instead we're just going to say this the plot and using this we're going to pass in our data and

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:18,540
say his state is equal to his data and then we can just pass on his data like this instead.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,940
And then we'll pass in our group labels as well.

59
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,290
So we'll say group labels OK and then we just need a plot that will say plot and plot that figure.

60
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,800
And as always you can say file name if you want.

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,510
So now it's called Python basic thought pi.

62
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,130
Haven't changed the name of that file yet.

63
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,570
We're going to run this and we're going to see our distribution plot.

64
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,320
So when I bring this over I could see my distribution plot and I get to see the values along my actual

65
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:52,820
KDE or kernel density estimation which is essentially just trying to make some sort of probability distribution

66
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,040
that goes along with your discrete data points and then on here we can see the actual points themselves.

67
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,530
So what's nice about this is I can now tell the distribution within a bin.

68
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,300
So like I was saying before for this first then from three to negative two I can see that most of the

69
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,570
points are actually closer to negative 2 than to negative 3.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,900
So is where you can really explore your data through that distribution.

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go out and see some other examples.

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,530
So we just created a very basic distribution plot.

73
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,620
Let's move on by adding in some multiple groups.

74
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,600
So I won't say X-1 and that ran them that ran then.

75
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,450
And let's just make 200 points.

76
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,430
So not a whole lot here and we're going to copy and paste this to get multiple groups here.

77
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,020
Let's create four groups of data.

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,550
There we go and we'll label these X1 x 2 x 3 and x 4.

79
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,950
And we're going to shift them just a little bit.

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,860
They're not all on top of each other.

81
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,840
We're going to subtract two from this first one.

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,490
Add two to this one and let's add 4 to that one.

83
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,450
If we didn't do this then they would basically be all right on top of each other and it would look so

84
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,320
great.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,930
So here is our actual data sets.

86
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,600
And then we just make a list of the data sets will say x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4.

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,490
And then you're going to need group labels for each of these.

88
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:19,880
So something we could do is just make string versions of this x1 x2 x3 and x for.

89
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,230
OK so these are the names that correspond to these sets of data and then basically the same thing down

90
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,500
here we're just passing in that list of data points for the histograms and the group labels.

91
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,610
So let's see what this looks like now.

92
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,290
A-plot Python base that PI run that and then that's going to create the plot that we saw again earlier.

93
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,750
We're now we have these four distributions here now something you may be wondering is how do you actually

94
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,560
affect the bin size for each of these histograms so you can do that individually.

95
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,130
And you actually do that inside this create this plot call.

96
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:01,430
So as an argument here you can specify bin size and then you just pasan a list of the actual bin sizes

97
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,930
for each of these.

98
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,270
So for X-1 we can say Give me a bin size of 2 4 x 2.

99
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,370
Give me a bin size of 1 and so on.

100
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,020
So you can kind of play around with these and then if we run this again we should see some different

101
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,890
bin sizes.

102
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,560
So let's run that.

103
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,180
And now we can see the actual bin sizes.

104
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,620
So here we made them probably quite too large.

105
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,450
So let's make them quite a bit smaller.

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,630
So we get an idea we'll say point to point one point three and point four.

107
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,040
Save that.

108
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,020
Run it again.

109
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,570
And then we can see the different been with here.

110
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,310
So you can see how they correspond to the bin sizes we chose how this last one the next four has a much

111
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,450
larger science than for instance point one and point two.

112
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,650
So that's how you can change the science for each of these different distributions individually or to

113
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,780
finish off this lecture.

114
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Let's go ahead and revisit that problem are we had Mark Twain versus the Snodgrass data.

115
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,430
What I'm going to do is just copy and paste that over from the notes again so he can copy and paste

116
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,640
this from the 3 PI file.

117
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,570
But basically we have those distributions for Snodgrass versus Twain.

118
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,640
And hopefully when we plot this out we'll be able to tell even more clearly not just from the box plots

119
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,280
but from distribution plots that these are definitely different authors or at least very distinct writing

120
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,180
styles.

121
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:30,120
So for his data instead of being X when X 2 and so on we're going to say Snodgrass and Twain and then

122
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,700
let's give these proper labels.

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:45,680
So the first one is Snodgrass writings and then the second one will say Mark Twain writings and then

124
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,930
for the bin sizes here.

125
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,730
After some experimentation what probably works that I noticed is zero point zero or five and 0.00 five

126
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,380
looks.

127
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,870
There we go because you'll notice here that these are actually quite small values.

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,480
Serbin sizes should be pretty small as well.

129
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm going to save this.

130
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,300
And let's check out the distribution and see if we can clearly see how separate these are.

131
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,950
All right so BREENE over our histograms.

132
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,790
You'll notice that are bin sizes aren't really that great.

133
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,590
But unfortunately we don't have enough data points to make some nice histograms.

134
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,970
And because of that issue history by themselves would not really have been enough for this sort of analysis.

135
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,720
But we can see here from the distribution that we have some nice Kaytee plots and the rug point plot

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,810
themselves that clearly there's a different distribution between these two sets of authors.

137
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,280
So you can see the mark twain writings over here in orange and the Snodgrass writings in blue.

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,340
Now we can see how they stack up against each other again leading us to conclude that whoever wrote

139
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,970
these writings from Snodgrass is probably not the same person who wrote Mark Twain's writings.

140
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,350
OK so you can play around that further because Mussar out the size and see if you can figure out a better

141
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,860
one.

142
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,030
But unfortunately for this particular problem since the points are so small and we actually don't have

143
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,040
that many points it becomes difficult to choose a nice histogram which is why the distribution plot

144
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,320
is really nice because we get to see those other layers of information including that Kaytee plot and

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,440
the plot.

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,410
All right.

147
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,240
