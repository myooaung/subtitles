00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:12,010
Welcome to this lecture on updating graphs on interactions now that we know about hover data click data

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,570
and selected data component properties.

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,660
We understand that we can actually grab information directly related to user interaction such as them

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,020
hovering over a specific data point or selecting a group of data points.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,230
Now so far we've only display that information back to the user either through Jaison or an image like

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,710
we saw with the wheels and colour's example we're going to expand on this idea by now actually using

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,320
that interaction information from either hover data click data or select the data from that user and

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,200
then adjust it to another plot on your dashboard.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,030
And this is where you really get to leverage the power of dash and plotted together because you're going

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,490
to be able to have a user directly interact with one graph in order to up another graph on the same

11
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,370
dashboard.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,470
We're going to be using the MPG data set to display a scatterplot adjacent to an acceleration plot.

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,610
The updates upon user interaction.

14
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,380
Let's go ahead and see what the final dashboard product looks like and then we'll create it ourselves.

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,540
All right so this is what our completed dashboard is going to look like on the left hand side.

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,550
We have model year of the car and how many miles per gallon that car got.

17
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,540
And then as you hover over these cars you get to see a representation of the acceleration and how many

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,860
cylinders are have.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:30,010
So if you look at this plot on the right hand side it will display the model of the car and the thickness

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,390
of that line corresponds to how many cylinders that particular model of car has.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,810
And then we can also see a calculation for its acceleration.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,880
So the slope of that line is visually representing how fast this particular model car can accelerate.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,530
And you can also see that below that graph we display the actual values of displacement as well as how

24
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,560
fast it can go from zero to 60 mph.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,050
OK.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,600
So let's go ahead and get started on creating this dashboard.

27
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:57,910
OK.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,520
Here am I text editor.

29
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,160
We've already done the regular imports dash Gorne HTL components graph objects panels PD and from by

30
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,440
pi we're going to import random in just a little bit you'll see why it's really to add a little bit

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,160
of jitter or kind of randomness to the year values.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,180
So first off let's critter application by saying app is equal to dash dash.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,510
And then we're going to read in the data frame for the MPG data set will say PD that read underscore

34
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,130
CXXVI and in my case I'm in the same directory as my data folder.

35
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,840
So all I need to do is say to MPG that see V your file path may differ depending on where your files

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,010
actually located on your computer.

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,620
Once you read in the data set list start off by just creating a quick scatterplot and seeing what that

38
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,340
looks like.

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:57,380
Oh say app out is equal to and here's where we're going to say H.T. maladaptive as we've done in the

40
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,130
past.

41
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,780
And let's start off by just inserting that graph for the scatterplot.

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,840
That's a core component graph and here it needs an ID.

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,390
So let's reference this as mpg that scatter and now it's time to edit the figure.

44
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,650
So let's get a couple more lines here.

45
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,830
Just so we can get some more space.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:27,450
So inside of this we have our ID and we have our figure parameter and this figure parameter as always

47
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:36,530
takes in a data value as a list and a layout value which is just going to be that go that way outcall.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,950
So let's start off with what goes inside the list.

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:47,500
Here we're going to call our scatterplot and are scatterplot is going to need an x and y value will

50
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,250
say the x value is the model year so that's the model year of the car.

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,750
And if you look back at that data set the model years actually does represent it with two digits such

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,870
as 87 or 77 or 68.

53
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,530
So we're going to go ahead and add 9500 to all those values so that displayed as 1960 instead of just

54
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,350
68 Why that's going to be the mpg on the y axis.

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,550
So replumbing 1968 per mpg for that particular car.

56
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,810
Then the next parameter we're going to define is text and also equal to the name of the car.

57
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,040
And there's actually no another parameter that allows you to specify more specifically what information

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,940
should be displayed.

59
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,210
And that's the hover info parameter.

60
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,250
So if the hover input parameter it does is it allows you to combine things like the X column or Y column

61
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,720
or text column to display that information.

62
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,870
And it should actually be a lower case i.

63
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,690
So hover info equals and then you just passen a string such as text and it's going to grab whatever

64
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,070
is in this text parameter and display that as the information hover.

65
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,750
But it also allows you to do things like add y and then it will display not just the name of the car

66
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,520
model but also then the model year or excuse me in this case the mpg if you wanted to display all three.

67
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,530
You could then add in the string and then that would correlate to the model year itself.

68
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,670
If you're interested more in information about hover info.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
You can check out the portly docks here.

70
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,880
This is the full reference I have.

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,140
And if you go down to hover info gives you more information about essentially what you doing just any

72
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,730
combination of x y z text or name and you can join them in a matter of with plus.

73
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,140
OK so coming back here we've developed our hover information the text as well.

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,940
And now it's time to move on to the last parameter which is mode and we'll set that equal to marker's.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,190
Then finally let's have our lay out.

76
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:56,620
We'll say go dots lay out and let's give this a title title we'll just be mpg data and let's give the

77
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:03,520
x axis and y axis some titles as well to do this is say X X primed or equal to and then you have a dictionary

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:18,190
title and we'll say this is the model year we'll set the Y-axis title be equal to let's say mpg or mpg.

79
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:25,480
And we will also say hover mode on this layout equal to the string closest though we close the string

80
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,860
to the cursor is the information that's displayed.

81
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,950
OK so that should be it for our basic scatterplot.

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,420
Let's come down here and run our server and you're going to see a little bit of an issue that will then

83
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,440
later be fixed by using this random data.

84
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,660
Or I should say a random library.

85
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,570
Let me zoom out so you can see the full picture.

86
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,770
All we've done here is basically essentially created a scatter graph that many times before using the

87
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,820
model year and mpg data.

88
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,980
Save this.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,630
And let's check it out.

90
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,140
Well run Python basic thought PI and let me jump over to my dashboard.

91
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,570
OK.

92
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,330
Here's our dashboard right now we're just showing an entire scatterplot.

93
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,800
We haven't edited the width of this so it's taking up the entire screen but something you should also

94
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,660
check here is that every car is basically released on a single year which is integer.

95
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,240
Right.

96
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,140
So it's either going to be released 1970 or 1971 the way our data is set up.

97
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,680
Realistically if we wanted to get finer detail it would be per this particular month of a year.

98
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,650
Right now what we can do in order to not have this look so spaced with these lines is we can actually

99
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,780
add what's called jitter to this model and it essentially adds a little bit of random data to these

100
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,370
points.

101
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,710
That way they surround the year they released but not all stacked on top of each other.

102
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,080
Let me show you how to do that.

103
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,450
And then you can really decide if it's up to you whether you want to add that jitter or not.

104
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,950
The jitter makes it look a little nicer but then it's technically not the real data you are adding a

105
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,000
little bit of noise to it.

106
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,120
So keep that in mind.

107
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,830
But let's show you how you can add jitter to this and then you can decide whether you want to keep it

108
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,410
or not.

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,930
So to add jitter to this come back here to your text file and with this random library we're going to

110
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:15,010
do is after we read in the data frame going to zoom in here I will say DMF and I'm going to create a

111
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,010
new column called year remember or default column for the years called Model underscore year and also

112
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:29,920
year equal to random dot Rand I enty remember that's grabbing a random integer and I'm going to grab

113
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:38,750
a random integer let's say from negative 4 to 5 and I need the length of that data frame number of random

114
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,180
integers because I'm essentially going to add a random integer to each of these years.

115
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,960
So I'll say negative for it's negative five random integer value there.

116
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,650
Then multiply it by point 1 or 0.1.

117
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,400
That way it's a small value being added onto that year.

118
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,190
So it's essentially going to be something like 1978.

119
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,430
And then we're going to either do plus or minus from negative for some value.

120
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,070
For example positive 3.

121
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,880
Multiply that by 0.1 So that would be point 3.

122
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,760
And then you add that to the year which already exists.

123
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,240
So then we'll say model year.

124
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,520
So essentially all this line is doing is adding noise.

125
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,100
And this is also called adding jitter.

126
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,930
So what happens is right now our years are all stacked on top of each other.

127
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,510
For example two cars will have 1978.

128
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:35,260
Instead all we can do is we can take that 1978 pick a random number between negative four and five such

129
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,500
as let's say negative three.

130
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,520
Then we multiply it by 0.1.

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,990
So now that's negative 0.3 and then we're actually going to add that.

132
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,060
So in this case you could subtract that because it's a negative.

133
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,690
So you get something like 1977 point seven.

134
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,140
And so we would do the same thing for 1978.

135
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,780
And because this is random again maybe you end up something like seventy eight point two.

136
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,550
So now they're not stacked on top of each other.

137
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,710
When you actually plot them out.

138
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,420
So that's all we're doing with this in order to make sure that actually effects come down here it's

139
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,080
a model year and just set it as year.

140
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,020
We're still going to add 19:00 to it because technically it just is 78 and 77 not 1978.

141
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,180
Not 1977 by the time we're actually working with here I'm going to save this.

142
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,930
Let's rerun our Python basic about pi file and let's visit that dashboard again.

143
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,390
All right checking out that dashboard now you can see the effect that the noise is having.

144
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,080
It's basically taking everything on that year and then giving a little bit of noise.

145
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,540
You'll notice that some of them end up actually on the year.

146
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,620
That's because that random number happened to have been zero.

147
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,030
And because I didn't succeed.

148
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,550
Your results may look different than mine but overall you should see this general trend that MPG tends

149
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,590
to go up slightly as the years go along.

150
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,790
And as you hover over this you get to see the information.

151
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,520
OK.

152
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,370
So that's our basic scatterplot we just showed you how to create a scatterplot between model year and

153
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,560
mpg and add a little bit of noise to it.

154
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,850
We're going to stop this electric here.

155
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
And then the next lecture will actually show you how to update another graph interactively.

156
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,550
But hopefully this is more review for you right now in the next lecture that's we're actually going

157
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,960
to connect in other plot that will display the acceleration which means we'll also edit the style of

158
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,700
this particular scatterplot.

159
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,540
So it has less of a with we'll see you at the next lecture.
