00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,180
As previously discussed one of her main goals at the end of this section is for you to be able to visit

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,750
the platies documentation and reproduce any plot type from the documentation with your own data in order

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,070
to successfully do this.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,820
Let's have a quick tour of the poly documentation for Python.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,330
Go to plot l y slash Python or Google search party Python to get to the documentation.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,390
Let's go to our browser now and explore a little further.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,500
All right so here we are.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,730
Plot Elwha I-Slash python.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,510
And there's two main aspects of the partly Python documentation that I want to show you.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,530
The first one is the main examples library.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,470
And basically here there's going to display various examples of pretty much any kind of visualization

13
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,560
you can think of.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,710
It starts off with partly fundamentals and these are main overview in concepts things like using plotless

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,810
if a Jupiter notebook or using plot leiu of a dashboard and doory we're going to covered that in a lot

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,740
more detail later on in this course and you can click here for more portly fundamentals.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,440
But more importantly if you scroll down you'll notice that there are sections such as basic charts and

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,330
then statistical and Seaborn charts as well as scientific charts financial charts maps and more.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,850
And if you click on one of these it's basically just going to give you some examples.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,450
So for instance if we wanted to learn about box plots we could open that in a new tab and here we see

21
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,640
box plots and I'll show you how to create a basic plot box plot at least to code for it and then horizontal

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,370
box plot and so on.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,820
So our main goal is for you to understand what's actually going on with these examples.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,530
So if you're new to plot line and you were just to come to this example it may be a little unclear what's

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,280
happening with things like go Dropbox or this data list or what's actually being passed in here.

26
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,750
So we want to do is fill in those gaps for you.

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,850
And that way you'd be able to come back to the main page visit any of these charts for instance Click

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,750
here for more basic charts view the one that you want.

29
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,130
So if you wanted a field area plot something we don't specifically go over but we do go over line plots

30
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,570
and after we go over this section you should be able to come here choose any of these plots and then

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,970
fully understand how to replace For instance x and y here with your own data and understand what the

32
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,440
parameters are doing.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,750
So again we want to give you the skills so that you don't need to memorize information but instead become

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,050
an expert at looking up information and applying it to your own data sets.

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,900
So to be able to then actually leverage these examples to what you want to accomplish.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,240
All right.

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,420
The last thing I want to know is besides these really nice examples that the poly documentation has

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,050
as far as creating basic charts scientific charts or financial charts is underneath QuickStart getting

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,390
started cheat sheet you'll see full reference and this one is really useful especially when you begin

40
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,110
to really understand and become an expert implicitly.

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,250
You'll be referencing full reference instead of those actual examples and we'll think your reference

42
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,470
allows you to do is actually understand what parameters you can pass in.

43
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,160
So for example if you're building out a color skill we can do a search for color scale and then you'll

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,180
see color skill in regards to different plot types such as a heat map.

45
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,830
So then you can click on heat map color scale and it will tell you how to set your own custom color

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,420
scale.

47
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,860
So as you get better and better of politely you'll find yourself at this reference page a lot more to

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,590
see what you can passen for the various parameters.

49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,540
So a lot of times will say during our lectures check out the documentation for other parameters you

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,650
can pasan what we're really saying is check this reference here.

51
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,920
And then you can look up the parameters match it up to the plot type that you're looking at and then

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,660
see what options you have.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,250
And again you can find this at plot Alwi slash Python slash reference.

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,990
OK.

55
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,460
That's really all we need to know about the documentation.

56
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,990
By the end of this section you should feel comfortable going to the documentation and being able to

57
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,310
recreate any of the plot types there understanding what the parameters are doing with that plot type

58
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,400
and then leveraging that plot type with your own data.

59
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,020
Thanks and we'll see what the next lecture.
