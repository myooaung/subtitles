00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.570
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.460
We now understand how to build very simple dashboards by inserting a plotless graph object into our

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.590
actual Dasch application.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.480
But I want to now take a little bit of time through a series of lectures to discuss dashboard components

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.100
in a little more detail so recall that dash components are provided by two main libraries.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.050
And that is that HVM l components and dash core components dash age HTML components.

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.860
We usually abbreviate to h tim L and those HTL components.

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.210
They're describing the layout of the page including placement and alignment of different graphs.

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.080
And you can apply CSI stylings to those h components.

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.470
The dash core components those are really meant to describe the individual graphs themselves.

11
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.970
So remember we can just call DCC that graph and then insert what we already know about plot Li into

12
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.470
that core component.

13
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.400
So what I want to do now is take a few lectures to quickly dive into a bit more detail about these component

14
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.040
types.

15
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.950
That way we feel really familiar of them when we go on to talk about more advanced topics like callbacks

16
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.110
and interactions.

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.370
So in the next series of lectures we can have a lecture on HCM all components dash core components and

18
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.560
then a very brief lecture on how to provide markdown syntax and a dash dashboard.

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.200
OK let's get started.

20
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.230
We'll see you at the next lecture.
