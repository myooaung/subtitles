1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,190
Welcome everyone to the general installation and setup lecture here we're going to get you set up with

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,440
Python a development environment or ID and then we're also going to show you how to get the required

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,260
libraries.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,700
So in general we'll set up Python.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,580
Anaconda we'll set up the Adam text editor and also set up plotlines and dash environments.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,660
Something I want to make clear is as an experienced user of Python you've enrolled in this course and

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,190
you probably already have Python on your computer and you may already have a developer environment that

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,310
you prefer because of this.

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,050
We've set time stamps here that you can jump ahead to whatever part of this lecture works for you.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,950
And if you've already set up Python and you know how to install libraries and you already have your

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,740
own preferred developer environment you are probably going to be able to skip this lecture entirely.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,200
So I just want to make that clear.

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,660
If you're in this course you've probably already done a lot of this and you may or may not find this

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,040
useful because of that.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,170
We set up timestamps so you can jump ahead and visit the sections that are most relevant to you.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,060
OK let's get started with setting up Python and we'll move on to then setting up Adam as well as our

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,320
environment.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,640
All right.

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,580
Here we are at the Anaconda dot com slash download page and it may look slightly different for you.

20
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,900
As far as styling is concerned but there should be three main links one for Windows one for Mac OS and

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,570
one for Linux.

22
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,200
On this page Anaconda's going to come with lots of data science packages.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,690
That's why it's a distribution.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,740
It also comes with package management as well as environment management with Conda.

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,050
So that's a tool we're going to be using as well.

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,670
So go ahead and click on the operating system that's relevant to you.

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,060
For Windows you're going to want to install the Python 3 version and I recommend the graphical installer.

28
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,890
There's a 64 bit version and a 32 bit version that depends on your computer.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,140
Then for Mac OS if you're a Mac OS I would also recommend doing the graphical installer here.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,340
So go ahead and download that graphical installer.

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,750
And if you're on Linux there is an installer here for you.

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,990
For 64 bit as well as an installer for 32 bit.

33
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,000
OK so once you've downloaded that actual installer in order to receive instructions on how to download

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,220
it after you click on whatever your relevant operating system is you should notice that there's a link

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,620
here.

36
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,240
How to install Anaconda.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,490
Go ahead and click on that link and it will take you to Dock's and Akala dot com slash Anaconda slash

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,580
install and then slash your operating system.

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,130
So here we have the instructions for installing on Windows and for most of these it's quite straightforward.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,670
Especially for the graphical installers you're just clicking along.

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,750
The only thing I want to clarify is as you go along you'll notice that there's an advanced installation

42
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,440
option set and this is going to ask you if you want to add anaconda to my path environment variable.

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,130
If you click on this it will turn red and say Not recommended we personally recommend clicking on that

44
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,280
and adding anaconda to your path environment variable.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,080
That way you can actually call Python and Konda at your command line.

46
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,910
So again we highly recommend that you add anaconda to my path environment variable.

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,310
That way you can call Python at your command line.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,030
So even though it says not recommended go ahead and check that box anyways you'll see the text turned

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,210
red and then hit install.

50
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,750
So again if you're ever asked to add anaconda to my path var. var..

51
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,050
Make sure you select that option.

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,300
OK so that's the option for Windows.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,260
Again if you click on here for any of the other operating system such a Mac OS and click on how to install

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,960
Anaconda it will take you to the Mac OS graphical install instructions page which is right here again.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,610
Essentially it is following along.

56
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,280
And again if it ever asks you to add anaconda to your path go ahead and select yes to that.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Even if it says it's not recommended for Linux users it's not going to be a graphical installer.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,600
If you click on how to install anaconda it's basically just going to be a bash command to wherever you

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,120
happen to have downloaded that s h file.

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,140
OK so that's the very basics of downloading.

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,060
Anaconda.

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,690
Once you've downloaded anaconda you should be able to run Python at your command line after you've finished

63
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,240
the installation process.

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,330
So let's go ahead and show you what that should look like.

65
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,210
OK we're going to quickly show you how to run Python.

66
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,440
This is going to be a confirmation that you've already downloaded and gone through the installer for

67
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,590
Anaconda.

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,740
All we need to do here is open up our command line for Windows users.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,840
We are going to do a search for see M.D on your computer and that will open up your command prompt.

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,050
If you're on Mac OS or Linux you can search for terminal and that will open up your command line.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,780
Let's do this.

72
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,030
I'm going to win this computer right now so I will search for ACMD and then open up my command prompt

73
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,060
All right here I am at my command prompt.

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,880
If you're on a Mac OS or Linux you should be at your terminal in order to check that Anaconda installed

75
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,810
correctly directly into your command line.

76
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,190
Type the word Python.

77
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,920
Hit enter and then you should see Python.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,980
The version number and then some sort of clarification of Anaconda.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,190
And once you've done this then you've successfully installed Anaconda in Python on your computer.

80
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,460
And if you want to keep testing things out you can print something like Hello hit enter and you have

81
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,420
hello.

82
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,110
Hopefully you've already worked with Python by the time you reach this course since this is a course

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,270
for more experienced Python users.

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,630
I'm going to quit out of this and we're ready to go.

85
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,730
Remember that for basic command lines in order to actually change directories you can use the see the

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,410
command.

87
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,580
And this works in either Mac OS Linux or Windows.

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,510
To go back up at the rectory you just say change directory thought and that will move back up a directory

89
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,660
to move forward into another folder.

90
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,820
You can say CD and then the name of the folder.

91
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,670
So for example I can move back into that folder where I was by using CD.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,430
That's really the main command you need to know for this course just change in rectory that way you

93
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,940
can run your python script wherever it's located.

94
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,180
Let's now move on to setting up our environment since we've already set up Anaconda and Python.

95
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,700
All right.

96
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,630
Now let's set up our development environment and this course we use the Adam text editor.

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,750
If you already have your preferred development environment such as sublime or pi charm or any other

98
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,360
number of ideas that are available Feel free to stick with those as long as you can run a high script

99
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,580
at your command line.

100
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,590
You're pretty much good to go and you can skip this part of the lecture.

101
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,640
If you do want to explore falling along the fence in this course with the Adam text editor.

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,720
Keep watching and go to Adam.

103
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,050
Oh and let's show you how you can install Adam and set up the plug in as well as the terminal command

104
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,460
line there.

105
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,670
OK.

106
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,770
Here am Adam.

107
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,500
I.

108
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,610
You shouldn't notice that somewhere on the screen there's going to be a download button that's going

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,200
to automatically detect your operating system and you can just click here on this download and it should

110
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,720
download some sort of executable installer file and then you'll just double click that.

111
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,280
Follow all the defaults and install Adam.

112
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,050
It's a simple text editor comes off a lot of really useful features especially if you're a big get user

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,580
Adams open source and it was created by it.

114
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,370
So that's one of our reasons for choosing it for this course.

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,810
As I mentioned you're free to use any platform you like.

116
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,330
They also notice there's packages and themes so packages are basically other packages that can help

117
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,310
you work with out them things like Python autocomplete.

118
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,820
So we'll be using those as well.

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,920
Themes are things that can help you change the appearance of Adam such as fonts or coloring so you can

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,220
do that.

121
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,680
All of it.

122
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,680
Adam as well.

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,260
So there's packages and themes.

124
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,530
Go ahead and download and install Adam onto your computer.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,160
And then let's open it up and show you how you can install plug ins and packages.

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,550
All right.

127
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,840
Once you've downloaded and installed Adam following along the defaults for the graphical installer you

128
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,360
should see something like this when you open at them.

129
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,510
However you may notice that my font or coloring is a little different than what you see as the default.

130
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,410
And that's because I've customized Adam to my liking.

131
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,270
So let's show you how you can do the same for your installation.

132
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,980
You'll just come to file and then go down where it says settings and you should see the core settings.

133
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,210
Open up and you'll notice you have here package's themes.

134
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:56,500
And then install as well as updates so packages are things that help you actually work better with whatever

135
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,540
programming environment or programming languages you're using.

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,970
So I have autocomplete Python which we're going to be using during this course.

137
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,160
I will show you how to install it in just a second.

138
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,590
Theme's that's going to be things like colorization or syntax themes.

139
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,980
So I have added material in one dark as my user interface theme and as my syntax theme.

140
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,100
So you can copy and use those as well.

141
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,500
Then you have updates once you've installed packages or themes you can update them and then you have

142
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,250
install.

143
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,280
So go ahead and come to install and then we need two main packages.

144
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,150
Go ahead and search for Python with packages selected here.

145
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,830
It's going to search packages for Python and then you'll eventually see somewhere at the very top autocomplete

146
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,660
python.

147
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,200
And I've already have it installed so you don't see the install button here but you're going to something

148
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
like this install button.

149
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,030
So go ahead and install autocomplete Python as I'm coding along with this course.

150
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,790
You'll notice a little bit of a drop down selection that helps you autocomplete your Python functions

151
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,930
or Python commands.

152
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,070
That's the package that allows me to do that.

153
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,220
The next package you'll probably want is the a terminal package.

154
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:10,090
So go ahead and search for terminal with packages selected and the one we like to use is platform you

155
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,700
dash ID dashed terminal and again install this package.

156
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,370
What this allows you to do is once you've installed this if you click here on this plus button it will

157
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,510
open up a new terminal inside of Adam.

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,700
That way you can call Python here right from inside of Adam without having to change anything.

159
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,800
So I can quit here.

160
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,180
And then what we're going to be doing is we're going to say Python and then be running scripts inside

161
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,730
of Adam as such.

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,830
What I want to point out is for Windows users by default it uses the power shell and usually the power

163
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,070
shell has issues with the Anaconda installation.

164
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,800
So what you're going to want to do is after you've installed the platform in the terminal what you should

165
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,260
do is especially if you're on a Windows computer edit this so that instead of using your power shell

166
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,390
by default eases your command prompt by default again this is only for Windows users.

167
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,760
It's a very quick fix.

168
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,830
You just come to packages and either search for a terminal or scroll down to find terminal number you

169
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,800
already installed terminal at this point click on settings and then somewhere along this you should

170
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,130
see Shell override where you're going to do is write this command right here.

171
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:31,990
You're going to want to have it point to see Windows system 32 C and D E x e because by default it's

172
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,510
going to point to power shell.

173
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Again this is only for Windows users if you're a Mac OS or Linux it's going to automatically point to

174
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,200
a terminal and you shouldn't have any issues.

175
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,900
All right so that's the shell override.

176
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,440
And that's an important step for Windows users using the terminal inside of Adam.

177
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,640
The last thing I want to point out is editing colors and themes as I mentioned.

178
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:59,720
If you come over to the core settings and click on themes I'm using atom material and one dark as my

179
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,110
syntax theme if you ever want to install those you just come to install click on themes and then search

180
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:13,270
whatever themes you want such as one dark enter and you can see the one dark you find that I have installed.

181
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,790
So that's an option for you.

182
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,650
A lot of times you can play around if you like a light setting you can do that as well if you like a

183
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,610
darker setting.

184
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,290
You can do that.

185
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,090
And if you google search more Adam actually has the ability to put custom CSSA scripts so you can color

186
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,840
this however you see it.

187
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,710
OK that's really all there is to Adam.

188
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,340
The main thing here we're just installing it setting up Python autocomplete setting up this terminal

189
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,680
so you can call Adam and show you how to install themes and syntax themes.

190
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,150
All right.

191
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Now they've installed Anaconda in Python to computer.

192
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,600
It's time to set up the environment.

193
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,850
Now technically it's optional to set up a virtual environment with the com the command line tool a virtual

194
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,210
environment basically allows you to create a version of Python and certain library installations on

195
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,220
your computer that will hold that actual versioning of the pip installed libraries.

196
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,250
That way you don't need to worry in case Dasch has an upgrade later on into the future.

197
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,640
You're going to be able to run our notes securely and make sure they work in your virtual environment.

198
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,130
So we're going to be using Pipp install to install the required libraries.

199
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,370
You can use Pitman's stall with or without that virtual environment.

200
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,320
However we do recommend using that virtual environment where you basically have a container that can

201
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,230
hold specific versions of dash and you can player on future versions of plotline in a separate virtual

202
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,160
environment.

203
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,470
So for convenience we've already created a requirements that textfile that you can use this requirements

204
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,650
that textfile is essentially just a list of libraries to install with Pip.

205
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,470
So it'll be really easy to use that your command line to just have a single line that installs all the

206
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,950
libraries will be using in order to actually use that requirements that text file at the command line

207
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,530
you're going to need to CD or change directory at your command line to wherever you say the unzipped

208
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,230
version of the court's notes or files.

209
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,650
So make sure you've already downloaded the unzipped version of the course notes files.

210
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,800
So usually we provide them as a zip file.

211
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,680
You'll download them unzip and then there should be a requirement that text file in that actual folder

212
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,010
that was unzipped.

213
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,010
So let's go to our command line find that requirements that text file and show you create a virtual

214
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,260
environment and then easily Pipp install all the libraries required for the course.

215
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,530
All right.

216
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,170
Here I am at my downloads folder.

217
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,170
You'll notice 40 unzipped the notes for this course and I have it in this folder plotless dashboards

218
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,150
of dash.

219
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,210
If you double click on that you'll notice all the folders and all are notes and if you go all the way

220
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,080
down you'll see a requirements that text file.

221
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,650
If you actually open up this requirements a text file it's just a list of libraries to install with

222
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,060
a Pipp install command.

223
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,980
So that's what we're going to be doing here.

224
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,800
We're going to create a virtual environment and then we're going to install all these requirements.

225
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,890
So it's just a few steps at your command line.

226
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,960
The actual step of creating a virtual environment that's technically not necessary.

227
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,480
You could just say pipin stall for these requirements text without creating the virtual environment.

228
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,920
We'll leave that as an option to you in case you didn't install Khanda or you already had Python installed

229
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,480
and don't really want to create virtual environments.

230
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,600
However we do recommend using virtual environments.

231
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,110
That way you can always activate and deactivate these specific versions of the libraries.

232
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,930
Let's head over to our command line.

233
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,280
OK.

234
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,760
Here I am at my command line.

235
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:28,530
I'm going to CD or change directory into downloads and then I'm going to change directory again into

236
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,960
that plot folder.

237
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,460
So now I will have access to that requirements that text file.

238
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,670
Now the next step is to actually create a virtual environment.

239
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,440
We're going to use Konda create and that's the Anaconda command line tool for creating a virtual environment.

240
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,900
If you already have Python installed and decided not to actually use Anaconda that's totally OK.

241
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,700
You can do our next steps without doing.

242
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,920
This virtual environment.

243
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,650
So just skip this step of Conda create and move on to the pipin small step that we're going to show.

244
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,520
And just a little bit.

245
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,380
But for Anaconda's users I would suggest creating a virtual environment.

246
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,090
So we'll go ahead and say Konda create dash dash name.

247
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,480
I want to say this is my dash ESV that's the name of our environment.

248
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,340
You can name it whatever you want.

249
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,910
And we're going to set up this environment with Python.

250
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:24,120
We'll say 3.6 enter and it will solve for the environment and basically create a virtual environment

251
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,620
with Python 3.6.

252
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,080
Ready to go for you.

253
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,060
They'll ask you if you want to set some things up.

254
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,530
Go ahead and say yes and we'll go ahead and install those packages for you.

255
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,900
I'm going to skip forward in time until this is done OK.

256
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
Everything was just installed.

257
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,560
Now I can activate and deactivate this environment.

258
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,570
If you're on a Windows you're going to say activate and then the environment name which is my dash envy

259
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:57,370
if you're using bash or Power Shell Well you need to say is source activate tool say source space activate

260
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,350
if you're on Mac OS Linux or using bash in general.

261
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,560
So since I'm just on a Windows computer I will say activate my dash envy again.

262
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,070
Mac OS Linux users say.

263
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,870
Source.

264
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,320
Space.

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,710
Activate the name of your environment.

266
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,550
So once you've activated that environment you should see in parentheses a little showing up of the name

267
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,660
of your environment.

268
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,430
This means that currently our environment is activated.

269
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,810
So this is where we want to install all the libraries from that requirements textfile.

270
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:30,580
All right once we've activated my dash in vi you should notice imprint sees my dash in a V on the left.

271
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,360
The next step is simply pipin stall all the requirement files.

272
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,940
What we need to do is make sure you cd into the specific unzipped folder that contains the requirements

273
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,110
that text file.

274
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,850
So again to do that if you ever want to go up a directory it should see the dot dot and if you ever

275
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,840
want to go into a directory it's CD and then you can begin typing out the actual name of your directory.

276
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,120
You should be able to tab autocomplete that enter and now we're in that folder.

277
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:04,100
OK so let's actually now say Pipp install Dasch are and then we're going to type out requirements that

278
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,980
txt file.

279
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,040
If you're in the right location you should be able to tab autocomplete this so that it says requirements

280
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,910
stop text as a quick note.

281
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,410
If you hit tab here and you notice it's not auto completing.

282
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,510
That means you either haven't unzipped the folder or you're in the wrong location and it doesn't contain

283
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,070
the requirements text file.

284
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,740
So if you ever get an issue with requirements text not found it means you're in the wrong location and

285
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,000
you need to CD into the location like we just showed.

286
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,390
So let's hit enter here and then you should get a bunch of commands reporting back collecting files

287
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
and installing the libraries.

288
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,260
So basically what we're installing Here are the main components for Dash the main components for flask

289
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,890
which Dash's built upon and then some pie and panderers.

290
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm going to skip forward in time until all of these have finished downloading and installing.

291
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,400
All right we've jumped forward in time.

292
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,590
You should see it say something like successfully installed as an alternative.

293
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,460
You can always install the libraries as you go along this course by simply saying Pip install and then

294
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,900
the name of the library.

295
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,810
Let's make sure that this all worked by saying Python enter.

296
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,640
Make sure your environment was activated when you called Python and then say import dash enter and if

297
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,090
you don't get any error then you're good to go.

298
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,080
If you do get some sort of error saying dasht not found then I would recommend as you go along through

299
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,770
the course.

300
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,570
Just say Pipp install and then the library you need throughout the course will be reminding you of the

301
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,960
libraries were going to be using such as them pie panderers and dash.

302
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,020
It will tell you the instructions to install them one by one.

303
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,160
Either way it's not a huge inconvenience to install them one by one.

304
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,140
There's really not that many libraries that we use.
