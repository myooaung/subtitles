00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,730
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to go over the solution for the box plus exercise.

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,870
Let's get started.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,850
All right so here we are at the exercise file.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,100
The you wanted to make a data frame using that abalone data set and then we wanted to take two independent

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,190
random samples of different sizes and we gave you a couple of hints here about how to actually do this.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,550
So let's start off and we'll say import.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:36,990
First off when you plot the off line as pujo And as always we also need plot the graph objects and we'll

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,520
have those as go.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,450
Then finally we'll import pi as p as well as pantless then we'll read in the dataset so will say create

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,170
data from the physical to PD that read CXXVI

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,330
an insight or data folder.

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,480
We have the ability thought see every file and now it's time to take two random samples of different

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,200
sizes.

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,800
So we wanted to do this from the Rings column.

15
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,370
So if you look here we gave you kind of an example of how to do this.

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:16,270
So let's copy right here this line and we'll set two samples we'll say a is equal to any random thought

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,830
choice.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,760
And for this one I'll choose 30 samples and for B I can choose any other number of samples.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,800
Again it's really up to you how many samples you wanted to actually grab.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,200
So let's choose let's say 20 here you could have also done 10.

21
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,310
Other number.

22
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,100
It's really up to you.

23
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,620
Basically the main idea here is just create two box blocks and the box plots are similar enough.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,930
Then we can assume that both of these were taken from the same sample group or same population that

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,490
we have created a variable of two box plots.

26
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,900
So two this will say data is equal to.

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,730
And I will say that our list here first box plot is just going to say why is equal to a.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,480
And we'll get the name of capital-T then for our second box plot in this list essentially the same thing

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,700
except Y is now equal to B and name is equal to we'll say capital B.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,180
So we have two samples there.

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:20,690
Well create a really an object with go that lay out and give this a title we'll say two random samples

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,430
we'll create our figure.

33
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,470
Go figure.

34
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:35,160
And say that is equal to data and lay out is equal to LEO and enough for all this we'll just plot out

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,570
the figure save it and run it.

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,900
And let's see what we get.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,080
Again you will get slightly different results depending on what you actually got as a random sample

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,390
and how many values you chose.

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,490
So we'll enter here by some basic pie.

40
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,270
And overall you should see something that looks similar to this depending on how large of samples you've

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,610
got your box plots may be slightly different than each other but they should more or less be around

42
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,430
the same range.

43
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,000
So here I can see that it looks like 50 percent of my samples from sample A are somewhere between 9

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,680
and 11 and it looks like I had a little more variation on B which makes sense because it was a larger

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,230
draw.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,870
And these tend to be between seven and maybe 10 and a half ish.

47
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,520
OK.

48
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,170
So I can see right here that the populations do seem to be similar enough.

49
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,430
This is something you can play around with by grabbing different size X samples so maybe you can grab

50
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,520
a 100 here and 30 here save this.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
Run it again and see how that changes your results.

52
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,330
Mean idea being that you were able to create two box plots again.

53
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,080
Here we can see that these samples tend to be even more in line of each other because we grabbed even

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
more samples.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,970
OK.

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,510
If you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums but hopefully you're able to get that.

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,570
We'll see at the next lecture.
