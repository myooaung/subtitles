00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.890
Let's now go over the solution for that simple dashboard exercise.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.180
OK so let's start off with the imports.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.590
Hopefully by now these feel pretty natural to you.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.200
First off import dash.

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.370
And then also import Dasch core components as DCC.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.810
And in case we need to use them also import dash H.T. and other components as HTL.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.910
And we'll be using both of these H.M. for the div. and DCC for that graph object.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.610
Then in order to actually create that scatterplot let's import plot the graph objects as go and we'll

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
import pandas as PD in order to actually read in that dataset.

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.730
So then we're going to read in that dataset.

12
00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.970
So we'll say DMF is equal to PD read cxxviii and this is going to be inside that data folder we have

13
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.990
the old faithful files old faithful that's ESV.

14
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
And then we can launch the application.

15
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.810
So basically that's just saying app is equal to dash dot dash.

16
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.010
So we have that ready to go.

17
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.630
We actually created the data frame so I'll delete that line and then we want to create that Daschle

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.050
that contains that graph component.

19
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.520
So for this we'll say app lay out.

20
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.340
So that's the application that we just created and we'll set this equal to an H Tim L div and then inside

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.600
of this we have a list and inside that list from Dasch core components we call that graph component.

22
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.700
And inside this graph component metry spell that right.

23
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.060
We have two parameters.

24
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.290
We give it an ID.

25
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.220
This is just a name.

26
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.160
Later on we'll see how to better use it so we can just really give it whatever string you want and then

27
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.640
more importantly we have the figure parameter.

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.210
So the figure parameter that's that dictionary that's going to take in a call to data and a call to

29
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.150
lay out.

30
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.970
So let's set that up.

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.860
We'll start off with our data so doing this over multiple lines to try to keep it organized data that's

32
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.670
the same plot Lead Data List that we saw before.

33
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.100
So inside of this list we say go scatter and then we're going to say x is equal to.

34
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.340
And in this case it's just lined up the same way.

35
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.780
So X and Y here are the actual names of those columns.

36
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:41.710
So you can say x is equal to f x and then we'll say Y is equal to DSF Y and then we'll set mode equal

37
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.110
to marker's.

38
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.600
So we have that nice scatterplot then for the LEO we're going to set up a similar thing will say Go

39
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.750
pasan a LEO object here and in this case it's up to you how much detail you want to go into but I'll

40
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.570
just give it a title.

41
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.130
Old Faithful lips.

42
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.290
There we go and we'll say eruptions as the title.

43
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.270
So Old Faithful we were options and you can give things like give it an x axis or y axis parameters.

44
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.670
We do that in the solution but it's really up to you as far as how much detail you want to go in the

45
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.060
layout and you've heard me say that multiple times.

46
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.000
OK so best thing to realize here is recreate that div that's elist there inside that list we have this

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.320
graph component it's that we have the ID parameter and the figure parameter that figure parameter is

48
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.920
the dictionary that takes in a data that's that lists for the party and the layout and then that's the

49
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.460
go that layout once you have that you should be able to at the bottom just say if name is equal to mean

50
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.250
we take the app and we run the server off of it.

51
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.130
So let's say this and check if it runs correctly and we'll do any debugging that we have to do in case

52
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.020
we get any errors.

53
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.010
We'll say Python basic apply.

54
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.530
Enter let me expand on this.

55
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.710
Looks like it's running so let me go to my browser and check that you are working.

56
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.740
All right there we have it.

57
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.150
We have old faithful eruptions and our dashboard is working know those here I don't have an x axis title

58
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.260
or Y-axis title.

59
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.470
You can add those yourself.

60
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.460
All quickly show you how you could do that.

61
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.780
In case you're interested in.

62
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.010
But basically you've already accomplished the main purpose of this dashboard which is show the Old Faithful

63
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040
eruptions.

64
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.780
So let's go back and add in those x axis and y axis title and finish up the solutions video.

65
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.950
So coming back here to go lay out we have this title parameter where we can always add is x axis as

66
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:45.260
well as the x axis equal to and inside of this we pass in a dictionary where we can say title and for

67
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.880
the x axis that was the duration of the eruption and then we'll also give a y axis parameter and this

68
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.400
Waks parameter same thing title.

69
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.370
But remember Y-axis that was the interval OK.

70
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.470
So you can save that and we can check on the browser again to see if it got updated.

71
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.840
So if you run that again you can check out in your browser and see those x titles as well as the y axis

72
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.250
titles or.

73
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.560
That's the basics of your first simple dashboard.

74
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.410
Hopefully now you feel comfortable being able to create the HTML div create that graph component create

75
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.050
that the parameter the figure parameter and then insert a data or layout into that figure dictionary.

76
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.450
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and we can help you out there.

77
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.860
We'll see you at the next lecture.
