Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,570
Now that you know how to create bubble bursts of partly let's test for new skills with an exercise we'll

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,210
go over the exercise of this lecture and the next lecture will go over the solutions.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,210
Let's jump to that PI script.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,380
All right.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,570
So for your bubble Churr exercise your main objective is to simply create a bubble chart that compares

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,260
a couple of other features from the mpg that C S V data set.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,550
So that can do things like compare mpg versus cylinders and then use displacement as the actual bubble

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,070
size or maybe horsepower versus weight.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,880
Then use acceleration as ball size et cetera.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,780
So it's really up to you which fields to choose.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,210
But remember basically we're trying to show three features three to them and plot.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,640
So you're going to do your imports create the data frame create your data choose fields for X Y and

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,260
then the market size attributes.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,970
You may want to play around that mark size attribute may need to make it smaller or larger and then

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,660
create a layout for title and axis labels and then create a figure.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,100
So for example you can have a plot that looks something like this.

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,850
Here we have vehicle acceleration versus displacement.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,800
So acceleration equals seconds to reach 60 mph then displacement on the X-axis.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,020
And if you hover over you'll end up seeing some information about the actual model car there.

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,560
OK.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,480
So that's it for this Boulter exercise.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,070
Best of luck.
