1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,920
Welcome back to the final part of updating graphs on interactions.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,120
Previously we saw how we could edit that acceleration plot so that the pitch of the plot changes on

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,780
its acceleration depending on what car was being hovered over.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,310
Now let's go ahead and edit the thickness of that line to have a visual representation of the number

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,120
of cylinders the car has as well as adding a little bit of mark down information.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,100
So we have text data for the car itself.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,030
Let's head back over toward text editor and finish off the project.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,160
OK here we are back at R-TX Ed..

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,450
We have all our imports and then we have our lay out where we have two divs right now.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,390
One for that scatterplot graph.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,140
Another one for the acceleration.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,350
We're going to do now is add one more div for our markdown.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,870
So let's zoom into that last live come back down here.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,860
So this is going to be T.M. div..

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,740
Again Rohrer to put in this comma here and then we will say a list.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,360
And this is going to take in a core component.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,030
I will say this is see markdown and technically you don't need another day here.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:16,300
This is just if you want to edit styles and we'll give this an ID of MPG underscore stat's and we're

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,480
going to do here is for the Stiv.

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,280
We'll give it a style dictionary.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,250
We'll set the width to be 20 percent just like the acceleration plot to make sure that's a string and

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:40,470
then we'll also say give it a height of let's say 50 percent just like we did for the plot and then

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:48,810
it's display is also going to be in line display and this will be in line the block.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,140
All right.

25
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,170
So we have our mark down recall from our multiple outputs lecture that right now we have a single output

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,120
to this graph.

27
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,270
But if we want to add in another output that means we actually need to add a second callback that can

28
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,870
take multiple inputs in a single callback foot for multiple outputs.

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,920
We need another callback.

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,910
So we're going to do here is essentially create another function call say the F and this is going to

31
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,580
be we'll call this callback underscore stats.

32
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,620
So we're going to report back stats about the car that's being hovered over the hover data and let's

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:32,290
go out and grab our actual callback values our output is now going to go to the markdown that we just

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:32,870
created.

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,280
So the idea we gave it was mpg stats so let's grab this and stick it in that MPG stats and we're going

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,730
to overwrite it's children

37
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,460
and then we want the input to come from mpg scatterplot that we made.

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,520
So that's the same input as before.

39
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,010
Essentially it's the same lines right here and you scatter.

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Now we're taking in the hover data than that however that is going to go inside this function.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,840
So we need to do is return back the actual text we want displayed in that markdown the way we do that

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,530
is we'll save the underscore index just as it did before is that hover data.

43
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:25,230
In the points key I want to grab the first item in that list and then grab the points index value from

44
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:34,090
that we can actually set up a large markdown text and to do this we're going to set up a multi-line

45
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,910
text and I'm actually going to just copy and paste this from the solutions.

46
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,080
It's really up to you how you want to format this.

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,600
This is again just to reiterate that you can't use markdown text formatting.

48
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,690
I'm going to copy and paste this here.

49
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,630
From our notes.

50
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,820
So this is what I'm copying and pasting noticed I have some values here that need to be filled in over

51
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:08,020
this multi-line but I have some number of cylinders some CCC displacement and zero to 60 in some number

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,930
of seconds using markdown.

53
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,620
I'm actually going to be able to keep these on a separate line if I was just returning back a normal

54
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,110
string that mark down.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,010
It would show up all on one line.

56
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,900
So once you've done that I can say that format and start inserting the values.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,720
So first I want to grab the number of cylinders to do that I can say DMF I location of that particular

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,950
vehicle index grab the value for the Sillars column then the next thing I want to grab is the displacement

59
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,730
value.

60
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,370
So very similar thing.

61
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,840
That vehicle index grab the displacement value

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,800
and then lastly I went from zero to 60 in seconds.

63
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,140
So that's going to be Dia.

64
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,900
I'll see at the vehicle index.

65
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,840
Go ahead and grab it's acceleration value.

66
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,420
OK so then those are going to be inserted into this multi-line string.

67
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,240
And because it's marked down it's actually going to be able to understand that you have multiple lines

68
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,140
here.

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,660
OK.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,910
The last thing I want to do is add a little bit to this acceleration plot.

71
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,560
So it was crawling back up here.

72
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,950
Remember this acceleration plot.

73
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,260
What we want to do is actually at its thickness based on the number of cylinders.

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,570
So to do that we actually go back down and edit our layout excuse me.

75
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:40,180
Our data here in this figure mode is equal to lines and then the line we're going to set it's with upon

76
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,950
update equal to two times the number of cylinders.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,650
So we can say just as before the location of that particular vehicle index grabbed the number of cylinders.

78
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,360
And the reason we say to X is just to make the effects a little more noticeable.

79
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,710
In fact if you really want to make a noticeable You can choose a larger value such as 3 x so let's zoom

80
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,980
out and do a quick review of everything we just did.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,020
Probably one of our largest projects so far and this is a good prep for our code along milestone project

82
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,670
but remember really what we're showing you here is how you can interact with other graphs when you have

83
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,130
hover data selected data or click data.

84
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,480
The main idea being is you just say hover data and then return back a figure.

85
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,460
Basically just combining two ideas that we've already seen in the past.

86
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,030
OK.

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,470
So what we did here is we let our imports read in the data fix one of the columns and often for real

88
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,040
data such you'll have to do that.

89
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,790
Then we set up or lay out two giant outermost div and then we have now three divs first div that's the

90
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,490
scatterplot of MPG versus a year.

91
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:48,720
Then we have a second div That's the plot that shows the line of acceleration and then we have marked

92
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,850
down text that we're going to return to this first function.

93
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,040
What it does is based on the hover data it grabs the vehicle index you're looking at and then it turns

94
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,670
back a figure at edits its data and edits its layout and then adjust the actual slope of the figure.

95
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,810
This is kind of a unique example and it's a little more complex than what you would probably normally

96
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,070
be doing but hopefully it's a good example of what partly in-dash are actually capable of.

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,910
I would imagine that.

98
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,570
And your more real world examples you won't have to be editing the pitch of a plot or a line but it

99
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,680
is possible.

100
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,820
Then for this last one we went ahead and set up the callback to actually return back some sort of information

101
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,670
stats to that markdown.

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,830
And lastly we actually need to return that.

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,600
So let's do that now at the very bottom of this.

104
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,380
We're going to say return stats and in case you're wondering where this princes is matching up to it's

105
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,250
for this format call.

106
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,290
So let's make sure return stats is indented properly it should line up right here of this first level

107
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,030
of indentation for the function.

108
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,070
Ok save this lots of code.

109
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,790
So let's make sure we don't make any errors or run Python basic about pi enter and wait a little bit.

110
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,320
If you're waiting a little bit that's a good sign because it means it's running the app.

111
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,310
OK let's go to our dashboard and see if it worked.

112
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,890
All right here's our dashboard right now.

113
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,410
Sets the defaults on that layout.

114
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,830
As we hover over this we now get to see the information being displayed back something to those right

115
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,120
now is I'm actually not seeing that information of the car itself.

116
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,720
So let's make sure that we save that return stats that we just edited.

117
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,970
However I do see the thickness of the line changing depending on the number of cylinders.

118
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,440
So let's go back here I want to close this.

119
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,150
Let's come back here and do a little debugging.

120
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,870
Looks like callback stat's is taking hover data.

121
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,020
I am returning stats right now.

122
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,360
So let me save this.

123
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,340
I'm going to troll see here and it looks like there may have been an error.

124
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,460
It looks like points index was not found.

125
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,860
So let's make sure that we're doing the right one it should be point index.

126
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,550
OK so news here is actually pretty capable of still running the dashboard even if there's an error on

127
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,260
your script.

128
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,560
And so there's a key error here actually typed points index at a point index.

129
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,410
So let's fix that.

130
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm going to save it.

131
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,520
And now let's run this again.

132
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,140
Hopefully now that fixes that markdown issue.

133
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,780
So that's running.

134
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,090
Let's head back toward dashboard.

135
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,300
OK restarted the dashboard now as they hover over this.

136
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,390
Now I'm actually seeing the data and the format is a little different right now because I'm actually

137
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,240
quite zoomed in to this dashboard.

138
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,770
You can see the number of cylinders the displacement and how many seconds it takes to go from 0 to 60.

139
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,980
If you choose a really recent car.

140
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,810
Well recent from 1982.

141
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,410
It goes from zero and 4.6 or maybe 18 Fenn's on the MPG.

142
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,380
You can see here some of these 1970s cars definitely changes in the cylinders.

143
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,280
OK.

144
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,110
So that's the entire dashboard project really.

145
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,020
All you really need to get out of this lecture is the fact that you can hover over data select data

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,940
or click data and use that to effect an update.

147
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,900
Another figure in your plot.

148
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,560
So we're going to be working on all these ideas combining them all together multiple outputs multiple

149
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,510
