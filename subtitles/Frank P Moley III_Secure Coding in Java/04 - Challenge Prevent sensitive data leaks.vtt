(upbeat music)

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.009
- [Instructor] So this brings us

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.008
to our next challenge exercise for this course.

4
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.009
In this challenge, your goal is to find a solution

5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.000
to the linking of sensitive data in the logs.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.004
We'll take the code from the previous challenge.

7
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.005
I've added some logging to the application,

8
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.002
so make sure you update it from the exercise files,

9
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.005
but I did so in a way that leaks sensitive data.

10
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.006
Now you choose how to fix this.

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.005
Run the tests, and you'll see the log messages print out

12
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.003
and easily be able to identify the sensitive data

13
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.001
that appears in the log message.

14
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.007
But again, from there, it's your choice how to resolve it.

15
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.009
I'm going to leave that up to you,

16
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.000
and I'll get back with some of those solutions.
