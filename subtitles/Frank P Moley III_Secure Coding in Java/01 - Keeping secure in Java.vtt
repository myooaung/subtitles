00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Moley] Java is one of the most popular languages

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.003
for software development,

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.003
especially for the enterprise space.

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:11.000
As such, Java applications are constantly targets

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.003
of bad actor's actions.

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.002
What increases this concern is that Java

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.008
is used for a lot of internal enterprise applications

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.009
and often internal threats from disgruntled employees

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.008
or even curious employees

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.006
are much more dangerous than external actors

11
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.004
due to their inside knowledge.

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.005
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

13
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.002
I'm a seasoned software professional

14
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.006
with a lot of time spent

15
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.001
with a focus on security functions within my team.

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.003
I have built security focused systems and controls

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.006
and taught secure coding courses for enterprises.

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:45.005
In this course,

19
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.007
we will start the journey of secure coding for Java.

20
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.009
Now, I say journey because security is just that,

21
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.007
a journey, not a destination.

22
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.003
We will speak about the most common attacks

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:58.009
against Java applications

24
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:01.002
and some common remediations for them.

25
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.000
So let's get ready to go.
