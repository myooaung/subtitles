00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] One of the features of Java

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:05.005
that is often overlooked or best misunderstood

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.002
is accessibility.

4
00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.006
Good software development practices

5
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.006
from a security perspective must keep this functionality

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.008
in mind.

7
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.007
Limiting accessibility in Java

8
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.002
is relatively straightforward.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.002
Public is just that;

10
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.005
it's public for anyone consuming your code.

11
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.004
Only mark things public

12
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.000
if you expect them to be consumed

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.003
and have taken adequate measures to protect that code

14
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.001
when it is consumed.

15
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.007
If your class or interface should not be consumed

16
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.003
outside its containing package,

17
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.001
it should be marked as package private.

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.002
You can further protect your packages

19
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.009
by using the package access security property.

20
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.008
Now this isn't a touch-free setting

21
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.005
and before you consider using it,

22
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.004
I suggest you do some research

23
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.007
and fully understand its impact.

24
00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:01.002
In addition, class methods, members, and constructors

25
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.002
should be protected if they should not be exposed

26
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.000
to outside consumers.

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.006
Constructors can be private.

28
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.000
You can control object construction

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.002
through static public or protected builders

30
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:18.000
if you need to control the object construction routine.

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.002
Finally, to prevent unintended extension of your packages,

32
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.002
consider sealing your packages

33
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.003
as part of your JAR manifest.

34
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:32.002
Doing so will ensure that only class files from your package

35
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:36.003
within your JAR can be loaded into the class loader.

36
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:40.008
Because package protections are at your class loader level,

37
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.008
sealing the packages in your JAR

38
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:47.000
will ensure your protections are not circumvented.
