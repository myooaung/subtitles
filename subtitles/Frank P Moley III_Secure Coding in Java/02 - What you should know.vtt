00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] In order for you to be successful

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.003
in this course,

3
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.001
there's a little bit of setup on your machine

4
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.002
that we need to do as well as some prerequisite knowledge

5
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.000
that you need to have.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.006
This course is about securing Java-based programs.

7
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.007
So let's talk about Java first.

8
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.008
You will need to have an intermediate knowledge of Java

9
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:20.007
to be successful in this course.

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.007
If you aren't able to use base constructs in Java

11
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.004
or understand the basic operations of the JVM,

12
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.008
you'll want to spend some time learning more about Java.

13
00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.007
You need to have the ability to not only write code

14
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:34.009
but read it.

15
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.007
That may not sound like a big deal,

16
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.009
but reading and comprehending code is far more difficult,

17
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.008
I find, than writing it.

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.001
You will also need to understand how to debug

19
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.006
a running Java application.

20
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.002
Good debugging skills often takes time to develop,

21
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.002
but you will need to be able to do it in order to find

22
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:59.001
and defeat security vulnerabilities in your code.

23
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.008
With this course, I don't need you to be an expert

24
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.007
at debugging, just be able to run the debugger

25
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.003
and step through code.

26
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.007
You will also need to be able to compile

27
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:11.002
and ultimately run your Java applications.

28
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.006
Now you will need to have a little bit of software installed

29
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.007
on your computer to get going with the code samples

30
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:17.008
in this course.

31
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:22.000
First and foremost, you will need to have the JDK installed.

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.004
Make sure it's a JDK and not the JRE.

33
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.008
I'm going to be using Java 14,

34
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.003
but you should be able to use anything greater than 11.

35
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.007
In fact, most of the examples should be able to use anything

36
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.003
greater than 1.8

37
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:38.003
in case you're on a corporate machine.

38
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.005
You can either use open JDK or Oracle JDK,

39
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.001
either should work fine.

40
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.007
We will use Maven for a dependency management tool.

41
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.007
You will need to have Maven installed on your machine

42
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:53.002
and Apache provides some very good instructions.

43
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.008
Now, we aren't going to go into a lot with Maven

44
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.000
outside of simple use cases.

45
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.003
If you want a little bit more background on Maven itself,

46
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:05.000
we have a course from the library on introduction to Maven.

47
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.002
You also should have a good Java IDE.

48
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.008
This will make writing, reading, debugging,

49
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.009
and running code significantly easier.

50
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.007
Now, I will be using IntelliJ Ultimate Edition.

51
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:19.007
I use their products every day for work, and for me,

52
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.008
they make me more efficient.

53
00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:26.001
But you don't need IntelliJ Ultimate Edition.

54
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.009
You can use the community edition,

55
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.006
you can use Eclipse, or really you can use any modern IDE

56
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:33.001
that you're comfortable with.

57
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.005
So even though I'm using IntelliJ Ultimate Edition,

58
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:38.007
please don't feel like you have to do the same thing.

59
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:44.000
Any Java IDE will work just fine for this course.
