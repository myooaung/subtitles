WEBVTT

00:01.910 --> 00:02.790
Welcome back.

00:02.810 --> 00:06.840
And in this lesson were you to look at more we can do with canvas.

00:06.860 --> 00:14.180
So we saw earlier in the course that the dorm is available we're able to do some CSSA for be able to

00:14.240 --> 00:22.310
apply some animations and we're able to update and change things outputs for the web user and canvas

00:22.310 --> 00:28.940
can do a lot of the similar things that we saw within the dorm where we've got the ability to draw things

00:29.000 --> 00:34.310
and present information to the user visually and with canvas.

00:34.310 --> 00:38.150
We actually do have some more options than the dorm.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.360
So the dorm is actually fairly memory intensive.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.550
There's also less control over how things get drawn out.

00:44.660 --> 00:52.010
And we saw earlier that with canvas we can actually draw things out and we can be very precise as to

00:52.070 --> 00:57.680
what it's actually going to look like within our canvas and with canvas we actually have the ability

00:57.680 --> 01:03.650
to have multiple canvases on one page so they can also interact with each other.

01:03.640 --> 01:10.190
There is a lot more flexibility and we also have a lot more power when we're dealing with elements.

01:10.190 --> 01:17.790
So I simply update this and I'm going to copy this out and I'm going to create all multiple canvases

01:18.170 --> 01:24.530
and then what we're going to do is we're going to show you because we saw how we can create it as an

01:24.530 --> 01:26.020
image.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.690
So basically that means that canvas can also take images.

01:30.770 --> 01:35.180
So actual images and embed them into the canvas as well.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.990
So that's another really great feature with canvas that we have the ability.

01:39.230 --> 01:43.370
So we saw earlier that we were actually able to create images.

01:43.430 --> 01:49.620
So let's go out and do the same thing that we did earlier where we can build it.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.460
First of all it's build out a rectangle.

01:52.610 --> 02:04.280
So this is going to be done in CTX one and the format that we used was fill rectangle or fill rec and

02:04.280 --> 02:07.550
we needed some numbers there so we needed some parameters there.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.530
So we needed a starting point.

02:09.770 --> 02:12.390
So we're going to start this one 5.

02:12.660 --> 02:21.380
So 5 x 5 y and we'll make it 150 by 100 so let's go and refresh

02:24.310 --> 02:30.040
and I'm actually going to get rid of this and I'm going to like this so we can actually see all three

02:30.040 --> 02:30.900
canvases.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.750
So there's all three canvases.

02:33.850 --> 02:43.510
So why didn't our rectangle actually output so one of the things that we do need to do is switch drew

02:43.510 --> 02:46.650
a rectangle but there's no color in it.

02:46.660 --> 02:49.010
And that's why we're not actually able to see it.

02:49.210 --> 02:55.510
So we need to specify a color and we saw earlier that we can specify and we were actually specifying

02:55.570 --> 02:56.640
a random color.

02:56.650 --> 03:02.350
So that was Phil style that gave us the ability to set a color.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.640
So this time I'm going to do something simple.

03:04.660 --> 03:06.140
I'm just going to do red.

03:06.380 --> 03:10.720
So let's refresh so refresh it.

03:10.760 --> 03:17.480
And there's our red rectangle So the next one that I wanted to do is I want to draw out a circle and

03:17.480 --> 03:24.160
we saw this earlier in the previous lesson as well that we could use the arc where we could draw out

03:24.170 --> 03:25.020
a circle.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.110
So this one CTX too.

03:27.260 --> 03:32.780
And we're going to do begin Poth.

03:32.870 --> 03:40.040
So that tells us that we're starting a brand new path and CTX to again and we're going to use arc

03:43.630 --> 03:47.010
and we saw that we can.

03:47.050 --> 03:49.390
We have to set some coordinates here.

03:49.570 --> 03:50.220
So we needed

03:53.400 --> 04:01.470
an X a y coordinate we needed the radius of the circle and we also needed an angle.

04:01.530 --> 04:05.160
And then also we need to include that math.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.370
So if we refresh it we don't actually see the circle.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.420
So why is that.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.240
I'm actually not seeing the circle.

04:11.340 --> 04:15.860
And that's because I didn't add the stroke value.

04:15.960 --> 04:23.000
So this is actually needs to be added Every time you create a stroke within your canvas.

04:23.010 --> 04:31.610
So there's our circle and I show you how you can actually fill the circle So let's bring that in here

04:31.700 --> 04:32.510
as well.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.940
So we need to use the fill style and remember we've got multiple canvases.

04:37.940 --> 04:43.290
So I want to make a blue circles Let's do that and refresh.

04:43.430 --> 04:46.120
And there's one other thing that we still need to show you.

04:46.120 --> 04:51.760
So we've got the stroke and we also need to do CTX fill.

04:51.830 --> 04:56.330
So doing the fill method and that's going to work the same way a stroke.

04:56.550 --> 05:03.350
But it's going to actually fill that last object with whatever Cuyo color is available so basically

05:03.350 --> 05:05.790
gives us a blue circle.

05:05.810 --> 05:06.380
So there we go.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.710
So now we've effectively drawn two images.

05:09.890 --> 05:17.690
So the last thing I want to do is I want to use draw image and we've got C-T x 3 already set up.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.730
So let's grab and we're going to draw image.

05:20.990 --> 05:27.530
And so what we need to do is first of all we need to specify an image and luckily we already have two

05:27.560 --> 05:29.560
images ready to go.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.500
And those are from canvas 1.

05:32.660 --> 05:35.850
So to CTX one and CTX two.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.080
So those are all ready to go.

05:38.180 --> 05:44.210
So a canvas one and canvas two we can use in order to add images.

05:44.210 --> 05:48.520
So let's set that image and we can set it at 10 10.

05:48.890 --> 05:55.790
And next let's take the other image as a canvas two and set that at 10:10 as well.

05:55.790 --> 05:56.540
So there we go.

05:56.540 --> 06:07.940
So we were over able to overlap one image on top of the other image using canvas Draut image it is one

06:07.940 --> 06:13.340
of the thing that I want to show you in this lesson and that's working with images that are already

06:13.340 --> 06:15.670
available within your page.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.430
So I need to equal that to my image.

06:19.630 --> 06:27.030
And let's give it a source so our source and I know that I've got that download there that we've got

06:27.040 --> 06:34.150
and we've got also the computer so we'll just use this one as our image so let's refresh and we see

06:34.150 --> 06:40.510
that this is the image that we've we used earlier and one of the games so we can actually pull this

06:40.570 --> 06:42.900
into canvas as well.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.580
So let's go ahead and pull that one in as the background.

06:47.740 --> 06:55.510
So this is going to be stacked so depending on when we're calling rendering out that function that's

06:55.510 --> 06:57.120
when it's going to put it there.

06:57.130 --> 07:02.590
So instead of a canvas one I want to grab that image and this is actually going to be really easy to

07:02.600 --> 07:08.140
do where all I need to do is to document.

07:08.140 --> 07:13.730
So we know that the image and the image information is available within the dorm.

07:13.750 --> 07:23.150
So all I need to do is grab my image as an object in javascript and that means that I can then make

07:23.150 --> 07:29.940
use of it within my web page so if I refreshed the page.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.110
So right now if we go out and if we refresh it we actually don't see that image being brought in.

07:35.250 --> 07:42.210
And that's because the way the order is loading that we need to make sure that the Dom has actually

07:42.210 --> 07:53.320
finished loading this image and that's where we need to wrap all of our canvas into a window onload

07:53.330 --> 07:56.180
function and then within that function itself.

07:56.180 --> 08:02.360
So just do an anonymous function and then that function will just wrap around everything.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.030
So now when we refresh it there we go.

08:05.030 --> 08:15.000
So now we're recreating a brand new image from an image that we've got sitting within our Web page.

08:15.220 --> 08:21.340
So that was great that we could combine two images that we've created and make a third one and we can

08:21.340 --> 08:28.390
also take our image that's available within our Web page and pull that back into our canvas and then

08:28.390 --> 08:30.800
actually build an image out of that.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.770
So now let's add some more functionality to this.

08:34.960 --> 08:41.860
And one of the other things that we can do is we can actually get these images as image paths.

08:41.860 --> 08:45.790
So what I'm going to quickly do is I'm going to add some Javascript.

08:45.790 --> 08:50.050
So an on click events and we're going to fire off

08:53.390 --> 08:54.720
image data.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.110
So it's going to return back that image data that's available there.

08:59.420 --> 09:02.830
So whenever we click on it and let's create that function.

09:03.020 --> 09:14.900
So the function image data AMG data whenever it gets clicked I going to do a console log and I can grab

09:14.960 --> 09:22.780
that event target information so that we saw that earlier that we can grab them at Target.

09:22.790 --> 09:23.980
So let's do that.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.480
And let's refresh.

09:25.550 --> 09:31.730
So now when I click it and let's open up the console we click it we get all of this information that's

09:31.730 --> 09:33.770
available within that Kandace.

09:33.830 --> 09:39.010
So there is a way to actually output this and get the data you are l.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.390
So that is two data.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.920
You are also all uppercase.

09:43.940 --> 09:49.820
So now when I click it we're actually going to get an image value there.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.860
So we get those data image PAGG so we get a base 64 representation of that image.

09:56.990 --> 10:03.320
And if you go out and if you look at this this is a representation of that image so you can actually

10:03.320 --> 10:07.800
click that and you can open it up and you can see that image separately.

10:07.820 --> 10:13.970
So we're actually able to pull out that canvas information that it's using in order to build out and

10:14.030 --> 10:21.650
display the image and we're able to pull that back into javascript into a value that we can you is within

10:21.710 --> 10:22.810
our script.

10:22.820 --> 10:28.700
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to update the value of this image so whenever it gets

10:28.700 --> 10:29.370
clicked.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.310
So let's add that in now.

10:31.370 --> 10:41.890
And instead of that let's do documents and we'll do get element by id and we'll grab that element so

10:41.900 --> 10:49.550
grab the my image and then know that we're actually pulling that value into canvas 3.

10:49.580 --> 10:54.110
So I want to just disable that.

10:54.210 --> 10:59.760
So I'm going to comment that so that it's actually not pulling that in because it might have some conflicts

10:59.760 --> 11:00.300
here.

11:00.510 --> 11:03.430
So we want to just work with the two that we have over there.

11:03.690 --> 11:12.280
So I get element by id my image and we know that we can set source value to it.

11:17.490 --> 11:26.520
So we can set its source and if we equal the source to this let's see what happens so let's go out and

11:26.520 --> 11:27.510
refresh it.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.540
And when we click it we're actually getting that image being represented there.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.000
Now within our aged him out.

11:35.190 --> 11:40.580
So what I want you to do now pause the video and we're going to do so Javascript.

11:40.710 --> 11:45.830
So I want you to build out another image in canvas 3.

11:45.960 --> 11:51.900
So a square a circle and you can do another circle a different color circle maybe yellow or something

11:51.900 --> 11:52.520
like that.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.380
So you have three canvasses each with its own image.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.270
And whenever we hover over it.

11:59.280 --> 12:06.750
So this is going to be the listener the mouseover of that listener that I want this image within the

12:06.810 --> 12:14.180
ID my image to update with whatever value is being represented within the canvas at the time.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.290
So go ahead.

12:15.300 --> 12:19.610
Pause the video and add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.290
So I hope you had an opportunity to try that out.

12:23.420 --> 12:31.790
And we're going to be doing what we saw earlier where we can update and we can grab that as a base 64

12:31.880 --> 12:37.040
image value and then we can output it back into our aged him out.

12:37.310 --> 12:41.280
So first thing that we need to do is we need to add some of that listeners.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.920
So we know that these are all canvas elements.

12:45.050 --> 12:50.230
So let's add those in and we're going to create a Word document.

12:50.510 --> 12:54.110
And this time let's use query selector.

12:54.200 --> 13:02.830
All and we're going to grab all of the elements that have that are using the canvas tag.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.620
So grab all of those.

13:04.730 --> 13:09.380
Next thing that we need to do we need to loop through those and we're going to set our event listeners

13:09.500 --> 13:11.010
as we're looping through.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.000
So variable.

13:12.030 --> 13:19.310
We're going to use the variable x loop through while X is less than the length of canvas and to increment

13:19.360 --> 13:22.020
X so we can break out of our loop.

13:22.220 --> 13:25.500
And then within here we're going to set our listener.

13:25.700 --> 13:33.700
So we're going to do X can and we're going to add a listener and the listener that we're adding is most

13:33.710 --> 13:42.770
over and I'm just going to do an anonymous function in here and we're going to use that event target

13:42.800 --> 13:45.290
object that we use down here.

13:45.290 --> 13:45.900
So that's it.

13:45.900 --> 13:55.340
So now we've grabbed that event listener and all we need to do is simply update that I can get rid of

13:55.340 --> 14:00.950
some of the stuff that we had here earlier because we don't need it anymore and there we go.

14:00.950 --> 14:03.010
So let's let's try the saved.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.700
Refresh it.

14:05.150 --> 14:09.620
And we see that now as we hover over everything looks great.

14:09.620 --> 14:17.250
And one other thing that I did want to what I did say is that we should add in something else here.

14:17.280 --> 14:24.480
So let's instead of these three I'm going to just simply commet these values out since we're not going

14:24.480 --> 14:25.300
to be using them.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.910
And we did say that we want it to have a yellow circle.

14:28.920 --> 14:29.910
So let's add that in

14:33.770 --> 14:37.770
so yellow circle and maybe this one can be a little bit bigger.

14:38.070 --> 14:41.420
So maybe we'll go outside of our boundaries so refresh.

14:41.430 --> 14:49.270
So there's our yellow circle and we do need to update this to see CTX 3.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.600
So one more time let's refresh that again.

14:51.790 --> 14:52.390
So there we go.

14:52.390 --> 15:01.600
So now whenever we hover over that canvas element we've got our actual HVM source is changing and updating

15:01.930 --> 15:06.090
with the newly created canvas content image.
