00:02.710 --> 00:07.080
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to be showing you how to validate a form.

00:07.080 --> 00:13.300
So this is a really useful function for javascript and we deal with forums all the time.

00:13.480 --> 00:20.230
So one of the things that we want to make sure with a form is that before the forum submits that we're

00:20.230 --> 00:26.190
actually checking to see if the fields that we're looking for are within the form.

00:26.410 --> 00:28.900
So this is where we're going to use on submit.

00:28.910 --> 00:34.630
So there's another event handler and this time we're going to return and we're going to do

00:38.840 --> 00:41.870
a validation of the form function.

00:41.870 --> 00:49.310
So this is going to work the same way as we saw earlier where when we had an element and we returned

00:49.310 --> 00:50.650
back of value.

00:50.660 --> 00:58.200
So if the value was false then we prevented the default action and we've prevented that event from triggering.

00:58.400 --> 01:04.640
So we can do the same thing for the forum and noticed the other thing here is that you've got a few

01:04.640 --> 01:08.240
options for where you want to place this validation.

01:08.240 --> 01:15.440
So typically we want to place it on the submission part of the form and the form works as one.

01:15.440 --> 01:22.300
So even if we've got an input and we do type equals submit.

01:22.400 --> 01:33.170
So make sure that this one is submit and the value is met that this way we can submit forms and this

01:33.170 --> 01:36.590
will work as the submission price of the form.

01:36.590 --> 01:44.000
And if the form is being submitted it will run that check to make sure that the content within the form

01:44.090 --> 01:45.180
is valid.

01:45.380 --> 01:53.630
So next we need to set up a function in order to accommodate that validation check.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.750
So let's go back and refresh it.

01:55.850 --> 02:01.430
And now when we submit it where we're not getting anything back we're not being able to do anything

02:01.430 --> 02:06.680
with the form because of the fact that we're not returning anything here.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.440
So we need to return either true or false.

02:10.460 --> 02:14.510
So let's return TRUE and see what happens.

02:15.910 --> 02:20.890
So go back and refresh and when we submit it we're actually submitting the form.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.680
So I actually need at Target in order to submit it.

02:24.760 --> 02:32.960
So let's add those in so that's action.

02:33.210 --> 02:36.910
And this is where we're submitting it so we'll just do it to index 2.

02:37.020 --> 02:45.910
So that's one of the files that we had created earlier and we'll do a method and get.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.020
So let's let's try this now.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.180
So refresh Now when we submit it we're actually going to the forum.

02:53.760 --> 03:02.880
And now if I update this to false Let's go back and refresh it and I'll try to submit the form and nothing

03:02.880 --> 03:03.550
happens.

03:03.750 --> 03:09.480
So we know that it works the same way if we're returning a value if it's false then we're not going

03:09.480 --> 03:11.790
to get that event being triggered.

03:11.790 --> 03:15.170
So basically it's going to cancel out the submission of the form.

03:15.300 --> 03:21.340
And this is what we can do in order to check to make sure that all of our inputs are there.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.670
So let's do tight and let's add in some inputs here.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.750
And for this one

03:30.990 --> 03:37.970
let's do we're going to do some ideas so to an ID and

03:41.710 --> 03:50.370
so do an ID of first name and I can I can just simply duplicate these.

03:50.370 --> 03:56.270
So next we'll do a last name and we want all of these fields to be filled out.

03:56.310 --> 04:01.960
And last time and maybe this one can be age or something like that to be a little bit different.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.520
So what all of these values filled with within the form

04:10.870 --> 04:16.890
and we saw also saw earlier that we can actually go through and we can go to the parent.

04:17.050 --> 04:20.560
So let's try that again where we get that target element.

04:21.110 --> 04:24.380
And so we're going to get the parent element.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.970
So that's the parent form that's being submitted actually.

04:29.020 --> 04:38.580
Let's let's first take a look at what the target is because this is important to note that we've got

04:38.580 --> 04:45.540
the actual event handler on the parent itself so that was typically the parent that we were using.

04:45.570 --> 04:51.840
So let's refresh this and open up our console and when we submit it we see that we are grabbing the

04:51.840 --> 04:57.510
form so we don't have to even traverse up any additional levels that we know that we're already on the

04:57.510 --> 04:58.840
level that we want to be.

04:58.980 --> 05:03.370
And we can go into those child nodes and we see that we've got the children.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.750
So we've got age first steam and last names so we can make use of that information that's contained

05:09.750 --> 05:13.980
within there so we can do children.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.000
And then we've got the first name last name and so on.

05:20.290 --> 05:22.220
So let's set up a variable.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.110
And I just going to call it P.

05:24.160 --> 05:30.030
So this is going to hold all of that event information that object.

05:30.610 --> 05:35.570
So this will be shorter and we can console log the soat.

05:35.830 --> 05:41.700
So now that I've got that in I can simply check to see if there's values.

05:41.860 --> 05:50.170
So we're going to rely on conditions again in order to check to see if there's a value for first name.

05:50.560 --> 05:59.160
So it's make sure that if first name is blank then we're going to return some type of error.

05:59.370 --> 06:01.740
And we're going to return back false

06:06.840 --> 06:10.550
and we know from previously when we were looking at functions.

06:10.650 --> 06:16.150
Whenever we do a return of a function that stops the rest of the code from running.

06:16.320 --> 06:21.530
So we don't have to worry about any of the stuff down here because we're returning false over here.

06:21.690 --> 06:28.110
So we know that if first name is blank then we're going to return back false and we can also pass something

06:28.110 --> 06:31.940
into that message function that we created earlier.

06:31.980 --> 06:45.630
So a message and let's say needs a first name.

06:45.790 --> 06:48.840
And so now let's let's try the out.

06:49.090 --> 06:56.250
And basically if everything passes then we can return back true.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.090
And then the form will submit.

06:59.350 --> 07:00.960
So let's see if this works.

07:00.970 --> 07:03.510
So now we try to submit it.

07:03.670 --> 07:11.640
Let's go back and there's one thing that I did forget to add in value there because we're checking to

07:11.640 --> 07:15.140
see if the value of that element is equal to this.

07:15.150 --> 07:16.450
So let's refresh now.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.610
And we submit.

07:17.670 --> 07:23.080
So now it says needs a first name when we put in something there we can see that that works now.

07:23.160 --> 07:28.200
So if we don't have any values in there we can't submit the form.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.150
It just tells us it needs a first name.

07:30.150 --> 07:35.310
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and update the rest of the fields.

07:35.400 --> 07:43.230
So update conditions for last name and age and then return back false and right the court in the appropriate

07:43.230 --> 07:45.640
messages for those fields.

07:45.810 --> 07:52.590
So pause the video build out the form and build out a form validation and I'll show you how to do that

07:52.680 --> 07:53.070
as well.

07:53.070 --> 08:02.260
Coming up so we saw that we can build out a form validation I'm just going to do some quick updates

08:02.260 --> 08:03.730
to the form.

08:03.730 --> 08:13.990
This is going to be first this is last and then this is age so we have some values there that we can

08:14.260 --> 08:15.640
take a look at.

08:15.670 --> 08:18.200
Now we can try to submit it needs a first name.

08:18.310 --> 08:24.280
So the challenge was to update this so that we can do.

08:24.310 --> 08:28.930
Last name and age so that all of the fields are required.

08:28.930 --> 08:37.480
So let's do that let's take care of that and check to see if there's a value for age and if all of these

08:37.480 --> 08:42.420
values are good then we should be good to go.

08:42.450 --> 08:48.260
It needs the age.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.400
So let's try this out.

08:53.960 --> 09:02.670
Go back refreshed the page submit needs a first name submit needs a last name submit needs an age.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.760
And then lastly we're able to submit the form.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.290
So go ahead try it for yourself.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.350
And in the next lesson we're going to show even more you can do what the dorm.
