00:01.190 --> 00:04.830
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be doing a challenge.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.050
So this challenge is going to be using the prompt again that's going to be using a raise.

00:10.100 --> 00:17.340
So we're going to start out with a basic array and we're going to ask the user to see if they want to

00:17.340 --> 00:20.380
remove a particular value from the array.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.140
So this time would set up rate and we're going to do the same rate.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.180
Really simple.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.700
We're going to just use a bunch of numbers.

00:28.050 --> 00:34.840
So that way we can create a whole bunch of values in there and to do this really easily.

00:34.930 --> 00:37.500
So actually I shouldn't repeat those values.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.720
So that's pretty good.

00:41.760 --> 00:52.840
And just to make it more interesting we'll sort that every and then console log out every day.

00:52.940 --> 00:54.080
What we have now.

00:54.140 --> 00:56.090
So we now we have a nicely sorted array.

00:56.150 --> 01:01.850
And I know I just have to throw in that sort it's actually not necessary within this exercise but I

01:01.850 --> 01:05.690
just didn't get a chance earlier to show you how it sorts numbers.

01:05.780 --> 01:08.720
So we're able to sort it in a number of ways.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.560
And also let's start in a few strings as well.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.930
So you can get a better idea of how things work for arrays.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.460
So we see that it sorts numbers first.

01:20.460 --> 01:27.450
So incrementing from 1 all the way to 77 then starts with the characters.

01:27.470 --> 01:29.940
So C is before D and so on.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.370
So that's what it does the sort.

01:31.770 --> 01:37.700
So going back to the task at hand and this is where we want to have another prompt.

01:37.730 --> 01:45.770
So I'm going to start with Q and we're going to do a prompt and the question this time what do you want

01:46.010 --> 01:49.850
to remove.

01:51.980 --> 01:55.510
And so we're asking the user what they want to remove.

01:55.760 --> 02:02.760
And next we need to find out the value of the index.

02:02.790 --> 02:08.000
So let's call it finder.

02:09.030 --> 02:16.650
And this one we're going to take array and we're going to get the value index of

02:20.320 --> 02:25.420
and this is where we're sending that response back from the prompt.

02:25.510 --> 02:33.300
So we're going to take a look and we're going to see if index is exists and if it actually exists then

02:33.310 --> 02:39.010
we know that we can splice and we can remove out that item out of the array.

02:39.310 --> 02:44.320
If it doesn't exist then we're not able to remove that.

02:44.780 --> 02:48.450
So we've got that value of Finder there.

02:49.190 --> 02:59.030
And as Next let's do another one we'll call it Orient remover zealous Finder.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.870
This one's the actual remover.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.160
So we get that array.

03:02.190 --> 03:10.020
We're specifying that we're splicing that particular value and we're splicing finder

03:13.520 --> 03:17.460
and were returning were only slight splicing one.

03:17.750 --> 03:22.480
So whatever the value of the finder is the Index we're going to splice that.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.680
And we're going to remove it.

03:24.920 --> 03:29.390
And then lastly let's cancel log out our history

03:33.800 --> 03:35.420
and let's refresh it.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.650
So what do you want to remove from that array.

03:37.700 --> 03:44.270
Let's remove that cat and we see that now when we remove that then we've got that item it's removed

03:44.270 --> 03:45.590
out of the array.

03:45.650 --> 03:48.130
So you've got the array being listed out again.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.810
So again this time let's try something that's not in that array.

03:51.980 --> 04:02.480
And this is going to remove that dog because what's happening here is that when you show you the value

04:02.480 --> 04:05.080
of Finder it is negative 1.

04:05.240 --> 04:12.560
So where we don't have a value of Finder and what it's doing here is it's just returning a value of

04:12.830 --> 04:19.100
negative 1 so it's going starting here and it's doing a negative one and that's why it's taking dog

04:19.190 --> 04:22.470
out of the equation because it doesn't have the last item.

04:22.470 --> 04:28.270
And we see here that the last item is also indicative of what we're specifying here.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.320
So we need to add in something else as well.

04:31.430 --> 04:37.680
And this is going to get a lot easier once we introduce conditional statements which is coming up in

04:37.700 --> 04:39.020
upcoming lessons.

04:39.380 --> 04:45.190
But for now let's use what we've already learned and that's the terrine ary operator.

04:45.290 --> 04:54.860
So let's take a look and let's sign a new value so maybe I'll just call this one V and we're going to

04:54.860 --> 05:02.570
take a look and we're going to see if Finder is greater than negative 1 then we're going to use whatever

05:02.570 --> 05:09.520
the value of Finder is and if it's not so we'll just use the value finder here.

05:09.680 --> 05:20.140
And if it's not then we need to do something else here and in this case we were not able to actually

05:20.380 --> 05:22.230
splice anything out.

05:22.630 --> 05:29.890
So maybe lets do something like 11 or something like that and see if that works or we have to do the

05:29.890 --> 05:30.970
length of the array.

05:31.060 --> 05:36.950
So let's try that one sorry length.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.870
So let's go back and refresh it.

05:40.300 --> 05:45.720
So now entering something that doesn't exist in there and still taken out that last item.

05:45.730 --> 05:53.100
So this is going to be a difficult part because where automatically always removing that last one.

05:53.380 --> 05:57.940
So this isn't this isn't working.

05:57.960 --> 06:03.320
And I know we're limited to this territory OPERATOR So there is actually a solution.

06:03.330 --> 06:09.720
So instead of creating and setting that value finder and then doing it within remover Lets just get

06:09.720 --> 06:13.080
that value because Russia returning a value from that method.

06:13.350 --> 06:19.720
So we're able to do that and we're actually able to put something from the.

06:19.740 --> 06:26.580
So now we can also over here we can set this to be

06:29.250 --> 06:33.120
let's say this to be false.

06:33.460 --> 06:43.920
And now whenever we we run this looks console log the value of v and refresh the page.

06:43.920 --> 06:49.220
So now it's entering something that doesn't exist in the array and we get returned back false.

06:49.300 --> 06:55.960
And now let's enter something that does exist in the array and we see we get that item return and it

06:55.960 --> 06:57.490
actually removes it from the array.

06:57.670 --> 07:01.400
So that's the solution and I know this was a little bit of a workaround.

07:01.480 --> 07:11.110
So this one did get a little bit more complex but we do see how we can use multiple statements and start

07:11.110 --> 07:16.630
combining them in order to apply even more logic into our application process.

07:18.060 --> 07:24.470
So the next lesson we're going to look at multi-dimensional arrays and then that sounds really cool.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.710
And I guarantee you it is.

07:26.730 --> 07:28.550
So that's coming up in the next lesson.

07:28.550 --> 07:33.820
It's going to actually extend what we can do with arrays and coming up in the next lesson.
