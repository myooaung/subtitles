00:00.760 --> 00:06.850
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to show you how to edit and also add items into the list.

00:06.850 --> 00:11.770
So I hope you had the opportunity to take a look at the source code and now let me show you how you

00:11.770 --> 00:14.740
can add items into a list.

00:14.740 --> 00:24.530
So first of all let's create an event listener so to document and this time we're going to do get element

00:24.530 --> 00:25.750
by ID.

00:26.060 --> 00:36.080
And we need to grab that add new and for this we're adding an event listener and event listener that

00:36.120 --> 00:44.460
we're adding is click and whenever it gets clicked we want to fire off the function where we're going

00:44.460 --> 00:45.730
to add an item.

00:45.930 --> 00:51.170
So let's Or maybe let's just do this as a separate function.

00:51.330 --> 00:55.040
So I'd add.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.920
And so that's a function.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.660
And we're going to also select false there.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.570
So this was from the previous lesson we were looking at the bubbling

01:10.050 --> 01:13.820
and let me let me clean up the code a bit.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.500
So there you go.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.700
So that's a little bit more readable.

01:17.020 --> 01:19.110
So now we're firing off.

01:19.150 --> 01:23.680
So whenever anything gets entered in here we want to be able to pick that up.

01:23.680 --> 01:30.380
So we've got a brand new function that we need to set up in order to handle this event.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.280
So this is where we're actually going to add an item.

01:33.280 --> 01:40.960
So we know that for arrays if we want to add something in then we push it and we need to just have a

01:40.960 --> 01:42.550
value there to push in.

01:42.820 --> 01:49.660
And also the next thing that we need to do is we need to know that we need to rebuild our HVM L after

01:49.660 --> 01:51.410
we've pushed the value.

01:51.730 --> 02:02.170
So now we need to grab a value so we can just do it as a variable A and grab document and get element

02:02.170 --> 02:08.650
by id and we need to grab that element of the input so that one was add friend

02:13.980 --> 02:17.240
and friend and we'll grab the value out of that.

02:17.450 --> 02:19.050
So contained within a.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.220
And we're simply going to push it into a.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.170
So go ahead try it out.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.890
And now hopefully if we hit test then we add in that functionality.

02:28.890 --> 02:33.430
We can also delete out items and add in items.

02:33.430 --> 02:34.640
So everything is working.

02:34.660 --> 02:40.150
And because we're just simply rebuilding it we don't have to worry about adding elements and so on.

02:40.210 --> 02:48.490
We're just simply rebuilding out what we had created earlier with the build function.

02:48.490 --> 02:58.480
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to grab that elements so we grabbed earlier data action.

02:58.510 --> 03:03.230
Delete now this time let's grab the data action at it.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.530
So this is going to be very similar.

03:05.530 --> 03:11.580
So what I can do is I can just simply copy this out and make a few updates.

03:13.080 --> 03:20.700
So instead of data action delete let's grab data action at it and we're going to loop through.

03:20.730 --> 03:26.700
So instead of data action delete will set up a brand new variable for that.

03:26.700 --> 03:30.340
So we've got the length we need to add an event listener.

03:30.450 --> 03:34.460
So we're going to listen for it when it gets clicked.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.570
We also are going to prevent the default.

03:36.570 --> 03:39.510
We need to get that index value as well.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.540
So grabbing that value.

03:41.730 --> 03:45.420
So that is relatively the same functionality.

03:45.570 --> 03:46.790
And then within here.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.350
So this is actually where it's going to all differ.

03:49.860 --> 03:54.620
So let's update update what's different here.

03:54.790 --> 03:57.370
And I'm also going to do one more update.

03:57.390 --> 04:04.090
So instead of variable I we're just going to do this we're going to grab the data roll because we want

04:04.090 --> 04:09.990
to make use of it within a few other items as well and then we're going to do that for the ID.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.380
So what I want you to do now pause the video and what I want to happen when we hit it I want this whole

04:17.410 --> 04:19.400
roll to go yellow.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.180
So pause the video and add that in.

04:22.210 --> 04:27.070
So looking back at what we did earlier we're changing the background color of an element.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.590
This is what I want you to apply.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.340
So the style background color change it to yellow.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.610
So pause the video and add that line of code in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

04:37.610 --> 04:46.280
So we do have that object under roll and let's add in style and background color is the one that we

04:46.280 --> 04:47.400
want it to update.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.580
And let's set it to yellow.

04:51.580 --> 04:56.170
So basically once it gets clicked then we're going to set it to yellow.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.480
And I'm actually also going to get rid of those built here because we don't need that one.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.630
And I'm going back in.

05:04.630 --> 05:10.480
So our ID and this one is going to be roll with the get attribute rule.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.070
So this is actually where ID is going to set.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.330
So let's go back and let's try the soat.

05:18.340 --> 05:21.170
So now when we hit it everything goes yellow.

05:21.280 --> 05:26.170
We are throwing an error there so let's go take a look and we'll see what the error is.

05:26.170 --> 05:27.860
So our is not defined.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.800
So we're trying to probably use our down here within the console and we haven't defined it so that's

05:32.800 --> 05:34.960
fine so we just simply remove that.

05:34.990 --> 05:38.110
Now when we hit EDOT at it it's going yellow.

05:38.260 --> 05:44.590
So the idea is once we finish the edit I want to change this back to white.

05:44.650 --> 05:47.560
So we need to include that as well.

05:47.590 --> 05:51.480
So there's a number of things that we need to do here.

05:51.490 --> 06:02.540
So what I want to do is I actually want to transform that text we need to have an input area here.

06:02.630 --> 06:08.270
So when we click to edit we want to change this to an input area so we can actually update and input

06:08.540 --> 06:11.830
that value so we can make some changes to it.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.340
So for this we actually need to create a separate input.

06:18.340 --> 06:25.300
So let's do that where we're going to create document and we're going to create an element so creates

06:26.380 --> 06:31.520
element and the element that we're going to be creating is going to be an input.

06:35.270 --> 06:45.000
And now we need to set some parameters so input type and let's have a text input and input value.

06:45.110 --> 06:54.200
So we need to set a value for the input input value is going to be whatever the contents of this particular

06:54.230 --> 06:55.190
element are.

06:55.190 --> 06:59.800
So we need to actually move down to that element and pick up that information.

07:01.540 --> 07:11.490
And so basically we know that we've got the role and we've got first element child.

07:11.690 --> 07:16.000
So if we do first element child then that's going to pick up.

07:16.130 --> 07:22.370
So we've got our role and our first element child is that the cell there that TV cell and so we can

07:22.370 --> 07:26.380
grab that and let's grab the inner text of it.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.170
So there we go.

07:30.170 --> 07:35.940
So we've created that input and let's just make sure that our input is actually holding right right

07:35.940 --> 07:36.590
value.

07:36.810 --> 07:43.120
So let's go back out and refresh and hit edit and we can see we've got our input here.

07:43.140 --> 07:49.060
We've got text and we need to loop be able to loop through there in order to get the value.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.130
So let's try that again.

07:52.660 --> 07:58.580
So input and let's go all the way down to value just to see if we're actually dropping that value in.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.770
So we do have a value of Larry within this input.

08:02.870 --> 08:07.380
So let's go back a little bit and create a variable called Tiddy.

08:07.400 --> 08:14.630
So this is going to be my first cell and I know if I go down row and I go to my first element then this

08:14.630 --> 08:21.380
way I can grab all of that information because I need it to be able to do this because I want to insert

08:21.680 --> 08:26.780
that input where that particular text is sitting right now.

08:27.470 --> 08:36.740
So let's clear out what's already existing now that we've passed that value let's do inner HVM L and

08:36.800 --> 08:38.360
we're going to clear that out.

08:39.110 --> 08:46.370
And next what I wanted to do is let's append this brand new input in its place so we know that we've

08:46.370 --> 08:47.360
already got

08:50.460 --> 08:59.020
the t d so we can go to D and append.

08:59.130 --> 09:04.750
So when I append child and the child that we want to insert is input.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.300
So let's see how this works.

09:06.330 --> 09:08.900
So go back and refresh the page.

09:08.950 --> 09:15.290
And now when we hit edit we see that we can actually access that and we can edit that information.

09:15.780 --> 09:23.700
So the next step that we need to take is that we need to add on blur action.

09:23.710 --> 09:30.820
So basically whenever we finish and we click off of it then we need to take some type of event and also

09:30.820 --> 09:36.970
the other thing too that I want to do is I want to do input focus because while we still have actual

09:37.240 --> 09:42.480
ability to grab this particular element we can attach the focus to it.

09:42.640 --> 09:49.120
So what focus does is when I click it we automatically jump into the input cell so we can actually get

09:49.120 --> 09:55.690
rid of this console here and the next one that we need to add is input and on alert.

09:55.690 --> 09:56.780
So just do.

09:57.100 --> 10:02.950
We're not going out at an event handler we're just added in as an attribute event here.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.420
So and we've got a number of actions that we want to do.

10:06.580 --> 10:13.680
So basically whenever the user finishes editing we want to update the index value.

10:13.690 --> 10:25.690
So for my array and let's update that array item with the brand new input value so whatever the input

10:25.690 --> 10:35.210
value is at that time and we know what our array item is by our ID.

10:35.220 --> 10:36.710
So it's odd that in there.

10:37.020 --> 10:45.020
So let's go back and refresh it and hit edit and let's make some edits click off of that and let's list

10:45.300 --> 10:46.180
the my array

10:49.210 --> 10:52.670
and we'll see that we actually were able to make that at it.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.000
So that worked out properly.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.520
So then next in that we also need to do is we want to change the background color style back to white.

11:02.770 --> 11:07.750
So this again we have all of that information that we need currently.

11:07.870 --> 11:17.070
So we can simply grab the one that we did to yellow and we can update it and change it back to white.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.490
And also we need to remove out that input.

11:20.610 --> 11:25.580
So just as we appended the input let's remove that one out.

11:27.080 --> 11:33.430
So this one is remove child.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.900
So just as we did append child input we can do remove child input.

11:39.060 --> 11:45.870
And then lastly there's one other thing that we need to do and we need to set the TV in or h t M-L to

11:45.930 --> 11:50.180
the value of the input value.

11:50.290 --> 11:53.200
So let's save this and let's try it out.

11:53.200 --> 11:58.160
So basically edit and let's add in test and when we click off of it.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.600
So now we've got the right value in there.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.840
Again when we go in to it and we click off of it.

12:03.850 --> 12:11.810
So now the RE as well as the cell has the new updated values attached to it.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.130
And we can do this for any one of our cells.

12:15.150 --> 12:21.110
Now so a few things that I still want to do and this is more CSSA.

12:21.340 --> 12:29.840
So let's do SS and first and we can also use the same CSSA in order to make our selection.

12:30.190 --> 12:32.970
So it's always good to be familiar with CSSA.

12:33.130 --> 12:36.790
So first child is I want to make it wider.

12:36.910 --> 12:42.970
So basically when I refresh it that's going to give me this one and it's going to make them wider so

12:42.970 --> 12:49.270
that I have better access and that doesn't look so weird when I edit and I click off of it and so on

12:49.510 --> 12:53.010
that the cell change cell sizes change.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.150
So there we go.

12:54.150 --> 12:57.240
So we can update some of the CSA as well.

12:58.850 --> 13:06.260
So now we've made an updateable dynamic table we can add new entries and whenever we add them in that

13:06.260 --> 13:13.750
we can edit them we can click on them edit anyone we can delete ones that we don't want and so on.

13:13.760 --> 13:19.570
So a fully flexible dynamic editable table using just javascript

13:22.200 --> 13:27.750
and this type of thing really shows the power that's available within the dom because you have just

13:27.840 --> 13:34.800
so many options and so much flexibility that really it's pretty much limitless that you can take advantage

13:34.800 --> 13:41.190
of what's available within the DOM traverse through the DOM selecting elements updating elements creating

13:41.190 --> 13:49.140
new elements updating styles and just basically manipulating everything that's within the visible area

13:49.320 --> 13:51.930
for the user within your web page.

13:51.960 --> 13:59.080
So go ahead and try it out for yourself and see what else you can do with this type of script.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.210
And remember all of these contents are sitting within an array.

14:04.210 --> 14:11.050
So if you're looking to submit it to a database all you need to do is simply submit that array to the

14:11.050 --> 14:15.450
database because all of this is just done on the front end as well.

14:16.590 --> 14:21.190
So you could add that functionality in and you can go ahead and add that in.

14:21.270 --> 14:24.950
So the next thing that you need to do is simply update.

14:25.020 --> 14:31.770
So when you're updating the build create a hidden field within a form and then have a submit button.

14:31.770 --> 14:39.180
So basically whenever that value updates update the hidden field with the value that's contained within

14:39.180 --> 14:39.990
the array.

14:40.080 --> 14:45.910
And that's going to give you the ability to pass through the brain you array values to your server.

14:45.920 --> 14:53.010
And so go ahead and add that into the application and also make some updates as needed to really customize

14:53.220 --> 14:55.770
and get a good feel for what's available within the.
