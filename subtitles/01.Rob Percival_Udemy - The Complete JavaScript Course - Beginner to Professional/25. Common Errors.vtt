In this lesson we're going to run through some common errors within Javascript.

00:04.880 --> 00:11.000
So showing you quite a lot of different javascript syntaxes and some of the common errors.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.160
So let's set a variable Let's go into our editor and set a variable.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.770
And I'm going to give this variable a string value of Hello.

00:21.950 --> 00:27.990
And then next I'm going to set up a condition and I'm going to check to see if it's equal to hello.

00:28.190 --> 00:36.110
And if it is then I get a console log that works.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.340
So take a look at this statement and do you spot the error.

00:40.350 --> 00:41.910
Do you see what's wrong.

00:41.970 --> 00:48.070
And do you see what the value of hello is actually being said as.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.530
So take a look at this error and tell me if you can spot the air.

00:51.630 --> 00:56.810
And if you can just make a mental note of that and let's try that out and see if it works.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.380
Or do you think that this will work.

00:58.390 --> 00:59.620
That there's no errors.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.830
And if you said it all work it will actually run and it will work.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.480
So let's see if we can check the value of hello hello world.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.740
Let's refresh it.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.580
And now let's see what the value of A is.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.150
And we see that it's actually.

01:15.180 --> 01:16.290
Hello world.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.730
So what do you think happened there.

01:18.090 --> 01:25.200
And if you said that we only set the one equal sign so we only assigned it and instead of actually doing

01:25.260 --> 01:31.910
our comparison our check here we're actually doing an assignment operator.

01:31.980 --> 01:39.460
So always make sure that if you are doing that condition that you are doing it with the two equal signs.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.800
So this is often a common mistake and this happens many many times within javascript where people will

01:46.800 --> 01:49.110
just leave out the equal signs.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.240
So let's do one more comparison here.

01:52.500 --> 02:02.940
And this is another important one to keep in mind that we know we saw earlier that variables have different

02:02.940 --> 02:12.660
types and if we were to compare B to C so do you think that we're actually going to log anything out

02:12.660 --> 02:16.420
in the console.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.300
So even though one is a string one is a number.

02:20.370 --> 02:25.720
When I refresh the page are we going to see equal or are we not going to see any message.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.770
So what do you think is going to happen here.

02:27.840 --> 02:35.760
So let's refresh the page and we do see that it is equal because we're doing the comparison here and

02:35.820 --> 02:38.810
we're checking to see if they're equivalent.

02:39.030 --> 02:43.370
So we're not actually checking the type in in order to check the type.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.930
That's where we need to do the absolute value.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.180
So do the three equal signs for that.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.160
And more often than not a lot of people leave this.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.490
And it can lead to errors within your javascript.

02:55.650 --> 03:04.180
So always be mindful of the fact that if you are doing these types of conditions use the three.

03:04.190 --> 03:10.860
And also compare the type just to make sure that they are truly equal and that there are no differences

03:10.860 --> 03:12.030
between the variables.

03:12.030 --> 03:19.740
If you're looking to do this type of comparison so go ahead and open up your editor and just practice

03:19.920 --> 03:25.860
adding in the two equal signs and then the three equal signs in various conditional statements and set

03:25.860 --> 03:29.340
a bunch of different variables here that you have to work with and practice with.
