Welcome Dockett in this lesson we're going to build a shopping list and we're going to build out an

00:06.710 --> 00:14.930
array add items into the array and then once the shopping list is complete once the user doesn't want

00:14.930 --> 00:19.820
to add anything else to the shopping list then we're in the loop through all the items in the shopping

00:19.820 --> 00:23.960
list and put them for the user to be able to see.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.500
So let's let's begin and we're going to use prompt.

00:27.560 --> 00:35.190
So this prompt is going to be.

00:36.310 --> 00:38.950
And we're starting out with a prompt.

00:42.290 --> 00:46.580
What do you want to add.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.640
So put a question mark there.

00:52.070 --> 00:52.880
Anti-coal.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.820
So we're starting out with a prompt.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.450
We're asking the user what do they want to add to the list.

00:58.490 --> 01:05.070
So we also need to create a basic default shopping list.

01:06.290 --> 01:09.270
And this is going to be just plain Karaite for now.

01:09.290 --> 01:14.570
So there we've got our array where we can drop stuff in to our shopping list.

01:14.660 --> 01:22.440
So let's say we need to ask the user that question to What do they want to.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.690
And now let's add the item into the list.

01:27.800 --> 01:33.680
So whatever comes back from I don't know we need to push it into the shopping list.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.350
So let's take what we learned previously was a raise.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.980
So it's a shopping list at a rate where it should be actually push.

01:45.430 --> 01:54.750
So push is that where we're able to push content and we're just doing it on.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.530
So next we need to actually ask the user if they want to continue.

01:59.540 --> 02:08.410
So let's say we do have another prompt or we need to have something else hop in here that we need to

02:08.500 --> 02:12.810
give the user the ability to add multiple items into the shopping list.

02:13.620 --> 02:23.220
So probably the best way to go about this would be to actually create a loop and I initially asked the

02:23.220 --> 02:31.080
user how many items they want to add to the shopping list and that will tell us how many times we need

02:31.080 --> 02:33.430
to loop through this product.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.210
So we initiate it by how many times.

02:39.630 --> 02:44.050
And this one is going to be the prompt So this is going to be our starting prompt.

02:47.400 --> 02:54.860
And we're going to ask how many items would you like to add.

02:55.530 --> 03:01.800
So this way we're establishing what we need and how we can do what we need for a loop.

03:02.170 --> 03:06.380
So this loop variable x and started to notice.

03:06.660 --> 03:12.060
And we're going to loop while it's less than how many times.

03:12.350 --> 03:15.410
And we need a way to increment x.

03:16.120 --> 03:20.770
And this is where we're applying our logic where we're adding to the shopping list.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.530
So are you going to continuously ask and add items.

03:27.550 --> 03:30.740
Am I'm going to declare this variable here.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.850
And then just clean up.

03:38.370 --> 03:45.780
So now we're just going to keep adding items whenever times the user wanted to add.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.060
How many times how many items they want to add.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.280
And we will loop through all those items.

03:50.280 --> 03:55.790
We're adding them into the shopping list and then finally we need to put our shopping lists.

03:56.110 --> 04:07.650
There's a number of options for outputting and I going to use the simple four and my item.

04:08.070 --> 04:14.940
So we set up a value of my item to hold all of the array information and we're going to loop through

04:16.470 --> 04:31.270
of of shopping list and all we need to do now is put to the inner h to your mail and let's add to this

04:31.340 --> 04:35.770
sort of to add the items into our shopping list.

04:35.770 --> 04:45.010
So we're looping through them and let's do the my item and then concatenate it into a line break.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.550
So see what happens.

04:46.570 --> 04:47.420
So refresh it.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.850
How many homes would you like to add three.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.700
What would you like to add.

04:52.370 --> 04:58.330
Banana poll and let's get some milk.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.200
So listen to the list.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.180
And there we go.

05:01.180 --> 05:02.760
So we've got our output.

05:02.770 --> 05:11.710
So essentially this is our shopping list so we can also do something like this where we've got each

05:11.710 --> 05:12.100
one

05:14.800 --> 05:15.810
shopping list.

05:15.850 --> 05:20.450
So just to make it a little bit more neat when we're outputting and refresh.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.740
So how many items would you like to add to.

05:23.140 --> 05:30.790
I'd like to add milk and I'd also like to apples so your shopping list.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.450
Milk and apples.

05:33.510 --> 05:38.220
So what I want you to do is to open up your editor open up your script.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.680
And I want you to break out of this loop.

05:42.870 --> 05:51.250
Asking another prompt and checking to see if this is if the value of an item is no.

05:51.290 --> 05:57.050
I want to stop this loop so it doesn't matter how many times they initially say it we want a way to

05:57.050 --> 06:02.580
break out of this loop because maybe there was a mistake or maybe there's nothing else to add.

06:02.600 --> 06:10.100
So check to see if item is equal to no and then stop the loop.

06:10.280 --> 06:14.250
And then we can continue and put a shopping list at that point.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.040
So pause the video.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.310
Open up your script.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.180
I.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.570
And I'm going to show you the solution coming up.

06:24.880 --> 06:32.950
So we can do a solution with one line of code and we're just going to check to see if item is equal

06:32.950 --> 06:33.440
to.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.230
No.

06:36.340 --> 06:45.080
And if it is then what we're going to do is we're actually going to break out of this so let's

06:47.790 --> 06:54.850
let's try this out or see how this works so save it refresh.

06:54.930 --> 06:57.910
And I want to add 66 items.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.030
So here we go.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.230
I'm going to add some items.

07:03.550 --> 07:04.510
And

07:07.530 --> 07:07.810
OK.

07:07.840 --> 07:08.540
So that's it.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.230
I don't want to add anything else.

07:10.240 --> 07:10.900
I just put.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.510
No.

07:11.650 --> 07:17.660
And we are able to break out of our our shopping list process and we still got our on this.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.320
They're being displayed.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.890
So what the solution.
