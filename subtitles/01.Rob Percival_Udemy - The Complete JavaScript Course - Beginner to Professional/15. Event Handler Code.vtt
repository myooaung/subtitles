WEBVTT

00:01.340 --> 00:02.360
We'll come back.

00:02.390 --> 00:09.520
And previously we were looking at on click and we're using them as attributes within each team.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.060
So there's actually a way to do the same thing.

00:12.080 --> 00:20.480
And as we saw we can traverse through and we can pick up different elements information throughout the

00:20.520 --> 00:25.870
dorm and we also saw earlier that we could use different builtin methods that are already in the DOM

00:25.880 --> 00:32.990
so such as alert and prompt and so on so we can actually do the same thing where we can grab this functionality

00:33.260 --> 00:36.390
and set it up only using javascript.

00:36.470 --> 00:43.310
So we don't have to actually have any of these javascript objects or Javascript functions sitting within

00:43.370 --> 00:46.810
our h t M-L we can completely separate.

00:46.820 --> 00:54.230
So let's give it some ideas because again we're going to need a way to identify so give it the 1 2 and

00:54.230 --> 01:00.710
3 and this is going to be this is going to be treated the exact same way.

01:00.710 --> 01:08.690
So whether we've got it as an on click within the aged hymnal within the attributes or whether we have

01:08.690 --> 01:14.570
it here we're reregistering it as an on click for that particular element.

01:14.570 --> 01:15.640
It's the same thing.

01:15.650 --> 01:25.730
So here we can do document and we need to use or get element by id and we're grabbing those ideas.

01:26.170 --> 01:30.070
And then within here we're adding on click.

01:30.070 --> 01:35.950
So just as we saw earlier where we could get the value and so on were actually grabbing the on click

01:36.070 --> 01:42.040
and basically it returns the event handler of that particular element that we've selected.

01:42.130 --> 01:45.610
And we saw that all of those elements had event handlers.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.540
So it doesn't return it back has a street value.

01:48.610 --> 01:50.100
We need to have a function here.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.550
On the other end of it.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.500
In order for it to be able to do something.

01:54.580 --> 02:00.070
So we've got our function that gets triggered whenever this one gets clicked.

02:00.070 --> 02:04.830
And for now let's just change the value of output.

02:05.080 --> 02:13.980
So do H.E. and Mehl and to work at.

02:13.990 --> 02:17.680
So let's see what happens when we refresh it.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.360
And now when I click it we see that we're updating that enraged him.

02:22.360 --> 02:28.330
So basically this function is firing off and giving us the ability to update the Tim L.

02:28.450 --> 02:33.790
And of course we haven't added any event handlers yet to any one of these other buttons but we can do

02:33.790 --> 02:40.960
the same thing and depending on what you want to do it may or may not be easier just to simply add in

02:41.200 --> 02:48.460
the on click within the element attribute or if you want to keep the separation from your element attributes

02:48.460 --> 02:54.520
from h him out to your javascript and maybe have a J.S. file that you're linking to then maybe this

02:54.520 --> 02:58.910
is the way to go by adding it in to your javascript.

02:58.990 --> 03:00.640
So there are two options.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.540
They're both registered within the same way.

03:03.610 --> 03:06.110
So they're both working through the dawn.

03:06.160 --> 03:12.670
This one is being set up within the dorm when the page initiates.

03:12.700 --> 03:19.960
And this one we're adding it in just as we did anything else when we were updating content and information

03:19.960 --> 03:23.910
within the dorm itself after it's been loaded.

03:23.920 --> 03:32.440
So what happens if you want to just simply pass it over to a function so we can copy over this within

03:32.440 --> 03:36.120
the function and let's add in the function.

03:36.550 --> 03:43.000
So with the function we know that's when we type out the function itself.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.530
So let's open up the console again and I'm going to go back in here.

03:47.650 --> 03:56.080
And we know that when we do my fun with out the rounded brackets it's different than my fun with the

03:56.080 --> 03:57.190
rounded brackets.

03:57.190 --> 04:03.760
And then when we do it with the rounded brackets basically we've got function my fun and then we've

04:03.760 --> 04:06.390
got the code that's in there.

04:07.270 --> 04:13.030
And the difference is that we have the rounded brackets that means that that function executes right

04:13.030 --> 04:19.850
away where as when we just use the value of the function.

04:19.940 --> 04:26.480
That basically means that whenever this gets executed then we're going to trigger the contents of my

04:26.480 --> 04:27.160
function.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.650
So you're probably wondering well what happened to this.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.710
What am I going to do.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.340
Where is this now.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.810
Because I don't have a way to pass that in here.

04:37.980 --> 04:48.130
Well not to worry because this is actually also being passed so if console log out and if I place this

04:48.280 --> 04:55.920
within here we're going to see that when I refresh the page and if I open up my console and I click

04:55.920 --> 05:00.270
it we're actually passing in that same element information.

05:00.510 --> 05:02.880
So if I do console directory

05:06.050 --> 05:09.710
and refresh the page click it and open it up.

05:09.800 --> 05:15.700
We see that we've got that same information and when we go down we see we've got all of that same that

05:15.740 --> 05:17.230
click event is still there.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.490
So it's registered within the same way.

05:19.490 --> 05:26.210
So both of those ways work and we can pass the same information using either one of them.

05:26.240 --> 05:33.050
It just depends on what works better for you in the situation when you're coding it and how you plan

05:33.290 --> 05:38.130
to access and add in that event handler.

05:38.130 --> 05:44.960
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and update the value of click.

05:45.950 --> 05:50.100
And update it to be clicked once the button gets clicked.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.890
So positive and I'll show you the solution coming up.

05:53.990 --> 06:00.700
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and we know that last time the solution was really easy

06:00.980 --> 06:05.040
and this time again the solution is going to be really easy.

06:05.060 --> 06:11.730
So all we have to do is use this again because we've already accessed that as an object.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.150
We've already passed it.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.580
When we selected that particular element.

06:15.800 --> 06:24.770
And now we just need to use this because this is that current active object that triggered this event

06:25.100 --> 06:26.190
the event handler.

06:26.330 --> 06:33.140
So we know where it is and now when we go back to the page and we click the button we see that we can

06:33.260 --> 06:36.480
update the value within the button as well to.

06:38.210 --> 06:44.060
So what I want you to do now is open up your editor and take the code from one of the earlier exercises

06:44.060 --> 06:49.310
where we're using on click and bring it in to a function and add it in.

06:49.340 --> 06:54.400
Only using javascript so get it out of that each Tamal and out added into the javascript.

06:54.410 --> 07:02.210
Try it for yourself and see if you can get that code only within javascript so nothing within the attributes

07:02.270 --> 07:03.000
of your age.

07:03.010 --> 07:03.490
Tim.

07:04.190 --> 07:10.960
And we've got plenty of earlier exercises where we're using the on click event within an attribute in

07:10.960 --> 07:11.600
the age Timo.
