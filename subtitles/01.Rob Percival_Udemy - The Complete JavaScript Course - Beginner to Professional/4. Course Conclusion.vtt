Hey you made it.

00:01.930 --> 00:06.130
And great job on completing the complete javascript course.

00:06.160 --> 00:11.680
I know we had a lot of exercises and a lot of lessons in this course and there was a lot of material

00:11.680 --> 00:12.520
to go through.

00:12.670 --> 00:17.890
But at this point you should be really familiar with javascript and you should have a really good idea

00:17.890 --> 00:22.180
of what Javascript can do and how to work with Javascript.

00:22.180 --> 00:27.760
And this is also an opportunity to reflect on some of the earlier lessons and take that source code

00:27.760 --> 00:35.950
from some of the earlier projects extend build upon them really add in and practice javascript because

00:35.950 --> 00:42.130
now that you've gone through all the lessons you can apply some more advanced javascript to those earlier

00:42.130 --> 00:44.910
lessons really extend those projects.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.760
Don't forget the Q and A section for the course.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.440
So this is a great opportunity if you have any additional questions.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.390
Connect with others within the Course as well.

00:55.390 --> 00:56.580
Post your comments.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.890
If you're looking for additional instruction or information on a particular topic that maybe we haven't

01:02.890 --> 01:06.070
covered where you want clarity on a particular topic.

01:06.070 --> 01:13.810
This is also your place to post a comment post a suggestion give me an opportunity to provide some additional

01:13.810 --> 01:17.560
content within this course to match your learning needs.

01:17.650 --> 01:24.220
I'm also going to be extending and adding in new content within this course as time progresses.

01:24.340 --> 01:29.770
So this course is expected to continue to grow and that expand and extend.

01:29.770 --> 01:36.730
I've got plans to be adding in new sections as well as adding in new projects and exercises.

01:36.730 --> 01:42.310
Check back often within the course and you're going to find that there is new content coming in all

01:42.310 --> 01:48.790
the time and of course with javascript it's all about practicing and really getting familiar and comfortable

01:48.820 --> 01:49.910
with the code.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.580
So once again congratulations on a job well done.

01:53.770 --> 02:00.990
There's also a number of resources that you can take a look through to continue with learning with Javascript.

02:01.060 --> 02:03.310
And don't forget I'm always here to help.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.900
So if you ever have any questions or comments please make sure that you post them within the course

02:07.990 --> 02:08.860
section.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.620
Thanks again for taking the course.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.460
We really appreciate your support.
