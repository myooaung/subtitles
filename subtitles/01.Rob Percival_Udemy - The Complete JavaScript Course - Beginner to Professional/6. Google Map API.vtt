00:01.240 --> 00:08.020
The prettiest lesson we showed you how you can get your latitude and longitude using that geo location

00:08.020 --> 00:12.040
from navigator within your web browser.

00:12.070 --> 00:16.310
So the next thing that we wanted to do is we want to map today so we need a map.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.380
And the good thing is that maps are already built.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.470
There's really great javascript libraries for maps.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.270
And one of them is available from Google.

00:25.330 --> 00:32.950
They have Google Maps API and basically build out the map and all you have to do is passen your latitude

00:32.950 --> 00:33.830
and longitude.

00:33.940 --> 00:39.100
And now that we saw how we can get that the next step is to show you how to use a library so that's

00:39.100 --> 00:40.700
going to be one of the first libraries.

00:40.880 --> 00:47.440
And there's a ton of great libraries javascript libraries out there online and basically a library is

00:47.440 --> 00:55.060
a javascript file that's got a bunch of javascript code in it already to go and it creates some amazing

00:55.060 --> 01:01.060
functionality that you don't have to worry about coding so it's as simple as whenever we build up our

01:01.060 --> 01:02.980
own G-S files and we link to them.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.240
We're going to be doing the same thing but we're going to be linking to a javascript library.

01:07.420 --> 01:14.830
And for the Google Maps API you do need to get an API key and the key is they're free to use all you

01:14.830 --> 01:16.630
need is a Google account.

01:16.630 --> 01:22.000
So if you have a Google account that you can go over to developers dot Google dot com forward slash

01:22.000 --> 01:29.890
maps for Slash document for it slash javascript for its slash get API key and click the blue get a key

01:30.640 --> 01:38.110
and then within here you can just create a new project and simply enable an API key and it will just

01:38.110 --> 01:43.810
take a few seconds and it'll spit out an API key that you can use for Google Maps.

01:43.810 --> 01:48.510
So this is the key that I'm going to be able to use within my Google Maps.

01:48.640 --> 01:56.920
So once you've got that copy that and I'm actually going to remove this one so by time you're watching

01:56.920 --> 01:59.830
this less than this one is not going to be active anymore.

02:00.010 --> 02:06.680
So you do have to get your own Google Maps API key for javascript or if you can find one on line.

02:06.790 --> 02:09.140
Sure there's some out there online as well.

02:09.220 --> 02:14.170
So grab your API key copy it and let's go back into our script.

02:14.200 --> 02:20.240
And usually what I like to do for key is is I like to just kind of comment them in here so that I'm

02:20.260 --> 02:23.710
ready to go to continue working with my application.

02:23.950 --> 02:30.610
So the next thing that we want to do is we want to bring a library in and just as before we saw we can

02:30.610 --> 02:34.260
bring in a library and we can just specify the source.

02:34.390 --> 02:41.770
So going way way back in the early part of this course we specify a source and we need a path to that

02:41.770 --> 02:42.470
source.

02:42.610 --> 02:45.890
So the path is going to be it's going to be quite long.

02:46.080 --> 02:46.620
So

02:49.740 --> 02:52.490
I'll just I just get actually pasted in here.

02:52.710 --> 02:57.360
And the only thing that you need to change is you're going to have to actually change your key.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.700
So paste it in with the key.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.620
So this is going to be the source.

03:02.160 --> 03:07.050
And then here is where we take our key and paste it in.

03:07.050 --> 03:12.990
So basically this is going to bring in this javascript library and this is going to allow us to use

03:12.990 --> 03:16.600
the javascript library within our application.

03:16.800 --> 03:22.290
And what the javascript library does is it allows us to build a map.

03:22.290 --> 03:28.440
So the other thing that we do need to do is we need to set a placeholder so you can call this whatever

03:28.440 --> 03:29.720
you want.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.060
You can just call it map if you want going to give an idea of map.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.350
So it's a blank element on your H-2 mail.

03:35.370 --> 03:41.550
And this is where Google from their javascript library is going to know how to build them up.

03:41.550 --> 03:44.010
So it's got all of the components to build up the map.

03:44.010 --> 03:46.830
All you need to do is pass in the latitude and longitude.

03:46.950 --> 03:52.100
And we saw how we can pick that up within the previous the previous lesson.

03:52.560 --> 03:59.730
So the maps do require some parameters that you can pass in and latitude longitude and there's also

03:59.730 --> 04:03.660
the zoom level and there's also a bunch of other parameters as well.

04:03.690 --> 04:05.980
So these these are just options.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.640
So you can call that whatever you want.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.640
It's just a regular javascript object anes.

04:11.850 --> 04:16.480
So this basically tells what we want to center the map on.

04:16.500 --> 04:22.910
And we want to center it on data and the coordinates

04:25.820 --> 04:33.050
so it has data coordinates and latitude and hopefully from the previous lesson you were able to pull

04:33.050 --> 04:35.890
back your latitude and longitude and next.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.590
Let's set up longitude.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.690
So this is going to be data coordinates and longitude.

04:40.700 --> 04:47.510
So this actually this information is coming from the data that's being returned from the javascript

04:47.510 --> 04:49.040
get current position.

04:49.040 --> 04:55.250
So all we're doing is we're passing that information that we're picking up into place map or place map

04:55.250 --> 05:00.980
function retrieves that data and then we're making use of it within our javascript and we're actually

05:00.980 --> 05:05.900
then passing that information along over into Google.

05:05.990 --> 05:10.720
And as you probably realize you can customize the latitude and longitude.

05:10.850 --> 05:14.120
So you don't need actually to pick up your latitude and longitude.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.070
This is just for this exercise.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.610
You can zoom them up here and you can set it to whatever position you want.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.020
So I'm going to zoom in zoom level of five.

05:24.110 --> 05:29.240
And then lastly what we need to do is we need to put that value on a map.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.560
So let's create a variable.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.180
Call it map or whatever you want to call it.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.100
And so this is brand new Google functionality that's available.

05:37.190 --> 05:39.830
So Google Maps map.

05:39.950 --> 05:43.490
And then within here this is where we're grabbing our parameters.

05:43.520 --> 05:49.040
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to set where we're sending this map information over

05:49.040 --> 05:49.560
to.

05:49.670 --> 05:54.690
And we know we're sending it over to the div with the ID map.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.270
So let's let's set that up as well.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.190
So we'll just call it.

05:58.230 --> 06:06.500
And and we're going to do our regular document's get element by id and let's grab that element with

06:06.950 --> 06:12.930
the ID of map and then over here is where we're going to pass that values going to.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.870
First it needs two parameters.

06:15.020 --> 06:21.290
So the first thing that we need to do is pass over the object that we want to place the content in.

06:21.410 --> 06:27.550
And then next we can pass in some options here.

06:27.730 --> 06:34.690
And one other thing before we actually try and launch this we actually need to set a height for the

06:34.690 --> 06:40.680
map because by default we don't have any contents in there and we do need to set a height.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.110
So let's just set it at 100 percent.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.090
And now let's reload the page so now we should be able to see our map.

06:49.190 --> 06:50.620
So go ahead and allow that.

06:50.780 --> 06:51.350
And there we go.

06:51.350 --> 06:55.180
So now we've got our map and it's zeroing in on our coordinates.

06:55.190 --> 07:00.660
And I'll let you know I am in the Toronto area so it is picking up the coordinates from my browser.

07:00.740 --> 07:07.250
It's passing those along into the Google maps and show me the map of where I'm located.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.080
And there is quite a lot more you can do with the Google Maps.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.420
This is just a quick sampling of what's available.

07:14.420 --> 07:21.350
So what I want to do now is try it for yourself and get comfortable with bringing in javascript libraries

07:21.680 --> 07:29.600
and then also get comfortable with what is available and what values you can use within your javascript

07:29.750 --> 07:36.620
within your browser API that you can then use within these javascript libraries so you can output that

07:36.620 --> 07:37.460
content.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.890
So try this out for yourself.

07:39.890 --> 07:46.190
And also you're welcome to go through the Google maps and see all the different really cool things you

07:46.190 --> 07:47.990
can do with the Google maps.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.960
There are quite a lot of other things that you can do as well.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.630
And there's a lot of great information here so do take some time and do check it out and do get familiar

07:56.630 --> 07:59.510
with bringing in libraries into your javascript.
