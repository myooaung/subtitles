WEBVTT

00:00.850 --> 00:06.900
Come back here and in this lesson or you will be continuing to build out our party applications so party

00:06.900 --> 00:08.410
invite application.

00:08.430 --> 00:11.900
So let's set up some of our h t m l.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.450
So no we've got our party checklist over here.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.130
We already have an area for the output.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.170
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to bring this one downing underuse output because I do

00:22.170 --> 00:28.770
want to have somewhere to put all of my party information and I want to keep that party invite checklist

00:28.770 --> 00:33.300
there at the top so the next thing that we need is we actually need a way to.

00:33.330 --> 00:38.010
We need some inputs so a way to add people into our guest list.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.270
So type text and we're going to give it an idea.

00:42.270 --> 00:47.160
So this is going to be our new guest name.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.670
So this will give it a label here.

00:49.680 --> 00:59.020
Guest name and then we also want to have plus we'll just have a plus sign there.

01:02.330 --> 01:09.490
And this will just be the input and this will indicate how many additional people that users that guess

01:09.490 --> 01:10.680
does actually bring.

01:10.700 --> 01:15.090
So we're keeping within that same format that we originally laid out our data.

01:15.230 --> 01:21.800
So this is going to be type and it's actually going to be number type because this is numeric and this

01:21.800 --> 01:22.820
is h tim L5.

01:22.820 --> 01:25.320
So it's not anything to do with javascript.

01:25.670 --> 01:30.070
It's just that we can retrieve back that information in.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.620
We're only going to be expecting to get a number of values there.

01:33.830 --> 01:39.920
And by default I want to set a default value so I set the value as equal to zero.

01:42.160 --> 01:50.950
And then lastly we need a way to add people so sorts to input time and this time let's do a button.

01:51.290 --> 01:56.090
So the button will give us something to click that we can actually add people to.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.520
So two value equals add

02:02.550 --> 02:08.700
and I'm actually not going to give it a name because we want to be a little bit more creative within

02:08.700 --> 02:15.000
this lesson on how we're making our selection and where you use Querrey selector in order to make our

02:15.000 --> 02:15.730
selection.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.110
But notice we didn't given an ID.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.540
So this is just to make it a little bit more challenging for you.

02:21.780 --> 02:26.560
So that's what they want you to do next is to hook up an event listener to the button.

02:26.570 --> 02:31.970
And without using get element by ID using query selector.

02:32.190 --> 02:43.080
So pause the video and create an input button with a value of ADD and create and grab that input as

02:44.630 --> 02:46.130
an event at an event listener.

02:46.130 --> 02:50.800
So whenever anyone clicks that button we want something we want a function to fire off.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.390
So go ahead.

02:51.400 --> 02:59.040
Pause the video and add data and I'll show you the solution coming up so we did want to have a way to

02:59.100 --> 03:03.160
select that particular element and I'm going to create.

03:03.330 --> 03:05.840
So this one will just be called Guest.

03:05.870 --> 03:10.610
So this is the object and we need to use document in order to grab it.

03:10.650 --> 03:18.690
And I did say that we're going to use Querrey selector and query selector allows us to select any one

03:18.690 --> 03:24.170
of those elements within our page and we do it within the same format as CSSA.

03:24.180 --> 03:31.500
So if and we know from SEE assess if we want to grab an input we can go input and we know we've got

03:31.500 --> 03:36.990
a number of inputs so if we left it at input we would be out of luck there because we'd only be grabbing

03:36.990 --> 03:39.020
the first input on query selector.

03:39.150 --> 03:44.710
So a quick query selector works as it just grabs that first instance of that query.

03:44.910 --> 03:52.620
And that's why we do type equals button just as if we did this and see SS We could identify this because

03:52.620 --> 03:54.370
we've only got one type of button.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.810
And even if we were to add additional ones down here as long as this one is first and the page we've

03:59.820 --> 04:05.160
grabbed our element properly and then the next step is to add an event listener.

04:05.310 --> 04:12.240
So because we've got it in the object we called it at guest we can do a event listener and then within

04:12.240 --> 04:17.550
the event listener that we're going to be listening for is going to be click and then we're going to

04:17.550 --> 04:26.630
fire off a function we'll pass over the event object as each and now we're ready to have our function.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.030
So something happen whenever the user clicks the button.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.230
So now let's set up the next part.

04:33.260 --> 04:38.710
And this is where we actually need to grab those input values and I'm got to go back to use and get

04:38.710 --> 04:39.990
element by ID.

04:40.060 --> 04:45.750
And of course you're welcome to use query selector or any other way that you can grab those elements.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.980
There's a number of different ones that we've gone through earlier.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.150
So first of all we need to get the guest theme song going to just set up a variable g and document get

04:55.180 --> 05:02.590
element by id and use guest name so that we can grab that.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.290
And what we want to do is grab the value of that element.

05:06.580 --> 05:14.450
Next one we need to grab the number so the number of additional guests.

05:14.530 --> 05:19.650
Our guest is bringing so get element by id and let's identify this.

05:19.870 --> 05:27.990
So guest number and it's always a it's always it's always good practice to try out different ways.

05:28.030 --> 05:34.210
So I know we use most commonly we're always using get element by ID but do challenge yourself to push

05:34.210 --> 05:40.210
yourself to try out different ways of making those Querrey selections and grabbing those elements into

05:40.270 --> 05:41.440
your javascript.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.390
So try to be creative and find different ways to make those selections and there's a number of them

05:46.390 --> 05:48.060
that we have gone through before.

05:49.810 --> 05:56.360
So next in that we would all we need to do is we need to add that user into the party array.

05:56.560 --> 06:04.450
So just over here when we parse through that data object that we're getting from Jason Jason we're creating

06:04.450 --> 06:10.810
that party object and we can push through and add in additional values into there.

06:10.930 --> 06:14.490
So we see that we've got an array with three items in there.

06:14.530 --> 06:15.600
Length of three.

06:15.640 --> 06:22.210
So we know that we're ready to push an additional item so we can utilize this just as we normally would

06:22.540 --> 06:23.820
any array.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.040
And this is an array with objects as the items.

06:27.250 --> 06:31.690
And that's where we're able to get more details just within that one entry.

06:31.690 --> 06:36.130
So we've got push and first thing value that we need is a name.

06:36.190 --> 06:38.480
So let's push a name in there.

06:38.590 --> 06:48.980
Next thing that we need is we've got guests so let's add in the value of guests and then let's let's

06:48.990 --> 06:54.330
start out with a default status because we're not actually grabbing the status and we want that status

06:54.330 --> 06:55.400
to be clickable.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.640
So I'm going to just set it up as false.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.350
So there we go.

06:59.340 --> 07:03.090
So now we're ready to add in people into the list.

07:03.150 --> 07:08.540
So let's refresh it and try it out.

07:08.580 --> 07:15.290
So if we add them in and if we go back to party we can see that now we've added in that fourth person.

07:15.390 --> 07:18.580
And this is being added in as a string value.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.050
So that's the other thing that we do need to take care of.

07:21.060 --> 07:25.800
So let's convert that into a number and we have gone over two different ways.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.540
So there's a number or we could parse integer.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.150
So let's try this out one more time.

07:31.650 --> 07:38.020
So I guess one and this time when I list the party in the console it should be a numeric value.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.140
So there.

07:39.180 --> 07:41.280
So they're all in within that same format.

07:41.280 --> 07:50.200
So there's a string a number and a boolean So one thing that I did want to add is I want this value

07:50.230 --> 07:50.750
actually.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.370
So after we add them I want them to clear out.

07:54.400 --> 08:00.450
So we don't actually keep having to click ADD and we also should have a message that this has been now

08:00.520 --> 08:02.600
updated or something like that.

08:02.770 --> 08:05.720
So let's let's update this.

08:05.740 --> 08:08.140
And within the source code here.

08:08.140 --> 08:15.040
Can you think of a way that once we click this that this will actually clear out to go back to a blank

08:15.070 --> 08:15.450
value.

08:15.460 --> 08:19.890
So it doesn't have a test in it and the user just isn't tempted to keep pressing it.

08:19.900 --> 08:24.660
So can you think of a way to do that and I'll show you a way to do that as well.

08:24.670 --> 08:29.650
So coming up so I hope you had an opportunity to try that out.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.390
And what did you come up with.

08:31.390 --> 08:35.700
Were you able to whenever you click click add that this would clear out.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.070
So the easiest way.

08:37.090 --> 08:44.530
We've already written some code so we can simply get rid of the values there and we can pick up these

08:44.920 --> 08:50.050
elements as objects within our Javascript.

08:50.200 --> 09:00.870
And that means that now I can reset the value to be blank and value and we're going to set that to zero.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.080
So let's try though.

09:02.110 --> 09:06.510
So let's refresh and let's type in test.

09:06.940 --> 09:13.360
And whenever we add that we see that we're defaulting back to zero and we can also see that we've actually

09:13.360 --> 09:14.740
added that value.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.020
So that was the quickest way to do that.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.000
There's a number of different solutions.

09:19.330 --> 09:24.670
So whatever you were able to do if you were able to accomplish this then that's correct.

09:24.700 --> 09:31.550
As long as we're able to make that accomplishment and clear out those values.

09:31.780 --> 09:37.700
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to build out our list so it's actual visual.

09:37.810 --> 09:42.430
And whenever we add somebody else in that it actually creates that part of the list.

09:42.460 --> 09:49.350
So let's create a couple of functions and the first function is going to just build the list.

09:49.360 --> 09:54.710
So it's going to build up the list from the party tree and then the other one.

09:54.910 --> 09:59.130
So the other function is I want to have one that's called message.

09:59.320 --> 10:05.470
And basically this is going to take in some parameters and it's going to output that visually so that

10:05.620 --> 10:12.030
whenever we click this and we add the user we can see that value being added to the bottom of the list.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.090
So we don't have to constantly keep rebuilding this list.

10:15.100 --> 10:20.530
We're going to build at one time and then we're going to make javascript do all of the work in between

10:20.530 --> 10:21.180
there.

10:21.190 --> 10:28.050
So in order to build this out let's set up we're going to build it into output.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.740
So this is where we're going to be outputting those values.

10:30.820 --> 10:37.310
So let's grab output so variable output and grab it into an object so that we can make use of it.

10:37.450 --> 10:44.310
So get element by id grabbing out output.

10:44.490 --> 10:46.380
So now we're ready to make use of it.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.430
And when we're passing it out into the message let's do output

10:53.170 --> 10:57.440
inner h to M-L and we're going to just add to whatever that is.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.760
Melas.

11:00.940 --> 11:07.940
And so let's set up our string here and we don't need to pass in some information.

11:08.110 --> 11:13.040
So let's let's take a message value.

11:13.920 --> 11:19.770
And just check to make sure haven't so many variables called message of surpassing message.

11:19.810 --> 11:28.030
Next we need to have the person or the guest and then next let's have the

11:32.130 --> 11:32.900
ID.

11:33.000 --> 11:42.150
So this is one that we can make use of and this is how we can identify what value here is tied to the

11:42.150 --> 11:44.970
ideas here where the index values within that array.

11:44.970 --> 11:49.440
So this is index or ID within the array within the party array.

11:49.500 --> 11:54.970
So that way we can make updates so we can remove it and we can basically identify it.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.600
So let's set that up.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.250
And now we know that let's let's set up the h t m l.

12:01.260 --> 12:06.350
So every time that gets clicked let's do div and I'll have a class here.

12:06.540 --> 12:13.820
So this class will basically allow us to toggle those values so we'll be able to check them in.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.490
We're going to have some data so I'll have one data ID.

12:17.670 --> 12:22.920
And this is the information that we're going to use to pick up within the Javascript.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.600
So we need to pass through that ID value.

12:25.610 --> 12:31.550
So a single quote double quotes and is want to make sure I got that single double quote single quotes.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.580
I know you can't really read that but so this is double quote.

12:35.610 --> 12:41.260
And then that's a single quote to break out of our string and then we can jump back into the javascript.

12:41.310 --> 12:46.890
Next one we're going to add a whole bunch of these data values because we need to make use of it whenever

12:46.920 --> 12:48.660
these values get clicked.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.160
And so that's where we're adding it within this type of format.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.410
So the next one is person.

12:54.510 --> 13:01.830
So we get that person's name the guests name break back in court so that our team is formatted properly

13:02.160 --> 13:04.310
and let's add a span in here.

13:04.440 --> 13:10.710
And so this is where whatever message content we want to add in so we can just go with a single quote

13:10.740 --> 13:11.200
there.

13:11.340 --> 13:17.700
So breaking out of the JavaScript single code again and we're going to close off that spam.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.070
So this is basically our message.

13:20.190 --> 13:27.580
And either that they've they've accepted it's true or false or we are going to use checkmarks or x'.

13:27.810 --> 13:33.960
And then lastly one more time we're breaking out of our strip and adding in person so we can visually

13:33.960 --> 13:37.090
see that person value there.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.830
And then last thing we need to just close off that.

13:41.190 --> 13:47.660
So let's go up to here where we're adding a guest and as we're adding in this guest let's push these

13:47.730 --> 13:53.030
values before we actually have those values.

13:53.170 --> 13:59.680
And I'm actually going to change this to m just because I'm using message at the function.

13:59.680 --> 14:04.550
So just to avoid confusion we'll just use the variable.

14:04.870 --> 14:09.250
So message so what parameters do we need to pass in here.

14:09.370 --> 14:13.280
And we saw that the first one is the basic message.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.500
So I said I was going to use X's and checkmarks.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.780
So I'll use this type of X..

14:18.820 --> 14:21.510
So this is some A.S.C. character X..

14:21.850 --> 14:24.000
Just to make it more interesting.

14:24.100 --> 14:33.090
The next one is that we need to pass through the number of guests where we actually need to pass in

14:33.330 --> 14:37.990
the person's name so that was the G value is the person's name.

14:38.070 --> 14:42.750
But I also want to add the number of guests and we don't actually need to track that unless we want

14:42.750 --> 14:43.720
to update it.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.670
So I just put yes.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.140
Or we can just do plus.

14:48.180 --> 14:53.160
So this is just a visual plus and then bring it back out of the string.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.750
So no we've got a couple of pluses there in a row.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.770
So this one is a string plus.

14:57.790 --> 14:58.980
So this is just visual.

14:59.050 --> 15:02.110
And then this is to concatenate the rest of those values.

15:03.380 --> 15:08.930
And this one is going to be it doesn't actually matter it doesn't have to be a number value that we're

15:08.930 --> 15:11.840
passing through there because this is all part of one string.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.890
So basically it's going to tell us how many guests.

15:14.900 --> 15:23.400
And then lastly we need to get the index value and we know over here we're adding it into the array.

15:23.540 --> 15:28.990
So how do we get the index value of the next available item in the array.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.980
How do we know that the next one we enter is going to be 4.

15:33.260 --> 15:38.900
And if you're looking at this you can see that the answer is right here that we know that we've got

15:38.960 --> 15:40.320
the length of the array.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.080
And the next value is going to be whatever the length is.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.610
So that's where we can just put in party length.

15:46.610 --> 15:54.080
So let's try to go back refreshed the page and I'm going to add in test and we'll do five and we'll

15:54.140 --> 15:54.710
add it.

15:54.860 --> 15:55.550
So there we go.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.710
So we're adding in that person.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.110
We've got test plussed five.

16:00.170 --> 16:07.030
And when I list out party we can see that we've got that next person there.

16:07.110 --> 16:11.280
So the next lesson we need to still build out our visual list.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.160
So that's what we're going to do here.

16:13.200 --> 16:18.500
And then after that we need to make this functional where we can toggle that the person is checked off

16:18.690 --> 16:25.080
and we can toggle the check to be either an X or a check depending on true or false.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.230
So all of that is coming up.

16:30.140 --> 16:35.580
So what I want you to do now between the next lesson is build out the list.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.860
So build out this function that we can call whenever the page loads.

16:39.890 --> 16:46.610
So set that window on load calling the function of build list and we want to build out all of those

16:46.610 --> 16:49.090
values that are sitting within Jason.

16:49.200 --> 16:55.280
Jason so build out all three of these and build that out as soon as the page loads and all she had to

16:55.280 --> 16:57.100
do that in the next lesson.
