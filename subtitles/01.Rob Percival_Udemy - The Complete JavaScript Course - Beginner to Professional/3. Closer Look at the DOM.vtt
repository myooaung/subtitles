00:00.580 --> 00:07.120
Book about in this lesson we're going to explore the dorm in more detail and the dorm is the starting

00:07.120 --> 00:13.780
place and it's actually the window to create interactive and dynamic content because this is what connects

00:13.840 --> 00:19.060
your job script to your age to a male page and you can also apply styling.

00:19.150 --> 00:23.210
You can create events and a whole lot more you can manipulate elements.

00:23.260 --> 00:26.700
So there's a lot of things that you can do with it that don't.

00:26.770 --> 00:33.120
So you had an opportunity to open that up with the browser and take a quick look through it.

00:33.400 --> 00:41.760
So what we saw earlier when we were looking at our our objects we saw that we can actually get additional

00:41.760 --> 00:42.700
information.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.770
So let's say for instance we want to pull back last modified.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.800
We can just as easily go into our

00:53.010 --> 00:56.030
console and I can type notes.

00:56.130 --> 01:03.000
So if I want to pull back when this document was Last-Modified we access the document object and we

01:03.000 --> 01:07.180
can specify Last-Modified and we can return by the result.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.760
So it's as easy as that to pull that information in.

01:10.800 --> 01:16.980
And if you were trying to use that within your code if you want to know when the document was Last-Modified

01:17.280 --> 01:22.300
you can really easily pull that through and put it in make use of it within your code.

01:22.470 --> 01:28.550
So say for instance you want to get the title of the document so you could do something like document

01:28.860 --> 01:30.050
and title.

01:30.060 --> 01:36.600
So the title object is document title and we can see that it actually pulls back the title information

01:36.810 --> 01:38.890
that's contained within my web site.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.810
So if I change this information and if I save it and of course I do need to go out and refresh it and

01:45.810 --> 01:55.260
if I do document title what that's going to do is that's going to output the title and title of my HMO

01:55.330 --> 01:56.370
title tag.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.930
So you see how useful this can be.

01:58.990 --> 02:03.820
And believe me it can do a whole lot more.

02:03.950 --> 02:09.050
So this is just the beginning that we can pull some information that's contained within the document

02:09.290 --> 02:12.800
and output it and make use of it within our script.

02:12.800 --> 02:20.660
So what I want you to do now is open up the console and go ahead and get the doctype of your web page

02:22.890 --> 02:30.230
and this will work on any Web sites are going to go over to Chrome dev tools and I'm going to open it

02:30.230 --> 02:31.070
up there.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.090
So go ahead.

02:32.090 --> 02:33.180
Pause the video.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.500
Try it for yourself.

02:34.550 --> 02:42.770
Any web page and try to grab that that information that Tagle information and pull back in and actually

02:42.980 --> 02:46.850
use it as a variable so set up a variable in javascript.

02:46.870 --> 02:53.870
Pulling the title information and then store that title information in that newly created variable so

02:53.870 --> 02:59.210
you can create that variable call it table and set that up and I'll show you how to do that coming up.

02:59.570 --> 03:05.990
So we had the opportunity to try this out for yourself so we know how to set up a variable time so we

03:05.990 --> 03:12.380
do the our title and now we need to e-mail it to the actual title of the information that's contained

03:12.440 --> 03:13.690
within the title.

03:13.820 --> 03:20.020
And we saw earlier that when we type in a document that actually pulls back the document object.

03:20.090 --> 03:26.570
And now we need to specify what part of the document object we want to hold him and we want to specify

03:26.570 --> 03:28.380
and we want to grab a title.

03:28.460 --> 03:33.950
So place in a variable called Title and there we go so we can pull back the title.

03:33.950 --> 03:37.270
The other challenge was to put the document type.

03:37.430 --> 03:44.060
So every web page has a document type so we can also put that we have even created a variable if we

03:44.060 --> 03:46.990
want to the same way that we just did title.

03:47.000 --> 03:54.260
So in order to pull back the document the document type this information Milkins contained within the

03:54.260 --> 03:59.300
document object and you can actually see quite a bit of the information that's contained within your

03:59.480 --> 04:01.570
just within Chromes dev tools.

04:03.860 --> 04:08.990
We've got a whole dropdown within the console that will give us all of the information.

04:08.990 --> 04:15.800
So for a document doctype It's as simple as that we can pull back and we can get return back the document

04:15.800 --> 04:21.850
type of the specific page that we're accessing right now and all of this information.

04:21.850 --> 04:27.650
This is built every time a page is rendered out in the browser because it's the browser that is doing

04:27.650 --> 04:34.550
all of this work and is recreating the whole H to content directly within the document and building

04:34.550 --> 04:38.190
up this document object.

04:38.590 --> 04:45.370
And I did say that we can also use the document object and we can interact with some of the content

04:45.520 --> 04:47.620
that's available on our Web page.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.960
So I would be showing you how to do that in the upcoming lesson.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.040
In the meantime between lessons.

04:53.140 --> 05:01.870
Open up your browser open up console and check out all of the different all of the different pieces

05:01.870 --> 05:07.420
of information that's available with the document object and you can also put it within this type of

05:07.420 --> 05:08.480
format as well.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.980
So you have to console log.

05:10.030 --> 05:12.020
You can simply type a document.

05:12.070 --> 05:16.840
And what this will do is this will return back that entire h to mail code.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.670
It was actually the source code gets returned back there.

05:19.810 --> 05:25.930
And if you to see it with a directory structure don't forget to place it within the document directory.

05:25.930 --> 05:28.350
So go ahead try it for yourself.

05:28.480 --> 05:33.160
Take a look through and you don't have to memorize everything that's available in the dorm.

05:33.570 --> 05:40.150
So nobody actually does but there's some key there's some key values here that you're going to be built

05:40.160 --> 05:43.960
to make you so you can see that there's ones like cookies and so on.

05:44.050 --> 05:50.620
So a lot of these are important and also the big important part of it is the amount of age to meld elements

05:50.680 --> 05:51.960
that are available here.

05:52.090 --> 05:55.600
And I'm going to show you how to access these elements coming up.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.380
So take a look.

05:56.420 --> 06:02.470
And next lesson I have to create that interaction between the elements and your javascript.
