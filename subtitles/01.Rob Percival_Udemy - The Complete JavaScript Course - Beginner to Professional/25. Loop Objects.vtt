00:00.760 --> 00:08.380
Welcome back and just says we saw within array's we can loop through the values that are contained within

00:08.500 --> 00:09.890
an object.

00:09.960 --> 00:14.290
So the same format where we use the four method.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.630
And then within that curly brackets this is where we execute our code.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.520
So we're going to console log something out here.

00:21.760 --> 00:28.660
And this is going to be console log of the properties and we're also going to console log and load the

00:28.660 --> 00:31.620
values associated with those properties.

00:31.630 --> 00:39.700
So next let's set up a VAR and just as we did before where we need to specify a variable.

00:39.790 --> 00:44.760
So let's do a property where we could have just done X or something like that.

00:44.760 --> 00:51.900
So we do need something that's going to contain the values the newly created values and we use it again.

00:51.910 --> 00:55.960
So the format is exactly the same as we saw in arrays.

00:56.110 --> 01:04.330
And at this time we'll take a look at the property and we also need to put that value of that property

01:04.930 --> 01:11.320
so that let's take a look and we can see that we return back the property so we get colors may color

01:11.380 --> 01:13.090
make dores model.

01:13.090 --> 01:16.740
So I've got color make dores model.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.160
So it's all there ready to go.

01:19.300 --> 01:25.120
And the challenge is going to be to actually get the values that are associated with that.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.250
And we saw earlier I'll give you a quick hint.

01:28.480 --> 01:35.660
And we saw earlier that if we do the bracket notation we can use a value dynamically.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.660
So in this way we can see that we can return back.

01:40.750 --> 01:47.830
We know that we've got the object car and we know that we've got the property value the property the

01:47.830 --> 01:49.830
value of the property here.

01:50.050 --> 01:53.000
So now we need to be able to retrieve back the value.

01:53.020 --> 02:01.030
So I paused the video and give it a go see if you can get the values as well as the properties output

02:01.120 --> 02:04.830
into the con..

02:04.870 --> 02:08.300
So I hope you had an opportunity to try that out for yourself.

02:08.530 --> 02:18.010
And I can assure you the solution and the solution is that we use the bracket notation for objects where

02:18.040 --> 02:20.710
we bracket around the property.

02:20.710 --> 02:25.510
So this is the same thing as if we two car model

02:29.530 --> 02:31.840
or I should need to quarter around that.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.150
So we do need to quarter around that model.

02:36.500 --> 02:41.690
And so we see that we can retrieve back the value so we see we get Mustang back.

02:41.890 --> 02:44.360
So let's try this for ourselves.

02:44.470 --> 02:49.420
And now we don't have to bracket around property because this is a variable.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.490
We don't have to bracket around there are a quarter around there.

02:52.570 --> 02:57.850
So that's why it didn't work when we did it over here because javascript was actually looking for a

02:57.850 --> 03:02.660
variable called model and not a string value called Model.

03:02.710 --> 03:10.540
So let's refresh it and we see now we've got actually the output as read for the number of doors and

03:10.600 --> 03:11.350
Mustang.

03:11.410 --> 03:13.590
So we're able to get all of the values out.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.060
And if you want the property

03:19.550 --> 03:28.270
plus the value you can always concatenate it together and you can see that we've got color red Ford

03:28.360 --> 03:34.670
Taurus 5 model Mustang and this will work even if we are doing something new.

03:35.770 --> 03:43.240
Driver and let's give the driver a name so this car actually has a driver.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.450
It's driving the car.

03:44.530 --> 03:51.070
So I've got a driver so it doesn't matter how many more items we add into the object.

03:51.070 --> 03:55.950
It's dynamic enough to loop through it and provide us all of those details.

03:58.860 --> 04:05.490
In the next lesson we're going to be looking at how we can nest objects within objects arrays within

04:05.490 --> 04:11.180
objects object arrays with objects in them and everything in between.

04:11.190 --> 04:12.790
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
