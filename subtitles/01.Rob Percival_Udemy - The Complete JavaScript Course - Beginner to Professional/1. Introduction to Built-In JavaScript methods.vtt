Javascript can do some really amazing things render the boxes a lot of built in functionality ready

00:07.140 --> 00:14.220
to go within javascript and this section I'm going to show you how to utilize and power up your applications

00:14.490 --> 00:19.560
with pre-built methods that are already available within Javascript.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.810
So first of all the Date object.

00:21.810 --> 00:27.960
So getting access to dates and date information is really easy within javascript.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.200
Also how to use math.

00:30.240 --> 00:36.180
We've seen this before that we can generate random numbers and we could do a whole lot more with numbers

00:36.240 --> 00:38.540
and math in javascript.

00:38.610 --> 00:46.860
Also how we can manipulate strings so take in string information update that string information and

00:46.860 --> 00:53.280
how we can even update content on our Web page depending on what we're trying to update within a string

00:53.340 --> 00:54.150
value.

00:54.210 --> 00:58.280
We're going to create a number of exercises within this section as well.

00:58.350 --> 01:04.290
So there's a string length guessing game that's going to ask you to guess the length of a strip.

01:04.410 --> 01:07.240
There's also a word scramble a guessing game.

01:07.290 --> 01:13.660
So it's going to scramble words and then it's up to you to guess what that scrambled word is.

01:13.740 --> 01:22.500
Also a countdown timer so specifying a date it will count down to the number of days until that date

01:22.560 --> 01:23.550
is met.

01:23.700 --> 01:30.540
And then we're going to build a memory pattern game where it's going to present you with four random

01:30.540 --> 01:37.680
colors and then it's up to you to select those colors and get those colors within that right sequence

01:37.830 --> 01:39.220
that it was presented to you.

01:39.330 --> 01:45.030
And where are you going to be using math random to randomize the colors that we're presenting on the

01:45.030 --> 01:45.750
screen.

01:45.750 --> 01:52.020
And then last but not least we're going to be building out a whack a mole type game where you can whack

01:52.080 --> 01:53.010
computers.

01:53.030 --> 01:59.520
There is a scoring mechanism and this is going to be a graphical game where you got to move your mouse

01:59.520 --> 02:07.470
cursor on top of the computer as it pops up and then click your mouse button in order to score.

02:07.650 --> 02:11.490
So we've got a lot of exciting exercises in this section.

02:11.490 --> 02:13.300
And I know you're excited to get started.

02:13.350 --> 02:18.990
So let's begin coding and let me show you all the really cool things that are built in within javascript.
