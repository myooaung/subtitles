Welcome back in in the previous lesson we saw how we can traverse through the dawn and we can get access

00:06.780 --> 00:11.400
to all of this amazing information that we can make use of within our Javascript.

00:11.430 --> 00:17.940
So this lesson I want to do something a little bit different I wanted to introduce you to the javascript

00:17.940 --> 00:19.420
word this.

00:19.650 --> 00:29.250
So what this does is I'm going to make several buttons here and it's going to I was going to type click

00:29.250 --> 00:33.110
one and I can't get rid of this part right now as well.

00:33.120 --> 00:39.110
So let's create a bunch of buttons and they're all going to link to the same function.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.330
And now let's go down to the javascript.

00:48.340 --> 00:54.160
We're going to make use of the function so we can actually get rid of this one here because we don't

00:54.160 --> 00:55.390
need that one anymore.

00:55.570 --> 01:01.240
So let's create that function so function and my fun.

01:01.240 --> 01:07.300
And what I want to do is I actually want to differentiate between what actually got clicked.

01:07.300 --> 01:13.900
So whether we've clicked one two or three we don't know because we're all all of this all of them are

01:13.900 --> 01:16.280
actually initiating that same function.

01:16.330 --> 01:24.490
So we want to be able to differentiate between all of these different values and be able to tell actually

01:24.520 --> 01:26.970
which one is clicking through.

01:26.980 --> 01:37.310
So one to pass through a value here and what we'll do is we'll just put it to the here UML

01:41.630 --> 01:43.690
and let's go out and refreshed.

01:43.740 --> 01:50.040
And what I want to do actually I want to be able to pick up these values that I've got here under value

01:50.090 --> 01:58.050
so click 1 2 and 3 where you use the keyword this and what this will do is this will actually allow

01:58.050 --> 02:07.450
us to pass to my function the value of the current element that's being clicked and we'll pass it in

02:07.500 --> 02:09.110
as a value of t.

02:09.210 --> 02:15.540
And we know that we can do values so we know that from previously where it can do document get element

02:15.540 --> 02:16.810
by ID.

02:16.820 --> 02:22.290
We could grab the idea of them even though these ones don't have ID but we could set up Id use on them

02:22.290 --> 02:27.480
and then we could get value and so on and we could pass the IDs in here on that click.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.570
So there's a number of ways that we could do this but the easiest way is to use this.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.130
Now let me show you what actually is going to happen here now.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.380
So let's go and refresh it again.

02:37.530 --> 02:43.840
And when I click one I get the value of click one click to get the value of click to click three.

02:43.860 --> 02:46.670
I get the value of click three.

02:46.740 --> 02:51.570
So let's take a closer look within the con. what's actually happening here.

02:51.570 --> 02:57.300
So when I click it I got a console log out the entire value of t.

02:57.450 --> 03:03.460
So you can see and we can take a closer look at it and see what's actually happening behind the scenes.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.310
So click one.

03:06.420 --> 03:13.350
We see that we get that entire object entire element being sent in to the console.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.810
So we're picking up everything.

03:14.810 --> 03:21.900
So what if I do console directories so we know that with console directory we can actually see more

03:21.900 --> 03:22.880
details.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.830
So let's open that up again.

03:26.830 --> 03:34.120
It now we've got that element and we've got access to all of this information that's contained within

03:34.120 --> 03:35.050
the element.

03:35.050 --> 03:40.780
So we've got information so we've got the default value we've got the height the top the width.

03:40.780 --> 03:47.340
So where it's located we've got the base you or I so we can access all of this information.

03:47.360 --> 03:52.600
We can also traverse through with next sibling and next element sibling or we're going to look more

03:52.600 --> 03:53.160
on that.

03:53.290 --> 03:59.110
And we also see that the click event is there so that one's registered the on click event is there ready

03:59.110 --> 03:59.840
to go.

04:01.190 --> 04:06.020
We can see that the parent is the form so we cannot get access to that.

04:06.020 --> 04:12.680
So really there is a lot of information that's contained within this and basically all this is doing

04:12.680 --> 04:18.530
is it's actually saving us the trouble of going out into the dorm and selecting it.

04:18.620 --> 04:25.440
We're actually passing it as an argument when ever this function gets fired off.

04:25.440 --> 04:33.000
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and create some input buttons create some values for

04:33.000 --> 04:41.060
those input buttons and when the button gets clicked I want you to update the value of the button.

04:41.070 --> 04:47.640
So once the button has been clicked change the value that's being presented in here instead of click

04:47.640 --> 04:49.310
1 2 and 3.

04:49.410 --> 04:54.260
I want it to say clicked in all uppercase and I'll show you the solution to that.

04:54.270 --> 05:01.740
Coming up so if you have an opportunity to try it for yourself and the solution to this is actually

05:01.740 --> 05:10.620
going to be really easy because all we have to do is set the T value because we already have the current

05:10.650 --> 05:13.560
element as the object t.

05:13.770 --> 05:16.170
And it's already connected within the dorm.

05:16.230 --> 05:19.630
We're already passing this information so it's already been identified.

05:19.630 --> 05:22.090
We want to go out into the dorm and select it.

05:22.200 --> 05:29.350
We're passing it here and using this and then we're picking the value up of this with a..

05:29.370 --> 05:34.710
So it's the same thing that we did over here where we set output document get Ellen by the wrapper.

05:34.800 --> 05:41.670
We're placing it within a variable and that gives us access to that particular object within the dorm.

05:41.730 --> 05:43.080
And the same thing here.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.820
So all we have to do is update the value.

05:47.010 --> 05:53.100
So just as we are outputting the value here into the inner h html we can also reassign the value to

05:53.100 --> 05:53.190
it.

05:53.190 --> 05:55.880
So let's refresh it and clicked.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.460
So we see that we can change the value to it.

05:58.670 --> 06:05.240
And this is really powerful because this gives us more information and access to each individual element.

06:05.310 --> 06:08.220
And you see we're still running that same function.

06:08.220 --> 06:14.750
So we don't have to have multiple functions in order to accomplish this by using the word.

06:14.790 --> 06:22.470
This we're passing in that entire element information as an object within the function and then we can

06:22.470 --> 06:26.310
make use of that anywhere within the function.

06:26.310 --> 06:33.000
So do try and vote for yourself and also try to get that type I give him some ideas grabbed the ideas

06:33.270 --> 06:39.840
and try it for yourself and get comfortable with passing all of that information that's contained within

06:39.840 --> 06:40.230
this.
