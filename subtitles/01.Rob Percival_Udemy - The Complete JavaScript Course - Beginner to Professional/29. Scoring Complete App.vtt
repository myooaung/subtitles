00:01.320 --> 00:05.100
We'll come back and this lesson let's add some functionality.

00:05.100 --> 00:11.670
So we start the game we want to initiate our pop up and now we need to create a function and let's call

00:11.670 --> 00:13.330
this function pop up.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.960
So basically what's going to happen is that within this function this is where we are going to pop up

00:18.960 --> 00:20.050
that computer.

00:20.220 --> 00:27.510
So we have to do some random stuff here where we need to pick out the random office where this computer

00:27.570 --> 00:33.290
is going to pop up and then we need to add the class to that computer element.

00:33.600 --> 00:40.420
So that way it can pop up and then the user can actually hit it and we can do something with the hit.

00:40.580 --> 00:48.140
So let's set up another global variable and this is going to basically contain the number of offices

00:48.440 --> 00:49.870
that I want it to create.

00:49.910 --> 00:56.360
So I'm going to give it a value of offices and create that sex.

00:56.590 --> 01:00.650
And basically we can use that value within there as well.

01:00.880 --> 01:09.550
So within the pop up what I want to do is I want to get a random value so that we can pick one of the

01:09.550 --> 01:11.790
computers and have it pop up.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.390
So there's a number of ways that we can do this and we've actually seen this before where we can pick

01:16.510 --> 01:19.130
a random value from our array.

01:19.150 --> 01:25.010
We know that we've got an array within computer where we can loop through and we can make our selection.

01:25.030 --> 01:32.140
So let's go ahead and pick our random computer and let's set up a variable for this.

01:32.140 --> 01:37.470
So set up a local variable and we might have to bring it out as well.

01:37.720 --> 01:47.680
So for this one we need to select from a computer and we need to pick out a random item from that computer

01:47.770 --> 01:48.300
array.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.350
So this is where we can use math.

01:50.350 --> 01:56.400
So just as we did before let's build out and pick out a random value from the array.

01:56.410 --> 02:02.470
So I want you to pause the video and go back into what we've done in the previous lessons and pick out

02:02.620 --> 02:06.710
a random value from the array and I'll show you the solution coming up.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.670
So we're use math floor in order to round it down and let's use math random to get a random number so

02:15.670 --> 02:17.260
math random method.

02:17.380 --> 02:23.860
And then we lastly we know we need to multiply it by the length of the array that we're trying to get

02:23.950 --> 02:25.880
the random value out of.

02:26.110 --> 02:28.810
So multiply it by the length.

02:28.810 --> 02:35.720
So we're doing a math floor math random and we're multiplying it by the vailable array.

02:38.250 --> 02:43.910
And so what this is going to do is this is going to return back a value of Rand.

02:44.100 --> 02:49.310
And let's just call this our For now so we'd shorten that have it all within one space.

02:49.380 --> 02:56.070
So just doing a quick check to make sure I got all the brackets in properly and we need to make sure

02:56.070 --> 02:57.840
that we add in pop up.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.470
So that was what we had within our class.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.730
So let's go and test.

03:02.730 --> 03:05.180
So it started up and so there we go.

03:05.180 --> 03:08.090
So we've got a random computer popping up.

03:08.220 --> 03:13.740
And so the next item is that when we hit it we want to remove that class.

03:13.740 --> 03:21.870
So what I want you to do pause the video and go into his computer grab the element that was hit and

03:21.930 --> 03:24.500
then remove the class up.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.670
So pause a video and try that.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.690
And I'll show you the solution coming up.

03:29.410 --> 03:36.670
So we know that we have the ability to select items so we know that when we're grabbing the computer

03:36.850 --> 03:40.180
we can go ahead and we can make our selection.

03:40.180 --> 03:47.490
So let's add that now that we're going to use them at Target.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.270
So the target object.

03:49.390 --> 03:53.930
And for the target object we want to.

03:54.220 --> 04:03.640
So just as we added the pop up let's remove pop up from the class list so as to remove pop up from the

04:03.640 --> 04:07.360
classless So let's refresh this hit start.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.330
And now when we click it it's going to remove the pop up.

04:10.510 --> 04:11.110
So there we go.

04:11.110 --> 04:17.980
So now we know that we can actually select an element and we can hide it and select it.

04:17.980 --> 04:22.110
So the next objective is to add an interval.

04:22.150 --> 04:28.960
So we saw that before where we've got the timeouts and we can set those up and we can have those run.

04:28.990 --> 04:34.090
So ideally within the pop up we want to have this function run.

04:34.210 --> 04:43.480
And then what we want to do is actually we want to hide the computers on the time and then go back and

04:43.480 --> 04:47.480
have another computer show up in another slot.

04:47.530 --> 04:51.840
So let's go ahead and we need to set up a global variable.

04:51.850 --> 04:57.300
So this is just our regular timer and I'm just going to initiate that up there.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.070
And then within here so within the pop up.

05:00.160 --> 05:06.580
So this is where we actually have one of them popping up and I want to have an interval where I want

05:06.580 --> 05:13.360
to be able to hide this particular one so let's do a timer and then we're going to pop it up somewhere

05:13.360 --> 05:13.750
else.

05:13.780 --> 05:21.880
So timer equals set timeout.

05:22.100 --> 05:26.200
And this is a function that we want to run on a specific time delay.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.780
So we're going to set it now as a default.

05:29.800 --> 05:37.990
And what we need to do is we need to create another function in order to hide the computer.

05:37.990 --> 05:40.470
So this one will hide the computer.

05:40.600 --> 05:46.150
And for that we actually need to know what the computer is that we want to hide so let's create that

05:46.150 --> 05:49.840
function and this function is hied computer.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.800
And we actually need to know what computer it is that we're trying to hide.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.960
So noticed over here.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.190
This is the one that we decided to show.

05:57.280 --> 06:04.320
So let's make a quick update to this variable and we'll have we'll call it show.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.210
See or s com.

06:09.540 --> 06:14.400
So that's nice and short there so that will fit right in there and Ask.com.

06:14.490 --> 06:20.250
And for this we need to actually set the value up here as a global variable.

06:20.250 --> 06:23.010
So as calm as a global variable.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.180
And that way.

06:24.180 --> 06:32.910
Now whenever this timer runs we know that after 200 milliseconds we know which computer we actually

06:32.910 --> 06:34.980
need to remove the classroom.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.870
So this one is going to be the same thing but we don't have an event target.

06:39.900 --> 06:46.030
But we do have Eskom in order to pick up and determine which one we want to hide.

06:46.410 --> 06:54.510
So it's go ahead and hide that one after 20 seconds and then after we've hidden that we need to run

06:54.690 --> 06:55.950
pop up again.

06:56.220 --> 06:59.570
So we're going back to the pop up functions are competing this loop.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.170
So let's go ahead and start this game.

07:02.370 --> 07:06.470
And now we should have all of these computers popping up really quickly.

07:06.690 --> 07:10.240
And if you can click them then that means that you're scoring.

07:10.440 --> 07:16.440
So the next part of this course is that we should also randomize the speed.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.020
So no it's rather quick.

07:18.030 --> 07:21.480
So let's set that up as a random speed.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.020
So what I want you to do now pause the video instead of having 200 milliseconds.

07:26.100 --> 07:34.670
Let's do random speed so do it all the way from anywhere from 200 and up to 1000.

07:35.010 --> 07:40.710
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you how to do that coming up.

07:40.770 --> 07:42.210
So let's set up a variable.

07:42.210 --> 07:46.110
We'll call it our time for random time.

07:46.110 --> 07:49.950
And for this one we need to do some math again.

07:49.990 --> 07:56.970
So let's let's bracket that because at the end of the math I want to at least 200 to it.

07:57.180 --> 08:00.500
So I want to have it at a minimum of 200.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.250
And maybe the other thing too that maybe we can do is we can multiply.

08:05.250 --> 08:14.880
So we can pick a number from 1 to 10 and we can multiply that number by a hundred so let's do math and

08:14.880 --> 08:24.980
floor and then math random and we're going to multiply that by 10.

08:25.500 --> 08:32.310
And then once we've done our math floor we're going to multiply this by 100 and then we're going to

08:32.310 --> 08:34.120
add 200 to it.

08:34.350 --> 08:36.120
So let's try out that interval.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.610
So that way they're not all going to be the same.

08:38.790 --> 08:42.450
And it looks a lot more random how they are popping up and showing up.

08:42.450 --> 08:48.760
So we've got there we've got it there that once stood it longer and again it's starting again.

08:48.780 --> 08:52.360
So once we click it we can initialize that pop up again.

08:54.270 --> 08:58.520
So the next objective is to add a scoring mechanism.

08:58.770 --> 08:59.790
So go ahead.

08:59.790 --> 09:06.140
Pause the video and add an ability to collect and keep the score.

09:06.150 --> 09:08.460
I'll show you how to do that coming up.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.630
So let's set the global variable.

09:10.650 --> 09:17.330
We'll just call that score and initially we'll just set it at zero and we're going to use query selector

09:18.120 --> 09:22.190
and we can't update that inner h t m l.

09:22.440 --> 09:29.260
So every time we hit the computer let's increment the score.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.310
So score plus plus.

09:31.550 --> 09:36.510
So it's going to add to one and all we have to do is put the score here.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.680
So let's let's try that now.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.580
So go back and refresh it.

09:40.590 --> 09:45.000
So every time I hit it we should be updating the score.

09:45.130 --> 09:50.820
So we're getting a value of one and it's actually shouldn't be gameboard it should be score that's updating.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.830
That was an error there.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.820
So let's refresh that and try that again.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.230
So now when I hit them we can see that the score is updating.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.020
So that's exactly what we want to happen.

10:02.020 --> 10:11.070
We want to be able to click and have the score update so I want to add in one more really quick transition.

10:11.170 --> 10:17.010
So we have an option when we add in another class and we do some transitions.

10:17.020 --> 10:20.580
We have what's called transition within CSSA.

10:20.740 --> 10:25.530
So this will make our transition between the two elements a whole lot smoother.

10:25.660 --> 10:26.660
So do all.

10:26.680 --> 10:31.870
And then this is the amount of milliseconds that we're going to do our transition.

10:31.870 --> 10:34.930
So so you this one line of code is going to do.

10:34.930 --> 10:39.580
So it's going to do quite a bit because now it's going to make our computers look like they're actually

10:39.610 --> 10:46.540
popping up from below because they are actually moving up and we're moving from 100 percent of the bottom

10:46.540 --> 10:48.400
of the element all the way up to the top.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.040
So now they look like they're actually moving up and we can see that we're clicking them.

10:53.050 --> 10:57.130
So one of the things now that we need to do is we need to do some bug fixing.

10:57.130 --> 11:02.530
So notice that if I click the computer I can actually click it a few times so I don't want to be able

11:02.530 --> 11:04.440
to click it more than once.

11:04.480 --> 11:10.810
I want that simply to be removed and I want the ability to be able to click on it to be turned off.

11:12.800 --> 11:19.040
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you how to do that as well coming up.

11:19.130 --> 11:26.840
So the solution to that is a global variable so this variable this will be our global variable and basically

11:26.840 --> 11:28.380
it will be sealed off.

11:28.430 --> 11:34.870
So it will turn off the ability to click on anything things or start out as having it true.

11:35.060 --> 11:43.010
And then whenever we initiate the pop up we're going to also set it as true.

11:43.160 --> 11:49.460
So that way we make sure that the user has the ability to click on the element that's popping up.

11:49.790 --> 11:59.240
And next we need to have a way to set it so whenever we do click on it I want to set the click off.

11:59.600 --> 12:08.070
So let's go down here and we're checking to see if we're actually doing a hit and when we remove the

12:08.070 --> 12:20.950
pop up we need to make sure that we're also checking to see if see off and if sea off is true.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.920
That means that we haven't set it to false yet.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.060
So now the next thing to do is set it to false.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.610
So basically this is going to work as a switch.

12:31.210 --> 12:36.790
And we can update the score within there and we could also keep this one out of there as well and keep

12:36.790 --> 12:44.590
that only if we're actually updating the score that we need to to actually put it into the HMO so that

12:44.590 --> 12:52.480
way that will fix that where we've actually made a hit and where closing that off and the other thing

12:52.480 --> 12:59.770
that was missing that we also need to launch back to pop up so that once we've clicked it and once we're

12:59.770 --> 13:03.100
hiding it then we're ready to retrieve our next one.

13:05.620 --> 13:10.220
So let's save that go back and refresh it and start the game again.

13:10.270 --> 13:16.660
So now we see that even if we click on it and I really do need to slow it down to be able to illustrate

13:16.960 --> 13:18.110
what's happening here.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.630
But we see that

13:22.830 --> 13:25.180
we have to click on it and they're really quick.

13:25.320 --> 13:30.390
So maybe what I'll do is update this to Phife and refresh again.

13:30.390 --> 13:33.180
So this will give me a little bit more time to click them.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.780
So I see that I can't click them more than once.

13:35.880 --> 13:41.580
So as soon as I click them that one time that they go back into the loop and they're going back into

13:41.580 --> 13:42.440
hiding again.

13:44.650 --> 13:52.900
So what I want you to do now is take the script and update it so have instead of six update it to 9.

13:52.990 --> 13:54.960
Try it out and see if that works.

13:55.030 --> 13:59.210
And you're also going to have to update the height of the game board.

13:59.260 --> 14:05.070
So let's do that now and let's see how dynamic Our application is actually going to be.

14:05.290 --> 14:10.930
So if we go to 9 Let's go back and refresh it and start the game.

14:10.930 --> 14:17.980
So now we see that we can go to nine computers and if we had the space we could go to even more.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.170
So now it's up to you to customize this application.

14:21.190 --> 14:24.500
You can customize the styling make it look a whole lot better.

14:24.610 --> 14:28.530
And also you can customize some of the functionality as well.

14:28.570 --> 14:33.570
Update The number of computers and even update what happens when it gets clicked.

14:33.820 --> 14:40.600
So go ahead try to for yourself out in your own customizations and add in your own spin to this.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.330
Hit the computer application.
