This lesson back to just opening up the file in the browser so I don't have the local host running anymore

00:07.790 --> 00:09.520
because we're not going to need it for any more.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.560
The lessons that are coming up.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.980
So that was just for the cookies.

00:14.090 --> 00:20.650
And in this lesson we're looking at I Ephie immediately invoked function expressions.

00:20.690 --> 00:27.620
So these are functions that will run right away and you can invoke them right away as well.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.580
So basically we've got a function here it's an anonymous function.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.750
And we also do need to have those second sets of round brackets.

00:36.860 --> 00:39.550
And then whatever content we've got in here.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.330
So this gets immediately invoked.

00:41.330 --> 00:44.140
So this is I F E content.

00:44.150 --> 00:51.650
So basically if we want a function to run right away we can simply invoke it right away within this

00:51.650 --> 00:52.710
type of format.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.180
So we don't have to give it a name or anything like that.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.400
And we can just run the function.

00:57.650 --> 01:03.490
So let's set up a message and let's say hello world.

01:05.360 --> 01:11.600
And these are really useful within your web page in case you want something to happen right away and

01:11.600 --> 01:14.740
you don't want to go and create those function names.

01:14.840 --> 01:19.520
So you can immediately invoke a set of code using this type of method.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.560
This type of format.

01:20.750 --> 01:25.970
And the good thing about it is as well though if you want to have some variables and you don't want

01:25.970 --> 01:31.580
them globally then this is one of the main reasons why we do these immediately invoked functions is

01:31.580 --> 01:36.620
to save us the trouble of having variables that are sitting within the global scope.

01:36.620 --> 01:43.880
So actually I'm going to update so I'm going to do document get element by id and I'm going to update

01:43.970 --> 01:51.220
the output with hinter each to M-L and this time I'm going to update it with message.

01:51.590 --> 01:58.190
And then we know that afterwards if I try to console log out to message I won't be able to have access

01:58.190 --> 02:04.030
to it because the variable is going to get destroyed after we run the function.

02:04.040 --> 02:11.060
So there we go so we see that we're trying to access a value and the value doesn't exist because of

02:11.060 --> 02:14.000
course this is sitting locally within the function.

02:14.180 --> 02:20.140
So we do need to get rid of that go back out here refreshed and we see that this way we can use that

02:20.140 --> 02:22.990
variable and immediately execute that.

02:23.090 --> 02:28.680
And then that variable will then get destroyed if we've got a lot of code coming up afterwards.

02:28.790 --> 02:35.270
We want to have access to it but that's the whole idea that we try to use local variables as much as

02:35.270 --> 02:40.950
possible and the local variables sit and live only within the functions.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.830
So go ahead and try this site and open up your editor and create one of these immediately invoking function

02:48.830 --> 02:51.530
expressions and write in some code.

02:51.530 --> 02:59.150
Set up some variables that are only going to be used to run this set of code such as the ones that I've

02:59.150 --> 03:00.110
done over here.

03:00.140 --> 03:02.630
So try it for yourself within your editor's.
