00:01.310 --> 00:02.220
Welcome back.

00:02.240 --> 00:06.670
And in this lesson we're going to be discussing get element by ID.

00:06.740 --> 00:13.250
Previously we saw how you can traverse through the dorm and it get it could get fairly lengthy and the

00:13.250 --> 00:17.540
whole idea is when you're trying to interact with your h m himself code that you want to be able to

00:17.540 --> 00:22.300
properly select the elements that you want to manipulate.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.930
So it's all about the selection process.

00:25.040 --> 00:31.430
And we've used this one before multiple times where we're actually outputting content and we're making

00:31.430 --> 00:40.010
use of that by doing the document get element by id and this by far is the most popular way of selecting

00:40.040 --> 00:41.190
DOM elements.

00:41.390 --> 00:47.300
And we've seen this before where we can simply grab the element that we want to make use of and then

00:47.300 --> 00:50.010
pull that into our dorm.

00:50.110 --> 00:54.120
So I'm going to just update that and I'm going to crowd in other elements.

00:54.130 --> 00:58.730
So you know I usually like to have device there for the output.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.890
So we've got our div we've got our output and now we're all ready to go.

01:03.910 --> 01:11.410
We're linked to that element and we're ready to manipulate that element.

01:11.610 --> 01:16.970
And another great thing about the dorm is that you don't actually have to memorize all of those paths.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.460
It simply just makes sense.

01:18.460 --> 01:23.950
And you can just simply open up your browser and within the console itself it's going to be suggesting

01:24.140 --> 01:28.710
the different paths the different methods that are available to traverse through the dam.

01:28.750 --> 01:34.150
So you've got a lot of help here and just as long as you understand the relationship the higher here

01:34.270 --> 01:40.190
aeration ship then you should be able to really easily select elements that you want.

01:40.390 --> 01:42.870
So we've used get element by ID.

01:42.910 --> 01:46.950
So there's a number of different ways in order to make selections.

01:47.140 --> 01:54.340
So let's say for instance we want to grab an element by we want to grab all of these divs here.

01:54.460 --> 02:01.750
So we want to grab all of the elements that have a tag team of div so we can do that the same way.

02:01.750 --> 02:06.030
So let's set that up and we can do div.

02:06.310 --> 02:13.480
So we'll call it our div list because this is going to grab all the elements that have divs and no document

02:14.920 --> 02:16.600
get.

02:16.650 --> 02:19.320
And this is important the way that.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.880
So we've got to get elements by tag name.

02:24.210 --> 02:29.430
So notice that it doesn't say element it says Get elements by tag name.

02:29.490 --> 02:31.440
So this is an important distinction.

02:31.470 --> 02:34.620
And then everything else still looks the same.

02:34.710 --> 02:43.290
But when we go back out and if we refresh that content so we know that if we do output we get that particular

02:43.290 --> 02:51.510
element but no notice that within the H.M. We've got multiple divs that have the tag name of Div.

02:51.510 --> 02:58.120
So what happens if I list out div we see we've got actually eight items that are being returned.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.970
So now we have an option.

03:00.030 --> 03:04.710
So if we wanted to select a particular one we can simply select it.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.630
At this point now as well.

03:06.630 --> 03:13.570
So just as we were traversing through we can maneuver through the div list so we can do this now div

03:13.580 --> 03:14.070
lists.

03:14.220 --> 03:18.360
And because they've got IDs and we've got a way to identify them.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.020
We can maneuver to any one of those.

03:21.030 --> 03:28.440
So this really jumps through and fast fasttrack source to be able to select out the proper elements

03:28.710 --> 03:34.380
so we can bring out and we can distinguish between all of the elements on that page and simply pull

03:34.380 --> 03:39.780
back the divs and then if we want to select a particular one we don't have to worry about where they're

03:39.780 --> 03:40.610
located.

03:40.680 --> 03:48.360
We can just use the ID value and we could also do when they appear on the page.

03:48.360 --> 03:53.610
So the first one that we have is output then another then one two three four or five all the way to

03:53.610 --> 03:54.090
6.

03:54.210 --> 03:59.640
So 6 is the last one that gets opened up and created here within the page.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.480
And that's why it's the last one here.

04:02.860 --> 04:09.940
So if we know the order that they're being represented now we can grab that first one and we can actually

04:10.000 --> 04:11.400
update the value.

04:11.560 --> 04:17.890
So that's what I want you to do now to pause the video and instead of using GET elements by id use GET

04:17.890 --> 04:23.320
elements like tag Neme and update some of the content here in output.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.470
Say hello.

04:24.490 --> 04:34.480
Welcome to my page and pause the video and try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up so earlier

04:34.540 --> 04:42.100
we saw how we can go through and we can pick out all of the dibs and it comes out within a list here

04:42.160 --> 04:44.380
where we've got all of the divs listed.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.180
We can also just like any other array.

04:47.290 --> 04:53.860
We've got the length of the number of divs so we can loop through them if we want to as well.

04:53.860 --> 05:00.100
So this is important to remember because this can this object can be treated the same way as an array

05:00.280 --> 05:08.970
because we've got a length and notice as well that the first one starts with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

05:09.010 --> 05:16.450
So if we want to update the inner h to him model of that particular element we can select it the same

05:16.450 --> 05:20.890
way that we would select any other item within an array.

05:21.100 --> 05:29.900
And we can do inner h t M-L so selecting that in our h t amount and we need it to update the message.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.350
So let's go ahead and do that.

05:31.400 --> 05:39.960
And the message was welcome to my Web site so there we go snow.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.880
We go back and we refresh the page.

05:42.880 --> 05:48.150
Now the contents of this particular element are welcome to my website.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.820
So I've got another challenge for you now.

05:50.960 --> 05:58.580
So we've already hooked up this button here and we can see that actually I should update this type button

06:03.290 --> 06:07.700
but it's not actually a button as of yet until we set that type.

06:07.710 --> 06:11.760
So what I want you to do now within this challenge this is the second part.

06:11.880 --> 06:18.240
I want you to we saw that we can grab div list and we saw that div list had a length.

06:18.240 --> 06:25.980
So what I want to do is I want to output all of the inner h t m l the inner text that's contained within

06:26.070 --> 06:32.980
every div on my page and I want to output that within the city of up here within the output area.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.470
But I want to skip that first one because I don't want to grab any text from there.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.130
I simply want to use that as an output.

06:42.310 --> 06:50.280
So go ahead and open up your editor and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up so hope

06:50.280 --> 06:52.230
you had an opportunity to try that.

06:52.350 --> 06:58.400
We're able to list all of the contents of the various divs and let me show you how to do that.

06:58.470 --> 07:01.530
So we know that the first one here is output.

07:01.530 --> 07:06.420
So that was one of the cues here that so we've got a function called my fun.

07:06.450 --> 07:14.010
So let's set that up and we're going to get this function to trigger out and put all of the content

07:14.250 --> 07:16.320
within that output element.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.710
So we know that we have a length.

07:19.710 --> 07:24.490
And when we have a length we know that we can utilize it within a loop.

07:24.510 --> 07:32.130
So let's set up a loop so you use X as a default variable and we're going to loop through while the

07:32.130 --> 07:35.970
length of div list.

07:35.970 --> 07:42.870
So while x is less than the length of div list and we're going to incremented and so this gives us the

07:42.870 --> 07:45.480
ability to output that content.

07:45.720 --> 07:50.070
And another thing important to note that we know that starts out with zero so this would be the first

07:50.070 --> 07:50.560
one.

07:50.580 --> 07:57.270
So if we want to skip it we can simply start up 1 and then we can loop through and output that content.

07:57.270 --> 08:03.560
So Nexen was in order to output that content into the inner h all of that first element.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.240
So we've already kind of done that over here.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.030
And what I'm going to do I'm going to set up a local variable.

08:09.090 --> 08:17.350
I'm going to just call it H2 mental and div list.

08:17.380 --> 08:22.530
We'll call it div list and put a line break there at the end of it.

08:25.350 --> 08:33.420
So let's as we're looping through we're going to concatenate to h t m l to the h l variable and we know

08:33.420 --> 08:38.180
that we're able to get back the value of the inner aged him out there.

08:38.220 --> 08:41.980
So let's use X as a variable.

08:42.210 --> 08:46.590
And now let's do enter and maybe you can do inner text.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.310
So to simplify it so get rid of all of that.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.780
H t m l.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.480
So that's it.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.950
So now we know we loop through.

08:54.090 --> 08:57.420
And lastly we need to output that content.

08:57.600 --> 09:03.660
So this one was what we did over here where we can just use div list 0.

09:03.780 --> 09:08.380
And we could output that inner h to M-L output to it.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.650
So let's go ahead and try it out.

09:10.890 --> 09:17.400
So that when I click it we see that we get all of those elements listed there and let's add in a line

09:17.400 --> 09:22.090
break so that we can distinguish between all the different elements.

09:22.140 --> 09:24.820
So let's go back and refresh it again.

09:24.900 --> 09:28.660
So we click it and we see that we've got our div list.

09:28.710 --> 09:33.960
So maybe this one can even be a heading or something like that for it so it actually gets distinguished

09:34.050 --> 09:37.220
stands out from the rest of the elements.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.880
So each one.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.450
So let's try that one more time and click it.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.920
So we've got our list.

09:43.980 --> 09:47.510
So notice that the first one is a parent.

09:47.880 --> 09:53.620
So where listing out all of the contents that are contained within there.

09:53.670 --> 09:56.930
So it's got that parent and then we've got all of the contents there.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.420
And then next we hit the next step of the next one.

09:59.440 --> 10:05.340
The next one the next one the next one and something happened here because we're not actually picking

10:05.430 --> 10:06.620
that one up.

10:06.930 --> 10:15.590
And that's because when we look at the length of it so let's go back out here and we'll give a list

10:16.730 --> 10:17.960
length.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.350
We see that the length is eight.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.150
So it's starting at 1.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.650
So we're looping through.

10:23.690 --> 10:34.450
So initially we're at 1 so this is one two three four five six and we've got a length of 8 and that's

10:34.450 --> 10:37.480
because this value here it's not test six.

10:37.480 --> 10:44.140
It's actually welcome to my Web site because this one actually fired off before we ran the function

10:44.140 --> 10:46.130
so it already updated that text.

10:46.210 --> 10:52.990
So it actually grabs that dynamically updated text and hits number 7 and then next round it would be

10:53.020 --> 10:53.530
8.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.110
So it's no longer true this statement and it breaks out of the loop.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.170
And then we output that H to him.

10:59.230 --> 11:00.600
So that's what happened there.

11:00.610 --> 11:08.700
If you're wondering why we're not seeing sex and we're seeing Welcome to my Web site so one more challenge

11:08.700 --> 11:11.010
before we conclude.

11:11.040 --> 11:17.910
So we looked at and we saw that this particular div has a whole bunch of children within it and that

11:17.910 --> 11:23.790
actually distinguishes it from the other six divs that don't actually have any children within it.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.380
They don't have any child elements.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.180
They have children.

11:26.180 --> 11:29.430
They have a child node but they don't have a child element.

11:29.450 --> 11:37.980
So now what I want you to do lastly is to pause the video and add a condition within our loop that checks

11:37.980 --> 11:43.580
to see if this particular div that we're looking at has a child.

11:43.620 --> 11:51.510
So if it's got any child elements and if it does then we know that we don't want to output it.

11:51.510 --> 11:56.630
So we only want to output to test 1 2 3 4 5 and then welcome to my Web site.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.780
We only want to output these values.

11:58.830 --> 12:04.500
We don't want to grab this one that's got the parent and it's got a bunch of divs nested in it.

12:04.500 --> 12:10.830
So go ahead and try that out and I'll give you a hint that it is a condition and we do need to look

12:10.830 --> 12:16.830
at what we looked at previously when we were traverses through the dorm elements that were able to actually

12:16.830 --> 12:17.990
distinguish this one.

12:18.060 --> 12:21.750
But this is the only one that's actually going to have a first child element.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.930
So go ahead try that it and I'll give you the solution.

12:25.980 --> 12:34.950
So the solution is to add in a condition so we know we can grab that elements and we can say div IList

12:36.320 --> 12:40.040
and we're going to do first child element.

12:40.070 --> 12:46.340
So what's going to happen now is that this condition is actually going to check to see if it's actually

12:46.340 --> 12:47.100
true or not.

12:47.240 --> 12:55.040
So if it has a first child element it will output it within our within our loop and if it doesn't then

12:55.070 --> 12:56.350
it's not going outputted.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.140
So basically we see that we get this output here.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.330
So this is the parent.

13:01.610 --> 13:08.780
So we know that when we're doing conditions if we do that the explanation mark then that reverses it.

13:08.780 --> 13:13.980
So now we should list out all of the divs that don't have any children.

13:16.700 --> 13:23.270
So again it's going in to the device looking out what's unique within them and then properly selecting

13:23.270 --> 13:28.310
out the device that you want to make use of within your code and I'll give you another hint as well.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.290
So there's a number of ways to do this.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.150
So this was just one solution.

13:32.210 --> 13:37.850
There's other ways to do this as well where you can look at and you can see what's actually distinct

13:37.940 --> 13:41.750
about the various elements and then make that selection.

13:41.750 --> 13:47.510
So what I want you to do now is to challenge yourself and create another type of condition where you're

13:47.510 --> 13:57.810
able to select out only a few of these elements or only able to select out ones that actually have children.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.880
So go ahead and try that out for yourself.

14:02.850 --> 14:04.020
And familiar style.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.250
Familiarize yourself even more with what you can do within the dorm.
