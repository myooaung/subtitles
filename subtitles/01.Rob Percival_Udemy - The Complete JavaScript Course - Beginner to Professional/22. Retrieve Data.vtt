00:00.480 --> 00:01.280
Welcome back.

00:01.290 --> 00:07.050
And previously we saw how we can make objects how we could define objects and we saw that there was

00:07.140 --> 00:08.810
really two ways to do that.

00:08.820 --> 00:13.740
So either way that you do that you're going to end up with an object and you're going to be able to

00:13.740 --> 00:16.620
have the same use of that object.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.680
So it's just a matter of how you prefer to define that object and what method works best for you.

00:22.860 --> 00:26.420
So a comment about that constructor method.

00:26.670 --> 00:29.360
And we're going to focus on the literal method.

00:29.580 --> 00:34.950
So we've created an object here and we see that we're able to put that information into the console

00:35.100 --> 00:36.940
by doing console log object.

00:37.140 --> 00:41.260
But what if we actually want to retrieve a specific piece of information.

00:41.550 --> 00:44.990
And with objects it's going to be really easy.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.750
So let me go back in here and refresh it and we see that we've got our object here so I can do object

00:52.140 --> 00:59.040
and I see that I've got my names here so I've got color I've got make I've got doors and this is all

00:59.040 --> 01:05.320
I have to do I can use the dot notation and specify the object name.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.450
So the original main container for the object will be J.

01:08.670 --> 01:14.940
And then I can also specify one of the values that's in there because we've got these named values so

01:14.940 --> 01:15.770
all I have to do.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.200
LBG doors.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.080
And it just makes a whole lot more sense.

01:20.160 --> 01:29.370
So I can even change this to be even more something that makes even more sense semantically where I've

01:29.370 --> 01:34.850
got a car and I've got my car and I've got my make.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.890
So I know that my car is a Ford.

01:36.990 --> 01:42.690
I've got my model I can see it's a Mustang and I've got some additional information so I know it's got

01:42.690 --> 01:45.170
five doors and so on.

01:45.390 --> 01:49.590
So there's also another way to retrieve information.

01:49.590 --> 01:52.750
And this way it has a few advantages.

01:52.950 --> 02:01.710
So although it's not as easy to write I would say this dot notation you can do bracket and we can quote

02:02.010 --> 02:06.680
the property the name of the property that we want to retrieve.

02:06.870 --> 02:10.100
So we can retrieve it within this format as well.

02:10.110 --> 02:15.850
So you're probably wondering well why would we go with this one when we can use this one.

02:16.140 --> 02:23.460
And that's a really good question and the answer to that is that that dot notation although it's easier

02:23.460 --> 02:31.070
to write and easier to read lacks some of the capabilities that the bracket notation has.

02:31.140 --> 02:38.670
And one of the things that bracket notation can do is it can dynamically change the property of the

02:38.670 --> 02:41.050
values so we can do something.

02:41.070 --> 02:51.870
I'm going to go back out into my editor and kind of say that maybe I want Propp and the property is

02:52.020 --> 02:55.110
color.

02:55.600 --> 03:04.120
So if I want to retrieve by the value of car color and maybe we're setting this dynamically so we're

03:04.120 --> 03:05.270
picking it out.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.640
We could do it from a prompt as well.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.760
So we're setting this dynamically.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.820
I can't do something like this.

03:12.900 --> 03:13.990
That's not going to work.

03:14.170 --> 03:20.580
So if I refresh it we get undefined because this is where we actually have to use that bracket notation

03:20.950 --> 03:26.090
and that value because this is this could be a potentially dynamic value.

03:26.110 --> 03:32.500
Well we see that this is our way to actually retrieve back that particular property.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.600
So making this more dynamic I can change this to dollars.

03:36.700 --> 03:44.530
I can refresh the page and I can see that in this format we can't change Propp and we can retrieve back

03:44.680 --> 03:47.020
the different values dynamically.

03:47.020 --> 03:52.450
So basically it gives us more flexibility to retrieve that information as needed.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.760
And that's the reason for going with the bracket notation over the dot notation.

04:00.060 --> 04:11.640
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor creates a similar object that what I have here

04:11.640 --> 04:21.330
describing a car and then what we're going to ask the user what information using a prompt what they

04:21.330 --> 04:26.700
want to see and then we're going to retrieve that information and put that back into the console.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.760
So a lot of the work is done other than the prompt.

04:30.060 --> 04:36.060
So you can pause the video and you can pretty much work with what we've got displayed here and update

04:36.060 --> 04:43.500
it to really simply ask that prompt and retrieve back that information sending it back into the console.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.690
So give me a few minutes.

04:44.700 --> 04:48.630
Open up your editor try it out you know provide that solution.

04:48.630 --> 04:56.420
So we saw earlier that we've got a prompt so prompt gives us the ability to essentially ask the question.

04:56.490 --> 05:03.450
So what did you want to know about the car.

05:04.080 --> 05:11.890
And of course we're expecting that the user is going to either enter color make doors or model.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.920
So we're going to keep it at that.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.760
And it's as simple as this.

05:15.780 --> 05:23.410
We just have to format this in a question and pass that dynamic value into prompt our own Pete Propp

05:23.760 --> 05:25.960
and then we can output it into the console.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.560
So let's try it.

05:27.630 --> 05:28.870
So what we want to know.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.400
Let's talk a color.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.450
We see that he comes back red.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.760
What do you want to know about the car doors.

05:34.770 --> 05:40.720
See that comes back fly so I know that this should have been a fairly easy challenge.

05:40.740 --> 05:44.470
So that was incorrect slow and sexy model.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.970
I was looking for comes back Mustang.

05:47.430 --> 05:56.130
So this is where you can begin to see that using objects is really useful because the names here just

05:56.130 --> 05:57.030
make sense.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.110
And then retrieving it.

05:58.140 --> 06:02.180
We can also create a dynamic way to retrieve that information.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.900
So now we've seen how we can retrieve information how we can create objects.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.340
So the next lesson I initiated can update some information within that object.

06:11.340 --> 06:12.780
So that's coming up.
