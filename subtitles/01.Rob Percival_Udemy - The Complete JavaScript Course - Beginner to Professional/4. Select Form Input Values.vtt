00:00.670 --> 00:07.410
The previous lesson we set up our h t M-L and collecting all of our inputs that we needed in order to

00:07.410 --> 00:14.510
make our calorie calculations to determine how much calories a person should be having per day.

00:14.520 --> 00:18.120
So we needed a number of factors and we've got all of the inputs ready.

00:18.120 --> 00:23.850
We also borrowed a couple of formulas from Wikipedia in order to make these calculations.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.880
So now we're ready to go with our Javascript.

00:26.880 --> 00:33.870
And the last lesson we left off with a challenge and that was to create an event listener for the entire

00:33.870 --> 00:34.490
forum.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.830
So we don't want to add event listeners to each input.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.800
We want to have it for the whole entire forum.

00:40.860 --> 00:46.230
So there's a number of ways that we've seen how we can add event listeners and I'm going to just do

00:46.290 --> 00:54.510
a simple one here or we're just doing document forms because remember if we go into the my form that

00:54.540 --> 01:01.470
basically means that we have access to it within document forms Kazumi that the document object works

01:01.470 --> 01:09.240
is if you have a form you actually get access to it by doing forms and then it's got an ID of my form

01:09.420 --> 01:11.370
and that's all I'm able to pick that up.

01:11.370 --> 01:18.840
So if I was to actually put this here within my Within my console you can see that you get all of this

01:18.840 --> 01:25.740
information here from the form and if you do something like Konsole dry and you output it there then

01:25.740 --> 01:30.990
you can dig deeper into that form and you can see that we've got all of our inputs are listed there

01:30.990 --> 01:32.130
by ID.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.380
We've got all of the child nodes.

01:34.470 --> 01:39.750
So again we can really dig into the dorm and get all of this information that we need just by simply

01:39.750 --> 01:42.750
referencing that main form container.

01:42.870 --> 01:49.520
So that's where we can go about it this way and save us quite a bit of code so that we don't have to

01:49.520 --> 01:54.690
access each input individually we can just access the form as a whole.

01:54.690 --> 02:00.850
Another thing to remember here is that we've got a bunch of inputs and all of these values are dynamic

02:01.060 --> 02:07.550
so we inevitably have to scan through all those values and pop them into the formula to make our calculation.

02:07.690 --> 02:11.230
So it's actually regardless of which one has changed.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.580
We need to get all of those inputs Every time to make our calculation.

02:15.610 --> 02:20.820
So we've got a number of ways where we can add event listener so we can do it this way where we do the

02:20.930 --> 02:21.830
event listener.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.100
So if you did it within this type of format.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.830
And then here you've got your function.

02:26.950 --> 02:31.090
So this would be the function that triggers off the change.

02:31.090 --> 02:37.470
So this would be we would could call it output calculation or whatever.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.270
So we'll just add that in there.

02:39.300 --> 02:45.810
So you could do it this way or the other way is that you could do document forms and you could do the

02:45.810 --> 02:47.370
on change.

02:47.400 --> 02:55.470
So this is the same thing so that adding that listener on change or the change of that listener.

02:55.500 --> 03:01.380
So just keeping in mind that for the older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 I add that listener

03:01.380 --> 03:03.390
doesn't always work properly.

03:03.480 --> 03:09.620
So we're going to just actually stick with the On Change and the output is going to be the same thing.

03:09.630 --> 03:16.040
We can link to a function which we're going to set up now so we can simply link it to a function.

03:16.050 --> 03:21.300
So either way that you've done it it's I it will work.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.350
So either way it's it's perfect.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.490
So now let's set up our function.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.360
So output calculator is the function.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.680
And we're going to actually we're not going to pass any of the arguments as we don't actually have any

03:36.680 --> 03:38.890
arguments to pass in here.

03:38.990 --> 03:45.050
And first of all it's always a good idea to try it out and just to make sure that everything is working

03:45.050 --> 03:45.870
properly.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.420
So do target or event target.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.530
So a list that target every time something changes.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.480
So let's refresh try it out.

03:56.500 --> 04:02.620
And now every time I click on any one of these inputs we can see that's firing off and it's triggering

04:02.620 --> 04:09.850
it off and we know that the target is actually picking it up and outputting whatever element actually

04:09.880 --> 04:10.720
triggered the event.

04:10.720 --> 04:17.500
So we're getting all of that information there so we know that everything is working as as needed and

04:17.530 --> 04:19.720
we're ready to go on to the next step.

04:19.750 --> 04:27.250
So the next step is to actually get some of these values out of our h tim L and I can actually set up

04:27.310 --> 04:29.380
a function within here.

04:29.380 --> 04:32.480
So it's going to be a function that's going to be sitting within the function.

04:32.590 --> 04:38.980
And this is the whole idea of if we don't need anything sitting outside of the function then if we're

04:38.980 --> 04:44.100
only using it within the function that we contain it within the function so we're going to set all of

04:44.100 --> 04:44.970
the variables.

04:44.970 --> 04:50.910
And we're going to have a function here that's actually going to allow us to return back the value that's

04:50.910 --> 04:52.850
contained within the input.

04:53.010 --> 04:56.300
So let's set that up and I'm going to just call it Dawk idea.

04:56.310 --> 04:59.680
So we're going to be passing through the document ID.

04:59.760 --> 05:04.380
We're going to be picking that up and we're going to be returning the value.

05:04.680 --> 05:13.730
So do a return and the return will be the values we'll just call it return our and then I'm going to

05:13.730 --> 05:16.840
go down here and I'm going to set up a variable.

05:16.850 --> 05:27.410
I'm going to call it age and this age value we're going to pull back by passing in the idea of age and

05:27.410 --> 05:33.710
we're going to pull back that information as a value for age and then we'll just console log whatever

05:33.710 --> 05:35.990
value of age is being returned.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.370
So there we go.

05:39.370 --> 05:50.960
So now what I want you to do is to pick up that document element that's being specified here within

05:51.050 --> 05:55.660
Dawk ID and return back the value that's contained within it.

05:56.630 --> 06:02.450
And keeping in mind that with iOS 6 we can pick up the values as arguments.

06:02.480 --> 06:11.270
So if we're only passing and one argument we can pick up the argument by doing arguments and square

06:11.270 --> 06:16.190
brackets zero so this will pick up that value of that first argument.

06:16.190 --> 06:24.290
So picking that information up use document Daut query selector and returned back the value that's contained

06:24.380 --> 06:27.780
within this input and I'll show you the solution coming up.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.270
So let's set that up here within the function.

06:32.270 --> 06:37.060
So let's do a let R and this is where we're going to use document.

06:37.380 --> 06:44.460
And this time we're you only use queery selector because queries selector allows us to make our selection

06:44.880 --> 06:50.830
and it treats it as if we were using the same way that we're using CSSA.

06:50.970 --> 06:57.990
So if we're using query select or we're passing over an ID number include the hash for the ID it will

06:57.990 --> 07:02.120
return back the element that's been selected.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.090
So let's try this out.

07:03.150 --> 07:04.570
Let's refresh.

07:04.740 --> 07:10.480
And every time we make a change now it should pull back each and we see that we've got the value there.

07:10.590 --> 07:13.290
And I did say that we want to return the value.

07:13.410 --> 07:18.180
So let's update this and we can do something like our value.

07:18.330 --> 07:22.670
And this should return back the value that's contained within age.

07:22.710 --> 07:30.630
See now it's 31 33 so every time we're making changes it is making that update if we go to 34 we see

07:30.630 --> 07:32.260
34 is being output

07:35.240 --> 07:41.270
so quickly looking at all of our inputs all of our inputs will work we can get weight we can get height

07:41.630 --> 07:43.880
we can get age we can get lifestyle.

07:43.940 --> 07:48.150
But when it comes to the radio buttons they're actually going to work a little bit differently.

07:48.170 --> 07:54.650
So if I was actually to return a value of the radio button and we can try it out within the console

07:54.650 --> 07:55.910
so let's clear that up.

07:55.940 --> 08:03.890
And if we do document query selector and because this one has an idea of if we do value we see that

08:03.890 --> 08:10.310
the value is on if we do f then the value is going to also be on.

08:10.340 --> 08:16.280
So it doesn't it doesn't matter if it's checked off or not even if it's checked off it's still going

08:16.280 --> 08:17.330
to be on.

08:17.330 --> 08:23.330
So this creates a problem here when we're actually trying to get back the value because if it's a radio

08:23.330 --> 08:30.120
button we can't simply do the query selector Plus the ID and do value.

08:30.230 --> 08:36.730
So this creates a problem and we need to create a formula here in order to differentiate those values.

08:36.740 --> 08:44.030
So what do I need to do now is to use the terror unary operator and set the value of our check to see

08:44.030 --> 08:53.200
if the value of our is equal to on and if it is then we're actually going to look for the element and

08:53.200 --> 08:56.260
we're going to check to see if it's actually checked.

08:56.260 --> 09:01.960
So if we do something like F and if we do checked we see that it's true.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.790
If I uncheck it and if I do the same statement we're going to see that.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.460
Now it's false.

09:08.460 --> 09:19.240
So using this what I want you to do is to return true or false within this value using terrine ary operator.

09:19.230 --> 09:23.060
So instead of our value update it.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.490
So it's returning back the check value.

09:25.540 --> 09:34.530
Or if it's not a value of on then go ahead and return back the the value of that element.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.530
And I'll show you the solution coming up.

09:38.610 --> 09:45.930
So the solution is our and I usually like for the ternary operators I like to use it in the rounded

09:45.930 --> 09:54.360
brackets so you don't have to send a check to see if our value is equal to on which we saw that both

09:54.360 --> 09:57.110
the radio buttons have a value of on.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.250
So doesn't matter if they're checked or not.

09:59.400 --> 10:07.140
So we see that if essentially it's a radio button and if it is there it take the value of our checked

10:08.280 --> 10:14.130
and otherwise we know that we want to return back the value of our.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.020
And I want to throw one more thing in here.

10:17.130 --> 10:24.810
So this is a good point to add in and convert it into a numeric value because as we saw earlier we know

10:24.810 --> 10:29.870
that those inputs are being returned back as strings and they're not going to work well when we added

10:29.910 --> 10:31.800
into our formula as strings.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.610
So it's better to convert it to a number.

10:33.750 --> 10:38.160
And in this way we know that we're returning back those numbers.

10:38.160 --> 10:44.490
So let's go ahead and refresh and let's make an update and we can see that we're returning back that

10:44.520 --> 10:45.810
as a number now.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.240
So this is a numeric value.

10:47.460 --> 10:55.580
And also let's quickly try that within Dawk ID so let's copy that in.

10:55.630 --> 10:59.880
And Doc ID and this time let's do am.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.330
So this is just to make sure that everything is working properly.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.990
So we see that it's false.

11:06.020 --> 11:08.790
If I click it and update it it goes back to true.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.030
So we know that we're able to pick that up.

11:11.180 --> 11:15.550
So the next part is to put all of these numbers together.

11:15.560 --> 11:22.970
All of these numbers into variables and then punch it into our formula here and then return that result

11:23.210 --> 11:26.540
and output it within an output area.

11:26.570 --> 11:28.780
So that's all coming up in the next lesson.

11:28.780 --> 11:36.620
And between the lessons what I want you to do now is to do the same thing that we did for age and pick

11:36.620 --> 11:43.160
up the weight pick up the lifestyle and then for here you're going to have to actually do a little bit

11:43.160 --> 11:49.560
of calculation because we know for every inch there's 12 inches in a foot.

11:49.730 --> 11:55.670
So we need to get the overall value in inches that we're going to be multiplying.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.670
So we've got height in inches here.

11:57.740 --> 12:01.010
So we need to get that height value in inches.

12:01.040 --> 12:08.710
So go ahead and add that and update it into a formula where we've got the age the lifestyle the weight

12:08.930 --> 12:15.050
and then the height is a total value of the inches that have been selected.

12:16.630 --> 12:20.500
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up in the next lesson.
