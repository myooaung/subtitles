00:00.590 --> 00:05.530
Welcome back in in the last lesson we left off where we were getting that event target and we needed

00:05.540 --> 00:07.660
to pick up that idea values.

00:07.670 --> 00:13.160
We need to check to see data set id and let's try that now.

00:13.190 --> 00:16.560
So whenever it gets clicked we either get false or true.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.300
So no if the answer is true or false.

00:19.370 --> 00:23.440
So that gives us the ability to track back what the answer was.

00:23.450 --> 00:32.670
I also want to place that answer value into the user answer array.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.740
So we know that we've got a number of different answers there.

00:36.810 --> 00:43.590
And this is where again we should pick up a way to track that index value.

00:43.710 --> 00:50.370
So I'm just going to set another one for inducts And let's set up instead of answer we're going to do

00:50.370 --> 00:51.360
X.

00:51.510 --> 00:59.310
So that way if we want to we can pick up the index value that they've selected and push that into that

00:59.430 --> 01:01.140
user answer array.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.070
So we actually will know what answer those users have selected.

01:06.380 --> 01:10.670
So next let's let's push that value into the array.

01:14.230 --> 01:20.320
So we want to place it in a specific spot in the array so maybe if they skip a question they want to

01:20.320 --> 01:21.440
come back.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.590
So we want to add whatever the page value is in the array.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.970
So sometimes we might set it blank or so on.

01:30.970 --> 01:36.610
So this is do it within this format and we're going to equal this value.

01:36.760 --> 01:43.030
And this is also in case they go back and they make a change so we can place that index value into the

01:43.030 --> 01:44.940
user answer array.

01:45.480 --> 01:52.660
So doing that now this gives us the ability to kind of track those answers and also whatever one we've

01:52.660 --> 01:53.310
selected.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.150
What I want to happen is I want to add an active class to it.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.720
So let's do that as well.

01:58.720 --> 02:05.380
We'll set up a class and we'll do background color on it so that we can distinguish what's been actually

02:05.380 --> 02:06.450
selected.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.360
So a background color of Alice blue.

02:10.370 --> 02:18.820
So now whenever we make our selection whenever that event listener gets added I want to update that

02:18.830 --> 02:20.420
class value.

02:20.420 --> 02:24.820
So when a clot toggle the class list of that particular item.

02:24.980 --> 02:31.290
So that data and this one is Clauss list.

02:31.310 --> 02:35.770
So this is the same as we saw before when we have the ability to kind of toggle it.

02:35.870 --> 02:40.890
So it gets clicked we toggle it back and forth.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.980
And this one is actually a method.

02:44.110 --> 02:48.800
So we're going to add active and and and remove active.

02:48.940 --> 02:54.610
And one of the problems here is that if we add the active we can actually select multiple And so we

02:54.610 --> 02:56.320
don't want that to happen.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.830
So we actually need to remove that active from the other.

03:00.830 --> 03:05.670
The other siblings that might have that same active class.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.500
So we have a couple options here.

03:07.510 --> 03:14.920
And what we can do is we can remove all of those classes from all of them and we know that they all

03:14.920 --> 03:17.390
contained within that output one.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.180
And they're all going to be children of output 1.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.080
So we need a way to remove them.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.410
So this is where we need to loop through.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.400
So we could add or we could toggle.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.900
So it actually doesn't matter because what I want to do is I actually want to remove them so I don't

03:31.900 --> 03:33.570
want it actually to toggle.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.120
I want to remove it from all the other ones.

03:36.190 --> 03:37.960
So that's where we're going to stick with.

03:38.160 --> 03:46.180
So let's set up a loop and we're going to loop through all of the available children that are within

03:46.270 --> 03:49.850
output or because we've clicked.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.380
We've used output as the listener.

03:52.390 --> 03:57.870
That means that that content is actually sitting in this.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.460
So we're going to loop through this.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.460
Children length.

04:04.550 --> 04:11.780
So while X is less than this children length let's increment X and from here let's do output or.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.080
This actually doesn't matter.

04:14.290 --> 04:21.800
This children we're referring to that same element and we need to identify the elements and it's class

04:21.800 --> 04:29.630
list and let's remove it active from the classless to move out the class active.

04:30.110 --> 04:33.280
And then we can go out and add it down here so let's try that out.

04:33.290 --> 04:39.590
So now we should only have one active one and not active one gets lit up.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.430
So that means we're ready to move on to the next part.

04:43.430 --> 04:48.720
And if we go to use or answer we're actually dropping that information here.

04:48.800 --> 04:54.650
Whatever was selected we still need to add in to that particular element.

04:54.650 --> 04:59.380
So if that one is selected let's do a user answer we see that's one.

04:59.420 --> 05:08.610
So we're able to show which value was selected and we can also transfer this into a number format.

05:08.770 --> 05:14.170
So maybe that will work better if we just have a number of values there because they're represented

05:14.200 --> 05:20.300
as numbers here as well so we know which one is correct within that array.

05:20.410 --> 05:25.420
So that's where we can do the comparison at the end when we do our summary.

05:25.480 --> 05:31.240
So we're ready to add in some buttons at the bottom so the users can move on to the next question if

05:31.240 --> 05:32.320
they want.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.620
So let's add those in.

05:33.640 --> 05:40.780
So this is just going to be regular default see SS and we'll have two buttons maybe at the bottom where

05:40.780 --> 05:43.600
we've got a div.

05:43.950 --> 05:45.800
So this will be four buttons.

05:45.810 --> 05:53.160
We don't actually need to give it a name and we'll have the two input types would have type button and

05:53.230 --> 05:55.300
the first button is going to be

06:00.270 --> 06:09.390
type button and we'll give it an ID of next and we'll give it a value of next as well so the user can

06:09.390 --> 06:20.750
see that this is the next one and we're going to also do one for previous.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.510
So it's out in one for previous ones.

06:23.520 --> 06:30.000
Our next button this is our previous button and we'll just do previous as well.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.500
So let's refresh.

06:31.530 --> 06:32.100
So there we go.

06:32.100 --> 06:38.780
We've got buttons we're able to make our selection on the quiz and we can hit next.

06:38.950 --> 06:44.710
So next we need to do it we need to add an event listener to the next button so that we can move on

06:44.740 --> 06:48.840
to the next question and represent the next question for the user.

06:48.870 --> 06:52.040
I can't get rid of this console logs here we don't need them anymore.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.620
And let's set up into that listener for that

06:58.760 --> 07:01.010
and we'll set up both of those event listeners.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.190
So this is where our listeners will sit.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.060
So let's

07:08.010 --> 07:19.140
do document get element by id and first will do next and we're going to just simply add the listener

07:19.140 --> 07:19.650
to it.

07:19.650 --> 07:25.470
So the listener is going to be on click and it fire off this function here.

07:25.620 --> 07:31.950
So we're going to do an anonymous function and that function is actually going to call two to the next

07:31.950 --> 07:32.580
part of it.

07:32.610 --> 07:37.570
So we're we're actually going to load through and we're going to send over information into it.

07:37.650 --> 07:43.760
So we've got our build a page and we need to create a function in order to move through the pages.

07:45.110 --> 07:53.210
So I wanted to move but I want to pass in the value of page and we're going to do page plus one is where

07:53.210 --> 07:54.050
we're going to move to

07:56.940 --> 07:58.830
and let me clean that up a bit.

07:59.100 --> 08:05.370
And this one over here we can do a quick one for previous

08:08.180 --> 08:13.820
So this will be for the previous one and we're going to do page minus one and we're going to still use

08:13.820 --> 08:15.140
that function move.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.260
So let's go out and create that function.

08:17.660 --> 08:23.170
And this is going to allow the user to move through the different quizzes.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.520
And this is where we also need to apply some logic.

08:25.670 --> 08:33.230
But for now let's go ahead and we're going to just to build a page and we need to apply some logic to

08:33.230 --> 08:38.990
make sure that the user hasn't finished or that they're not going to a page that doesn't exist and so

08:38.990 --> 08:39.440
on.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.630
So let's let's just do

08:48.130 --> 08:53.790
let's do page equals whatever value is passed into a.

08:54.050 --> 08:57.280
So now we're able to move next and previous.

08:57.350 --> 09:00.580
And if we go over we see we get some errors.

09:00.590 --> 09:02.140
So we have to account for that.

09:02.150 --> 09:07.010
And another thing that we need to account for is now that we're able to make these selections and set

09:07.010 --> 09:08.990
them as active when we go back.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.770
They're no longer set to active.

09:10.910 --> 09:17.370
So we need to make sure that we can account for all of this and if there's no more content in the page

09:17.370 --> 09:24.030
to be built that this is where the summary comes up and that we also can't go previous to pages that

09:24.030 --> 09:24.980
don't exist.

09:25.110 --> 09:30.630
So all of this we need to take care of in the upcoming lesson and what I want you to do now take the

09:30.630 --> 09:37.160
source code add the functionality in as you can and Oshi the solution coming up in the next lesson.
