00:00.560 --> 00:04.620
Work come back in this lesson we're going to look at the location object.

00:04.710 --> 00:10.290
So I know we've gone through quite a few different objects and you don't have to memorize every bit

00:10.290 --> 00:11.390
of functionality.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.010
Just be aware that they are there.

00:13.050 --> 00:16.960
And if you do need to make use of them within your code you know where to go.

00:17.130 --> 00:25.760
So let's go ahead and create a button and this one is just going to be a button button type and I'm

00:25.790 --> 00:34.730
going to do the On Click event handler and we're just going to create one that's called Go you are l.

00:34.770 --> 00:42.200
So basically whenever this gets clicked then we're going to send the user to another web page.

00:42.270 --> 00:45.510
Go to a u r l.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.360
So that's going to be the the button value.

00:50.360 --> 00:58.150
So now let's create our functions so we need a function now called GO YOU ARE ALL SO function

01:00.990 --> 01:02.710
so go you are l.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.650
And then within this function what we're going to do is we're going to grab

01:10.990 --> 01:12.740
a value or variable.

01:12.770 --> 01:19.700
So let's let's set that up here above that and we'll do another input so the user can actually type

01:20.210 --> 01:25.340
and add in what type of or what you or L they want to visit.

01:25.340 --> 01:30.950
So it give it an idea of or L and then also give it a name.

01:31.010 --> 01:38.310
You are all and I'm going to give it a default value so we're going to give it a value of HTP for its

01:38.320 --> 01:46.870
life for its slash and that will be Google dot com and let's close that one off.

01:46.870 --> 01:51.850
So now what I want to do is I want to grab that value from there.

01:51.850 --> 02:00.610
So it's too variable you are l and documents we know how to grab that value get element by id the element

02:00.610 --> 02:05.380
that we're grabbing is you are you are all.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.150
And let's make sure we pick up the value.

02:08.230 --> 02:15.130
So get you your get element by ID you IRL grab the value and then this is where the magic happens.

02:15.130 --> 02:23.710
We're going to do Windows location and we're going to grab that value and we're going to simply equal

02:23.710 --> 02:25.270
it to you or else.

02:25.480 --> 02:32.680
So let's see let's try the suits and go and refreshed the page and go to the URL and we can see that

02:32.770 --> 02:37.540
this way we're able to actually go to the URL that we've specified

02:40.580 --> 02:41.920
within that value

02:48.780 --> 02:52.190
and I'll just go back to the page there.

02:52.190 --> 02:57.560
So if I wanted to change this to Facebook or something else I can always go to that.

02:57.570 --> 03:01.730
You are Elle and we can see that it doesn't matter what we put in there.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.660
We always end up at the you are l that's been specified within their.

03:07.680 --> 03:16.470
So what I want you to do now is open up your editor and create a function that you can click and pass

03:16.560 --> 03:20.600
the value that you want within the function's argument.

03:20.790 --> 03:27.820
So pick it up as a parameter within the function and then redirect the page to the specified parameter.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.890
So create another input button and go to your favorite Web site.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.860
Add that into the go to you are l.

03:35.910 --> 03:41.670
Make a different function in order to accommodate that and I'll show you the solution coming up.

03:41.700 --> 03:47.040
So we had an opportunity to try that out and we do need to create a separate function for this.

03:47.130 --> 03:49.630
So I'm going to duplicate it and I'm going to go go.

03:49.650 --> 03:50.620
You are l.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.230
And then within here.

03:52.230 --> 04:00.350
So this is where we're expecting our primers so HTP forward slash for it's launched W W W and here let's

04:00.350 --> 04:03.840
enter in a web site.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.540
So whatever your favorite Web site is enter that in over there.

04:07.590 --> 04:14.640
And now let's create the function to go to that you or else it's go to your URL to we're taking in the

04:14.640 --> 04:21.230
parameter of the are L and just simply delete that.

04:21.230 --> 04:25.560
Now it can go and we can refresh it and we should say go to

04:28.990 --> 04:33.530
my favorite you are ill.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.290
So go back refreshed again.

04:36.340 --> 04:40.750
So we've got one that can go to your Ehle whatever value we've entered in here.

04:40.810 --> 04:48.790
And then another one that simply goes to our favorite you are all so I want to also introduce you to

04:48.880 --> 04:54.280
another way to grab information from our from our content.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.000
And this is going deeper into what the Dom can do.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.400
So give your wrap your inputs with a form and you can call the form whatever you want to call it.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.450
So I'm going to just call it my foreign and then close it off.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.720
So make sure that you wrap all of your inputs inside of that form.

05:14.580 --> 05:22.530
And now what I want to do is I actually want to when we click a button so I want to add one more button

05:22.530 --> 05:32.510
here and what this one is going to do is this is going to output the value that's contained within here.

05:32.530 --> 05:35.620
So we're not going to use that document get element by ID.

05:35.650 --> 05:41.080
We're going to go directly into the dorm because all of this information now that we've got a form that's

05:41.080 --> 05:47.290
wrapping all these inputs we can actually identify this form by its name that we've given it and we

05:47.290 --> 05:49.840
can grab information that's contained within the form.

05:49.990 --> 05:56.550
So we don't have to go through the document get element by id and we can go directly to get that information.

05:56.560 --> 06:08.890
So let's call my value and this one is just going to simply take whatever value is here and it's going

06:08.890 --> 06:11.600
to rate it here within that wrapper area.

06:11.620 --> 06:14.350
So let's let's set that up.

06:14.680 --> 06:21.580
So function and this one's called my value and we are going to be making use more use of this later

06:21.580 --> 06:22.840
on as well.

06:22.840 --> 06:30.460
So I just want to show you this because it's a really interesting way to handle and get values from

06:30.520 --> 06:34.420
your web page so get document by ID.

06:34.420 --> 06:39.000
So this one we still need to do because we're not wrapped within the form and so on.

06:39.010 --> 06:43.530
So wrapper and that's in our age to a mouse we're not going to change the way we do that.

06:43.750 --> 06:50.140
But this time what we're going to do is we're actually going to grab the values we're going to use document

06:50.530 --> 06:52.440
and we're going to traverse through the door.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.910
So we're not going to do get element by ID.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.790
And we did see earlier that all of the elements within your web page are actually located within the

07:00.790 --> 07:02.200
document object.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.700
So all of these are already sitting in the document object.

07:05.740 --> 07:10.390
And the reason we're using get element by ID is because we're just simply selecting it.

07:10.450 --> 07:17.500
But we can also traverse through the dawn basically go down the layers the tree structure until we actually

07:17.500 --> 07:20.020
identify and find our value.

07:20.020 --> 07:27.200
So we're going to select within the document we're going to find the one named my form within my form.

07:27.220 --> 07:35.020
We've got one named are old and then we've got one that has that we want to get the value of that you

07:35.020 --> 07:37.920
are all sort going through a bunch of notes here.

07:37.960 --> 07:44.170
We're going to the my form that we're grabbing the one that's named you are all within my form and then

07:44.260 --> 07:48.110
we're grabbing the value from that particular node.

07:48.310 --> 07:51.540
So let's save that and refreshed the page.

07:51.580 --> 07:57.560
And so now when I hit value we're actually grabbing the value that's contained within this form.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.120
And if we update it.

07:59.320 --> 08:04.660
And now you are well obviously won't work but you can see that as I hit the value we can always grab

08:04.660 --> 08:07.710
the current value that's sitting within that form value.

08:07.870 --> 08:11.530
And this this is actually may be a shorter way.

08:11.590 --> 08:16.650
It all depends on what you're trying to do instead of going through and grabbing at it.

08:16.690 --> 08:22.360
In this type of format doing a selector we actually know where it's located and we can go directly into

08:22.360 --> 08:25.910
it and grab that information.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.570
So go ahead and try it for yourself.

08:28.570 --> 08:35.260
Wrap all those inputs around with the form and then you can go ahead and you can get some values from

08:35.260 --> 08:45.230
that and so on and try it for yourself creates an input and then simply another button where you can

08:45.230 --> 08:51.560
click at and it can update the value and grab that value from the input without using Document get element

08:51.560 --> 08:52.160
by ID.
