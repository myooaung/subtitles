00:00.950 --> 00:07.800
Welcome back and in this lesson we're going to show you how you can set classes to various elements.

00:07.870 --> 00:12.550
So this is going to be different than just applying the styling because this gives us the ability to

00:12.550 --> 00:15.340
set an entire class to an element.

00:15.340 --> 00:24.200
So if I've got something like box and I've got my background color here and lets out a background color

00:25.760 --> 00:28.620
and also I have y font size.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.920
So this one.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.660
Let's make this one point five.

00:32.870 --> 00:37.790
So it's really going to be big and we'll do color or color will be white.

00:38.030 --> 00:43.610
So you get the idea that there's a number of different options that we can set up here and we can have

00:43.610 --> 00:49.790
a number of different classes so we can do another one where maybe this one can be Box number two.

00:49.790 --> 00:53.030
So this can be Box number one box number two.

00:53.180 --> 01:01.470
And we're going to apply these styles these various styles various classes to the elements.

01:01.580 --> 01:06.660
So let's do this one red and this one will be really really small.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.450
And let's update the font color to be something like this.

01:11.450 --> 01:11.990
So there we go.

01:12.020 --> 01:18.920
We've got two different options and now we need some HVM elements so let's create some divs and we're

01:18.920 --> 01:21.230
just going to give it an ID.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.020
So we'll call this one one

01:25.530 --> 01:30.950
and duplicate this will in some text in here.

01:31.180 --> 01:36.360
Baulks one and we'll duplicate it.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.040
So have box too.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.520
So this one will be too.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.790
We can do any number of boxes as well.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.010
So box two and let's do one more.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.840
So we've had three boxes that we can apply this to.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.620
So Box number three.

01:51.620 --> 01:58.160
So let's go and save that.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.730
So now another thing that we should do is we need to apply some styling.

02:02.900 --> 02:09.630
So one two and three.

02:09.710 --> 02:15.180
So let's do with 100 picks.

02:16.370 --> 02:25.870
Height of 100 picks and we'll do a display so display and we'll do inline block again.

02:28.450 --> 02:29.710
So let's see what this looks like.

02:29.710 --> 02:35.640
Go back out and we should also put a border around so we can actually distinguish between the boxes.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.350
So it's out in that border.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.330
So go back out and refresh it again.

02:42.460 --> 02:42.940
So there we go.

02:42.940 --> 02:50.710
So we've got our three boxes and we're all ready to go to apply and move some of these classes around.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.880
So the challenge is now is to make these boxes clickable.

02:56.010 --> 03:01.530
And then what we're going to do within when the box actually gets clicked then we're going to apply

03:01.740 --> 03:05.930
one of the styles to it so we can do a box one or a box too.

03:05.970 --> 03:09.180
So go ahead and make these boxes clickable.

03:09.290 --> 03:13.530
And of course we've looked at a number of ways of making those selections.

03:13.590 --> 03:21.330
So it's up to you whatever you want to do to make these boxes selectable and update your code so that

03:21.330 --> 03:22.350
you can click these.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.690
And then that will prepare us to be able apply the styling to those boxes as they get clicked and we're

03:27.690 --> 03:29.540
going to apply the classes.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.350
We're not going to do any styling that we're going to be applying.

03:32.700 --> 03:37.520
So go ahead and set that up within your source code and I'll show you the solution coming up.

03:40.120 --> 03:46.810
So I want what I want it to do is I want to set these up and I'm going to make these clickable.

03:46.810 --> 03:51.390
So they're going to be clickable boxes and we need to apply a class to it.

03:51.430 --> 03:58.480
So we're going to call it just my class and I'm going to copy and paste this out as I only to use the

03:58.480 --> 04:05.470
class in order to select these elements in case I expand my age to male and add even more divs or if

04:05.470 --> 04:06.710
I'm doing anything else.

04:06.790 --> 04:12.560
So it's always a good idea to make it flexible enough and that's why I usually like to use classes.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.960
So let's grab all of those elements.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.740
So we're going to do well and we're going to grab them so document.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.680
And again how you grab them is up to you so you can do get element bought by id class name if you want.

04:26.680 --> 04:32.650
So I'm going to do Querrey select are all so very select are all.

04:32.680 --> 04:39.040
And within here I just need to specify that brand new class that I added in so that way I can grab all

04:39.040 --> 04:44.080
of those elements and the objective was to make all of these clickable.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.670
And we would take some type of action when we clicked the button.

04:47.860 --> 04:50.220
So for this we need to set up a for loop.

04:50.260 --> 04:56.430
So let's set up our for loop and this is something that we've done many times before.

04:56.530 --> 05:04.420
So while the length of hell is while X is less than the length of L and let's increment X so that we

05:04.420 --> 05:06.250
can create our proper loop.

05:06.280 --> 05:11.560
So we're just going to loop through all the available elements and then we're going to add in that click

05:11.560 --> 05:12.030
event.

05:12.040 --> 05:20.330
So that's And we're going to do on click and when it's on clicked then we're going to fire off a function.

05:20.380 --> 05:24.070
This is an anonymous function that's going to set within this click event.

05:24.070 --> 05:29.050
And what we want to do is for now let's just add in

05:31.760 --> 05:34.310
our ability to grab those elements.

05:34.370 --> 05:36.180
So there's a number of ways we can do this.

05:36.200 --> 05:43.550
We can do event target because we automatically get an event being passed or we can select this.

05:43.550 --> 05:47.400
So basically what this does is it can console log that out.

05:47.630 --> 05:53.750
And so now whenever it gets clicked this and we've looked at this before as well.

05:53.810 --> 05:59.210
So we see that when we click it we're picking up the element that fired this off so we're able to be

05:59.270 --> 06:05.210
really specific and select that particular element and make some type of action.

06:05.210 --> 06:12.620
So now we've got all of these elements they're clickable and now the next step is in order to do something

06:12.620 --> 06:15.190
with this let's apply some classes to it.

06:15.200 --> 06:21.410
So basically when this actually gets clicked I want to set a class so let's do

06:25.390 --> 06:27.950
and for here we can use this.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.320
So let's do this.

06:29.320 --> 06:36.910
So we're grabbing that object that's been clicked and what's do class list.

06:36.940 --> 06:39.400
So this is the number of classes.

06:39.520 --> 06:45.940
So this is well this is an array of different classes that are currently on this element and we have

06:45.940 --> 06:49.870
the ability to actually toggle a specific class.

06:49.870 --> 06:50.710
That's what we want to do.

06:50.710 --> 06:55.750
We want to toggle a class and we want to toggle the class box one.

06:55.780 --> 07:01.600
So basically what's going to happen here when it gets clicked it's going to add that class when it gets

07:01.600 --> 07:02.320
clicked again.

07:02.350 --> 07:06.090
It's going to remove that class.

07:06.190 --> 07:12.910
So we see that we've got the ability to add and remove classes in their entirety from various elements

07:12.910 --> 07:15.600
that we've got within our page.

07:15.620 --> 07:20.120
So let's open up the console and we're going to also see what's available to us.

07:20.150 --> 07:29.180
So we've got the object L So let's grab one of the elements within that object.

07:29.260 --> 07:38.050
So we've got all one and let's output and see what the class list is that's available within this.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.310
So we've got class list

07:46.040 --> 07:47.640
and we see that currently.

07:47.660 --> 07:49.810
This one has two classes.

07:49.940 --> 07:57.320
So it's got my class and Box 1 and so all we're doing is that we're toggling that available class list.

07:57.470 --> 08:01.000
So we see that we've got a number of different options here as well.

08:01.100 --> 08:04.510
So we can check to see if it contains a class.

08:04.550 --> 08:12.170
So if we want to see if Box 1 is in there we can do this or we could do Box 1 and we can see that this

08:12.170 --> 08:12.910
is true.

08:13.190 --> 08:19.340
And if we did something like Box 2 then we can see that that is false.

08:19.340 --> 08:25.340
So this actually provides us a number of built in methods that are already available within that class

08:25.340 --> 08:25.930
list.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.140
We're able to actually loop through all the different ones we can do for each.

08:30.230 --> 08:36.340
So that's built in we've got a length we can remove out a class and we can add a class to it.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.240
So if we wanted to add a class we can do odd

08:42.760 --> 08:45.850
and this time let's add another class to that.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.390
So do box too.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.360
Adding it to it.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.220
So now we see that we're able to add blocks to this one.

08:53.230 --> 08:59.380
So now if we do again the class list and we list all of the classes that are available there we've got

08:59.380 --> 09:01.760
my class box one box two.

09:01.810 --> 09:07.440
And if we want to remove one we can do remove and selecting that box one.

09:07.450 --> 09:15.070
So I want to completely remove that one from the class list so removing it and going back and listing

09:15.070 --> 09:23.060
out the class list again we see that now we've effectively been able to move it from box to.

09:23.150 --> 09:31.670
So for this upcoming challenge what I want you to do is have one class of active so the active class

09:32.750 --> 09:36.570
needs to be the one and we're going to set a background color to that one.

09:36.590 --> 09:41.600
So this one is going to have a background color of yellow So this is going to really stand out.

09:41.780 --> 09:49.310
So I want you to do is add active but I also want to remove it from the other boxes so we can add active

09:49.370 --> 09:52.430
and remove it from the other boxes.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.840
So take a minute and a pause the video and then try it for yourself.

09:57.880 --> 10:05.080
And remember what we're doing is we're using the remove and the ad and we're removing it active and

10:05.080 --> 10:08.620
we're adding active to the current one that's selected.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.430
So we're not toggling it anymore.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.920
We're just adding it and removing it.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.630
So pause the video and I'll show you the solution.

10:15.640 --> 10:23.120
Coming up so we can use the on click as well so we don't have to make any changes to there so I'm going

10:23.120 --> 10:25.520
to comment out that toggle option.

10:25.550 --> 10:28.870
And we're going to we're going to get rid of the cons. this.

10:28.910 --> 10:36.140
So what we want to do is we want to add active to it and we want to remove active from the remaining

10:36.170 --> 10:37.270
boxes.

10:37.310 --> 10:41.300
So let's create a function and this function what this one will do.

10:41.330 --> 10:44.840
This will allow us to set and remove classes.

10:44.870 --> 10:53.300
So let's set this one up where or call it up update class and this will give us the ability to update

10:53.300 --> 10:56.100
classes on a number of elements.

10:56.150 --> 11:00.380
So we want to actually pass that element value in.

11:00.500 --> 11:06.900
So depending on which element it is and if we've got it within e l so we can use that as well.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.830
So I just call that element.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.740
So just use E for short.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.030
So this is the element.

11:12.200 --> 11:20.690
And next we want to have a class name so we can easily remove all of the classes we can loop through

11:20.690 --> 11:24.800
it and run one function and remove out all of the active classes.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.770
So it's pass the class name as C..

11:27.800 --> 11:30.350
And then lastly what we want to do.

11:30.350 --> 11:34.290
So either we want to remove it or add it to all of the boxes.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.720
So let's call this one a for action.

11:37.730 --> 11:42.970
So next let's loop through the values that get passed within this function.

11:43.160 --> 11:52.670
So we've got variable x starting at zero and we know that we're passing through the array object under

11:52.670 --> 11:56.450
the variable so that the length

12:00.420 --> 12:04.450
and now we just need to increment x.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.810
So now let's loop through this.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.890
So we've got all of these variables here.

12:09.930 --> 12:17.550
So we're passing through E and we're grabbing the current one so that when we e x and let's do class

12:17.640 --> 12:18.960
list.

12:19.080 --> 12:23.710
So we're getting all of that class list object information.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.510
And next we need to pass and what we want to do.

12:26.510 --> 12:33.880
So this is our action that we want to take and then next we need to pass in and utilize the class.

12:33.950 --> 12:41.660
So the class was C so this was the class name that we want to add or remove.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.850
So let's try this function out.

12:43.970 --> 12:49.360
And first of all let's add an octave on one of these elements.

12:49.460 --> 12:53.030
So set this one to be active by default.

12:53.030 --> 12:59.600
And what I want to do is I want to when we come in here I want to add octave to the one that was clicked

12:59.840 --> 13:02.460
but I want to remove it from the rest of them.

13:02.690 --> 13:11.000
So let's do a condition here and we're going to check to see if this particular value already contains

13:11.060 --> 13:15.800
the value active and if it does then we'll just leave it as is.

13:15.800 --> 13:23.190
So let's see this class list so use the class list object.

13:23.240 --> 13:30.260
And what we saw before in the console where we've got contains active and if it's already there then

13:30.320 --> 13:36.550
we don't need to do anything else here that we know that if this is true then we can leave it.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.950
And if it's not true then we know we need to add active.

13:39.950 --> 13:42.520
So let's do a negative there.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.930
And basically now we know that we need to add that class to it.

13:47.090 --> 13:50.710
So let's update this one and we're going to add the class to it.

13:52.050 --> 13:58.440
So using this class list we wanted to add the class.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.570
And then what class we wanted to add.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.660
So just like we had done earlier in the console.

14:05.680 --> 14:12.880
So we need to do the rounded brackets and then within here we can specify what we want to add and we

14:12.880 --> 14:15.650
want to add in the class of active.

14:16.030 --> 14:18.490
So this is only if it already doesn't exist.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.730
We can't add that in.

14:19.900 --> 14:26.440
Otherwise we want to remove it and just in case we've got it sitting in any of the other ones we want

14:26.440 --> 14:30.860
to simply remove it from all the other functions.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.070
So let's go back and try to save it and refresh it.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.400
So now when I click on them they're all becoming active.

14:37.440 --> 14:43.380
So what I ultimately want to do whenever the click gets initiated I want to remove the active from all

14:43.380 --> 14:44.010
of them.

14:44.010 --> 14:48.960
Now I know that where we're already checking to see here if it's already active so I'm going to leave

14:48.960 --> 14:55.890
that in place but I want to run through this function where we've just created and this one will allow

14:55.890 --> 14:58.860
us to actually remove out that element.

14:58.860 --> 15:05.680
So we know we've got the elements within E-L object and the class that we want to remove.

15:05.910 --> 15:08.360
So we're going to pass those in.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.890
So the class that we want to remove is going to be active.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.730
So let's add that in here.

15:15.120 --> 15:21.610
And lastly the action that we want to take we want to remove.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.150
So let's try that eight's go back and refresh it.

15:25.260 --> 15:30.520
So now whenever I click I'm actually able to toggle between the few between them.

15:30.660 --> 15:35.290
And also let's try out our function now within our console

15:38.470 --> 15:43.160
and this is the nice thing when you set up functions that you can actually make use of them within your

15:43.160 --> 15:44.410
console.

15:44.420 --> 15:50.170
So let's do all and we're going to add let's do something different.

15:50.170 --> 15:56.100
Let's box 1 and let's add box 1 to all the elements.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.960
So it's as easy as that to add baulks one class to all of them.

15:59.970 --> 16:05.390
So now if I go into any one of them I can see that it's been added and if I want to remove them out

16:06.060 --> 16:12.020
I can just pass within this function and I can remove them all out and bring them back to the default.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.760
So that's all we're doing over here.

16:13.770 --> 16:20.410
We're simply removing them and we're adding them and so trying it out for yourself and also try building

16:20.410 --> 16:27.250
out some functions that provide you some added benefits and then try those functions within your console.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.840
So the next lesson we're going to be looking at this and I'm going to show you how what we can take

16:31.840 --> 16:37.030
what we've learned within this lesson and build an accordion so an accordion basically you can click

16:37.090 --> 16:41.040
on a heading and it opens up content underneath and I'll show you how to do that.

16:41.050 --> 16:41.580
Coming up.
