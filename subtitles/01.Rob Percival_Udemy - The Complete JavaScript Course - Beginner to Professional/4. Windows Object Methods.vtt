00:00.680 --> 00:05.750
Work back and in this lesson we're going to be looking at even more that we can do within the window

00:05.750 --> 00:06.750
as object.

00:06.780 --> 00:14.820
So we saw earlier that we can add an unclick so we can use functions within there as well so we can

00:14.820 --> 00:20.100
also add in built in methods that are already available within the Windows object.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.100
So I can do something like print.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.640
So now when I go back and refresh it and I'm just going to read page 1 so to avoid any type of confusion

00:30.060 --> 00:33.960
just to make sure that I'm actually on the page that I am updating the code in.

00:34.180 --> 00:37.160
So I am on index and now instead of back.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.490
Actually we should update this to say print because this is no longer going to take us back.

00:41.490 --> 00:43.910
So one more time let's refresh the page.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.550
Let's save it and go back refreshed the page so we can actually send this to a printer if we want it

00:50.550 --> 00:51.120
to.

00:51.420 --> 00:58.650
So this is another built in object and we already saw that we had prompt so prompt was one that we were

00:58.710 --> 01:04.110
working with before and that gave us the ability to type in a question.

01:04.260 --> 01:12.600
And one thing that I do want to make note of here is that see see what's happening here that this statement

01:12.600 --> 01:18.870
here within the javascript the prompt it's not looking right and that's because the on click always

01:18.870 --> 01:21.310
requires quotes around it.

01:21.330 --> 01:29.340
So if you're creating javascript in here that also requires quotes mixture that you single code and

01:29.400 --> 01:34.420
that or that you break out of break out of the courts.

01:34.570 --> 01:44.030
So now if I actually do this and if I go back at it and if I refresh the page so try that again and

01:44.030 --> 01:52.310
instead set print or I should update this to say prompt so save it and let's go back and refresh the

01:52.310 --> 01:52.960
page.

01:52.970 --> 01:56.690
So now it'll save prompt and we see we get that hello world.

01:56.690 --> 02:03.560
So be always mindful of the fact if you're using the on click attribute that you do need to be careful

02:03.620 --> 02:04.570
with the quotes.

02:04.610 --> 02:07.410
So make sure that you escape the quotes properly.

02:07.430 --> 02:13.490
So if you're using doubles to wrap the statement then make sure that you're using singles inside of

02:13.490 --> 02:15.980
it as well and it does get tricky.

02:15.980 --> 02:19.250
So this is one thing to always watch out for.

02:19.370 --> 02:24.220
So we don't want you to do now is paused the video and try this for yourself.

02:24.350 --> 02:27.010
Create a few inputs here.

02:27.050 --> 02:31.630
So have a button to prompt it to alert and say hello world.

02:31.790 --> 02:39.150
So one button to pop up an alert and the other button to print the content of the window.

02:39.350 --> 02:47.060
And within your output here within the alert be careful of escaping the quotes properly.

02:47.090 --> 02:53.480
So make sure that you're not double and single so make sure that those are proper and try it for yourself

02:53.740 --> 03:00.500
and to make things even more interesting say something like Hello worlds what the apostrophe s just

03:00.500 --> 03:01.200
like that.

03:01.370 --> 03:04.700
And do that without actually breaking out of the quotes.

03:05.560 --> 03:12.690
And as we saw earlier the way to do that is to escape the quotes by doing the backslash saving it.

03:12.790 --> 03:25.560
And now if I change this to an alert and update this to say alert I was well so go into the page refresh

03:25.550 --> 03:28.920
it hit the alert and you can see that you can have hello world.

03:29.020 --> 03:36.010
So you have that apostrophe s within your within your string value.

03:36.010 --> 03:41.440
So do try to it for yourself create the alert create the print window and the next lesson we're going

03:41.440 --> 03:42.730
to look at timeouts.
