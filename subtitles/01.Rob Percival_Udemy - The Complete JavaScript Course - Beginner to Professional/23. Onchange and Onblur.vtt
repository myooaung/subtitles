00:00.720 --> 00:05.070
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at some more event handlers.

00:05.130 --> 00:11.880
We're going to look at on blur on change and a few other ones so we do need to have a form because some

00:11.880 --> 00:18.780
of these event handlers they only work on specific types of elements such as on change on blur.

00:19.050 --> 00:24.420
Some of these elements you can't change and the forms are ideal because you can change the content within

00:24.420 --> 00:25.090
a form.

00:25.290 --> 00:33.780
So now we've got this one here where we've got the name and let's in on change.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.120
So you see that we are.

00:35.220 --> 00:39.530
We also have a whole bunch of different ones available to us as well.

00:39.540 --> 00:46.620
So let's first of all let's take care of on change here and we want a particular function to fire off

00:46.620 --> 00:48.370
every time it gets changed.

00:48.430 --> 00:53.040
So we'll call it see fun.

00:53.580 --> 01:00.770
So this is what's going to get fired off when we change the contents of that particular element.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.480
So let's go back into here and we'll do see fun sort of create and elements in order to pick that up

01:08.910 --> 01:16.690
and maybe what we'll do is we'll copy a little bit of the code there from below to save us some trouble.

01:16.860 --> 01:24.220
And let's do the event handler and also we can do the parent name.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.070
So maybe

01:28.420 --> 01:31.980
maybe instead of welcome changed too.

01:32.230 --> 01:36.720
And this one we actually have the value so we don't need to go to the parent.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.450
We can simply get the value out of it.

01:40.450 --> 01:44.020
So however we want to do it we can do value like that.

01:44.110 --> 01:46.290
So that way we don't have to traverse anymore.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.180
So let's give it a shot and try it out.

01:49.180 --> 01:55.990
So now whenever I change anything and I click off of it so notice the onchange fires when I click off

01:55.990 --> 01:58.050
of that particular element.

01:58.060 --> 02:00.190
So this one as well.

02:00.610 --> 02:01.810
Let's fire off.

02:01.930 --> 02:11.440
And what I want to do is I actually want you to be able to tell if we fired off number one or number

02:11.440 --> 02:12.220
two.

02:12.350 --> 02:19.110
And in the message say first name changed or last name changed.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.270
So go ahead.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.290
Pause the video and try it out.

02:23.330 --> 02:28.770
So the thing is you're using the same function here on the onchange.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.760
So you need a conditional statement to tell whether the name is the one or two.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.720
And then depending on what the name is you're going to fire off a different type of message.

02:40.160 --> 02:40.760
So go ahead.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.620
Plus if you open up your editor try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

02:45.710 --> 02:51.530
So we didn't need a condition so for any time we need to apply any type of logic we can use that condition

02:51.530 --> 02:52.700
statement.

02:52.700 --> 02:58.710
So let's take the event target.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.250
So we're putting it in as P..

03:01.370 --> 03:04.530
And we need to know what the name is.

03:04.730 --> 03:13.580
So first check to see if the name is one and if it is then we know that we're using that first element

03:14.090 --> 03:14.800
else.

03:14.930 --> 03:19.670
And if we had multiple elements we could make use of those as well.

03:19.670 --> 03:23.930
So let's update these values and we can say

03:27.730 --> 03:35.500
so we know that this is the first name first name changed too and we could just simply do p value because

03:35.500 --> 03:38.860
we did update it there as well.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.750
And now we know the last name changed to.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.050
And then that's it.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.690
So let's let's try this out.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.680
So save it refresh your page.

03:50.950 --> 03:54.680
And now let's update the first name.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.400
Update the last name.

03:56.470 --> 04:05.190
So we are able to detect using the information that's getting passed within that event handler.

04:05.230 --> 04:07.030
So we try on change.

04:07.030 --> 04:10.420
Let's try on Blur's to have something different.

04:10.490 --> 04:14.690
And we're going to fire off that same function because we don't actually need to change it.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.710
So let's let's see what happens here.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.940
Let's refresh it.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.380
So now let's type something there and whatever we click off of it.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.610
So it's going to work roughly the same thing.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.570
So the on blur on change.

04:27.580 --> 04:34.480
So basically the on blur means that every time I click off of it every time the blur changes it fires

04:34.480 --> 04:34.910
off.

04:35.080 --> 04:38.390
And the onchange changes every time I click off of it.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.820
And I I've I've updated some of the content has changed.

04:42.820 --> 04:47.030
So it's able to detect and know that the content has changed.

04:49.200 --> 04:55.900
So go ahead and try it for yourself and try out some of the other event handlers with him forms.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.240
You're going to find that there's quite a few really useful ones.

04:59.280 --> 05:06.900
So the next lesson we're going to look at this even deeper and we're going to create a forum to automatically

05:06.960 --> 05:11.340
generate that placeholder dot com image that we saw earlier.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.100
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
