00:00.880 --> 00:07.540
Welcome back can earlier in the earlier lesson we saw how placeholder dot com has these nice default

00:07.570 --> 00:14.200
images and you can adjust the color the font color the text that's being displayed in there the size

00:14.260 --> 00:15.490
and so on.

00:15.490 --> 00:23.200
So what you want to do in this lesson is create a generator to generate those images on the fly using

00:23.260 --> 00:26.350
our what we've learned with Javascript.

00:26.350 --> 00:33.140
So let's first of all we've set up a forum and within this forum we need to have some options.

00:33.160 --> 00:40.880
So the first thing that I want to do is I want to have a select menu so select and this one on change.

00:40.990 --> 00:46.530
So it's going to fire off whenever we change it and I want to update the I Am G.

00:46.550 --> 00:51.350
So basically I am g you this is the function that I want to fire off.

00:51.550 --> 00:59.250
And every time we make a change I want to fire off the image you are image update function.

00:59.680 --> 01:07.240
And next we need to create several options and give it some values and we're going to get that information

01:07.300 --> 01:10.510
directly from the values of the options.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.110
So this will just say select.

01:13.250 --> 01:18.630
So we're not going to have any values in there because onchange is going to work.

01:18.630 --> 01:24.450
We need a change actually in order for something to happen and that's why you can't have it as the first

01:24.450 --> 01:29.510
option because if the person tries to select that first option that's not going to work.

01:29.730 --> 01:39.740
So let's set some default sizes so saw that we can do maybe a small size would be 150.

01:39.770 --> 01:45.380
So we can do small and let's add in a few other ones.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.570
And just the the sizes of these.

01:50.710 --> 01:57.690
So instead of 150 let's do 350 and then let's do 750.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.980
So this is going to be medium.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.610
And then of course we have large.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.250
So this is just a start off.

02:06.250 --> 02:13.300
So basically whatever these get changed then I want to fire off a function and I've kept that message

02:13.300 --> 02:18.280
one in here because I think this is going to come in useful whenever we get that new path we can put

02:18.280 --> 02:21.730
it in there just by calling out to message.

02:21.730 --> 02:25.030
So let's let's set up that function that we're calling to.

02:25.030 --> 02:34.410
So that's I am g you with that upper case you.

02:34.480 --> 02:42.700
So next Let's hide in our image so I know I just copy and paste that image that we used before and I'm

02:42.700 --> 02:44.170
going to keep that within the form.

02:44.170 --> 02:46.200
So go back and refresh.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.100
So now we're firing this off.

02:48.130 --> 02:53.060
And what we want to do is we want to change the size of the image.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.450
So let's put this one on a new line so it looks a little bit better.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.480
So within the form when we make our selection I want it to change that image.

03:03.490 --> 03:06.340
So these are the default sizes.

03:06.340 --> 03:10.170
We know that we've got this one as the default center size.

03:10.330 --> 03:16.910
And I want to grab that and update it so we know that we've got information within that event trigger

03:16.910 --> 03:20.280
selects console directory out.

03:20.530 --> 03:30.440
And that was event target so that we know that what's actually firing this off.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.960
And let's also do one other one here as well.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.010
So we know that this is a select.

03:36.030 --> 03:39.470
So let's try a value let's see if we can get the value.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.850
So go back and refresh it.

03:41.880 --> 03:48.570
So open up our developer space and when we select it we see that we can pass those values that are within

03:48.570 --> 03:49.320
the select.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.760
And we also have select here so we have a lot of information in here.

03:53.940 --> 04:00.300
And one of the ones that I wanted to make use of is because I want to be able to detect what type it

04:00.300 --> 04:08.070
is that's actually passing the information through and we can see that the type for the select option

04:08.400 --> 04:09.950
is select one.

04:10.200 --> 04:18.720
So I want to make sure that if the type is select one then I want to do something with that and that's

04:19.230 --> 04:22.680
update this entire value over here.

04:22.680 --> 04:31.270
So let's check to see if and this is a vent target type

04:34.930 --> 04:48.370
so if event target type is equal to select one then we know that we've got the selection and we can

04:48.370 --> 04:52.540
also go by if we could add in names as well.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.050
So there's a lot of different ways to distinguish it.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.960
But I'd just like to keep it as minimal as possible.

04:57.970 --> 05:03.790
And the other ones are going to be actually text inputs and one is going to be a color picker.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.710
So they're going to be all different types.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.360
So I can add those in as well.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.460
So let's update those.

05:11.470 --> 05:24.650
So we know we need a way to put some text so let me add a line break and text so odd text here.

05:24.650 --> 05:27.610
And this is input type equals text.

05:27.860 --> 05:33.130
And then within here I want to simply add in some type of text information

05:36.160 --> 05:40.260
and we'll add the On Change as well.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.090
So we're going to have that same trigger here.

05:42.130 --> 05:50.070
So onchange So if anything changes in here we want it firing off and we want to trigger off that value.

05:50.170 --> 05:50.950
So next

05:54.180 --> 06:03.830
so select color and this is another one that's going to be really easy because with each tim L5 we've

06:03.830 --> 06:10.820
already got color pickers so we know that with the color picker we can select different colors that

06:10.820 --> 06:11.720
we can use.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.010
So let's save that and go out and refresh it.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.170
So you've got the ability to add text.

06:17.300 --> 06:24.050
We've got the ability to select a color so everything is there as we need it and when we go into here

06:24.140 --> 06:28.500
we can see the outputs that are being responded back so we make a selection.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.320
We see that we're getting the colors there and we can utilize all of this information as we build out

06:34.450 --> 06:38.620
our string and replace our image source value.

06:40.420 --> 06:46.510
So what I want to do now is set up some global variables that we can make use of when we're building

06:46.510 --> 06:48.210
out our basic strings.

06:48.210 --> 06:50.840
So first of all let's set up a variable.

06:50.860 --> 06:55.300
I'm calling it i m g or maybe I can call it I

06:58.310 --> 06:59.590
so I color.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.850
So whatever the color is that we want.

07:01.850 --> 07:05.190
So I'm going to just set those defaults that we have right now.

07:05.270 --> 07:16.190
So the eye color and I text so this is the default text that we have.

07:16.190 --> 07:17.580
So we've got image 1

07:20.720 --> 07:21.830
next variable.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.480
We need to do I.

07:24.710 --> 07:33.400
And this is going to be the size and our starting size is 350 by 150.

07:34.040 --> 07:39.620
So at the end of the day we know we need to use all of these variables and we need to actually generate

07:39.980 --> 07:44.390
some type of output that we can replace that source image with.

07:44.420 --> 07:51.470
So also let's let's see if within the console whenever we go into the input we know we have to go over

07:51.470 --> 07:53.560
to the parent as we did before.

07:53.690 --> 08:01.380
And let's try that now and we'll go to the parent and then we'll move down to get to the my image so

08:01.390 --> 08:07.610
I want you to pause the video and traverse through our selection.

08:07.610 --> 08:12.800
So whatever element got selected they all share the same parent which is the form.

08:12.830 --> 08:20.280
So go back to the form and then go to select the image and output that right now within the console.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.370
And then we have our starting point in order to update that image as needed.

08:25.400 --> 08:31.190
So go ahead pause the video and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:31.400 --> 08:37.070
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and we're all we're doing is putting it into the console

08:37.280 --> 08:39.350
so we can console log it out.

08:39.530 --> 08:45.380
And sometimes it does help if you do console directory and that way you can traverse through all the

08:45.380 --> 08:46.550
different elements.

08:46.580 --> 08:55.130
So we saw earlier that we can use the target to select whatever event just got triggered.

08:55.130 --> 09:01.930
That brought us to this function and we also saw earlier that we can traverse up to the parent element.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.670
So that gets us to the parent which is the form.

09:04.670 --> 09:13.640
So the next step is going down to select the image and we know with these inputs we have names we can

09:13.640 --> 09:16.890
select those as well but we haven't added in any names.

09:16.940 --> 09:21.800
So how do you think you can get to the image we're able to successfully get the image source.

09:22.190 --> 09:28.040
So one of the nice things about images is that we can use the my image.

09:28.070 --> 09:36.110
So let's open up refresh this open up the console make some type of update there and we can see that

09:36.170 --> 09:37.740
we've got the form.

09:37.790 --> 09:44.250
We've got a bunch of children in there and we see the top one here that we got my image.

09:44.300 --> 09:49.370
So it's as easy as just selecting my image.

09:49.370 --> 09:56.660
We can use the ID my image and then we know once we grab that element we can really easily grab that

09:56.660 --> 10:03.500
source and I'm going to update this a console log or a console directory back to console log.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.800
So let's refresh it again and we'll go out here.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.160
We'll update the color press OK.

10:09.200 --> 10:09.770
And there we go.

10:09.770 --> 10:13.400
So now we've got access to our image.

10:13.460 --> 10:19.980
So the last and final thing that we need to do in this exercise is simply build out our strength.

10:20.210 --> 10:25.580
So let's set up a variable and we'll set that one up over here.

10:25.580 --> 10:30.150
And basically this is going to be the image source that we want to make use of.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.850
So we know we've got to start with these same parameters.

10:34.910 --> 10:37.050
So let's go ahead and grab this.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.590
And next we know that we've got a bunch of variables that we've set up.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.290
So we're looking for size.

10:44.300 --> 10:47.240
So that was ice size that we set up.

10:47.240 --> 10:53.890
So we're using those global variables and then we're going to use the event event handler.

10:53.900 --> 10:59.720
The triggers here in order to update these values so we can grab the size.

10:59.900 --> 11:09.320
And next we know that after the next slash we have a color so we can use our eye color variable.

11:10.010 --> 11:16.190
And then after that we have another slash and we're going to just use leave this text right now as white

11:16.190 --> 11:20.500
text and we need to do text equals.

11:20.720 --> 11:25.340
And then lastly we toss out our last parameter address that was the text

11:28.510 --> 11:35.490
and I forgot one quote there.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.800
So that looks right now.

11:37.830 --> 11:47.210
And then we know that we can take this big long path here and we can update it with a new source.

11:47.220 --> 11:52.980
So whatever source we've created here we can update it and we can actually even skip all of that as

11:52.980 --> 11:53.920
well.

11:53.970 --> 12:00.050
But it's better it's more visually easier to understand what we're adjusting with all of these values.

12:00.180 --> 12:04.950
So now the next step is really just to make that adjustment that we need.

12:04.950 --> 12:12.240
So we know that we've got that target type if it's select one that we're actually updating with whatever

12:12.240 --> 12:14.220
value we're picking up here.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.840
We're updating the size.

12:15.990 --> 12:22.810
So now let's update the size and we know that we've picked up a value from a target.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.590
So let's save that one.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.220
So let's try this out.

12:27.840 --> 12:34.620
So we've got this one hooked up and we know that we can change the size and image is getting larger

12:34.650 --> 12:41.610
and smaller as we're making our selection and maybe I do need to make.

12:41.640 --> 12:47.760
Oh they were shrunk down a little bit there so let's bring them back up to 150 so that they're a nice

12:47.760 --> 12:49.680
size.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.710
So go back refreshed again.

12:51.750 --> 12:56.890
And now we see that we can adjust the size depending on our selection.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.900
So the next thing that we need to do is add in the text and the color.

13:00.900 --> 13:07.980
So what I want you to do now is pause the video using that type and update the appropriate variable

13:08.310 --> 13:15.770
and that's all you have to do within the condition update the appropriate variable so pause the video

13:15.890 --> 13:18.040
give it a try and I'll show you the solution.

13:18.050 --> 13:22.520
Coming up so if you had an opportunity to try that out.

13:22.640 --> 13:26.060
So it's just a matter of setting the conditions.

13:26.060 --> 13:30.830
So you've got another condition here that we're going to check to see if the type

13:33.450 --> 13:38.710
and the type for this one that we're looking at is if the type of text.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.280
So that's all of our inputs are all different.

13:41.310 --> 13:47.640
So we know that we can utilize the text so the text is going to be text.

13:48.130 --> 13:51.970
That's the variable that's going to change.

13:52.050 --> 13:55.710
And also maybe we can do our last LCF

13:59.480 --> 14:06.920
and this time we're going to look to see if the type is color and then we know if it's color we can

14:07.370 --> 14:15.380
we can just update the color.

14:15.950 --> 14:20.600
And then instead of the text Let's update the eye color

14:24.160 --> 14:25.620
with the target value.

14:26.010 --> 14:31.140
So there is actually one thing that we do need to take care of as well.

14:31.140 --> 14:36.450
So this was a bit of a trick question because the colors are being returned with the hash and we don't

14:36.450 --> 14:39.900
have a hash here within the string so we need to get rid of that hash.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.940
So I show you how to do that as well but let's try this for now.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.740
So refresh and add in some text.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.160
When we click off of it the color.

14:49.200 --> 14:54.780
And this isn't going to work because right now we're not adding in the hash.

14:55.280 --> 15:01.950
So everything else is working and we've got a problem here because of the hash.

15:01.970 --> 15:08.990
So let me show you how you can get rid of that hash so the hash is really is a we just do a replace

15:09.080 --> 15:11.140
of thought that value

15:13.880 --> 15:18.940
and this is the one that I need to update so variable and what just color and color.

15:19.100 --> 15:25.700
So this is just a simple placeholder for the value.

15:25.700 --> 15:35.420
And then when I set eye color I can update and color and I can use a built in method called replace.

15:35.420 --> 15:41.840
And this is also very useful in javascript that it gives you the ability to really easily just replace.

15:41.840 --> 15:46.670
So I'm going to grab that hash and I'm going to just replace it with a blank.

15:46.690 --> 15:54.450
So now when we go out and we refresh it and hit OK we see that the color itself is actually working.

15:54.660 --> 16:02.160
So the last part of this exercise was to generate that string and have it useful somewhere.

16:02.280 --> 16:07.170
So it needs to output somewhere where we could easily grab it and make use of it.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.520
So let me update.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.250
So we did want to update

16:14.100 --> 16:18.080
message and we could simply grab it from there as well.

16:18.090 --> 16:19.470
So I m g.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.190
Source and let's refresh it again.

16:24.330 --> 16:30.120
So now whenever I update any of the content here I can see that it's actually updating there and then

16:30.120 --> 16:37.980
I can just grab the string and I can output it so I can utilize this as essentially my generator for

16:37.980 --> 16:40.420
my placeholder text.

16:40.660 --> 16:47.520
And this is how you can make use of all of these events simply passing over that same function.

16:47.620 --> 16:55.240
And then we use logic in order to separate out and determine which one of these actually triggered the

16:55.240 --> 17:01.650
onchange event and using that logic then that helps us determine which value we have to update.

17:01.750 --> 17:07.630
And then the rest of it was just simply updating the updating the values creating a new string with

17:07.750 --> 17:16.580
the new values or with the values the variables and then traversing through the Dom to the image source

17:16.700 --> 17:24.320
and then simply updating the source with the brand new string value.

17:24.320 --> 17:31.640
So what you can do now is you can update this code to add in a few more options here and another option

17:31.640 --> 17:34.970
that you can add in is changing this value here.

17:34.970 --> 17:43.750
So we've got a text color value and you can add a second input for color and update that value as well.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.920
And for that one you're actually going to have to distinguish which color type it is.

17:51.930 --> 17:58.200
So you probably would have to add in a name or an ID so that when you are doing your condition here

17:58.380 --> 18:01.560
you can see which one it is that you're updating.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.720
So either outside or the inside vine values.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.340
So go ahead try it for yourself.

18:09.450 --> 18:15.520
