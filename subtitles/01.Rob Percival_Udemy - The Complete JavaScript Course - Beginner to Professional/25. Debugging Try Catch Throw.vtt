00:00.810 --> 00:04.800
We'll come back in in the previous lesson we build out an application.

00:04.810 --> 00:06.940
And we had to do some bug fixing.

00:06.940 --> 00:11.060
So in this lesson are going to show you throw try to catch.

00:11.260 --> 00:18.400
And this is going to give you the ability to do some additional bug fixing with your applications.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.800
So first of all let's open up our editor and we're going to create

00:27.820 --> 00:30.940
a default function where we're going to have an error.

00:30.940 --> 00:35.810
So we'll have function and test me.

00:36.190 --> 00:39.070
So basically this is our test function.

00:39.220 --> 00:50.510
And within this function we're going to try to reuse the statement try and what we're going to try to

00:50.510 --> 00:55.220
do within here is we're going to try to put something into the console.

00:55.340 --> 00:58.150
So let's spell console wrong.

00:58.830 --> 01:02.770
It's a console and we're going to say hello.

01:03.410 --> 01:04.830
So we try to do this.

01:04.940 --> 01:16.220
And next what I want to do is I want to grab that error message using catch.

01:16.290 --> 01:24.650
So we're going to grab that error within catch and we're going to output that error into message up

01:24.660 --> 01:36.010
here so let's do document get element by Id grab a message that's going to put that error into our inner

01:36.350 --> 01:38.390
HMO so that we can see it.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.220
So let's put error into here.

01:43.790 --> 01:48.190
So this one error message.

01:48.740 --> 01:54.810
And also I want to put that air in its entirety within the con..

01:55.130 --> 01:58.240
So let's try this out and launch it.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.960
So now let's fire off.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.980
Test me so see what happens.

02:03.260 --> 02:10.600
So we see that what actually gets returned that this updated so con coal is not defined.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.100
So that's our air reference here.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.040
And we saw that we've got this reference air.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.000
Test me.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.430
So it gives us more information to actually what happened.

02:20.570 --> 02:27.410
And I know you can see a lot of this within the console as well but sometimes you don't want your script

02:27.470 --> 02:29.020
to stop executing.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.790
And by doing it try that gives you the ability to try to execute some functions.

02:34.790 --> 02:40.150
And if it doesn't turn out the rest of your script continues can continue to execute.

02:40.310 --> 02:47.460
So it doesn't produce that javascript error that's going to actually stop the code from executing.

02:47.580 --> 02:54.030
And if we output the same thing as directory's so console directory we see we've got this reference

02:54.090 --> 02:54.750
error.

02:54.750 --> 03:01.170
So that's what we're picking up and catch we can use catch and catch is a statement and allows us to

03:02.560 --> 03:06.720
catch the error that's being thrown and basically handle the error.

03:06.850 --> 03:07.630
So we've got.

03:07.630 --> 03:08.560
Message.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.320
Clean coal is not defined.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.510
So that's what we're outputting over here.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.630
And then we've got some more information reference occurred.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.320
Coal is not defined.

03:17.320 --> 03:23.150
And we've got some more details here and that's what basically was being output within that console.

03:23.830 --> 03:29.940
And what throw does is it actually allows us to set a custom error.

03:30.070 --> 03:31.990
So let's set up a variable.

03:31.990 --> 03:39.400
And I'm going to give this variable a number of 500 and instead of trying to output control we're just

03:39.400 --> 03:41.000
going to do control x.

03:41.110 --> 03:42.630
So no that's not going to work.

03:42.820 --> 03:46.120
And we're also going to do some tests here as well.

03:46.180 --> 03:56.650
So we're going to check to see if the value of x is greater than 100 then we're going to output through

03:56.650 --> 03:57.520
role.

03:57.580 --> 04:11.580
And we're going to create our brand new air that yes it's greater than 100 and we're going to do another

04:11.580 --> 04:12.210
condition.

04:12.210 --> 04:23.400
So this is where we can use our conditions at this time if X is less than 100 than we're going to do.

04:23.430 --> 04:29.080
Oh no it's less than 100.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.230
So let's try this out now so let's open up refreshed in the console.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.110
Let's do.

04:35.190 --> 04:43.660
Test me test me function and we see that we're able to define our own error messages here.

04:43.680 --> 04:50.280
So we see that instead of being returned back that default message we can actually see some information.

04:50.490 --> 04:58.270
And this is also really useful when we're debugging because this gives us ability to customize our errors.

04:58.380 --> 05:01.650
And especially for looking out for a particular variable.

05:01.710 --> 05:08.820
If one of our variables is not working properly we can try and we can then do a check to see what that

05:08.820 --> 05:13.580
value is and output a customized message within the console.

05:13.590 --> 05:17.020
So really helpful when it comes to debugging.

05:17.250 --> 05:24.550
So next time you're debugging your applications try to use the try catch in order to determine the error

05:24.600 --> 05:28.160
and then you can customize those error messages using throw.
