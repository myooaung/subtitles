00:00.710 --> 00:06.960
Come back in this lesson we're going to be showing you how to do window open and what window open does

00:07.020 --> 00:13.530
is basically it allows you to open up another window just by using javascript.

00:13.530 --> 00:17.130
So first of all let's set up a trigger in order to.

00:17.150 --> 00:22.470
So we can have an input button trigger our pop up window.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.890
So this is just going to be a regular standard.

00:24.890 --> 00:32.220
H tim l button and we'll give it a value of pop and then we're going to just set the On Click event

00:32.220 --> 00:35.880
handler and we'll just call it pop up.

00:35.870 --> 00:42.990
So now we need to create a function called pop up that will initiate opening up the window so function

00:43.080 --> 00:44.300
pop up.

00:44.310 --> 00:49.040
So basically when the button gets clicked we want to open up the window.

00:49.140 --> 00:54.210
So there's a few parameters here that we can make use of within this window.

00:54.450 --> 01:01.140
So first of all we need you or else let's say a variable you are l and this is the you are all that

01:01.140 --> 01:07.350
we wanted to open up and I'm just going to open up indexed on H Himmel you could open up different web

01:07.350 --> 01:10.260
pages if you are opening up a web page.

01:10.260 --> 01:13.840
Make sure you do that HTP dope w w w.

01:13.890 --> 01:18.550
So if you're doing Facebook then you could do something like that.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.210
But for now I'm just going to keep it at indexed.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.240
H t m-L.

01:22.470 --> 01:29.670
And next we're going to actually do the window open so window open as part of the windows object.

01:29.670 --> 01:35.790
And we know that the window object has a whole bunch of methods attached to it and we did see a lot

01:35.790 --> 01:36.770
of them earlier.

01:36.810 --> 01:43.250
So I just want to go over open a little bit more detail because you actually have some control over

01:43.440 --> 01:47.440
the different options that you have for opening up the window.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.120
So first of all you need to provide that you are all that you're opening up.

01:52.230 --> 01:55.100
So we've got that here represented in this variable.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.980
So we know we can open that up.

01:57.090 --> 02:00.560
So next we need to provide a name for the window.

02:00.720 --> 02:08.130
And this is really important because if you want you also have an option to open up on the current window.

02:08.250 --> 02:13.860
So for now what are you going to do is I'm going to create a name and I'm just going to do blank so

02:13.860 --> 02:19.560
that we know that we're opening up a blank window so just like if you've got a hyperlink you can add

02:19.560 --> 02:22.770
it and set it up as a brain window.

02:23.100 --> 02:30.510
So there's one more last parameter and this one has a whole bunch of options so we can control height.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.220
We can control with we can control where the window gets positioned.

02:35.220 --> 02:41.930
So there's a lot of options we can add scrollbars toolbars location bars and a whole lot more.

02:42.120 --> 02:48.930
So let's let's just do some of the defaults and all we have to do is set the parameter the name and

02:49.020 --> 02:50.320
then the value.

02:50.490 --> 02:57.180
So let's set this up and let's bring it top and I'm going to set the top rate to zero.

02:57.390 --> 02:59.000
And I get a comma separated.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.100
Am I going to do with.

03:01.140 --> 03:04.560
So let's do a with and this is a pixel with for the window.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.110
So let's do a width of 200.

03:07.110 --> 03:11.230
So go out into the browser and we've got our pop button.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.880
When I click the button we open up our window and we see that it opened up right at the top.

03:17.070 --> 03:23.280
So if I was to adjust this go back and refresh it and I know I've got a few windows opening up.

03:23.270 --> 03:28.820
Now we can see that we've got the ability to open up multiple windows.

03:29.160 --> 03:38.590
So next let's set some even some additional parameters so we set our width and also let's that height.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.990
So that's another really common one that you might be setting.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.570
And we're going to do a really tiny window

03:47.370 --> 03:53.940
so let's go back and refresh it and we can see now we've positioned that at one hundred picks down and

03:53.970 --> 03:55.310
the width is 200.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.860
The height is 200.

03:57.060 --> 04:02.790
So let's just start again and we're going to bring it back to zero because I think before I didn't refresh

04:02.790 --> 04:03.590
the page.

04:03.660 --> 04:08.000
So we have full control over what it looks like and where it gets positioned.

04:08.370 --> 04:13.700
So let's go back and refresh the page try it again and then we've got our pop up window.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.290
So we're popping it up top.

04:15.370 --> 04:18.520
Zero height and with 200.

04:18.840 --> 04:25.880
So another way to do it is that we can set and we can do our options and have that in a separate variable

04:25.890 --> 04:27.670
because I know this is getting quite long.

04:27.810 --> 04:33.060
So we can take those same parameters here and we've got a number of other ones that we can enter in.

04:33.060 --> 04:35.430
So I'm just going to simply do that.

04:35.450 --> 04:40.650
So one other thing that I also wanted to show you as well within the window if we want the window to

04:40.680 --> 04:44.400
go on itself we can just simply to self.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.940
And I know this isn't going to really do anything but let's

04:50.890 --> 04:56.310
so let's do id 1000 so that we can actually distinguish between the two different windows so we can

04:56.310 --> 04:56.720
see that.

04:56.730 --> 05:01.640
Now we've gone over to our ID equals 1000 window.

05:01.770 --> 05:05.580
So now every time I click it it'll go to the ID 1000.

05:05.580 --> 05:10.260
So that's how you can send that window on top of itself as well.

05:11.700 --> 05:16.640
So now what I want you to do is pause the video and try it for yourself.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.180
Create an input.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.100
So create a way to trigger your function.

05:21.240 --> 05:28.710
And then once the function triggers then I add in some parameters set your Eurail to wherever your favorite

05:28.740 --> 05:32.500
website is then open up set some options.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.890
So there's a bunch of other ones as well.

05:34.890 --> 05:44.780
So set a default window height and width of 400 and then also move the window left 100 picks and one

05:44.810 --> 05:46.880
her picks off of the top.

05:47.190 --> 05:56.860
And also add in the window to open up into a new pop up window so not on the same one.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.440
So not what I have here.

05:58.490 --> 05:59.630
So pause the video.

05:59.650 --> 06:06.020
Try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up so I hope you get an opportunity to try that out

06:06.320 --> 06:10.010
and there isn't a whole lot of updates that we need to do.

06:10.100 --> 06:15.140
So we're going to stick with that seem you are all we're going to update this to blank.

06:15.290 --> 06:21.280
And we did say that we want change the height to height and width to 400.

06:21.290 --> 06:27.290
We want to go off the top 100 and the one that we were missing is left.

06:27.320 --> 06:32.300
So we want it to move it over left 100 top 100 and

06:34.890 --> 06:36.540
so once you've added it in.

06:36.540 --> 06:45.350
Go ahead and save it refresh the page and then pop up that window in the location that you've specified.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.190
So let's do one more thing.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.600
So go ahead try that.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.910
And I wanted to add in one more thing.

06:51.070 --> 06:58.320
So we've got pop up and let's do pop up close and we're going to set a variable here.

06:58.450 --> 07:06.040
So this one is actually I want it to be a global variable because we want to access it from another

07:06.040 --> 07:07.150
function.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.200
So let's just add that and create that one.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.930
And now let's do a function for a pop.

07:13.930 --> 07:14.480
Close

07:18.100 --> 07:22.210
go down a little bit and we're going to grab

07:25.890 --> 07:27.800
and we're going to do the close method.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.450
So let's try the saved.

07:30.030 --> 07:33.100
So pop up the window and then you can close it down.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.510
And actually this one should say close.

07:37.950 --> 07:45.900
So you do have a lot of control especially when you're registering those values and you're giving the

07:45.900 --> 07:47.130
window that's opened up.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.240
So it's being completely contained within that object.

07:50.250 --> 07:55.100
So that means that we've got actual control over it and we can close it down if you want.

07:55.110 --> 08:03.340
So go ahead try that out and add the close button into your application using the editor.

08:03.390 --> 08:05.490
And there's one other thing that I did want to note.

08:05.520 --> 08:10.510
So we are opening up that same web page and we've got a close here as well.

08:10.590 --> 08:16.950
So if you close this one this is no longer referring to the current instance that was opened.

08:17.010 --> 08:22.620
So I need to do another one where I opened that one and then I can close it from the window that opened

08:22.620 --> 08:23.140
it.

08:23.160 --> 08:29.790
So that's where the controls are laying they're actually laying in the window that initiated that instance

08:29.790 --> 08:31.430
of that window popping up.

08:31.620 --> 08:38.160
So going back and just remembering that that clause is not referring to that new one that was opened

08:38.160 --> 08:41.940
up and you do need to open another one in order to do the close.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.420
And then this one would have this one would have control over that instance that opened up.
