00:02.570 --> 00:07.420
This lesson we're going to be concluding the memory game that we've been working on earlier.

00:07.490 --> 00:12.710
So usually when you're building out these types of applications it's always a good idea to just make

00:12.710 --> 00:19.490
sure that the rules are working as intended so go through and you usually do need to play the game a

00:19.490 --> 00:20.520
few times.

00:20.570 --> 00:25.970
So to make sure that everything is working properly because that's the best way to tell if you've got

00:25.970 --> 00:28.110
some bugs within your script.

00:28.640 --> 00:34.370
So everything seems to be working properly and we actually don't have any way to finish the game as

00:34.370 --> 00:42.320
of yet so let's create that within a function so we know that we're checking and we're getting our last

00:42.320 --> 00:43.940
matches over here.

00:43.940 --> 00:49.750
So this is where whenever we're finding a match this is where we're getting the last matches.

00:49.850 --> 00:56.930
So we know that if there's a final match then this is the point where we can finish and conclude our

00:56.930 --> 00:57.830
game play.

00:58.090 --> 00:58.940
So let's see.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.400
And do one condition here.

01:02.570 --> 01:08.360
And if this condition is true then we're going to launch a function called Game Over.

01:08.630 --> 01:11.050
So what do you think that condition could be.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.240
It's member that we're expanding this Saray length.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.980
We're actually depositing more and more items into the full array.

01:21.140 --> 01:30.680
So we know that the full array length if it gets to a certain length or if it equals another array of

01:30.680 --> 01:38.300
length then we're finished the game and we know that the tiler rate is the one that we originally built

01:38.660 --> 01:41.080
the game board out of.

01:41.240 --> 01:50.240
So we know that the tile array length if it's actually equal to the number of we that we've selected

01:50.570 --> 01:51.970
then the game is over.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.900
So that's all we have to do we have to just find one condition that we know when it's true.

01:57.050 --> 02:02.070
And if it is true that this is our point where we can select the game ending.

02:02.390 --> 02:08.170
So now let's build out the functions so we know that at this point the game is actually over.

02:08.450 --> 02:13.220
So function and game over is the function that we're doing.

02:13.430 --> 02:18.140
So I usually like to break things up as much as possible within functions.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.590
Because this makes it a lot more versatile and flexible.

02:21.590 --> 02:26.750
And then if you do have something to update or fix you can just simply jump into the function that's

02:26.750 --> 02:28.090
handling that task.

02:28.190 --> 02:34.190
And this is the whole idea with functions that you give each one particular job to handle and the more

02:34.190 --> 02:38.900
you can break up these jobs the better your code is going to be because that's going to give you the

02:38.900 --> 02:47.660
ability to really fine tune all the different pieces working pieces of your of your application.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.270
So now we know that game is over.

02:50.270 --> 02:57.830
So game over game over or type game over into the message area.

02:58.070 --> 03:03.290
The other thing that we need we need our start button box or the one that we got rid of earlier.

03:03.410 --> 03:05.300
Let's bring that start button back.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.150
So going back to where we started the game.

03:08.210 --> 03:11.550
So we've got SATB display none.

03:11.570 --> 03:16.130
So in the game over let's display it again and you do that by doing.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.960
BLOCK So what else do we need.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.230
Whenever we finish up the game.

03:21.410 --> 03:25.490
So we need to set our game play over to false.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.670
So let's.

03:26.820 --> 03:35.430
So just as we've done here so going into where we're starting and this is going to give us a lot of

03:35.580 --> 03:38.320
hints as to what we need to reset.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.630
So we know we're setting our game play to true when we're playing that game.

03:42.660 --> 03:46.770
So I know that whenever the game is over we need to set to false.

03:46.770 --> 03:51.990
So a lot of what we're doing is we're actually going to be resetting our values back to what they were

03:52.050 --> 03:57.600
when we started the game and we have to empty out a couple or raise as well.

03:57.600 --> 04:04.980
So what I want you to do now pause the video and empty out there raise that we need to review this when

04:05.040 --> 04:06.330
we start the game again.

04:06.510 --> 04:12.270
So take a get a look at the different arrays that we have available where we've got the tile array where

04:12.270 --> 04:17.340
we're building out this one and the tile images and so on.

04:17.340 --> 04:22.210
So we need to zero out some of these arrays.

04:22.420 --> 04:29.170
And the main array that we have to zero out is this one here that holds all of the flipped over cards.

04:29.230 --> 04:36.490
So make sure that you get one and that you zero that when it and there's another one that we have to

04:36.490 --> 04:38.060
zero out as well.

04:38.140 --> 04:40.090
And you may or may not need to do this one.

04:40.090 --> 04:41.920
So that's the tile images.

04:41.920 --> 04:48.500
And the reason we have to zero tile images is because we push into it and when we build our array.

04:48.520 --> 04:54.730
So typically if we already have a bunch of images that we're using we can simply place them into tile

04:54.800 --> 04:56.560
images and we won't have to do that.

04:56.710 --> 05:00.070
It's only because now we're kind of doing it dynamically.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.770
So we're building that out every time.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.630
So this is why we want to have the ability to zero that.

05:06.970 --> 05:13.340
So now we should be good to go and do one last practice round of our game.

05:13.450 --> 05:20.290
So we click it and we've got our images showing and now we just got to make sure that our game actually

05:20.290 --> 05:22.710
ends and we can start the game again.

05:25.400 --> 05:32.160
That we can make the game even more challenging by adding different images we can add in different values.

05:33.670 --> 05:36.600
We get out in even more tiles if we want as well.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.580
So there we go sorry.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.130
Game is over and we're ready to start again.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.510
And there's another thing that maybe we need to clear out and we need to clear out that game board.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.520
So let's go out and grab a game board.

05:47.530 --> 05:53.290
So we've got a game board down here so let's update the inner h to smell of game board and we're just

05:53.290 --> 05:57.280
going to simply clear all of that out on that game over.

05:57.280 --> 06:07.510
So go over to their inner HMO and we're just going to equal that to blank.

06:07.540 --> 06:08.080
So there we go.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.560
So now we should be able to start again and we are locked out.

06:19.570 --> 06:22.080
So everything seems to be working properly.

06:22.150 --> 06:27.160
And again it's always a good idea to play it through a few times just to make sure that you're not seeing

06:27.160 --> 06:31.920
any bugs or not picking up any new bugs that you might not have noticed before.

06:31.930 --> 06:36.000
So everything seems to be working on the second round through the game.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.530
So everything worked properly there as well.

06:38.530 --> 06:42.300
And this time we know that we've added in that we're clearing the game board.

06:42.370 --> 06:48.550
So now it's up to you to take that code and to work with it make some updates to it make some changes

06:48.550 --> 06:49.080
to it.

06:49.180 --> 06:54.400
And there's quite a lot of things that you can do as well to condense it and streamline it.

06:54.610 --> 06:59.460
And also of course if you want spend some time and style it nice.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.930
I did some really cool images in order to enhance the gameplay.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.750
There's quite a lot of things you can do and the code is yours.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.510
It's within the source code.

07:09.640 --> 07:15.730
And take a look at it and work through it make some updates to it make some changes and make some improvements

07:15.790 --> 07:17.020
to the current game.
