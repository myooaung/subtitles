00:01.720 --> 00:07.870
Welcome back in this lesson where you to look at query selector are all so unlike just like what we

00:07.870 --> 00:14.680
saw last time with query selector basically queries select her all returns back all the elements within

00:14.680 --> 00:18.330
the document that match the specified group of selectors.

00:18.340 --> 00:23.920
So previously we looked at and we saw that we can have multiple elements and it would simply return

00:23.920 --> 00:26.230
back that first one in query selector.

00:26.230 --> 00:29.490
But what happens if we want to grab all of the elements.

00:29.620 --> 00:35.290
So we have the ability to grab all of them that match whatever format we're actually looking for.

00:35.290 --> 00:44.650
So if for instance we want to have a div and then any divs that have children of output we can select

00:44.650 --> 00:46.270
those as well so this will be.

00:46.270 --> 00:49.240
Pick me one pick two.

00:49.420 --> 00:52.050
And now let's go back into it.

00:52.150 --> 00:56.770
TMF So usually this is my starting point when I want to make sure that I'm grabbing the elements that

00:56.800 --> 00:58.450
I actually do want to make use of.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.740
I usually do start with CSX.

01:00.910 --> 01:09.730
So this one is div and output and this time let's just copy this background color red it will get rid

01:09.730 --> 01:14.800
of some of these styles that we already have here within the that we're using for query selector.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.580
So let's go back out and refresh the page

01:21.660 --> 01:24.100
so click the page refresh it.

01:24.140 --> 01:27.580
And now we can see that we're selecting these four elements.

01:27.650 --> 01:32.660
So now we know that those are the ones that are actually going to get used and output within the query

01:32.660 --> 01:33.560
selector.

01:33.560 --> 01:42.890
So let's grab that and see SS As you probably aware if you're familiar with CSSA there's quite a lot

01:42.890 --> 01:48.050
you can do you can do quite a lot of really cool things when you're grabbing within the CSSA.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.520
And that's what it's designed for.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.830
So similar to what we're doing within the dorm.

01:51.830 --> 01:56.410
It's designed to grab a bunch of elements and do something with them.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.700
So let's grab that and we're going to do Querrey selector all.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.480
So now we've got so let me get rid of that because we don't have just one element.

02:06.730 --> 02:07.950
We've got a number of them.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.660
So we've got four of them that are being returned.

02:10.660 --> 02:15.850
And as we saw earlier as well when we're just using the classes we've got kind of a mixed bag of different

02:15.850 --> 02:17.320
ones that are being returned.

02:17.350 --> 02:23.770
So some of them might be device but actually they're all divs but we could have a case where they're

02:23.770 --> 02:28.140
not the same elements and it could be various elements that are being returned.

02:29.970 --> 02:35.970
So now that we've used queery selector I wouldn't want you to do is to try the search for yourself.

02:36.120 --> 02:43.140
Try using Querrey selector select a bunch of the elements and then grab the inner h him out because

02:43.140 --> 02:45.280
we know that there are all divs by looking at it.

02:45.330 --> 02:53.960
So just simply grab that inner h TNL and up output update the value of those elements.

02:54.860 --> 02:57.720
So go ahead try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up

03:00.740 --> 03:05.530
so welcome back and I hope you had an opportunity to work with Querrey selector.

03:05.530 --> 03:11.200
All salute me show you the solution and we know that because we've got multiple elements that basically

03:11.200 --> 03:12.900
means that we do need a loop.

03:13.060 --> 03:21.250
So I use my typical variable x set that loops up and we also know that he has a length value within

03:21.310 --> 03:26.460
that object and we also know we need to increment x 2 in order to break out of our loop eventually.

03:26.710 --> 03:30.690
So as we're looping through them we can grab that element.

03:30.890 --> 03:40.420
So grab the element that is at this index value as we're looping through them and do h t m l and then

03:40.450 --> 03:46.890
equal that r h to mail to it worked.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.010
And that's it.

03:48.010 --> 03:54.040
So let's go ahead and try that within our screen and we can see that we've updated them all to say it

03:54.040 --> 03:55.140
worked.

03:55.870 --> 03:57.730
So I've got one more challenge.

03:57.740 --> 04:06.040
Within this lesson and this time what I want you to do is turn queery selector all into an actual function

04:06.550 --> 04:12.260
so we can pass multiple loops here multiple values.

04:12.310 --> 04:21.050
And when we update what we're selecting So this needs to be passed as an argument and picked up within

04:21.140 --> 04:26.930
the function and then the function would simply be returning back the results from the query selector.

04:26.930 --> 04:33.920
So returning back that value as an object so place this within a function and try it out and I'll show

04:33.920 --> 04:35.310
you the solution coming up.

04:36.450 --> 04:42.480
So a lot of times it's a great idea that you have this type of stuff within a function because they

04:42.480 --> 04:47.730
don't always have to do query select or all you can simply pass the parameters through and then return

04:47.730 --> 04:49.560
back the results.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.330
So let's go take a look at that now.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.730
And create a function.

04:53.820 --> 04:58.040
So this function basically will do.

04:58.440 --> 05:09.880
So we just call it Q S and it's going to take the element selector within the parameters there and instead

05:09.880 --> 05:19.540
of outputting it here let's return back document query selector all and it's going to simply look through

05:19.540 --> 05:27.380
this argument here and instead of this where you updated it and just do queue s.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.350
So the query selector and this time.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.630
So it's more dynamic this way.

05:33.340 --> 05:37.190
So go back and refresh the page and we can see that.

05:37.210 --> 05:46.190
Now we're getting this output and when we go and we type in El we're not getting a result.

05:46.310 --> 05:50.060
And that's because we need to specify it as a class.

05:50.090 --> 05:55.820
So go back out and refreshed and you'll find that now we've actually updated all of the inner h t m

05:55.820 --> 06:00.080
l and e l now it contains all of those elements.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.650
So now we've made it dynamic.

06:01.670 --> 06:08.060
So now is the second part of this challenge where Let's update one of these input fields and add a button

06:08.060 --> 06:16.550
to it and have an On Click event where we're going to pass the parameters from this input field and

06:16.610 --> 06:21.800
make this dynamically output and update depending on the classes that we're selecting.

06:23.450 --> 06:31.830
And then output the inner h to M-L into the first message we'll just get rid of the second message area

06:32.100 --> 06:39.520
and output whatever we've selected output the contents within the message area.

06:39.630 --> 06:43.560
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.810
So let's update this.

06:45.830 --> 06:56.280
So we've got our input and let's change it from first to Querrey So we'll just call it Querrey stuff

06:56.340 --> 06:58.810
and also give it an idea of Querrey stuff.

07:02.260 --> 07:08.950
So that way we can pick up the value and next to input type and let's create a button.

07:09.370 --> 07:13.210
And for this button we're going to do an on click event.

07:13.210 --> 07:25.720
So on click the button and I want to fire off my ACL for my selection and what we can do then just add

07:25.720 --> 07:26.410
in a value

07:30.230 --> 07:32.990
get Querrey.

07:33.020 --> 07:37.940
So basically we're going to get the results back of the query and this is how we're going to initiate

07:38.270 --> 07:40.630
and trigger that action.

07:41.150 --> 07:42.510
So let's close that off.

07:42.650 --> 07:46.820
So basically now we need to go over to here and create a function.

07:46.820 --> 07:51.540
So we're going to keep what we have already and we're going to create a brand new function.

07:51.540 --> 07:56.180
So my S L and this function.

07:56.180 --> 08:02.600
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to grab the contents of this input here and because

08:02.600 --> 08:10.400
we only have one of them are going to simply use get element by ID so variable and make it a local variable.

08:10.490 --> 08:21.310
So I got to give it an A and document get element by id and this element is Querrey stuff.

08:23.030 --> 08:27.260
And we're going to return back the value of the contents of that element.

08:27.260 --> 08:33.020
So the next thing that we want to do is say we want to be able to add and input that information there

08:33.290 --> 08:34.630
for the query.

08:34.730 --> 08:45.200
So now that we've got that we can simply output that here and we can actually update it to actually

08:45.200 --> 08:47.510
query out that selection.

08:47.510 --> 08:54.320
And then the next thing that we needed to do is we need to update the inner t amount of the message

08:54.320 --> 08:54.980
area.

08:56.090 --> 09:03.580
So let's set up a variable here local variable to hold it and we'll just call it results.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.500
And do a line breaks it breaks apart the content there.

09:09.800 --> 09:16.330
And next let's pull that one out and update this to be.

09:16.670 --> 09:24.460
And this one again we need to specify so documents and we're doing yet element by ID.

09:24.800 --> 09:29.500
And so the idea for this one is message and let's fix that up.

09:29.510 --> 09:31.090
So in our age to Mel.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.580
So basically got to get rid of this as well.

09:35.120 --> 09:41.210
So now we're looping through it and we need to build out our h M-L value.

09:41.330 --> 09:46.490
So we're going to increment and can contaminate it together and we know that we've got a number of elements

09:46.490 --> 09:47.020
here.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.790
So depending on the element.

09:48.840 --> 09:53.200
So in it to pull that into our as an object usable format

09:56.030 --> 10:04.220
so E-L and X because this is the Loopt index value of the element as we're looping through and we're

10:04.220 --> 10:09.040
just going to do in our text sort of to pull back all of that H-2 mail.

10:09.080 --> 10:09.880
So there we go.

10:09.890 --> 10:14.360
And we've just got a couple of functions here so let's go ahead and try this out.

10:14.630 --> 10:17.480
So now we know that when we input it.

10:17.570 --> 10:23.180
So if I do output we can see that we can return back all of the results and we can play around a bit

10:23.180 --> 10:25.130
with this as well so highlight.

10:25.190 --> 10:30.500
So if we want to get back highlight we can see that we return back both of those results lets out in

10:30.650 --> 10:32.330
line break as well.

10:35.110 --> 10:42.730
So that we can have a nice neater output.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.760
And let's go ahead and try that again.

10:44.780 --> 10:46.690
So go back and refresh it.

10:46.890 --> 10:51.380
So now let's let's try output and do the query.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.150
So we get all of those results next.

10:54.150 --> 10:59.880
We can do highlight and we can really have some fun with this if we want to get information that's contained

10:59.880 --> 11:02.850
within there so maybe we want to even get message.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.140
So let's do message.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.550
So we're going to output whatever is contained within message and notice that the format changes because

11:10.550 --> 11:12.520
we're just doing the inner text.

11:12.530 --> 11:13.810
We're not doing the age to model.

11:13.880 --> 11:19.370
So this was the actual dynamic content that we generated and now we're able to pull that out as well.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.510
So we've got another one with an I.T.

11:26.010 --> 11:33.240
So try it out for yourself and make some updates to your H Tamal thing and different classes IDs and

11:33.240 --> 11:39.660
then try it out and test yourself to see what different values you can return back using this type of

11:39.660 --> 11:44.120
format and using of course the query selector.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.870
All method.
