00:00.900 --> 00:06.070
Work back in this lesson we're going to do an exercise so we're going to flip a coin and we're going

00:06.070 --> 00:10.550
to simulate flipping a coin and we know it with a coin that see their heads or tails.

00:10.690 --> 00:17.520
So we need to create a prompt asking the user to guess either heads or tails.

00:17.680 --> 00:25.240
Then the next step is to evaluate that input from the prompt because we know that people aren't going

00:25.240 --> 00:26.490
to do a zero or one.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.760
They're actually entering heads or tails.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.010
So to take that string value turn it into a number.

00:32.110 --> 00:39.910
So knowing that it's either 0 or 1 and then we can use math not random which we saw earlier within the

00:39.910 --> 00:47.410
Course as well and generate a random number so that we can simulate throwing the CT coin and returning

00:47.410 --> 00:49.100
back into 0 0 1.

00:49.240 --> 00:54.430
And then lastly we need to tell the user whether they were correct or not.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.880
So let's let me show you how this is done.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.310
And if you want to pause the video give it a try.

01:02.310 --> 01:10.090
Write out the code and I'll show you the solution coming up so we had the opportunity to try this challenge.

01:10.530 --> 01:16.290
So first thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to ask the question.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.530
So this is just going to be a question.

01:18.560 --> 01:26.580
And of course the variable that you use for the prompt you could use any one that you wanted.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.740
So just do a heads or tails.

01:31.970 --> 01:36.620
So next we need to make sure that we can turn this into a number.

01:36.620 --> 01:43.230
So let's do something like result and we can use There's a number of ways we can do this.

01:43.250 --> 01:49.500
So I'm going to use the ternary operator or check to see if.

01:49.710 --> 02:00.490
So if question is equal to heads and if it is then we're going to return back a value of 1.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.770
And actually it doesn't matter we can do 1 or 0.

02:03.870 --> 02:06.290
So it wouldn't really matter the order of these.

02:06.300 --> 02:10.120
So this is just basically turning in our question.

02:10.150 --> 02:17.550
Our verbal question to the user into a numeric format and then we can use these numbers as a comparison

02:17.640 --> 02:18.620
later on.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.810
So now we've got a question.

02:20.820 --> 02:31.590
It's turned into a numeric result and as next what we can do is that we can generate a random number

02:31.600 --> 02:37.720
so this will be our random number.

02:38.740 --> 02:42.310
And this has to be a number from 0 to 1.

02:42.310 --> 02:49.420
There's only two numbers in here and we're really to use math floor so that we can bring the math value

02:49.420 --> 02:54.850
down so round it down so that it will always be 0 or 1.

02:54.860 --> 03:05.070
And now this math random number so random is the built in javascript method and we need to multiply

03:05.070 --> 03:06.230
it by two.

03:06.230 --> 03:13.130
So basically that's going to return a value of zero point whatever whatever whatever or one point whatever

03:13.130 --> 03:14.230
whatever whatever.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.540
And then the floor is allowing us to round it down.

03:17.690 --> 03:22.720
So either a zero or one that's all it's going to be returned with that statement.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.620
And then lastly you should do our comparison.

03:26.990 --> 03:38.940
So we need to check to see if the value of result is equal to the value of a random number.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.690
And if it is then let's do something in here.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.110
And if it's not then we can do something else.

03:48.140 --> 03:56.350
And then lastly we can put in our HMO and

03:59.720 --> 04:06.660
we also we should create another variable in order to hold our So I'm going to call it H.M. again declared

04:06.680 --> 04:07.480
up there.

04:08.090 --> 04:13.330
And then all ready to do is aged out and maybe over here.

04:13.340 --> 04:17.790
I started by just saying something went wrong.

04:17.810 --> 04:20.150
So hopefully we never see this message.

04:20.290 --> 04:27.150
But just in case something went wrong with our condition and we can just put that something went wrong.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.520
So now we know that HMO now.

04:31.760 --> 04:38.540
So take another look at this code so we know if the person guest heads and we're turning back heads

04:38.960 --> 04:43.040
then we see that you guessed correctly

04:48.420 --> 04:49.120
correctly

04:53.100 --> 04:58.600
or else we do you we can say you were wrong

05:05.390 --> 05:08.130
OK so now we're ready to give it a go.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.490
So it's a refresher.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.000
So heads or tails.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.980
So let's try it heads I guess correctly.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.210
And actually it's going to be a little bit hard to check.

05:17.210 --> 05:23.290
We could of course we could go into the console here and this is where we can actually find out what

05:23.330 --> 05:24.120
the value.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.830
So believe I guess heads.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.840
Let's see what let's see what the value of random number is.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.320
And so we see them it's zero.

05:35.500 --> 05:43.610
So in order for it to have been right we know that the random number should have been 1 and then when

05:43.620 --> 05:49.350
we do our comparison between the results here and the random number that we would have been correct

05:49.590 --> 05:51.330
but because it's a zero.

05:51.330 --> 05:58.950
We know that we selected heads which evaluates to be one within the Turner statement there.

05:58.950 --> 06:02.690
So we know that one does not equal to zero.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.020
And we were wrong.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.680
And then that's the output there.

06:05.820 --> 06:09.250
So that's the solution to this challenge in the next lesson.

06:09.380 --> 06:15.960
I show you a switch statement and we're going to build a magic 8 ball using the switch statement.

06:16.020 --> 06:16.940
So that's coming up.
