00:01.330 --> 00:02.220
Welcome back.

00:02.230 --> 00:05.660
And in this lesson we're going to update some over age to m-L.

00:05.740 --> 00:09.110
So let's add some classes.

00:09.110 --> 00:16.390
So we're going to create a bunch of divs and let's use output as a class and then just put a quick message

00:16.390 --> 00:17.600
test me one.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.330
So we've got some content in there.

00:19.450 --> 00:25.900
And what I wanted to do is I want to duplicate this a bunch of times so that we have a bunch of input

00:25.900 --> 00:28.880
classes so that we can actually make a selection.

00:28.900 --> 00:37.960
And then next we want to loop through all of the classes and take from what we learned previously where

00:37.990 --> 00:44.600
we can attach click and that's how we can attach different click events to multiple elements.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.100
So let's update that content.

00:49.140 --> 00:53.020
And they're all going to have the class of output.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.740
So let's loop through their 9 and 10.

00:59.130 --> 01:03.690
So we know that we've got 10 elements what the class of output.

01:03.930 --> 01:07.340
So next let's grab that within our H.E. M-L

01:11.550 --> 01:20.350
So let's create a variable here and we're going to call it L.

01:20.640 --> 01:28.410
So I call it L class and from here we're going to do document and get element.

01:28.420 --> 01:35.530
So instead of element by ID because we're selecting multiple ones we want to select them by class so

01:35.530 --> 01:37.220
get elements by class name

01:41.790 --> 01:52.270
by class name so get elements by class name and then we need to select the class that we're looking

01:52.270 --> 01:52.720
for.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.490
So the classes output.

01:54.850 --> 01:58.080
So let's go back out and we're going to refresh our page.

01:58.090 --> 02:06.230
So now if I do elth class we can see that we've got access to all of those elements.

02:06.280 --> 02:12.790
So the next step is as we saw earlier to actually loop through them and click events to them so we can

02:12.790 --> 02:15.810
do that and we're going to create our loop.

02:15.820 --> 02:22.780
So we're going to loop through all of the elements we're going to use X as our default variable and

02:22.840 --> 02:26.870
loop through while X is less then.

02:27.010 --> 02:29.590
And we're going to make use of the length.

02:29.590 --> 02:32.920
So we know that we can get the length of the class.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.830
And now let's just increment X by 1 so that our loop is changing.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.490
And we're updating.

02:39.490 --> 02:45.670
So now we know that we've got access to all of those elements and now we can do something with those

02:45.730 --> 02:46.660
elements.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.910
So previously we saw how we can grab that element information.

02:51.910 --> 02:56.950
So I'm going to call it all within this variable within this loop and

02:59.820 --> 03:06.120
so we're going to create it as an object and as we loop through we've got access to e-mail and basically

03:06.120 --> 03:09.080
that represents that element of an object.

03:09.120 --> 03:17.430
So we also saw earlier that we could do the click events so we could do on click and we could attach

03:17.430 --> 03:19.380
a function to that on click.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.120
And then actually have something happen when that element gets clicked.

03:24.120 --> 03:31.640
So what I want to do now is I want you to pause the video and I want you to output within message that

03:31.650 --> 03:35.870
text of any one of these output elements.

03:35.880 --> 03:43.140
So when the user comes in and clicks on it I want this message to change with whatever the text is of

03:43.140 --> 03:44.730
the element that they clicked.

03:44.730 --> 03:50.580
So go ahead pause the video and use what we learned in the previous lessons and apply this within this

03:50.580 --> 03:54.210
code and I'll show you the solution coming up.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.000
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and I'm just going to put in a placeholder here for message

04:00.360 --> 04:04.910
so that my role is don't actually adjust when I make the clicks.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.590
So I know that we attach these click functions.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.760
And right now we don't actually have anything happening within those quick functions.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.370
So the next thing that we want to do is we want to output that message.

04:15.510 --> 04:21.780
So you see in various ways how we can do this and I going to put this document I use get element by

04:21.780 --> 04:31.370
id and I'm going to grab message so that all I need to do is now I can do message and do it for age

04:31.390 --> 04:33.480
to melt to that message.

04:33.480 --> 04:38.960
So we know that E-L represents the particular element.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.120
So if we do well and we do enter h to amental Let's see if that works.

04:46.140 --> 04:51.850
So go back out refreshed and now when I click it we see that we're actually updating the message as

04:51.850 --> 04:54.550
what those clicked values.

04:54.640 --> 05:01.960
So we notice that all we get is that last element input so we don't actually see solutes what's going

05:01.990 --> 05:04.110
on here when we're clicking it.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.340
So let me let me plug it into the console.

05:07.360 --> 05:13.480
So basically when we click it we're also going to add in another event and we're going to output that

05:13.540 --> 05:18.340
in our age to melt so that we can better better understanding of what's going wrong and why we're not

05:18.340 --> 05:19.650
able to click events.

05:19.690 --> 05:22.110
So we see that we always get that test the test.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.950
So no matter which one we click we end up with the same message.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.120
So let's also add that console log.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.340
And this is you can do some debugging using console log.

05:32.380 --> 05:38.290
It becomes a very very useful when you're actually expecting a different result within your each to

05:38.300 --> 05:40.350
Mel than what's actually happening.

05:40.600 --> 05:47.020
So what's going on here is that when we're clicking at and we see that we're looping through it we're

05:47.020 --> 05:49.030
able to get all of these elements.

05:49.030 --> 05:53.990
But at the end of the day we're only getting this one click event being registered.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.150
So this is fine if you're only looking to grab that one click event.

05:58.210 --> 06:03.970
But if you want to register them as separate elements then you need to do something as well.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.490
You need to update it a little bit.

06:06.490 --> 06:12.680
So we saw earlier that when we clicked on the event we've got them at Target.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.170
So let's see what happens.

06:14.170 --> 06:18.270
Now if I do event target in h t m l

06:21.350 --> 06:22.800
h t m l.

06:22.810 --> 06:25.030
So let's go back and refresh it.

06:25.180 --> 06:31.110
And now when I click it we see that we're actually getting those right values coming down there.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.790
So that was what was happening.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.820
And this is what you got to remember when you're setting these click events.

06:36.850 --> 06:41.580
So if we're not actually being specific to that class.

06:41.590 --> 06:48.510
So what was actually happening is that we were looping through this variable and we were always re-attaching

06:49.220 --> 06:51.470
e l n r h t M-L to it.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.890
So we weren't identifying that particular element at the time it was clicked.

06:55.990 --> 07:02.740
We were using the value of e l and we know that when we loop through it the last value of E-L was test

07:02.740 --> 07:03.420
me 10.

07:03.550 --> 07:05.210
So that's what was happening there.

07:05.230 --> 07:11.830
So it was as much that we weren't being able to separate these click events but we weren't able to actually

07:11.830 --> 07:20.590
pick up the message that we wanted to make use of because E-L inner h to M-L had been changed to test

07:20.590 --> 07:21.680
message 10.

07:21.700 --> 07:27.330
So this is where we've got all of those connections to the variables and values within Javascript.

07:27.340 --> 07:30.430
So you've got to be really careful when you're trying to grab this.

07:30.460 --> 07:34.560
So another thing that we could do is we don't have to use that message.

07:34.570 --> 07:39.820
We could have used the value of x and dump something like this.

07:39.820 --> 07:45.140
And if we do X clicked let's refresh it.

07:45.180 --> 07:51.570
And now when we click them we're actually getting that same thing where we're doing X clicked 10.

07:51.810 --> 07:58.590
So we do need to use that target in order to distinguish the different elements at the time the click

07:58.590 --> 08:00.580
event was being fired off.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.460
So they're all being seen as not one click event.

08:03.540 --> 08:09.450
And in order to distinguish We need to be more specific and grab that information on the event.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.550
At the time.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.460
So what I want you to do now is add another message area.

08:15.450 --> 08:22.160
So we're going to have message one and message to and make an update to that ID.

08:22.560 --> 08:35.660
And I want you to create a class highlight So we'll have a few that are called highlight and what I

08:35.660 --> 08:41.690
want to happen when you click the ones that have a class of highlight I want to add another listener

08:41.690 --> 08:46.100
there so that these ones are going to have something else that happens.

08:46.100 --> 08:52.100
So loop through the ones that have the class highlight and add another event listener that says you

08:52.100 --> 08:56.090
clicked one with Highlight and output that in message 2.

08:56.110 --> 08:57.790
So go ahead and try that.

08:57.860 --> 09:00.480
And I'm going to show you how that works coming up.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.450
So if you get an opportunity to try that.

09:04.510 --> 09:05.360
Did it work.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.680
What did you only get one of the messages to only get one of the click events or were you able to pass

09:10.680 --> 09:14.500
message one and message to when you clicked the ones that are highlighted.

09:14.490 --> 09:19.800
So if you clicked number seven and it was highlighted did you get message 1 and message to say are able

09:19.980 --> 09:21.410
to click events.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.780
So let's see what happens.

09:22.800 --> 09:28.820
So let's go into our H-2 Mel and we're going to loop through all the different elements.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.750
And next we need to grab.

09:31.950 --> 09:35.690
So we need to do some duplicating of some of the code that we have here.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.590
So we need to do.

09:39.660 --> 09:49.030
So this one was called message one and message once it's grabbing the element with message 1 and also

09:49.060 --> 09:53.920
let's grab that class name so we use class name as well.

09:54.310 --> 10:04.770
So we'll call it high class and this one is going to grab the ones with the class name highlight and

10:04.770 --> 10:12.510
let's loop through all the elements that have high class all the length we're going to grab that element

10:13.050 --> 10:15.230
value they're in high class

10:19.770 --> 10:26.940
and actually let's get rid of that one and we'll just do it with this type of format because we don't

10:26.940 --> 10:35.330
actually need to always register that within the variable So let's go back and go back so we can clean

10:35.330 --> 10:36.720
that up a little bit.

10:36.770 --> 10:42.050
So now when we click high class and we don't need to put that value any more we can get rid of it within

10:42.050 --> 10:46.490
that console as well as of outputting to message one.

10:46.620 --> 10:54.910
It's just so put into message we want to output message 1 so it output that inner HVM El and this time

10:55.060 --> 10:58.120
call it highlighted

11:00.990 --> 11:05.190
so clicked highlighted save that go back and refresh it.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.340
So let's see what happens.

11:06.520 --> 11:13.810
So we see that we do get that clicked highlighted and we get that change so we're able to fire both

11:13.810 --> 11:21.220
of those off and we're able to add different event listeners on the different classes and then we get

11:21.220 --> 11:23.920
those triggered depending on when they get clicked.

11:24.250 --> 11:32.260
So that was successful and you are able to do that and apply to different actions when the particular

11:32.260 --> 11:36.340
element gets clicked by using the different class names.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.060
So let's go ahead and try this out.

11:39.280 --> 11:47.170
And remember before that one of the disadvantages to on klick was that we could only register one event.

11:47.170 --> 11:53.950
So now we've tried to register two events go out to the page refreshed and try clicking one of the regular

11:53.950 --> 11:57.520
elements we can see that all of those events are still working.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.400
And as soon as we click three.

11:59.500 --> 12:06.340
So an interesting thing happens when we click number three we actually get the last registered on click

12:06.340 --> 12:08.830
event to that particular element.

12:08.830 --> 12:10.520
So we don't get both of them.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.850
We only get the once so we can't actually see.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.360
Test me seven or test me three.

12:15.370 --> 12:21.970
All we get is clicked highlighted and if we were to change the order that it actually gets represented

12:21.970 --> 12:23.150
within our code.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.180
So do you think that this will make a difference.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.650
What do you think will happen now.

12:26.740 --> 12:30.150
So let's refresh it and click three and click 7.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.540
And now we see that once again we're only registering that one of them.

12:34.570 --> 12:42.400
So whatever event is presented last within the order of the code then that's the one that actually going

12:42.400 --> 12:45.150
to takes precedence when the element gets clicked.

12:45.310 --> 12:52.390
So always keep that in mind and that when you're using on click you can only have one click event per

12:52.450 --> 12:53.220
element.

12:53.410 --> 12:58.930
So even though both of these are different and they're going by the classes you can only have one per

12:58.990 --> 12:59.440
element.
