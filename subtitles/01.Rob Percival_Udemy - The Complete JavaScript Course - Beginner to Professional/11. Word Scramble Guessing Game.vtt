WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:01.800
Welcome back.

00:01.800 --> 00:05.310
And in this lesson we're going to create a word guessing game.

00:05.310 --> 00:09.320
So the objective of the game is to guess the word that.

00:09.450 --> 00:12.270
And we're going to have some words that we need to create.

00:12.270 --> 00:15.290
So first thing that we need to do is have an array.

00:15.290 --> 00:19.290
So let's set up an array and add some words into there.

00:19.320 --> 00:28.790
This can be any words to do javascript's And we're also going to make it that we're going to update

00:28.790 --> 00:35.040
it to check for where I transfer in the wall to lowercase when we do the check to see if the if the

00:35.840 --> 00:37.140
value is correct.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.500
So the case actually isn't going to matter on these words

00:44.080 --> 00:49.100
and you can have any number of values here within the within the array.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.150
And let's reuse some of what we had before.

00:53.150 --> 01:00.180
So this one is going to go back to gas and our would change it to our gas.

01:00.290 --> 01:05.360
So this is the function that we're going to use in order to check to determine if the player's guess

01:05.450 --> 01:06.330
is correct.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.270
So let's put that one up.

01:08.330 --> 01:13.330
So function our guess.

01:13.490 --> 01:19.160
So this will check to us to see if I'm correct.

01:19.190 --> 01:25.950
So another function that we need to set up is that we need a way to actually represent a word.

01:25.970 --> 01:32.510
So we want to represent a word within message that is scrambled and this word is coming from the array.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.210
So let's set up a function for that.

01:35.210 --> 01:41.760
So this is going to be the one that's going to so we'll call it s word.

01:42.010 --> 01:48.780
And basically this will scramble the word and show the word for the users in order for them to guess.

01:48.790 --> 01:51.130
So this one we need to initiate.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.020
So let's set it up that when the windows on load.

01:54.060 --> 01:57.640
So window on load.

01:57.820 --> 02:03.450
And we're going to fire off as word.

02:03.520 --> 02:11.190
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and grab a random word from the array and bring that

02:11.190 --> 02:12.820
into the S-word function.

02:12.810 --> 02:18.740
So we need to have random item from the array.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.180
So that's the objective.

02:20.510 --> 02:26.430
And then next once we have that random word we need to output that word within the message.

02:26.450 --> 02:31.700
So that is the first objective and then second output the word.

02:32.360 --> 02:32.900
So go ahead.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.840
Pause the video and add that in.

02:34.970 --> 02:36.330
So let me show you the solution.

02:36.350 --> 02:44.290
Coming up so we saw earlier that we can grab a random item from the array using the math.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.960
So let's do that now and we're going to do.

02:47.010 --> 02:49.330
We're going to create a variable called W.

02:49.440 --> 02:59.000
So basically this will hold our random word and we know that if we do my array then this is where we

02:59.000 --> 03:00.990
need to have that index value.

03:01.190 --> 03:05.800
So let's figure out that index value and I'm going to do this all within one statement.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.440
So we use math floor and we also use math random.

03:10.520 --> 03:16.970
So we've done this several times before and we know that if we multiply it by a value we get a random

03:16.970 --> 03:23.840
number from 0 to whatever number is that we're multiplying it by and the number that we need to multiply

03:23.840 --> 03:26.080
it by is the length of the array.

03:26.360 --> 03:31.510
So I put that in and we refresh it.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.700
We need to actually also output it into message.

03:34.730 --> 03:35.600
So let's do that.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.150
So this is inner so enraged him.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.910
And just to equal that to W..

03:42.050 --> 03:44.300
So let's go back out and refresh it.

03:44.510 --> 03:47.550
So now we've got the word refreshed again.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.980
So now we can see that we're getting some of these words at random.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.550
So that's what we want to do we want to get those words at random.

03:57.590 --> 04:03.460
So the next thing that I want to do is I want to transform W into lowercase.

04:03.740 --> 04:04.340
So go ahead.

04:04.340 --> 04:10.430
Pause the video and let's transform W into lowercase because we want

04:13.530 --> 04:15.440
all of the characters to be the same.

04:15.450 --> 04:18.050
And we've got some uppercase some lowercase.

04:18.210 --> 04:25.010
So let's do w and the method was to lower case.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.340
Or you could do it to uppercase as well.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.050
So this is it just in order to present that content to us.

04:31.090 --> 04:33.990
So to lower case and basically.

04:33.990 --> 04:40.240
Now when I refresh it we're always going to have a lower case where it doesn't matter that case that's

04:40.330 --> 04:41.700
available within the array.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.860
So when I have to have some type of consistency there.

04:44.860 --> 04:52.360
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to actually scramble the words so we can do this using

04:52.540 --> 04:56.870
some of the builtin methods that are available within Javascript.

04:56.950 --> 05:06.520
So let's create first we'll create a loop variable x equals zero and we're going to loop while X is

05:06.610 --> 05:11.400
less than the length of the the word.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.890
So w length.

05:14.050 --> 05:19.200
So this is going to work the same way as we saw earlier with arrays.

05:19.210 --> 05:24.910
So when we loop through all of the letters that are in the word then we're just simply looping through

05:24.910 --> 05:25.500
them.

05:25.510 --> 05:30.290
So now this is going to give us the ability to swap out a few of the letters.

05:30.370 --> 05:40.750
So let's next select a letter by index that you want to update and we're going to do a variable here.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.240
So I'm going to use I.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.970
So this is going to represent the index that we want to grab.

05:46.130 --> 05:50.660
So this is actually going to be very similar to what we just did over here where we're getting the length

05:50.960 --> 05:54.760
of the array because they're going to work within a similar type fashion.

05:54.890 --> 06:03.570
So what we need to do is we need to just pick a random item getting the index number from our word.

06:03.590 --> 06:07.840
So we've got instead of array the length is like w.

06:07.850 --> 06:12.470
So basically this is picking a random letter from our word.

06:12.710 --> 06:20.220
So the next thing that we want to do is add a placeholder here so let's set up a variable and this will

06:20.220 --> 06:21.930
be the scrambled word.

06:22.080 --> 06:28.950
So initially we're going to have it blank and we want to build out the word.

06:29.970 --> 06:37.010
So we're going to increment it and and we're going to build out this string.

06:37.020 --> 06:44.460
So we're starting out with nothing and we need to add in whatever character we had at that.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.830
So we've got the word.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.760
And we need to grab back the character that we had an index.

06:50.010 --> 06:57.540
So basically what this is doing is this is building out the variable s every time were irritating through

06:57.540 --> 07:00.810
the loop we're adding in a new character.

07:00.960 --> 07:10.440
And now all that's left is to simply remove out that one selected index value from our initial word.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.030
So let's do that.

07:12.030 --> 07:19.020
And we needed to provide word a brand new value and this time we're going to use substring and what

07:19.020 --> 07:26.550
substring is going to do is as we saw earlier that gives us the ability to start at zero and go all

07:26.550 --> 07:36.740
the way up to the index value that we want to select and then add it together with W and substring again

07:37.050 --> 07:43.120
and this time we're starting at the index value and we're just doing plus one.

07:43.590 --> 07:50.910
So what this is effectively doing is this is removing that letter from the word and basically allowing

07:50.910 --> 07:55.620
us to add it in here and then remove it from our initial word.

07:55.650 --> 08:02.340
So at the end of the day once we loop through this we can have our scrambled word and we can output

08:02.410 --> 08:02.690
that.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.280
Here we notice that something's wrong.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.120
So something's not working right.

08:07.290 --> 08:13.110
So again we need to do some troubleshooting and figure out what's wrong with our Javascript.

08:13.320 --> 08:18.840
So let's go back into our code here and take a closer look.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.090
Plus the video.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.980
And to take a look at this function and figure out what's wrong with it and I'll show you the solution

08:26.040 --> 08:35.540
coming up so if you had an opportunity to take a closer look and if you notice the problem is actually

08:35.540 --> 08:38.050
going to be this part of the loop.

08:38.270 --> 08:42.260
So what's actually happening is that we're taking.

08:42.320 --> 08:47.860
And we're rebuilding the length of w as we're shrinking it down.

08:48.020 --> 08:54.680
So when it comes in the initial work length of w is going to be whatever the length of the word is.

08:54.740 --> 09:02.540
But over here we're taking out that this letter from it and we're rebuilding W..

09:02.780 --> 09:10.450
So every time we loop through our W is shrinking and that's why we're not looping through enough times.

09:10.670 --> 09:14.500
So the solution is to create a variable.

09:14.660 --> 09:22.640
So this one would actually be the length of W and we need to grab that and hold that so that we're not

09:22.640 --> 09:26.720
actually changing how many times were looping through.

09:26.900 --> 09:33.500
So now let's go back and try it again and this time we can see that we're actually scrambling the words

09:33.560 --> 09:35.090
and the letters properly.

09:37.320 --> 09:41.340
So there was one final part to building out this challenge.

09:41.490 --> 09:45.370
And that was to actually do that the guess.

09:45.390 --> 09:53.010
So what I want you to do now again is to pause the video and build out this to check to see if whatever

09:53.010 --> 10:00.950
input is being entered in here and when the user hits I guess to check to see if their solution is correct.

10:01.350 --> 10:01.860
So go ahead.

10:01.860 --> 10:02.750
Pause the video.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.460
Make the necessary updates to the script and I'll show you the solution coming up.

10:09.890 --> 10:13.180
So I hope you had an opportunity to try this yourself.

10:13.340 --> 10:20.180
And one of the things that we need to do is we need to pick up whatever value was picked out of here

10:20.240 --> 10:21.340
at random.

10:21.560 --> 10:28.670
So we know that with W we're picking up a random value and this is going to be local.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.930
So this goes back to the local and global scope.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.460
So this we need to set up

10:37.900 --> 10:44.710
globally where we need to be able to register the random word so we can do it within this type of format

10:44.980 --> 10:52.660
because W here is dynamically changing so we can't set up w global because then we would have to make

10:52.660 --> 10:55.080
some more additional updates to our code.

10:55.090 --> 10:59.990
So let's go ahead and accept random word to whatever w equals.

11:00.070 --> 11:06.880
So that basically allows us to capture within the value the variable random word whatever this word

11:06.880 --> 11:07.480
is.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.840
And we actually know what the word is unscrambled.

11:10.960 --> 11:18.040
So let's go back let's save this go back to the page refresh it and let's try this again.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.280
So this time we can see that when where refreshing it.

11:23.500 --> 11:30.070
And now if I type in a random word in the console we can actually see what the solution is.

11:30.070 --> 11:37.480
So now it's up to you to add in that condition to check to see if we've actually selected the right

11:37.480 --> 11:38.140
word.

11:38.170 --> 11:44.240
And this is just a matter of picking up that value of the guess.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.370
So this is contained within the string object.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.720
So let's set that up.

11:48.740 --> 11:58.770
And two yes and equal that to document get element by ID so that the users guess is going to be contained

11:58.770 --> 11:59.990
within the value.

12:00.300 --> 12:07.890
And let's do a condition and we're going to check to see if the users guess is equal to the random word

12:12.840 --> 12:21.680
so checking to see if it's correct and if it is then we can update the message to say correct.

12:21.800 --> 12:29.930
So let's update message and in h t m l l it could be in our text as well.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.020
And we're just going to put correct

12:34.650 --> 12:39.640
and next we need to have an else condition so else.

12:39.780 --> 12:48.290
And if they didn't guess that then we're just going to say wrong wrong it was and then.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.020
Now let's add in that random word.

12:51.050 --> 12:55.330
So that was the actual solution that we were looking for.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.990
So less the user provided that they're going to get a message that it was wrong but we're going to see

12:59.990 --> 13:01.070
what word it is.

13:01.070 --> 13:04.000
So let's try this guessing game out.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.440
So we've got a word there and let's do a world.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.530
So we see that that was correct.

13:11.160 --> 13:17.800
And initially what we should do as well is we should launch as world again.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.880
So I know that's going to overwrite our message that with output with a new word so we can actually

13:23.940 --> 13:28.990
maybe output that message in another screen so that we can tell the user what's happening.

13:28.990 --> 13:34.950
So there's a few options there and it doesn't actually matter what happens but we need to launch another

13:34.950 --> 13:35.610
game there.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.180
So do S-word.

13:37.230 --> 13:45.220
So maybe for this one we can do message one and we'll set up another output here.

13:45.450 --> 13:52.530
And just simply equal that to message 1 and set up another element where we can pass a message to the

13:52.530 --> 13:53.610
user.

13:54.180 --> 13:58.040
So this time we're going to have message one.

13:58.680 --> 14:04.540
So this one isn't actually going to overwrite whatever the results were of the game.

14:04.590 --> 14:05.790
So let's try that again.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.370
So wrong.

14:07.410 --> 14:11.410
It was a low and we already get represented our next word.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.220
So we can try again and wrong again.

14:14.220 --> 14:20.720
It was javascript and we should also maybe add in that guess this word or something like that.

14:20.970 --> 14:28.910
So guess this word and concatenate it together.

14:29.190 --> 14:31.040
So let's try that one more time.

14:31.050 --> 14:34.770
So I guess this word and let's try Hello.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.180
So we see that wrong.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.330
It was Halo.

14:38.460 --> 14:46.020
And this is one last fix that we need to do is we need to transform them both to lower case so it doesn't

14:46.020 --> 14:51.840
matter if what the guest says and it doesn't matter what the random word is that we're going to transfer

14:51.840 --> 14:53.570
them both to lowercase.

14:53.700 --> 14:58.100
So now we see that let's let's do one more.

14:58.230 --> 15:03.750
So we see that we can get it wrong and I'm going to go now and try world.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.030
But I'm going to do an uppercase.

15:06.030 --> 15:10.100
So going back into our array we know that world is lowercase.

15:10.140 --> 15:14.130
So even if I guess world as upper case we're still going to get it correct.

15:14.220 --> 15:16.870
So no longer is a case sensitive.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.930
It doesn't actually matter if we're uppercase or lowercase.

15:19.950 --> 15:25.580
So this is just the default in case that because we don't want the users actually guessing.

15:25.770 --> 15:30.540
The case of the letters we just want them unscrambling the word.

15:30.660 --> 15:34.720
So in this type of format it doesn't actually matter how we're outputting it.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.690
So go ahead and try it for yourself.

15:39.790 --> 15:45.490
Update the array add in even more words and you can even add in some styling.

15:45.490 --> 15:47.760
You can also have a scoring mechanism.

15:47.890 --> 15:50.710
So go ahead out in a scoring mechanism as well.

15:50.710 --> 15:56.290
So you can do that by setting a variable SCORE and then every time they get it right then you can increment

15:56.320 --> 15:57.540
the score as well.
