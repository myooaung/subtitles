00:00.800 --> 00:04.730
Welcome back in this lesson we're going to build a pop up overlay.

00:04.820 --> 00:09.510
So they also sometimes called modals add in a little bit more text here.

00:09.710 --> 00:17.000
And this text is just a dummy text placeholder text so that I've got more content within my age to smell

00:17.210 --> 00:21.820
so good going in here refreshing it so you can use any page you want.

00:22.160 --> 00:31.790
So let's set this up and what we're going to do is we're going to use javascript to create the updates

00:31.790 --> 00:38.330
and the styling so we're going to stow it as visible and hidden or visible and depending on what the

00:38.330 --> 00:39.440
button gets clicked.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.850
So basically this is a pop up box that's going to show up on top of our content.

00:44.870 --> 00:50.240
So let's let's set this up and this can actually sit anywhere within our page.

00:50.270 --> 00:55.670
A lot of times you're going to find modals sit at the bottom and let's for this time put it at the bottom.

00:55.670 --> 00:57.160
So we need to give it an ID.

00:57.170 --> 01:02.160
So again this is just our way of identifying it within each Tamal.

01:02.270 --> 01:08.120
And usually the simplest is just having default ID.

01:08.420 --> 01:12.500
So we're not going to go into too much detail but basically that's it.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.170
So that's all we're going to do for that.

01:14.270 --> 01:22.830
And next let's set up a div and then inside of that div Let's get in some default content here.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.840
Nothing important.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.780
And so on so we can.

01:27.980 --> 01:32.390
And then I'll add in even more content within there as well.

01:32.390 --> 01:37.340
So let me just populate some content in there so we're going to add the javascript stuff so that we

01:37.340 --> 01:39.680
actually have some content within the overlay.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.110
So now when I go back in that page and if I refresh it.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.770
I've got the overlay there sitting at the bottom.

01:45.770 --> 01:52.730
So we also need to apply some styling to our overlay so that it actually is floating on top of our HVM.

01:52.880 --> 01:59.360
And I used to like to do this part early because then I'm going to hide it using the Javascript.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.960
So this is the styling part.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.030
And a lot of times with styling you need to be able to see it actually.

02:05.030 --> 02:11.670
So we need to set position and this is all going to be CSSA are saying position of absolute.

02:11.750 --> 02:16.300
So we can actually position that and let's do left at zero.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.590
And we're going to do right at zero as well.

02:22.950 --> 02:29.920
And let's add in some margin so we've got margin and left because I want this to float center.

02:30.100 --> 02:36.310
So we're senting the left margin to our middle and margin right.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.140
Auto.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.690
So that will give us the ability to float at center.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.580
We need to give it some with.

02:41.890 --> 02:46.160
So let's set it at 400 pics and height.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.780
So this one maybe 200 picks.

02:49.170 --> 02:58.390
And we also need to give it a background color so that we can distinguish it from the rest of the content.

02:58.470 --> 03:03.100
So a background color and I ask you to do slightly off of white.

03:03.130 --> 03:07.920
So do dee dee dee and lets out a border as well.

03:07.940 --> 03:15.350
Suborder 1 pick solid black border and of course you can style this however you want.

03:15.720 --> 03:22.710
So let's let's save that and go back out here and refresh it and we see it as such showing up there

03:22.740 --> 03:23.730
at the bottom.

03:23.730 --> 03:26.160
And also let's add in Zed index.

03:26.230 --> 03:33.000
So that will give it the ability to actually float on top so that index 1000 is usually a good number

03:33.000 --> 03:34.850
to use.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.870
So glad to see that and go back a bit.

03:38.610 --> 03:43.420
And also let's hide in the top so that one is also important.

03:43.500 --> 03:49.990
So this is how far off the top it is let's just set it 50 picks off the top go out here and refresh

03:49.990 --> 03:53.870
it and just make sure that it's showing up roughly where you want it to show up.

03:54.180 --> 04:02.220
So now next part of this is in order to initiate this and we're going to use this just via javascript.

04:02.220 --> 04:09.510
And let's go back down here and what we need is we need a way to actually call this so we can put this

04:09.510 --> 04:12.040
button anywhere and I'm going to do input.

04:12.270 --> 04:16.850
So we're going to basically copy this button and I'm not going to use the On Click event.

04:16.980 --> 04:22.740
So this is just something to do something a little bit different and it's going to delete that.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.760
And we need to give it an idea so we can grab to it.

04:28.090 --> 04:39.860
And I'm calling it all day and I'm going to call it a pop up window.

04:39.960 --> 04:40.500
So there we go.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.160
So now we've got our button.

04:42.210 --> 04:44.640
Let's go back out and refresh the code.

04:44.820 --> 04:50.580
And of course or overlay is on top so we do need to have one more thing within the styling and that's

04:50.640 --> 04:56.190
the visibility property and this is important because we're going to be actually this is the one that

04:56.190 --> 05:02.250
we're going to be adjusting via javascript so we know that hidden the way that hidden works and hidden

05:02.250 --> 05:08.520
is different than display none because it doesn't reserve any space within that page to him.

05:08.850 --> 05:15.430
So now that we've set this up we're all ready to make our connection and press the button.

05:16.330 --> 05:18.970
And have our pop up windows show up.

05:19.270 --> 05:24.790
So what I want and actually maybe even get rid of some of these buttons here so that it doesn't confuse

05:24.790 --> 05:25.490
us.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.490
So let's refresh.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.710
So now we just have that one button for a pop up window.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.760
So what I want you to do now.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.300
Is add the click event so pause the video.

05:35.300 --> 05:40.870
Open up your editor and create that button and add a click event to that button.

05:40.970 --> 05:47.450
So we know that that button has been clicked and then create a function for that button so we can just

05:47.450 --> 05:48.800
create an anonymous function.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.900
We don't have to link it to an actual function.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.340
So it's just an on click.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.180
And then it's going to fire off and show up overly.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.130
So go ahead and try that out and show you the solution.

06:00.130 --> 06:08.230
Coming up so the challenge was that we need to attach an event listener to this button.

06:08.460 --> 06:14.490
And we typically what we've been doing is we've been doing it within the attributes here on click and

06:14.490 --> 06:15.240
so on.

06:15.240 --> 06:20.660
So this is actually going to work the same way but we're just doing it just via the scripting a lot

06:20.700 --> 06:24.900
so we're not going to have anything within the H to model that's going to indicate that there's actually

06:24.900 --> 06:26.010
a click event on it.

06:26.190 --> 06:29.640
So we need to make our selection of the element.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.310
So I believe we had called it only.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.000
So always double check.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.360
So it is called Olay.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.360
So I'm able to grab the element that way.

06:37.740 --> 06:44.760
And what I wanted to do is I want to apply the On Click event and I also want it to fire off and I've

06:44.760 --> 06:49.370
got an anonymous function so I don't have any information that I'm doing with it.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.380
We're just simply firing off this function.

06:52.380 --> 06:58.260
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to grab that element and I going to set up a default

06:58.290 --> 07:08.400
global container here that's going to that we can use within this to basically create our element or

07:08.400 --> 07:10.020
actually we don't need to make a global.

07:10.020 --> 07:13.970
So maybe get rid of that because this is within a function.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.780
So let's set it up within here.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.490
So Al and here is where we're going to grab that element.

07:20.490 --> 07:27.940
So document and get element by id and this time let's grab that overlay.

07:28.970 --> 07:34.350
So the grabbing one and we're placing it with in the variable L.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.860
So now we're all ready to adjust our visibility.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.290
So that was style.

07:39.300 --> 07:49.470
So all style and it's visibility and then we need to equal the visibility to either hidden or visible.

07:49.470 --> 07:57.870
So what I also want to do is I want to make this button toggle so we know that if we set the visibility

07:57.870 --> 07:58.470
to

08:01.120 --> 08:02.270
visible.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.470
So let's let's start setting the visibility visible.

08:06.730 --> 08:09.020
Let's go back and refresh it.

08:09.250 --> 08:13.210
And now when I click it I actually have no way to get rid of it.

08:13.270 --> 08:17.940
And now this reminds me I should actually move this button off of here.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.510
So that's another thing that we need to take care of because we can actually see our button.

08:22.660 --> 08:27.040
So maybe let's place that button right at the top of our aged you know.

08:27.130 --> 08:33.410
So either way we still have no added functionality so even if it's at the top we can keep clicking it.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.990
And we don't see anything happening.

08:34.990 --> 08:38.090
We're not actually toggling the visibility.

08:38.500 --> 08:44.500
So this is where another challenge comes in for this lesson is to make this toggle so toggle between

08:44.500 --> 08:47.450
hidden and visible every time you press the button.

08:47.470 --> 08:54.160
So one will make it visible and pressing it again will hide it and then continuously be able to do that.

08:54.160 --> 08:59.330
So what I want you to do pause the video and think of how we can set that up.

08:59.350 --> 09:03.100
We can do it within a turn every statement or we can do it within a condition.

09:03.160 --> 09:09.070
So it's up to you and try to update the code so that you can pop the button and this will disappear.

09:09.190 --> 09:13.730
I hit the button again it will pop up and I'll show you the solution coming up.

09:13.950 --> 09:18.000
So my preferred way of doing this is actually the ternary operator.

09:18.210 --> 09:24.840
So we know what the turn every operator we can evaluate a condition and depending on the valuation if

09:24.840 --> 09:29.550
that's true then this gets fired off.

09:29.730 --> 09:35.790
And if it's false then this one gets fired off and that's exactly what we need for there because we

09:35.790 --> 09:39.740
don't actually need to have any additional variables or nothing else.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.000
We can simply toggle between the two depending on what the condition of the statement is.

09:45.180 --> 09:48.640
And now we just need to enter in a condition.

09:48.780 --> 09:57.170
So we're going to check to see if visibility is equal to visible and if it is that means it's true.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.700
So we're changing it to hidden.

09:58.800 --> 10:04.930
And if it isn't that means it's false and it equals hidden and we're changing it back to visible.

10:04.950 --> 10:09.600
So it's a quick way to create a toggle option within your javascript.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.220
So let's go back refresh.

10:11.370 --> 10:15.600
And now we can show what we can hide it show it hide it and so on.

10:15.750 --> 10:20.590
So this is the best way to create those pop up effects.

10:20.640 --> 10:26.870
And of course we can even do this and run the code in a number of ways within Javascript.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.710
So do try it out for yourself and try creating one of these pop up modals for your web page.
