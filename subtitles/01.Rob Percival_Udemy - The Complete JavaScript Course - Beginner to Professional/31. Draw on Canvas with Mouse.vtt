00:01.190 --> 00:08.690
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to combine our javascript event listeners mouse down mouse

00:08.690 --> 00:16.100
move mouse enter and we're going to show you how you can draw on your canvas using your mouse.

00:16.100 --> 00:22.040
So first of all let's set up a canvas supplement and we're going to apply some styling to that canvas

00:22.070 --> 00:23.210
element.

00:23.210 --> 00:27.370
And also let's create a window on load.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.890
So we're going to do the same thing that we've done in previous lessons where we set off a function

00:33.890 --> 00:40.110
because we want to make sure that the dorm has actually loaded before we try to interact with it.

00:40.190 --> 00:45.180
And also let's set up some widths for the canvas as well

00:48.240 --> 01:00.900
so set that up and sort of set up variable so canvas with and let's give it a nice wide width and also

01:00.900 --> 01:02.140
to canvas height

01:05.000 --> 01:08.340
so as to be fairly large as well.

01:10.420 --> 01:13.850
And then we also need to have that function function.

01:14.110 --> 01:20.290
I NIIT So whenever the page initializes them we're going to fire that off.

01:20.480 --> 01:29.340
So we go so we get a nice big canvas to work with so we grabbed canvas already let's add in some event

01:29.390 --> 01:30.560
listeners.

01:30.710 --> 01:32.360
So odd event listener.

01:32.450 --> 01:36.510
And we're going to add in several So we want to add most move.

01:36.830 --> 01:42.520
So this is the one whenever the user is actually moving that this is going to initiate the draw

01:46.340 --> 01:47.690
the mouse down.

01:47.960 --> 01:55.090
So whenever the mouse is down then we want it to grab and we want to be able to set up a position so

01:55.090 --> 01:58.070
that only the actual.

01:58.110 --> 02:04.470
So we're going to set position and whenever the mouse.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.830
So whenever the mouse is moving we're going to get the position.

02:07.970 --> 02:13.590
And whenever the mouse enters the canvas then we're also going to set position.

02:13.910 --> 02:17.800
So let's create those functions now we need to create draw.

02:18.130 --> 02:25.000
So that's the first function and we need to also create s position.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.780
So we're picking up the position of the mouse whenever it moves.

02:29.780 --> 02:39.640
So now we're ready to set up position so let's do this first and we'll do a console directory and we'll

02:39.650 --> 02:41.100
take that event object.

02:41.120 --> 02:46.210
So that target and we'll grab that within there.

02:46.220 --> 02:49.080
We could also pass it as an event as well.

02:49.130 --> 02:53.010
So maybe that's a little bit simpler we'll just pass it as the.

02:53.150 --> 02:56.350
And what we did earlier as well.

02:56.360 --> 03:03.530
Let's set up some variables and create an object for our positioning so that we know where we're drawing.

03:03.530 --> 03:09.050
So we're going to have for x zero and for y zero.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.990
So that's going to be our default positions.

03:11.990 --> 03:20.110
So whenever we're moving it we need to reset position of X to whatever the position of the mouse is

03:20.480 --> 03:24.150
and we're going to use Page X..

03:24.320 --> 03:31.460
So basically this is the coordinate relative to where the mouse is within the element that it's on top

03:31.460 --> 03:34.880
of because we're adding that event listener to that element.

03:35.090 --> 03:39.840
So I need to pick up where it's relevant to that position.

03:41.550 --> 03:48.720
So there we go should we should always have a position of x and y and maybe for now let's just put that

03:48.720 --> 03:50.610
into our output area.

03:50.610 --> 03:57.210
So variable output and document get element by ID.

03:57.330 --> 04:01.150
So it's GRABBE output so that we can write to it.

04:01.350 --> 04:13.590
And every time it moves let's update output and update the enraged him l to be X equals and then add

04:13.680 --> 04:27.290
the value of position X and then concatenate it with why and y equals position Y so let's try this.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.610
Let's refresh it.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.560
So refresh the page.

04:32.560 --> 04:37.720
So now whenever we're moving around we're getting the position of X and Y and we see them when we get

04:37.720 --> 04:39.260
to zero there.

04:39.280 --> 04:45.860
So this is roughly around 0 there and then all the way down to 700 by 700.

04:45.880 --> 04:52.540
So I've got a bit of an offset there but we do see that we've got roughly those positions of where we're

04:52.540 --> 04:55.150
located on top of that element.

04:55.150 --> 05:03.140
So the next thing that we need to do is we to actually draw our content onto canvas and now that we

05:03.140 --> 05:11.620
know that where the position of x and y is the next step is fairly easy or we simply draw that position.

05:11.780 --> 05:17.210
So it's going to draw and we're going to pick pick up that event object.

05:17.630 --> 05:23.490
And one of the things that I want to do is I only want to draw it whenever we press down on the mouse.

05:23.540 --> 05:31.100
So there's a really easy trick here that we listen for the buttons and if none of the buttons are equal

05:31.100 --> 05:39.080
to one then we can simply return back this function and we know that from earlier when we return back

05:39.080 --> 05:44.180
a function basically that voids the rest of the code that doesn't actually run through the rest of the

05:44.180 --> 05:44.810
court.

05:44.810 --> 05:50.240
So basically if the button isn't pressed down then it's not going to do anything else here within the

05:50.240 --> 05:51.080
code.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.180
So let me show you how that's going to work.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.790
So let's add in this output update.

05:56.090 --> 06:03.500
Let's go back and refreshed the page and we're going to see it's only when I'm clicking down that we're

06:03.500 --> 06:08.350
actually updating those values when I'm not clicking down right now and not clicking on the mouse.

06:08.390 --> 06:13.320
It's not updating then when I click on it it does update those values.

06:13.400 --> 06:19.850
So that's exactly what we want to happen is that we want only action to be taken whenever we're clicking

06:19.850 --> 06:20.540
down.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.570
So the next step is to add our drawing

06:26.330 --> 06:27.670
so let's add that in.

06:27.770 --> 06:30.790
And we've already got CTX set up.

06:30.830 --> 06:38.720
So first thing that we want to do is we want to begin a brand new path and then we want to do CTX and

06:38.720 --> 06:45.080
noticed that are not clearing it out because I don't actually want to clear out the contents so we simply

06:45.110 --> 06:54.260
want to move to a position in the position that we want to move to is position X and position Y.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.160
So wherever that's located.

06:56.160 --> 07:02.590
So basically wherever the mouse is currently setting then that's where we want to update those positions.

07:02.590 --> 07:10.240
Next thing that we want to do is we want to set the position so we're going to call that function

07:13.220 --> 07:14.190
and then let's do.

07:14.210 --> 07:19.950
Now it's out in a line so saw that there was a number of options with line.

07:20.060 --> 07:24.010
So now we can set where we're drawing our line to

07:26.820 --> 07:28.140
in order to draw it.

07:28.150 --> 07:31.960
We know we need CTX stroke because otherwise nothing happens.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.260
We don't actually see it.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.940
So we need to make sure that we're adding in that CTX stroke.

07:37.030 --> 07:39.540
So see what happens so let's refresh it.

07:39.610 --> 07:43.300
And now whenever we click down we're able to draw something.

07:43.450 --> 07:46.240
Move the mouse around and so on.

07:46.240 --> 07:51.180
So we see we've got the ability to draw within our page.

07:51.310 --> 07:54.210
We can also set some different parameters to it.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.510
So we saw earlier that we can update the color so we can go

08:01.660 --> 08:09.790
stroke style and let's say that two blue.

08:09.950 --> 08:14.340
So now when we refresh that well you can see that we've got a blue line.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.500
We can also set the width.

08:16.620 --> 08:22.140
So as long as we're doing it before the stroke all of this is going to take place so we can do a line

08:22.230 --> 08:23.020
with.

08:23.430 --> 08:27.190
And basically this is going to allow us to make a wider line.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.460
So it's 210.

08:28.690 --> 08:33.550
So be a nice big thick line there that we're able to draw with.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.780
And you see it's still kind of choppy.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.150
So there's a few other things that we can do.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.770
We've got some A-line options so we can do a line cap.

08:43.080 --> 08:48.080
So for line cap we've got an option to do around that cap.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.270
So I said around the top of wherever we're drawing.

08:52.390 --> 08:55.350
So that makes it quite a bit smoother as well.

08:57.610 --> 09:03.400
So now I wanted to add in some more Javascript challenges into this exercise.

09:03.400 --> 09:09.880
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor use the code that we've been using so far and

09:09.880 --> 09:19.330
create each team L5 color input and then whenever that gets updated that we want to update the value

09:19.330 --> 09:20.980
of the stroke style.

09:20.980 --> 09:26.800
So we're going to put this stroke value into a variable and let the user actually update it when they

09:26.800 --> 09:27.670
click it.

09:27.910 --> 09:32.410
So go ahead and add that in and I'll show you the solution coming up.

09:32.410 --> 09:36.610
So the solution is type and color.

09:37.290 --> 09:40.600
And let's give it an ID so that Id can be

09:43.980 --> 09:47.190
color or background color.

09:47.340 --> 09:53.140
So basically we want whenever this changes so we need to listen for the change on that.

09:53.210 --> 09:58.450
And whenever it changes then we want to actually update that color value.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.370
So that means we need a variable in order to contain it.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.550
So variable.

10:02.580 --> 10:09.360
And B what is call it background color and will set the default to to be blue

10:13.240 --> 10:16.420
and of course we're going to have a hexadecimal color come in from there.

10:16.690 --> 10:19.480
So keep that in mind as well.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.670
So no that's instead of blue.

10:21.730 --> 10:24.200
Let's just update to background color.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.620
So now we need to make it dynamic.

10:26.710 --> 10:31.370
We can also update it to read just to make sure that everything is working properly.

10:31.540 --> 10:35.310
So we do have read and we do have our color picker here now.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.280
So we should be able to pick a color.

10:37.310 --> 10:41.470
Hit OK and update that value.

10:41.560 --> 10:48.500
So let's grab that into an object so stewe variable Biji see.

10:48.790 --> 10:51.590
And because we've already got the background color set there.

10:51.630 --> 10:59.430
So let's do a document get element by id and we're going to grab that element information so the background

10:59.430 --> 11:05.810
color.

11:06.020 --> 11:16.870
And now we can an event listener to background color and let's add the listeners so let's do event listener

11:17.320 --> 11:21.220
and the listener that we're listening for is change.

11:21.220 --> 11:26.830
And whenever that fires off then we're going to run this function so it can set up an anonymous function

11:26.830 --> 11:27.400
here.

11:27.490 --> 11:32.720
And basically what we're going to be updating is the value of the caller.

11:32.890 --> 11:43.600
So let's do let's first of all let's log that console log event target and we want to grab the target

11:43.600 --> 11:44.180
value.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.910
So let's just make sure that we're able to grab that.

11:46.930 --> 11:54.550
So go back and refresh the page and let's let's just make sure that we were able to grab that color

11:54.580 --> 11:55.790
in the console.

11:55.810 --> 11:56.410
So there we go.

11:56.410 --> 12:01.890
So now whenever I do this I can grab that color there so that's perfect.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.090
And that's exactly what we want to do.

12:04.090 --> 12:15.110
So now it's just a matter of setting the value and so we can really use javascript effectively in order

12:15.110 --> 12:15.620
to

12:19.320 --> 12:22.440
update canvass information.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.590
So if we want it orange it's as easy as that.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.790
Change the colors.

12:26.850 --> 12:31.770
You can pick whatever colors you want now and all of them are going to work and you're going to be able

12:31.770 --> 12:40.680
to update your values so you can even add some more inputs here so you can do one for the line line

12:40.680 --> 12:43.010
with sort of set the line with 10.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.040
So you can make this dynamic as well.

12:45.040 --> 12:51.240
So a number of different options that you can add in and you can make a really effective drawing application

12:51.300 --> 12:54.540
really easily on Candace.

12:54.590 --> 12:59.150
So go ahead and try all of this so that you can make some updates to that as well.

12:59.180 --> 13:07.100
And then the next lesson I'll show you how to actually save it to an image and also how we can erase

13:07.100 --> 13:08.640
content here on the canvas.

13:08.630 --> 13:13.850
So if you've drawn something and you've made a mistake we'll show you how you can use an eraser and

13:13.850 --> 13:15.740
actually erase some of this content.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.570
So all that is coming up.
