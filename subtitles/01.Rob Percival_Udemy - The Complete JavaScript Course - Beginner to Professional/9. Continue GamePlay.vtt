Welcome back.

00:01.020 --> 00:04.200
In this lesson we're gonna do a quick improvement on the game.

00:04.200 --> 00:09.830
So currently we have a game where we have an element that shows up somewhere randomly within our container.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.740
We track how long it takes the user to click that element.

00:13.740 --> 00:18.840
So what if we want to make an improvement to this where we don't want the game to stop and start and

00:18.840 --> 00:20.390
always have that start button.

00:20.430 --> 00:25.080
That's all we're going to do in this lesson we're going to set up some intervals and have some timers

00:25.110 --> 00:26.160
that we need to clear out.

00:26.250 --> 00:30.100
And so that we can continuously keep playing the game.

00:30.180 --> 00:34.150
So we've got our event listener where we're adding in the Start button.

00:34.170 --> 00:39.900
So what we want to do here is we want to relaunch make items so this will make another item after we

00:39.900 --> 00:40.650
clicked it.

00:40.740 --> 00:48.480
We can get rid of the start game button to simply hide that one and we've got our score area so that

00:48.480 --> 00:53.520
one will still show up and instead of having a Start button we're just going to launch another element

00:53.810 --> 00:55.010
to try that out.

00:55.030 --> 00:56.250
So we've got our elements.

00:56.250 --> 01:01.800
We've got another element another element another element to it if we want to make it even more interesting

01:01.860 --> 01:08.820
where we want to have a timer so that setting up another object here called timer we're going to set

01:09.270 --> 01:10.650
the timeout.

01:10.890 --> 01:16.060
And just as we've been before we need some values here some parameters within the timeout it's going

01:16.050 --> 01:20.180
to run this block a code after the timeout completes.

01:20.190 --> 01:23.120
So right now we'll set it up for one second.

01:23.190 --> 01:28.440
And basically what will happen is we're going to show the element for one second and then we're going

01:28.440 --> 01:30.780
to get rid of it off of the page.

01:30.780 --> 01:38.040
So taking the container and we're removing the child with the attributes with the element that matches

01:38.040 --> 01:38.640
the div.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.340
And we've still got that div object and then we're going to create a brand new one.

01:42.360 --> 01:47.940
It's just gonna be a little bit of a problem with this because what's going to happen is that if we

01:47.940 --> 01:53.030
click it then we're gonna throw an error and if we don't click it then everything's fine.

01:53.130 --> 01:57.410
We're going to have a new square showing up every second.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.910
And so he's going to be moving around.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.920
So what we need to do is we need to update our code where we need to clear that interval.

02:04.920 --> 02:10.560
And that's why I give the interval a variable name so that we can access that interval and we can do

02:10.590 --> 02:13.060
a clear timeout or clear interval.

02:13.110 --> 02:14.700
And in this case it's a timeout.

02:14.700 --> 02:20.160
So we need to clear this one out before remove the child and this will give us the ability to click

02:20.160 --> 02:25.680
it not have it interfere with our gameplay so you can see that we're clicking it and we're updating

02:25.680 --> 02:29.520
the score and it actually doesn't matter so if we click it if we miss it.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.740
So sometimes we're clicking at sometimes we're missing it and so on.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.700
So this is more effective way to create the gameplay.

02:35.790 --> 02:41.820
So go in and add in these changes and updates and you're free to update and tweak the game as necessary

02:42.060 --> 02:44.470
in order to produce the gameplay that you're looking for.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.140
And coming up next we'll do a quick overview and a review of the code that we've worked on in order

02:49.140 --> 02:50.340
to build this application.
