00:01.370 --> 00:05.810
In this section we're going to be learning about the essentials of javascript.

00:05.810 --> 00:11.630
We're going to take a look at the most basic unit of javascript and we're going to look at the different

00:11.630 --> 00:16.850
data types that are available to us to build upon and build our code out of.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.010
So those are strings numbers and booleans.

00:20.060 --> 00:27.440
So those are going to be covered within this section and those are the most basic data types and data

00:27.440 --> 00:32.130
types within javascript javascript allows you to switch data types.

00:32.270 --> 00:38.030
So it's not that when you define a data type a variable with the data type that it has to stay that

00:38.030 --> 00:44.370
way you can redefine it and you can have dynamic different data types for those variables.

00:44.480 --> 00:50.670
So you can update that directly in the code and you're going to find that that javascript is very versatile.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.380
It's very easy to use.

00:52.400 --> 01:01.820
So when you try to write code javascript tries to render it out as best as possible and understand anticipate

01:01.970 --> 01:04.260
what you're trying to do with that code.

01:04.310 --> 01:09.890
And this is where javascript variables also become really important because this is one of the most

01:09.890 --> 01:17.350
fundamental units of programming being able to store a value in a variable and then call that variable.

01:17.360 --> 01:24.470
At any point within the script we're able to update reuse those values as needed within our Javascript

01:24.470 --> 01:25.340
code.

01:25.460 --> 01:30.110
In this section you're going to get familiar with the different data types and how they work and how

01:30.110 --> 01:32.510
you can use them within your code.

01:32.510 --> 01:38.720
There's also the prompt we're going to show you how you can get input and connect a javascript to what's

01:38.720 --> 01:46.010
happening with your web users and allow them to actually input a dynamic value that you can use as a

01:46.010 --> 01:48.740
variable directly within your code.

01:48.740 --> 01:54.200
So this is a first step in creating that interaction between your code and your web users.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.380
We're also going to look at different operators so we're looking at the sign meant.

01:58.390 --> 02:06.830
Operator arithmetic operators comparison operators and logical operators operators and Javascript allow

02:06.830 --> 02:11.950
us to ask a question and get a boolean value in return.

02:11.950 --> 02:18.830
So we know that it can either be true or false with a comparison operator with logic operators.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.410
We can add multiple conditions together and tell if they're true or false.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.380
And then do something with the boolean value.

02:27.410 --> 02:31.480
We're also able to assign values so we can incremented.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.740
We can't add values together.

02:33.770 --> 02:39.840
We can divide them we could subtract them we can multiply them and all of these are arithmetic operators.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.560
Well so there is plus minus multiplication.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.800
Divide and modulus.

02:45.800 --> 02:51.260
So all of this and a whole lot more is going to be covered within this section and it's going to get

02:51.260 --> 02:57.830
you started with the most basic units and to start your foundation for coding javascript.
