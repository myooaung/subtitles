00:01.250 --> 00:07.160
Welcome back in in the previous lesson we looked out how we can pick up information from you or Elgie

00:07.160 --> 00:12.740
saw an information using AJAX and retrieve it and then utilize it within our javascript.

00:12.750 --> 00:18.000
Then this lesson I wanted to show you that we can also post data to our.

00:18.020 --> 00:21.620
You are to a you are l and then retrieve back that information.

00:21.620 --> 00:28.190
So basically to simulate a server and queering into the server and there's a number of different

00:31.020 --> 00:33.120
ways to set up a server.

00:33.210 --> 00:41.440
So for the purposes of this lesson I'm going to be running zap and I've got a really simple ph P application.

00:41.490 --> 00:47.540
So if you're not familiar with HP you don't have to do a lot of coding.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.330
All it's doing is picking up those request variables.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.210
And if you don't have the ability to set up a local server you could always use zap.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.310
So this one is very straightforward.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.790
You can download it for Windows OSX and so on.

01:02.790 --> 01:09.520
Or you could just use your own web server and upload a simple DHP file in order to try the same.

01:09.660 --> 01:14.640
Now there's not a lot of open endpoints that you can post to.

01:14.880 --> 01:21.140
So this is why for this lesson I have had to set up the local machine that's going to run on my computer.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.320
And the one that I'm using is Zap.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.700
It's all I've done is I've started it and it's running in the background.

01:26.700 --> 01:32.670
So basically it allows me to launch APHC file and the purposes of this file.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.390
Very simple and straightforward.

01:34.410 --> 01:36.000
There's not a lot of code in here.

01:36.000 --> 01:45.780
All it's doing is taking the post request and the post request by name and age and it's just returning

01:45.780 --> 01:46.700
them back.

01:46.710 --> 01:52.650
So this I'm going to use in order to simulate picking up information and sending it to the server using

01:52.740 --> 01:54.680
AJAX.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.020
So let's go ahead and build this.

01:57.150 --> 02:07.300
So what I want it to do is I want to set up an input input field so that we can dynamically change the

02:07.300 --> 02:10.820
values that we're inputting and that we're sending over to the server.

02:11.110 --> 02:20.110
We're just going to give it a simple We'll give it an ID of ID text and then next let's do input type

02:20.170 --> 02:24.770
and we'll do a button and then we'll add an event listener to the button.

02:25.420 --> 02:26.140
So

02:29.010 --> 02:30.380
send data.

02:30.420 --> 02:36.470
So this one is actually going to send the data when it's clicked and we'll do it by.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.000
We'll just give it a value of send.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.340
So that's it for further H.T. m-L.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.900
Now let's jump into the Javascript.

02:43.950 --> 02:47.110
So what we want to do is we want to add an event listener.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.710
So let's go ahead and add that event listener.

02:49.830 --> 02:59.750
So document get element by id and we're picking up the element with the ID of send data.

02:59.760 --> 03:06.770
So basically whenever this gets clicked we want to initiate our AJAX call.

03:06.780 --> 03:16.940
So a listener and we're listening for the Click event and we're going to fire off my function.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.230
So just get to caught fire off a function called my function

03:24.190 --> 03:29.260
so next let's set that up and I'm going to just clean this up a little bit so it moves a little bit

03:29.260 --> 03:32.180
back and then move some space into here.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.380
So next thing that we do is set up the function.

03:35.570 --> 03:36.630
So my function

03:39.880 --> 03:44.170
and most of this is going to be similar to what we saw earlier.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.760
So there's not a lot of change.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.880
The only difference is I'm not going to be sending a get I'm going to be sending a post method.

03:49.990 --> 03:55.630
And also I'm going to be sending some data over so I'm going to be sending the data that we're going

03:55.630 --> 03:58.160
to pick up within that input field.

04:00.400 --> 04:05.580
So let's grab the value of the text.

04:05.680 --> 04:14.950
So this is the text that we're sending over so just call it XTi and do a document get element by id

04:15.250 --> 04:21.460
and we're going to pick up the value that's contained within here so we'll grab that elements and place

04:21.460 --> 04:31.090
the value next to that we want to do is set up a brain you X-amount HTP request so set up a variable

04:31.090 --> 04:36.940
an object in order to hold dots and we're going to do new X M-L HTP request

04:39.940 --> 04:47.500
so that places that object into the X a char variable and then next Let's listen for the ready state.

04:47.560 --> 04:54.340
So this time we'll do the ready state change and if the ready state changes then we fire off this anonymous

04:54.340 --> 05:01.820
function and then within here we're going to make sure that we do a check to see if they are ready state.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.680
Is equal to 4.

05:05.170 --> 05:11.110
And if it is then we know that we've connected and we can retrieve back that information.

05:11.110 --> 05:17.170
So also let's put let's actually update that output area with whatever we're retrieving back.

05:17.200 --> 05:27.050
So document get element by Id grab in that output area and we're updating the inner h t amental.

05:27.100 --> 05:32.640
So whatever we're retrieving back from the response text is what we're going to output there.

05:32.650 --> 05:37.660
So basically whatever the server outputs we're going to output within our output area.

05:37.780 --> 05:38.720
So what.

05:39.010 --> 05:45.950
What else do we need to do in order to make this fire off so I can close that up a little bit there.

05:46.210 --> 05:52.030
So the next thing that we know we need to actually open the file so this is where we put in that file

05:52.030 --> 05:52.610
path.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.960
And we saw this before as well in the earlier examples.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.670
So we need to specify the format.

05:58.750 --> 06:05.650
So this time we're going via post and then we need to specify where we're posting it to.

06:05.650 --> 06:08.140
So that's the end point.

06:08.350 --> 06:17.540
And then true so that we can go asynchronous and next thing we want to do is we want to send that ex-teacher.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.870
So send H.R.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.180
and we do need to add in some headers as well.

06:26.210 --> 06:35.030
So within the send format we're going to send the value for name because we're picking up a name here

06:35.090 --> 06:40.330
and we're picking up age so we need to specify that here.

06:40.850 --> 06:44.890
So let's it can be specified by text.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.870
And then this one we're not going to make this one dynamic.

06:47.870 --> 06:51.180
So we we connect them together with the end sign.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.290
And this one let's just give it a value.

06:53.300 --> 06:58.460
So give it a value of 50.

06:58.570 --> 07:03.400
So we're almost ready to send this over and there's a few other things that we still need to add in

07:03.400 --> 07:10.990
and so we're sending it over to our local file and remember we do have our server running and within

07:11.140 --> 07:16.100
because we're doing this locally we need to add in a header here to allow the access control.

07:16.210 --> 07:23.850
And also if you are running your local server you can go and you can grab that full address.

07:23.860 --> 07:29.290
So this is the same thing that we saw earlier when we were posting to or we are getting information

07:29.290 --> 07:33.810
from a Web site we need to go HTP Ford slash.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.600
And if you're actually running it on a server and if this file is running on your local host as well

07:39.760 --> 07:42.710
you won't have any of these problems with the Corps errors.

07:42.820 --> 07:48.130
And this is something that you need to be mindful of the fact that these coures errors are there built

07:48.130 --> 07:50.950
into javascript in order to protect your local files.

07:50.950 --> 07:55.360
So that's why you're going to run into these and that's why for this lesson we did have to set up a

07:55.360 --> 07:59.200
local machine in order to better illustrate how Polistes works.

07:59.200 --> 08:04.990
So you don't necessarily need to always do this if you're just uploading to a server.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.600
So just keep that in mind.

08:06.910 --> 08:12.370
So one other thing that we also need is we need to update the headers.

08:12.370 --> 08:18.370
So over a year we're updating the headers on the peace side when we receiving the information but we

08:18.370 --> 08:25.840
also have an option to update the request headers within the URL and that's because we're sending over

08:25.840 --> 08:26.590
data.

08:26.590 --> 08:31.960
So we've got to make sure that that data gets encoded properly and especially because we are doing a

08:31.960 --> 08:39.310
post we're not doing a get we need we need to set our request header and this is something that you

08:39.310 --> 08:45.660
do have to do depending on what type of data and what type of AJAX call that you are doing.

08:45.670 --> 08:51.530
So set request header and then within here you can specify different requests headers.

08:51.790 --> 08:55.840
So we're doing content type.

08:55.840 --> 09:01.810
So that's the that's the and you notice as well that it's within this type of format would do content

09:01.810 --> 09:06.160
type and then the next part is you are l encoded.

09:06.340 --> 09:13.880
Because we're getting it from a form we need to encode it so it's application for Slash SWW dash for

09:13.990 --> 09:15.820
you are all encoded.

09:15.820 --> 09:22.510
So after you've done all of this then you're ready to refresh your page and you can enter in some data

09:22.510 --> 09:25.270
here and you can see that we do a round trip.

09:25.270 --> 09:31.330
We pick it up on the server and the server outputs it and then the server puts that information there.

09:31.330 --> 09:35.200
I can also console log that response information.

09:35.200 --> 09:40.400
So basically this is equivalent to whatever is being output within the server.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.890
And that's what we see here.

09:42.010 --> 09:48.610
So as I update it it's actually going to do the round trip to the server and update my content within

09:48.610 --> 09:52.060
my page.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.850
And you can see that I added in the console log as well.

09:55.850 --> 10:02.140
So you can see the actual sending and receiving of the data that's happening here within the AJAX call.

10:02.270 --> 10:07.520
So I know this lesson has been a little bit of out of scope where we did set up the local machine but

10:07.520 --> 10:11.060
we did need this in order to illustrate that output.

10:11.180 --> 10:15.630
And also I know I was using upper case here you can use lower case as well.

10:15.650 --> 10:17.350
So that actually doesn't matter.

10:17.390 --> 10:23.300
So I just had an upper case so it would stand out that this is the method that we're using but the case

10:23.360 --> 10:28.450
it's not case sensitive so it can be upper or lower it doesn't actually matter.

10:28.510 --> 10:36.450
So unless you actually have access to a local machine and if you want to try this part out then you

10:36.450 --> 10:42.100
can go over to zap or you could set up another local machine or you could upload this to your server

10:42.190 --> 10:43.530
and try it out.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.650
Also remember that this is a need.

10:45.660 --> 10:53.230
You need to have server side code in order to pick up your post requests and be able to retrieve that

10:53.230 --> 10:55.690
information and make use of that.

10:55.690 --> 11:01.860
So again you do need to have some type of server in order to retrieve that information.

11:01.990 --> 11:11.050
And also depending on what where this request is coming from you might need to update the access control

11:11.050 --> 11:16.960
headers to avoid those coures errors that we saw earlier that were popping up within our application.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.130
So that's how you can send and post information using AJAX.
