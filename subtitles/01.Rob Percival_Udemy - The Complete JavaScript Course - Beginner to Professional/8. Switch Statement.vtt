00:00.410 --> 00:05.180
Woke up back in this lesson we're going to be looking at the switch statement.

00:05.230 --> 00:12.700
So previously we saw that the if statement allowed us to apply multiple conditions and continue to check

00:12.820 --> 00:17.770
and also have a default that if none of those conditions were true.

00:17.970 --> 00:23.280
So this is the same type of idea for the switch statement but it actually allows you to write it out

00:23.380 --> 00:24.610
quite a bit neater.

00:24.790 --> 00:32.040
So the switch statement is going to take one expression and I get to use my time that we're entering

00:32.080 --> 00:34.910
in and so my time.

00:35.110 --> 00:44.470
And then what it uses is the curly brackets and it uses the key word case.

00:44.470 --> 00:50.190
So basically this case is what evaluates the expression.

00:50.410 --> 00:53.120
So over here we've got a value here.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.970
And now let's check case.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.710
So our first case checked to see if the value is 8.

01:01.180 --> 01:06.330
And if this is true then we're going to execute some code here.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.630
So let's

01:11.510 --> 01:13.650
create a folder for.

01:14.040 --> 01:19.190
So I'm going to create h t m l i create a variable called H him.

01:19.270 --> 01:28.670
And now I can put each t about an equal that to good more or we'll just keep it the same as what we

01:28.670 --> 01:29.570
did before.

01:29.690 --> 01:39.570
Well do we wake up time and we get as many things to happen here as needed.

01:41.670 --> 01:51.350
And if we want to have another case so do Case 12 and this time the age to now will be lunch and that

01:51.350 --> 01:52.500
should be an equal sign.

01:59.800 --> 02:10.400
And next let's do case and this time was 2 4 p.m. so that should be sixteen hundred hours and also H.T.

02:10.410 --> 02:22.220
amount to be dinner Snel Let's go down to the bottom and I can assure you that.

02:22.510 --> 02:28.180
So the way that we set it up it's actually going to work the first time we run through and then I'll

02:28.180 --> 02:30.100
show you why afterwards.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.680
So let's update that with the HMO.

02:33.050 --> 02:37.120
So let's refresh and it's going to ask us what our IT IS.

02:37.150 --> 02:42.370
So let's say our 8 and we see that it returns back on defined.

02:42.850 --> 02:51.100
And what's happening here is that first of all the my time is not a number.

02:51.190 --> 02:56.480
So we need to update that to be a number so irritated.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.940
How does a number go back refreshed and all we get is

03:04.330 --> 03:07.800
we're missing one print this either.

03:08.820 --> 03:15.780
So let's refresh that it now let's try eight and we see that we get dinner in returned.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.780
So the problem here is that what's happening.

03:18.940 --> 03:27.240
Actually evaluating it as true over here and it's continuing through all of these cases.

03:27.250 --> 03:34.600
So if for example I do something that isn't true so if I do 5 We're going to just get undefine because

03:34.600 --> 03:37.930
we don't have a value being set for aged him up.

03:37.990 --> 03:45.310
So basically if one of these expressions one of these values is true to the expression that we've got

03:45.310 --> 03:50.250
in here then it runs through and it runs the code within the case.

03:50.350 --> 03:57.910
And this is where break is really important because break allows us to stop executing this particular

03:58.630 --> 04:00.560
this particular set of code.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.850
And this is where we are in break.

04:02.860 --> 04:08.130
So we need to add in a break for every single line here for every single case.

04:08.140 --> 04:13.360
Otherwise if we pick it it's just going to follow through on to the other cases.

04:13.360 --> 04:18.850
So once one of these cases is true unless you add in break then it will continue to run through the

04:18.850 --> 04:19.580
code.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.830
So let's try it again now and this time.

04:21.850 --> 04:26.670
Let's try and wake up time refreshed again this time.

04:26.670 --> 04:29.570
Let's try 12 and we see lunch.

04:29.740 --> 04:33.770
And this time let's try 16 and we see dinner.

04:33.940 --> 04:40.150
And now lastly let's put something in there that doesn't exist and we see we get 77.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.480
So this isn't an accurate time.

04:43.540 --> 04:48.970
We need to have a default something that says that there's nothing to do for that time.

04:48.970 --> 04:54.900
And this is where we can use case watch we have to use case we can do default.

04:55.210 --> 05:02.560
And basically what the default will do is this rule that HMO if none of these are true.

05:02.920 --> 05:11.110
So nothing to do and closed off.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
So refresh.

05:12.290 --> 05:16.390
And now let's do a time that we don't have anything existing.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.150
So we turned back nothing to

05:21.030 --> 05:26.940
the one thing that I do want to note that we saw that we had to switch this to a number because when

05:26.930 --> 05:29.620
we use prompt we're getting a string value.

05:29.700 --> 05:36.630
And that way we need to have them notching types so we can also see that by default.

05:36.630 --> 05:42.950
So this one is my type in the cases we can use strings as well.

05:43.020 --> 05:49.620
So we don't necessarily need to have numeric values.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.320
We can have cases as strings.

05:52.350 --> 05:59.040
So let me show you now that if I enter in 8 then it's still going to work because now we've switched

05:59.050 --> 06:02.650
it out and we're using the string now use.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.280
So let's make an update to this.

06:05.280 --> 06:18.700
So instead of returning back what we need to do let's say we enter in what action what are you doing.

06:18.870 --> 06:27.420
And instead of telling us it's time to wake up depending on the time we're going to say what we're doing

06:27.420 --> 06:30.680
so for eating lunch that it should return dot dot.

06:30.690 --> 06:39.090
It's 12 12 o'clock if we're eating dinner it should return like that it's 6:00 p.m. if we're waking

06:39.090 --> 06:44.470
up then it should turn return back not it's 8:00 a.m..

06:44.910 --> 06:51.180
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor make those updates to the switch statement and

06:51.240 --> 06:59.510
try it out and get that output coming into that elements on your web page and show you the solution.

06:59.580 --> 07:08.890
Coming up so good an opportunity to try it out and we saw that we can really easily switch and have

07:08.950 --> 07:15.820
multiple different types of cases here within the switch statement and we can also use strings or we

07:15.820 --> 07:24.920
can also use numbers and if we use numbers of course if the case is a number then we have to also have

07:25.220 --> 07:30.330
the switch condition also to be a number as well.

07:30.440 --> 07:37.640
So the expression has to match with what the case the expression output evaluation has to notch to be

07:37.700 --> 07:39.380
whatever the case is.

07:39.380 --> 07:41.500
So now let's make that update.

07:41.840 --> 07:50.670
So is it that we get up so we know that the time that we get up is going to be 8 a.m.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.830
and this one is lunch.

07:57.830 --> 08:08.870
So we know that we're eating lunch at 12:00 and that's 12:00 p.m. and then dinner and we're eating dinner

08:09.110 --> 08:09.410
at

08:13.160 --> 08:17.090
6pm.

08:17.110 --> 08:25.630
And lastly let's do something where I'm not found or something like that so we get some type of message

08:25.630 --> 08:27.530
coming back to the user.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.050
So let's try this out.

08:30.170 --> 08:30.910
So let's see.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.300
What are you doing.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.230
Lunch.

08:33.500 --> 08:41.190
We see that the time is 12:00 p.m. We're going to see dinner time is 6 p.m..

08:41.190 --> 08:47.570
Refresh it and get up and make sure that that case matches.

08:47.690 --> 08:48.320
And there we go.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.470
So we've got we've got it working.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.330
And this is how you could use the switch statement.

08:53.360 --> 08:57.160
So remember that to include the breaks within the switch statement.

08:57.170 --> 09:05.480
Also remember to make sure that the case matches whatever is here with your evaluated expression and

09:06.290 --> 09:11.330
make sure that everything is matching up and the next lesson I'm going to show you even more that we

09:11.330 --> 09:16.550
can do with the conditional statements that if statements and switch statements.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.370
That's coming up.
