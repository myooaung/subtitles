00:00.980 --> 00:06.300
Book back in a previous lesson we built it and we showed you how you can append child.

00:06.410 --> 00:09.800
And then eventually add it into the aged him.

00:09.980 --> 00:15.770
So now I'm going to show you a shorter way to do this because this was quite long and we did have to

00:15.770 --> 00:21.050
loop down because we have a bunch of table cells in there so the TT's and we had to loop through each

00:21.050 --> 00:28.010
one and now we're looking at having to add attributes to them and adding classes so we can go through

00:28.010 --> 00:34.430
this type of format where we can set attributes to the T R and we can set both those data row and the

00:34.430 --> 00:36.040
data values there.

00:36.110 --> 00:39.960
And then also we can add a class to that Tedi.

00:39.980 --> 00:43.440
So to that first tee and that way that would actually work.

00:43.610 --> 00:48.800
But I'm going to show you a shorter format and this is going to actually save us a little bit of time

00:48.800 --> 00:49.340
here.

00:49.340 --> 00:54.850
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just comment out all of this.

00:54.980 --> 01:01.340
And one thing that we've learned previously is that once we've got the element then we can't update

01:01.340 --> 01:02.330
things like that.

01:02.390 --> 01:09.650
Each to UML and meaning that if we're updating the interface to UML that basically means that we can

01:09.650 --> 01:13.160
write out all of the inner content that we want to hear.

01:13.210 --> 01:20.990
Let's do TDD and let's let's add in those values first so we're just going to have some default placeholder

01:20.990 --> 01:21.830
values.

01:21.830 --> 01:30.530
So we'll do 10 and I'm going to copy and paste this over and this is just saves us a little bit of time.

01:30.680 --> 01:36.560
So now the rest of this is going to be the same when I go back out here and if I refresh it and if I

01:36.560 --> 01:40.830
hit add that we can see that we can actually add to the new value.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.770
So we know that this one here is going to have a value of

01:48.950 --> 01:51.900
whatever the array length plus 1.

01:52.130 --> 01:59.360
And we know that this one is going to have the value of the value that we've picked up.

01:59.360 --> 02:08.880
So this is going to hold the value of Q So he can add that one in and then lastly this one is zero.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.360
So we can zero that.

02:10.520 --> 02:17.330
So now let's try this out and go back to the page refresh it and let's type in test and we can see that

02:17.330 --> 02:19.280
we can add it in the same way.

02:19.370 --> 02:23.390
So we didn't actually have to spend all these children we could just do the to a male and we only have

02:23.390 --> 02:25.100
to pen that one element.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.700
So it makes things a lot simpler.

02:26.750 --> 02:32.090
But it was worthwhile going through that exercise just to get familiar with what you can do within that

02:32.090 --> 02:32.680
done.

02:32.900 --> 02:37.440
So the next thing that we want to do is we want to add in all of these attributes.

02:37.550 --> 02:43.250
Now unfortunately we still need to go through that same process where we're adding attributes where

02:43.250 --> 02:49.040
we're setting those attributes because we don't have the ability actually to do it within each team

02:49.040 --> 02:49.660
Mel.

02:49.910 --> 02:58.370
So let's create some attributes and this is another great practice exercise in creating attributes within

02:58.460 --> 02:59.410
that cell.

02:59.450 --> 03:04.190
So we know we can do.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.310
So let's let's just simply create out those attributes.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.950
So we had one that was the vote.

03:10.020 --> 03:16.830
So I'm going to just give it a value vote and the other one that we're creating is when we go down and

03:16.830 --> 03:20.520
just see what we had we had one that was called Data roll.

03:20.550 --> 03:24.190
So let's do a variable roll and variable vote.

03:24.420 --> 03:28.580
So we know we need to add and create an attribute.

03:28.800 --> 03:37.230
So let's go ahead and do a document and create sort of creating an attribute and then we can attach

03:37.320 --> 03:40.460
this attribute to that cell.

03:40.470 --> 03:50.550
So that was a data vote was the attribute that we wanted to create and that would work if we just simply

03:50.550 --> 03:52.140
want it to create the attribute.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.780
But we actually want to set a value slits to set attribute.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.300
And this one requires the two parameters.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.410
So the first one is the attribute name.

04:01.410 --> 04:04.990
And the second one is the value that we want it to create.

04:05.010 --> 04:10.970
So we know that this value is actually going to be the value that's contained within here.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.630
So let's set that up.

04:12.690 --> 04:16.950
And this is just simply the index value of that particular element.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.980
And the next thing that we need to do is suspect.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.200
So that was roll and actually sorry I just got those backwards.

04:23.220 --> 04:28.350
So this one is data roll and for data roll.

04:28.470 --> 04:34.220
This is the value that we have and for data vault the value that we have is simply zero.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.470
So that's where we're starting out at zero.

04:36.750 --> 04:45.320
So now the next thing that we need to do is we need to attach those attributes so instead of actually

04:45.320 --> 04:48.890
setting up those values we can do it this way.

04:48.950 --> 04:56.730
So basically now we're attaching those attributes to the TR Which is exactly what we had down here.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.830
So let's go back and let's try this out.

04:59.870 --> 05:03.340
So let's just see and then we'll inspect the HMO.

05:03.500 --> 05:09.830
So let's do an inspection on this and let's make this a little bit bigger so we can actually see what's

05:09.830 --> 05:10.590
happening.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.650
So we see that we've got.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.170
So everything all the parameters are the same.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.760
We've got a data roll

05:20.710 --> 05:25.370
and one of the things that I noticed that we're actually sitting outside of the table body.

05:25.420 --> 05:30.700
So we do need to take care of that that we need to actually added in to the body so that it's in line

05:30.700 --> 05:34.540
with the rest of them but we can't really see that there's a difference there.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.720
But either way that we should add it to the body.

05:37.900 --> 05:42.810
So because the structure is being done within this type of format but everything else is the same.

05:42.820 --> 05:48.420
And the only thing that we're still missing is that we need to add the class to that first table role.

05:48.580 --> 05:55.430
And this is actually really easy because we can simply do this and we can do a class box and that will

05:55.570 --> 05:57.270
be in that class.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.860
So let's also make an update of where we're adding it in.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.770
So we're not adding it in as the parent of table.

06:03.780 --> 06:08.790
But we wanted to add it to the body.

06:08.830 --> 06:14.150
So now let's refresh that and let's see if this works.

06:14.380 --> 06:18.720
So now we're able to add in test let's do an inspection on there.

06:18.820 --> 06:24.590
So this time it added in nice and neatly with the rest of them into the T body.

06:24.970 --> 06:31.480
So the one thing that we do notice that we don't have the event handlers attached yet and that's because

06:31.570 --> 06:34.690
the event handlers were being done within this function.

06:34.720 --> 06:41.100
When we built it and I know that we could simply remove all of this we could append it to the array

06:41.350 --> 06:47.490
and we could just simply go to build and that would actually rebuild the array and then we could we

06:47.560 --> 06:48.010
added.

06:48.130 --> 06:51.620
So that would be actually the shortest way to accomplish what we're trying to do.

06:51.740 --> 06:58.290
But we are trying to learn and to try to go through all of what's possible within the DOM.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.810
So now we're left with one last thing that we need to do.

07:02.890 --> 07:07.010
We need to attach the event handler to that particular element.

07:08.350 --> 07:11.110
So we do have a few options as well.

07:11.110 --> 07:17.530
So probably one of the easiest ways to do would just be simply to grab out all of this functionality

07:17.560 --> 07:22.140
and put it in a separate function and maybe that's what we're going to do for now.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.180
So that way we're just going to reconnect all of those as click event handlers.

07:27.310 --> 07:33.990
So we're going to keep the build separate from the one that we're adding the vote count.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.400
So this is the vote count function.

07:36.490 --> 07:42.640
And basically what this is going to do is this is going to give us the ability to update and add those

07:42.640 --> 07:43.560
click events.

07:43.630 --> 07:48.030
So that's all we're doing over here and we're this is all self-contained.

07:48.130 --> 07:55.870
So if we go over to add in a vote count over here within the build function we can simply call to vote

07:55.870 --> 08:01.180
count as well within our function that we've just built note here where we're adding in all of those

08:01.210 --> 08:02.090
elements.

08:02.110 --> 08:07.380
So basically once it gets appended then we need to run our vote count.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.270
And we're also going to add to the array as well.

08:12.400 --> 08:18.490
And now let's try this out and really there are always a number of different ways to do this.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.030
So now we've got that one working we've got that one working.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.350
We've got that one working.

08:23.350 --> 08:25.530
So everything is working properly.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.390
So let's go the dot again.

08:27.460 --> 08:32.880
And now we can see that we've got the new vote counts are all hooked up and ready to go.

08:33.340 --> 08:38.100
So that's how you can make updates and create brand new elements.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.130
And now we can add as many as we want.

08:40.150 --> 08:46.150
So if we get more friends we can always add them to our list and then we can vote on them.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.150
So this is all done dynamically.

08:48.220 --> 08:53.530
And also depending on how many friends we have in our original array all of this functionality will

08:53.530 --> 08:57.900
work as well.

08:57.970 --> 09:04.990
So go ahead and try to do it for yourself and build it out and then also practice with adding and creating

09:05.050 --> 09:11.530
brand new elements and then also adding attributes to those elements that are in line with what you're

09:11.530 --> 09:17.560
trying to do and the type of functionality that you're trying to get to happen within your javascript

09:17.560 --> 09:18.440
application.
