00:00.240 --> 00:03.200
Let's I did an event listener for starting the game.

00:03.210 --> 00:04.610
So we've got our start.

00:04.610 --> 00:06.950
Game object that we create in the previous lesson.

00:07.470 --> 00:11.850
Adding an event listener to that that that listener that we're adding in is a click.

00:11.850 --> 00:17.150
We'll do an anonymous function so containing all of the functionality that we need on the click.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.100
Within this set of code here.

00:19.110 --> 00:21.350
So what do we want to happen.

00:21.450 --> 00:27.960
And one of the things that we want is we want to take that start game object and update its style properties

00:28.230 --> 00:30.030
to be display none.

00:30.050 --> 00:33.690
Because we don't want the user to have the ability to click the button again.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.240
So only one click of that start button.

00:36.330 --> 00:39.000
So let's try that out click and it disappears.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.680
Still on the page but it's being displayed none.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.450
Let's also create a random wait time random time using math random method from javascript.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.080
We can multiply it by two thousand and then we'll add 1000.

00:55.110 --> 01:01.680
So we always have at least 1000 milliseconds or one second before we start the game and we make the

01:01.680 --> 01:02.460
item.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.730
So setting up the set timeout.

01:05.010 --> 01:11.460
And what this will do is this will execute a function or a code snippet after a specified delay so it

01:11.460 --> 01:19.740
can call it make item the function and random time is the time period that it's going to wait until

01:19.740 --> 01:21.500
it executes the function.

01:21.510 --> 01:27.650
So what this is going to do whenever we press that start button It's going to select random time.

01:27.660 --> 01:34.380
So it could be anywhere from one to three seconds and it's going to start the process of having the

01:34.380 --> 01:36.660
element show up that we have to click.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.270
And timing that element as well.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.570
Next let's set up a function that will make the item.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.750
And this is where all of the gameplay will take place.

01:45.810 --> 01:52.290
So add that ability to start the game with the start button set up a blank function to make the item.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.850
And coming up next we'll show you how to complete the game and the gameplay.
