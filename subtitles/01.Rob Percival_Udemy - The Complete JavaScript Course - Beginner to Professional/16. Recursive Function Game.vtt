WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:09.940
We'll come back and with functions you can actually call a function you can call a function within itself.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.310
So basically that technique is called recursion.

00:13.340 --> 00:15.990
It's going to show you an example of that.

00:16.050 --> 00:21.990
So we would take what we do earlier where we have a secret word and we're putting some content into

00:22.020 --> 00:23.280
our elements here.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.080
So let's create a function.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.920
So we created one for on click event where we're going to launch start.

00:30.070 --> 00:37.020
So because actually this function is going to start our whole process where we're going to be prompting

00:37.110 --> 00:41.640
and we're going to get a secret.

00:41.640 --> 00:48.570
So let's let's set up a function in order to test our response here that we're going to get from the

00:48.570 --> 00:49.150
prompt.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.160
So we're going to test the value of the product to see if it's equal to the secret word.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.290
And then within function.

00:57.380 --> 01:08.540
So indirectly we're going to prompt and ask the user for what is the word and questionmark and then

01:08.630 --> 01:15.900
down here we need to create one more function that's going to actually check and get a secret word.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.880
So we're passing in parameters.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.250
Let's call this secret

01:21.790 --> 01:28.450
and we need to have a conditional statement so that conditional statement has to check to see if we've

01:28.450 --> 01:29.990
got the word correct.

01:30.210 --> 01:38.290
So we're passing it in as a volume here called secret and we need to compare it to see if it's equal

01:38.290 --> 01:40.480
to what our secrets were.

01:40.510 --> 01:41.130
Yes.

01:41.290 --> 01:50.610
So what's the condition in order to do that so we're going to compare secret to see if it's equal to

01:50.610 --> 01:53.380
a secret word.

01:53.830 --> 02:02.990
And if it is then we know that we've got it correct and we're going to put it to the inner HMO and we

02:03.030 --> 02:10.650
would say you are correct otherwise so lose an else.

02:10.660 --> 02:20.060
So yes we basically want to initiate a prompt again and get the user to asked to be asked the same question.

02:20.290 --> 02:21.560
So we have a choice here.

02:21.610 --> 02:27.980
We can just do start and then we'll go to that function and we'll launch our function that we're here

02:29.020 --> 02:33.900
or we could go directly with the function that's within start.

02:34.060 --> 02:42.650
And this is kept secret within that secret and now maybe let's update this to say yes again.

02:43.010 --> 02:44.560
And now let's try this out.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.230
So start thinking What is the word.

02:47.230 --> 02:52.810
So this time let me enter it in Java and now it says guessing games or javascript.

02:52.980 --> 02:57.660
And yes again because it's case sensitive we've got to make sure that it's correct.

02:57.730 --> 02:58.490
So there we go.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.140
So it says you are correct.

03:00.340 --> 03:02.950
So if you want to start again there we go.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.190
We can try to guess the correct word once again

03:09.210 --> 03:11.270
so well I want you to do now is.

03:11.270 --> 03:18.050
Pause the video and update the script to have an array of possible words.

03:18.090 --> 03:21.780
Pick a word out from the array randomly.

03:21.870 --> 03:28.260
And so that way the script can be dynamic and have a selection of words that could be the secret word

03:28.560 --> 03:33.540
and then let the user try a bunch of different words and keeping the recursion in there.

03:33.540 --> 03:37.820
So we're calling back to the function within itself.

03:37.860 --> 03:42.990
So I think that would be different is when we initially started thinking we're going to be adding in

03:43.130 --> 03:53.670
the ability to pick a random word using from our array within start so go ahead and try that out and

03:53.660 --> 04:02.480
I will show you the solution coming up so a solution is to transform this into an array so we know what

04:02.580 --> 04:12.180
we can do that by updating and let's have a number of different possibilities here so see us as JavaScript

04:12.690 --> 04:17.090
and H-2 mail and web site or something like that.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.660
So it doesn't really matter we've got four words in there that we can make use of.

04:21.660 --> 04:28.140
So what we want to do is when the user hits start that's what we want to pick the word that's going

04:28.140 --> 04:34.240
to be the secret word and we need to pick actually random value here.

04:34.590 --> 04:45.850
So let's set up this and say mystery number and this one right now we're just we're just going to clear

04:46.020 --> 04:50.590
out the variable and then with it here whenever we start.

04:50.670 --> 04:58.020
This is where we're going to use that mystery number and we need to use that in math.

04:58.050 --> 05:04.990
So this is built into javascript gives us the ability to make random numbers so random.

05:05.100 --> 05:05.940
So using math.

05:05.970 --> 05:06.720
Random.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.230
And we want to multiply it by.

05:10.230 --> 05:15.620
We've got an array here and we want to do secret word length.

05:16.440 --> 05:26.310
So this will actually give us a value of within the secret secret word length and Swing code to check

05:26.310 --> 05:26.740
it.

05:26.850 --> 05:29.330
All we need to do is add that in.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.410
So we're actually not going to know what the word is.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.030
So let's save this.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.220
Refresh it.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.970
And I believe I have to cancel out of this to refresh it.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.760
So it's refreshed thinking and try this again.

05:43.620 --> 05:48.600
So what is the word Let's try javascript and it's not javascript.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.610
It's strange to so took him out so I guess us.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.610
So let's see this.

05:53.760 --> 05:59.850
Let's try a web site so that time it was Web site and we have the ability to play the game again like

05:59.900 --> 06:05.660
game was so much fun that we're going to just continue to try it and this time let's see what the word

06:05.690 --> 06:06.340
is.

06:06.350 --> 06:09.390
So this time it was Javascript.

06:09.390 --> 06:12.190
So this was again the last gust that I made.

06:12.230 --> 06:17.050
So you could play the game multiple times and you can it's dynamic.

06:17.050 --> 06:23.260
So if you add more words into the array than the script will adjust accordingly.

06:23.570 --> 06:25.560
So you get the last one that I tried.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.370
So have some fun with this.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.480
Create some nice interesting secret words.

06:31.580 --> 06:38.270
Try thinking for yourself and use make sure that you get used to using the recursion.

06:38.270 --> 06:41.500
So basically that's calling the function within itself.

06:41.690 --> 06:45.060
And this is really use in place of a loop.

06:45.080 --> 06:51.310
So typically you might have a conditional statement here and then you've got the prompt again.

06:51.330 --> 06:57.800
So this is a better way of doing that where you simply call back to that statement until you actually

06:57.800 --> 07:03.290
get the result that you want and then you continue to loop through that function until you actually

07:03.290 --> 07:05.090
get the correct result.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.780
So that's one of the benefits of doing it this way.

07:08.790 --> 07:14.850
As important to keep in mind that this actually it won't break out of your until we've actually hit

07:14.910 --> 07:21.390
the right values so it will continue to have these prompts until the right value is set up.

07:21.390 --> 07:28.710
So just like when you have loops you always think that there should really be a way out of it and always

07:28.710 --> 07:35.500
having a way out of your your function is something that you should include as well.

07:35.820 --> 07:36.540
And keep in mind.
