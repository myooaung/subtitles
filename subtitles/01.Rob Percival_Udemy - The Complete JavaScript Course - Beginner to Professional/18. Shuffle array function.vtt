00:00.960 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:07.590
And in this lesson we're going to build out a really useful function and this could be one of the functions

00:07.590 --> 00:14.160
that you keep within your library of functions because it's super useful with javascript and this is

00:14.160 --> 00:18.980
the ability to shuffle your items with it array.

00:19.110 --> 00:22.880
So we've got an array here and this is the same one that we use previously.

00:23.010 --> 00:28.970
And what I actually want to do is I want to shuffle the array so I build a function.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.830
Am I going to have that strt function.

00:31.860 --> 00:42.330
And basically what the start function is going to do is give them a call to shuffle the array.

00:42.330 --> 00:45.330
So you going to create another function to shuffle the array.

00:45.450 --> 00:51.960
And I also want to pass in those array values so that we can we can shuffle those as well.

00:52.020 --> 00:56.880
So let's shuffle the array and the read that we're shuffling is secret word.

00:57.270 --> 01:00.840
And then what we want to do is we put it.

01:00.840 --> 01:11.670
So again we need to set up the put so put equals don't commence get element ID screw scrub the output

01:11.760 --> 01:14.240
element into our object.

01:14.270 --> 01:22.070
And every time we shuffle let's let's put what our area looks like.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.970
So we'll put our array and order should actually change.

01:26.970 --> 01:35.040
So let's now set up the function in order to shuffle array and we're taken that one parameter which

01:35.040 --> 01:38.640
is going to be the array and we're passing that in.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.960
And then here is where all the magic is going to happen.

01:44.360 --> 01:50.800
And once I finish shuffling that rate let's return that new array value.

01:51.020 --> 01:57.710
So right now whenever we refresh refreshed we're going to just simply get output and I should put a

01:57.710 --> 01:58.720
line break in there.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.680
So it's more readable.

02:01.910 --> 02:02.910
So let's try that again.

02:02.930 --> 02:07.360
So now every time I click it we still get the same order.

02:07.370 --> 02:12.720
So the idea here is that we want to take the rate order and we want to shuffle it around.

02:13.310 --> 02:18.250
And this is going to be a really useful function when it comes to arrays.

02:18.290 --> 02:25.370
So I use it quite often when I'm working with arrays and I use this function to shuffle the values within

02:25.370 --> 02:26.090
the arrays.

02:26.300 --> 02:33.740
So we need to create a loop so let's create a loop starting with the value of x and we give it a value

02:33.800 --> 02:37.610
of whatever the length of the array is that's passed in.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.650
So this is what makes it dynamic.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.590
We also have to subtract one because we know that arrays start at zero.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.850
So I want to make sure that I'm able to count down all the way to zero.

02:49.180 --> 02:59.420
So let's do a B minus one and we're going to loop while x is larger than 0 and we're going to decrease

02:59.480 --> 03:04.520
the value of X by 1 through every iteration of the loop.

03:04.970 --> 03:11.930
So we know that we're picking up that this serie A secret were array is being passed and here we're

03:11.930 --> 03:19.120
passing it in to this function as a parameter here so this argument is being passed in as a parameter.

03:19.250 --> 03:23.360
And we're able to make use of it within our array.

03:23.720 --> 03:32.430
So now we need to set up a variable and this variable is going to be holding holding values.

03:32.450 --> 03:40.520
I usually just call that Holder and call to the math floor and this is similar to what we just did previously

03:40.820 --> 03:47.300
where we get a random value for the items in the array.

03:47.300 --> 03:55.280
So this time we know that we have all of the values within the array under X and we're going to do X

03:55.280 --> 03:56.190
plus 1

04:00.220 --> 04:04.260
so this is going to give us one of the items that are in the array.

04:04.300 --> 04:11.140
And as we decrease the number of items left within those random formula are going to change as well.

04:11.140 --> 04:17.080
So there's going to be a possibility to take several items and just swap them randomly so basically

04:17.140 --> 04:18.200
that's what we're doing.

04:18.340 --> 04:25.320
And as we loop through the array we're going to select two different items and swap positions.

04:25.480 --> 04:31.570
So the holder is just selecting a random item from the array that's available.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.140
And next we need to set up a tent.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.720
So this is going to be our Ted value from the array.

04:39.010 --> 04:44.070
So all we need to do is set up and use X here.

04:44.530 --> 04:52.060
So now what we're holding is so we loop through the array we're going to decrease the value X..

04:52.060 --> 04:55.710
We're going to start out with the highest values we're going to take.

04:55.710 --> 05:02.370
Web site we're also doing our random value of x here so we could have any one of these.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.420
Within this loop as well.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.880
So we're taking the value for web site.

05:07.030 --> 05:08.890
We're holding it temporarily.

05:09.310 --> 05:19.150
And next we're reassigning the value from web site and we're going to pace to use another item from

05:19.210 --> 05:26.210
a rig and this time we're going to use this random item here within the race so basically we're swapping

05:26.500 --> 05:31.300
but we're not including this one in the swap so we can't swap it with itself essentially.

05:32.550 --> 05:38.610
So if not we pick up random item that we're holding from knife here.

05:38.640 --> 05:43.880
And then lastly let's swap our hold for value.

05:44.280 --> 05:51.400
So this is a random one and we're swapping it with the value we had initially held in 10.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.040
So that's it.

05:52.050 --> 05:59.840
So basically what's going to happen here is as we look through these three items are going to swap places.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.350
Let's refresh it and try this out.

06:02.670 --> 06:12.540
So we see that basically we're able to generate random array listing so re-index the array and have

06:12.540 --> 06:13.960
it randomly displayed.

06:14.130 --> 06:20.450
And this works really well if I add more values and I'm going to do some Americans because they're just

06:20.490 --> 06:22.000
easier to do.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.320
So will refresh and you can see that because it's dynamic.

06:28.370 --> 06:31.600
It works with any number of items within the array.

06:31.670 --> 06:35.710
And then also we can utilize this with any array essentially.

06:35.720 --> 06:42.380
That's why I said that this is a great function to have and you will find that as you're developing

06:42.590 --> 06:48.150
this is where functions become really useful because you will develop these nice neat functions that

06:48.150 --> 06:53.000
are fully dynamic and you can utilize them in any number of projects.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.920
So when you're calling out and you need something to shuffle an array you can default to one of these

06:57.920 --> 06:59.010
ones that you've built.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.810
So go ahead.

06:59.810 --> 07:07.030
Open up your editor create an array and create the shuffle array function.

07:07.220 --> 07:14.150
So try it for yourself and check it out and try it and see how it works within your editor within your

07:14.150 --> 07:14.890
browser.
