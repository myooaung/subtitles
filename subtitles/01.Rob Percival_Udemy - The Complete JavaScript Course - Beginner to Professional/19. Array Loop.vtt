Welcome back in in this lesson I want to show you how you can loop through the values of an array.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.710
So we saw that we created multiple arrays here.

00:09.800 --> 00:16.250
So what I wanted to do to get rid of the multi dimensions here because this will just simplify this

00:17.180 --> 00:19.040
and make it a little bit easier.

00:19.040 --> 00:25.040
So if I want to see all the values that are contained within the array so we can get rid of the stuff

00:25.040 --> 00:25.870
here now.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.490
And what I want to do is I actually want to look at the values that are contained in a car.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.970
So how do we do that.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.910
And there's a really easy way when it comes to a race where we can use a loop and we are going to look

00:43.910 --> 00:49.030
at loops coming up in the latter lessons of this course as well in more detail.

00:49.130 --> 00:56.650
But for now let's stick to what we can do within arrays so we can set up and we can do a for loop.

00:56.780 --> 01:02.470
So for loop initialized with four and then we need to set the parameters that it's going to be looping.

01:02.600 --> 01:11.690
So we just set a variable so we can just call that X and then in and then we specify the array.

01:11.690 --> 01:18.320
So basically what's going to happen here with this simple line of code it's actually going to give us

01:18.320 --> 01:22.790
the ability to loop through the values of the array.

01:22.790 --> 01:25.790
So let me also console log out the value of x

01:28.680 --> 01:34.820
and this is just a really neat simple loop function that's pre-built and you can use it within your

01:34.820 --> 01:35.520
arrays.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.680
So let's try and see what happens now.

01:37.730 --> 01:42.720
So we see that we actually do loop through every single item in the array.

01:42.800 --> 01:52.970
We start with index zero cat index 1 dog index to fish and then index three is a value of four and so

01:52.970 --> 01:58.970
on some of these numbers kind of got a little bit jumbled because I just remember that that first one

01:59.410 --> 02:03.640
line number 11 from the code is putting the index.

02:03.920 --> 02:13.690
So this is the index value and then next is the item value.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.680
So that's what that's outputting.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.680
So it's just a quick way to loop through all of the content of your array.

02:20.690 --> 02:25.280
So what I want you to do is to try that out on your own array as well.

02:25.310 --> 02:32.780
We'll take one of the rays from the earlier lessons pasted into your editor and then loop through it.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.140
So setting a variable and this variable can be anything that you want.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.680
We're just using X at the moment.

02:39.680 --> 02:45.680
Just make sure that when you want to retrieve those values that you're updating the value of x and then

02:45.770 --> 02:52.520
this value so we need to do V-A are so specified so variable x in array.

02:52.730 --> 02:54.350
So in is

02:57.220 --> 02:59.810
needs to be included within this loop.

02:59.890 --> 03:05.310
And then next we just need to specify which array we want it to loop through and we've got our array

03:05.320 --> 03:06.660
called a r r.

03:06.850 --> 03:12.160
So go ahead try it for yourself in the next lesson or you may be jumping into objects.
