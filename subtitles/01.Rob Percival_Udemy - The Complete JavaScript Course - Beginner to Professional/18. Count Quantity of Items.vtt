00:00.780 --> 00:06.930
Welcome back in in the previous lesson we looked at session storage and we found that session storage

00:07.860 --> 00:14.850
might not be the best alternative even though it will just work you'd only work within the current session.

00:14.910 --> 00:23.040
So let's update the session storage to local storage and that way we're able to store that cart information

00:23.100 --> 00:24.700
for a longer period of time.

00:25.500 --> 00:31.590
And let's make sure that they're all updated so we don't have any of the session storage is still lingering.

00:31.590 --> 00:34.930
So that's always a good idea to go try that out.

00:35.040 --> 00:40.470
And now when I refresh the page I should still see that.

00:40.470 --> 00:48.420
So the one thing that I am missing is that I'm actually not putting the cart contents less thing that

00:48.420 --> 00:56.910
I do need to do is I need to put the cart contents so that in refresh the page and this time when I

00:56.910 --> 00:57.580
refresh.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.060
We're actually not seeing any difference because it's just refreshing and it's all there within the

01:03.060 --> 01:04.280
local storage.

01:04.350 --> 01:11.520
So we're actually we saw that we were able to build out our cart contents and we're able to loop through

01:11.520 --> 01:18.210
it and we did notice that there was a few things that we do need to take care of and one of them is

01:18.270 --> 01:19.740
the quantity.

01:19.740 --> 01:25.390
So we don't want to actually store those quantities within the card itself.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.000
So we want to update them.

01:27.030 --> 01:31.370
We don't want any duplicates with the IDs within the card itself.

01:31.410 --> 01:35.760
We want to have a quantity value instead of having these duplicates.

01:35.820 --> 01:42.660
So we need to make an update and we need to do that within the part where we're updating the cart so

01:42.670 --> 01:47.760
we're adding it to the cart because this is where we're determining the quantity and so on.

01:47.760 --> 01:56.010
So let's add this in and make this update in order to do this we need to actually check to see if value

01:56.070 --> 02:03.180
is in the card itself and if it's in the cart then we know that we need to update the quantity instead

02:03.180 --> 02:06.840
of adding another item into the array.

02:06.840 --> 02:11.610
And if it's not in the cart then we know that we just simply push it into the array.

02:11.790 --> 02:17.790
So let's set up a variable that's going to work within the function and we're just going to call it

02:17.790 --> 02:19.660
item in CART.

02:20.070 --> 02:23.310
So this is going to be by default such false

02:26.120 --> 02:33.860
and next we need to loop through all of the values that are available in order to check to see if that

02:33.860 --> 02:35.730
ID is in the cart.

02:35.960 --> 02:40.000
So let's loop through and we saw what we could do that earlier.

02:40.010 --> 02:48.140
So let's just copy this loop here and I'm going to copy that part there so we can loop through all the

02:48.140 --> 02:58.120
values in the shopping cart and we're going to do a quick check to see if the the ID is equal to

03:00.750 --> 03:06.680
the item in full ID so check to see if these are equal.

03:06.970 --> 03:11.600
And if they are then we know we need to update the cart quantity.

03:12.130 --> 03:20.530
So instead of doing quantity of one we can update that quantity to whatever quantity is available already.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.760
So let's take

03:24.900 --> 03:30.870
and we're going to take the value of the quantity because this is the current value that's within the

03:30.870 --> 03:36.390
item in the array and we saw earlier how the relationship between the items so we can update that and

03:36.390 --> 03:42.480
that will actually update within the cart and we can start to parse integer.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.930
So same thing as we entered the number.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.350
So same idea.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.380
So let's just make sure that they're both numeric.

03:49.770 --> 03:53.650
So we can parse IMT.

03:53.700 --> 03:58.670
So I'm just showing you that there is a variety of different ways

04:02.300 --> 04:08.150
and basically this is just simply adding the one value to it because we're picking up that value of

04:08.150 --> 04:08.800
one.

04:08.840 --> 04:14.930
But in case this was two or three coming from the cart that would also update there so that way it's

04:14.930 --> 04:16.440
a little bit more dynamic.

04:16.550 --> 04:23.100
And next when we're taking the value of item in the cart we need to say that it's true that it was in

04:23.120 --> 04:23.680
there.

04:23.960 --> 04:30.030
So basically that means that we don't need to add it into the array.

04:30.230 --> 04:35.540
So we're checking to see if the value is in the cart and if it's

04:38.250 --> 04:42.750
not in the card that's when we're going to add it into the array and the rest of it should be the same.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.770
So let's just make sure that everything works properly.

04:45.810 --> 04:52.500
So let's refresh it and we're adding items into the card and we see now we're actually updating quantities

04:52.770 --> 04:54.440
instead of those items.

04:54.480 --> 05:02.130
So we're we're cleaning that up and we're only adding that one item into our array.

05:02.190 --> 05:08.460
So if we open up console and we'll take a look at our shopping cart unfortunately we still have a number

05:08.460 --> 05:14.310
of items within that array because it's only at this point that we're updating the quantity but we see

05:14.310 --> 05:17.860
that as we're adding updating all of those quantities.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.340
So what we ultimately want to do is we want to remove those duplicates which we want to actually have

05:23.430 --> 05:30.750
in our working version because we're only setting it too because we didn't have this part before that's

05:30.750 --> 05:33.600
where we're able to add in all those extra values.

05:35.050 --> 05:39.320
So we do need a way to remove items from the array.

05:39.820 --> 05:42.430
So the next lesson I'll show you how to do that.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.970
So before we end this lesson I still want to update this.

05:48.020 --> 05:52.480
So that actually shows all of this information that's within the shopping cart.

05:52.490 --> 05:59.390
I want to put it here within the visual sopping cart here so not in the console that we can actually

05:59.390 --> 06:04.170
see it so the user can see the updates the quantity and the price and all of that.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.320
So let's go ahead and do that.

06:06.320 --> 06:13.580
So what I want you to do now pause the video and add in the rest of the columns within this table so

06:13.580 --> 06:16.610
that we can actually see all of those values that are being held.

06:16.610 --> 06:24.870
So that's the quantity and also the details and the cost of each item.

06:24.980 --> 06:30.200
And then also the subtotal maybe at the end and then also we are also grabbing and we're building out

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
this total.

06:31.220 --> 06:35.650
So we need to add in the total here as we're putting that to male.

06:35.660 --> 06:40.490
So when you to pause the video and make those updates to the script and I'll show you the solution coming

06:40.490 --> 06:41.890
up.

06:41.990 --> 06:46.930
So we had an opportunity to give that a go to make those updates.

06:46.940 --> 06:52.220
So let's basically let's add in and let's build out our table.

06:52.220 --> 06:56.400
So let's start with T R and T H.

06:56.570 --> 07:04.710
And for the table heading we're just going to have the item and I want to do a bunch of th's here.

07:04.970 --> 07:06.710
So this one can be quantity

07:10.210 --> 07:16.900
so quantity and next do another column for

07:19.480 --> 07:22.370
another column for the cost.

07:22.390 --> 07:24.850
So this is the cost of each item.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.940
We can also do another column for the ID.

07:28.060 --> 07:35.890
So whatever that ID value is for the item and if you have other items within your within your description

07:35.890 --> 07:42.140
you can easily add those in as columns because it's just a matter of just putting that information out.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.470
And then also to add and one for options.

07:45.700 --> 07:53.740
So this is where we can do a remove or if we want to update it we can add a bunch of our options there.

07:54.230 --> 07:56.550
So now let's refresh it.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.570
So now we've got more of a table type format.

07:59.810 --> 08:06.240
I want to add a little bit of styling as well so we can apply some styling we can better see the table

08:06.260 --> 08:20.120
contents TT's and so do text align and center align that do a border so pick a solid block.

08:21.650 --> 08:23.040
Or maybe we're not going to do block.

08:23.110 --> 08:26.620
So maybe do it a little bit later and padding.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.300
And of course you can style this however you want.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.730
Whatever makes sense for you.

08:30.950 --> 08:40.760
So T-H and do the text align center align the text and make the font size bigger for these ones because

08:40.760 --> 08:47.190
these are these are the headings so that we can learn more so that they stand out a little bit more.

08:47.210 --> 08:47.660
So there we go.

08:47.660 --> 08:54.770
So we've got our basic shopping cart and also made out in a border around those ones as well.

08:56.900 --> 08:57.980
So let's refresh it.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.060
And now we need to update our shopping cart.

09:02.060 --> 09:09.410
So this was being dynamically output and generated and we saw that we can do it within these cells.

09:09.410 --> 09:17.090
So the first one is the item and I didn't leave a second space for the details so I was going to have

09:17.090 --> 09:18.510
the details there.

09:23.460 --> 09:33.220
So we can add in details like that and then we had a number of other cells.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.230
So let's build those out.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.110
So it's out in those cells now.

09:41.250 --> 09:49.290
And it's going to do a quick one here so that I can do a bunch of them so the first one was quantity.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.250
So it was cue to you why.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.220
Next one was cost

09:57.840 --> 10:10.980
so was the cost of the value of the item next was the ID fee ID and then after that we had the subtotal.

10:10.990 --> 10:15.470
And then lastly we had some options so leave the options now.

10:15.550 --> 10:19.450
At the moment we're just going to leave them blank and this is where we're going to add in or remove

10:19.450 --> 10:20.550
or whatever else.

10:20.830 --> 10:21.700
So let's see.

10:21.700 --> 10:29.260
So we do have a problem there with the cost Siletz because I believe I had called it price not cost

10:29.260 --> 10:31.400
because it was price over here.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.160
So let's update that

10:36.390 --> 10:38.030
and refresh.

10:38.340 --> 10:42.160
So we've got the cost we've got the subtotal we've got our options.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.920
And then the last part was that we wanted to update that total area.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.980
So I know that we're looking for that console as well.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.670
And just over here.

10:54.780 --> 11:05.530
So just before we close off let's add in one last roll and then in this roll let's do a table spat and

11:05.550 --> 11:12.550
we'll do a call spam and we'll spam all six columns span of six.

11:12.680 --> 11:18.670
And then within here we can place the table contents the total contents the total value.

11:18.770 --> 11:30.860
So let's just do a total and add in a value for the total sum total which is going to be total.

11:30.870 --> 11:33.220
So let's try that and refresh it.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.620
So there's our total.

11:34.620 --> 11:41.340
So one of the thing that is missing as well is that we're not it doesn't look like a number format.

11:41.340 --> 11:44.630
So we you need to build out a function in order to do that.

11:44.640 --> 11:51.680
So let's do that really quickly so I'm going to just add in a function and I'm going to call it

11:54.550 --> 12:00.660
f money to format it as a money format and we'll take a value in.

12:00.680 --> 12:06.670
So whatever value that we pass in we're going to return it within a number a money format.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.110
So no we need a dollar sign.

12:08.110 --> 12:14.050
We don't have any dollar signs and we're going to take the value of and we're going to divide it by

12:14.150 --> 12:22.660
100 and we're going to use a built in method in javascript to fix it which basically allows us to have

12:22.990 --> 12:25.540
a fixed set of decimal points.

12:25.690 --> 12:31.960
So we're always going to have at least decimal 0 0 to it and that's going to actually give us a money

12:31.990 --> 12:34.020
type format that we can do.

12:34.240 --> 12:43.210
And so now all we need to do is we need to wrap total into a money format and we also need to wrap the

12:43.210 --> 12:45.710
subtotal into a money format.

12:46.060 --> 12:52.990
So it's now refreshed the page and now we see that we've got more of a money format we can add in the

12:52.990 --> 12:59.920
TVs and there's actually one other thing that's still missing and that we've got the details so the

12:59.920 --> 13:05.380
details aren't coming in properly and that's because it's not in the details so the attribute value

13:05.440 --> 13:06.320
was just.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.770
So let me try that again.

13:07.990 --> 13:08.560
So there we go.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.800
So now we've got all the details we've got the quantities.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.670
We've got the cost I.D. and subtotal.

13:14.740 --> 13:19.320
And next we need to add in the remove and I'm going to simply remove these manually.

13:19.330 --> 13:25.570
So you had to do that in the upcoming lesson and then that will clean up our current running list and

13:25.570 --> 13:31.510
then we're able to add in additional items and clean up our array or we could create a function in order

13:31.510 --> 13:33.830
to clean that up to remove any duplicates.

13:33.970 --> 13:36.040
So we've got a couple options on the table there.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.000
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
