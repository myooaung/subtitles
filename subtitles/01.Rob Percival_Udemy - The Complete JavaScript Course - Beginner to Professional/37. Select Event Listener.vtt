00:00.820 --> 00:05.670
Work back in this lesson we're going to use that listener select.

00:05.690 --> 00:13.250
So for this we need an input and this is just going to be a regular input text and give it a value.

00:13.400 --> 00:24.920
So this is some dummy text and also going to a copy and some of this javascript course as well.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.990
So we've got lots of tax to work with.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.550
So next we're just going to give it an ID.

00:30.590 --> 00:36.090
And this is just going to be my t.

00:36.130 --> 00:44.400
So now what I want to do is I want to set an event listener and I want to use the listener select.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.570
And once that gets triggered then I want to fire off a function.

00:49.570 --> 00:55.110
So go ahead create a brand new function called my function and the listener is select.

00:55.300 --> 01:04.420
So I want you to do now pause the video grab this element and add an event listener to it and then create

01:04.420 --> 01:12.220
a function that gets triggered when the user selects some of the text.

01:12.220 --> 01:18.940
So let me show you the solution to that so we can use document and we can use get element by id and

01:18.940 --> 01:21.990
simply add in my t there.

01:22.300 --> 01:28.120
And then here let's add that Lessner So we're going to do this all on one line and the listener that

01:28.120 --> 01:36.450
we want to use is select and then we're just going to have a function we'll call it my fun.

01:36.880 --> 01:43.060
So now Next let's set up a function and we're going to set up my fun function.

01:43.060 --> 01:47.080
And this is where I'm going to make something happen and we'll console log.

01:47.110 --> 01:58.730
Now just to make sure that everything is working properly and I can clean this one up a little bit.

01:58.890 --> 02:03.520
So now go back and try it out and let's grab some of this text here.

02:03.630 --> 02:07.290
So we see as we're grabbing the text it's firing off.

02:07.380 --> 02:13.830
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to figure out actually what's been selected.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.890
So let's will console directory.

02:16.970 --> 02:26.680
So because we can actually figure out from the event so do event target.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.780
Or it could do this as well.

02:29.030 --> 02:39.400
And so let's save that and will refresh it and once we grab some of this information we can go down

02:39.400 --> 02:45.160
here and we can see that this particular one is going to have some value.

02:45.170 --> 02:49.440
So right down at the end we've got selection's start and selection.

02:49.450 --> 02:57.830
And so this value will change and notice that this is the character that we're starting and stopping.

02:57.850 --> 03:04.230
So if we start out with the T H I S space I s space.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.910
So this is the ninth character.

03:06.970 --> 03:11.050
So if we look at it the same way and the strings work the same way as arrays and we are going to look

03:11.050 --> 03:13.600
more at strings later on.

03:13.600 --> 03:21.460
But we know that we're able to grab that information that's selected and we have our starting point

03:21.580 --> 03:23.910
and our completing point.

03:23.950 --> 03:31.330
So basically we get that information and now we can make use of it by using the object information here

03:31.630 --> 03:37.090
from the target and putting that in to our result.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.380
And there's a function that's built in to Javascript.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.090
So let's set up a variable.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.590
I'm going to call it result

03:49.600 --> 03:53.890
and actually first of all let's grab that string.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.860
So it grabs the string selection.

03:56.890 --> 03:59.540
So because we want to grab that whole string value.

03:59.830 --> 04:06.230
So you know set up a string as we are and we're going to basically grab that event target.

04:06.940 --> 04:09.400
And I want to grab the target value.

04:09.520 --> 04:13.850
So I'm grabbing that entire string value into string.

04:13.960 --> 04:21.640
And then what I want to do is I want to take from string and we've got a method called sub string and

04:21.640 --> 04:29.290
what basically that does is that allows us to take a piece of the string so we can take a piece of these

04:29.650 --> 04:38.000
and return that into result and we actually know the starting point and the ending point of that selection.

04:38.140 --> 04:41.660
So we can simply grab that and output it.

04:41.740 --> 04:46.940
So let's do that now where we've got that event target.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.160
So we can shorten this as well.

04:49.180 --> 04:55.860
So I'm going to just do variable easy and that will be event target so that we don't have a really long

04:56.950 --> 05:05.010
statement here and just get rid of that because we no longer need the console and the values that we're

05:05.010 --> 05:13.320
looking at so it's easy and the value that we're looking at is selection.

05:13.510 --> 05:18.450
Start So Aleck's selection

05:21.700 --> 05:26.280
start and then we comma separated.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.040
And we have e and selection.

05:29.050 --> 05:33.610
And so we've got our selection start and now it's two selection.

05:33.620 --> 05:36.480
And so basically the result.

05:36.490 --> 05:42.540
So this console log what the result and just make sure that we're grabbing it properly.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.470
So go back and refreshed.

05:45.940 --> 05:49.010
And now let's grab some of this text and we can see that.

05:49.010 --> 05:53.750
Now whatever we're grabbed that we're putting here within the con..

05:53.750 --> 05:57.640
So the next step is to actually output it within this output area.

05:57.770 --> 06:05.530
So we want you to do now pause the video and output the result into our element with the ID output.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.530
Now I'll show you the solution for that.

06:08.540 --> 06:16.430
So this is documents so it doesn't this multiple times before get element by id and the element that

06:16.460 --> 06:23.900
we wanted to grab is output and so do the inner tacks or enraged him.

06:24.140 --> 06:26.660
And we're just going to set it equal to result.

06:29.810 --> 06:33.970
So let's try that out now and let's refresh now.

06:34.070 --> 06:39.920
Every time we grab some of that text we can see that it actually is going to get output there.

06:40.100 --> 06:46.610
So whatever we're grabbing here we're outputting just above there within that output area.

06:46.610 --> 06:53.690
So what I want you to do try to do it for yourself and open that up and create some different inputs

06:53.870 --> 06:59.930
and have different values here and different select values and then have them output somewhere else

07:00.020 --> 07:03.010
directly within your HMO of your web page.

07:03.210 --> 07:08.950
So try it for yourself and see what you can make happen using the select event listener.
