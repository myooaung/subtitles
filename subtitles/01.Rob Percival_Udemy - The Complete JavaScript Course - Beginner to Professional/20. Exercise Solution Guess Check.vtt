00:00.860 --> 00:05.930
Welcome back in we left off the previous lesson with an exercise.

00:05.990 --> 00:10.810
Updating the code and being able to actually create some gameplay out of this.

00:10.820 --> 00:18.120
So earlier we saw how we can pull back a value of a country using a rest and point and using that Jaison

00:18.200 --> 00:22.160
data parsing it into usable object in Javascript.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.340
So next that we need to do is we need to add an event listener.

00:25.490 --> 00:30.800
So we saw we've got an event listener that we're adding to my button so we can really easily just kind

00:30.800 --> 00:33.340
of duplicate what we did over here.

00:33.350 --> 00:41.200
And instead of firing off the loader will fire off the gas and we just need to update that button.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.350
So the button for this one is my guess.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.310
It's not my button my guess.

00:46.310 --> 00:46.850
So there we go.

00:46.850 --> 00:49.470
So that's already we're all hooked up.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.120
The next that we need to do is grab the value of the gas.

00:53.270 --> 01:02.960
So this is just the input and we've got an ID there so we can just do variable yes or we call it variable

01:02.960 --> 01:13.480
g and document get element by id and the element is yes and we need to return back to the values Samoa's

01:13.490 --> 01:15.490
we'll do that at this point as well.

01:15.650 --> 01:21.750
So we already know that we have the word within nickname so we need to loop through the length of pick

01:21.750 --> 01:29.360
a name and we saw that we could do that earlier as well or we could do pick name length so we can literally

01:29.360 --> 01:35.300
copy what we did up there and loop through all the letters.

01:35.320 --> 01:42.680
So now we're looping through the length of nickname and we need to make a comparison.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.580
And we also need to make sure that we utilize the tools that were case method to bring it down to the

01:49.580 --> 01:50.530
lower case.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.400
So let's do a check.

01:52.400 --> 01:57.290
And there's actually one thing that I did want to add in here we can get rid of this line and I did

01:57.290 --> 02:07.820
want to actually have a break here that in case x is longer than or equal to the length of the guess

02:08.600 --> 02:17.090
then I want to break this loop so I don't want it to loop over so if the users only if if because we're

02:17.090 --> 02:24.380
looping through the name of the length of the name if the guess is over here then let's break this loop

02:24.510 --> 02:28.350
at the first two characters so we don't need to keep comparing characters.

02:28.430 --> 02:33.140
If this length is already if we've already broken past that value.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.510
So this is where we can use break.

02:35.780 --> 02:40.180
And basically that will stop the rest of the loop from executing.

02:40.220 --> 02:45.120
So next thing that we need to do is we need to make a check condition.

02:45.260 --> 02:56.610
So we have to check to see if the letter at this current position is equal to the letter at 4 pick name

02:56.700 --> 03:04.710
at that position and we know that we saw earlier and we're using our words when we're using javascript

03:06.320 --> 03:11.670
string values that we can see different characters at different points.

03:11.680 --> 03:17.210
If we do if we have a word or string value we can bracket it just like we did with arrays and we can

03:17.210 --> 03:18.290
see that value.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.390
So that's what we're going to do now.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.890
So we're going to do g and X because that's where we're.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.030
Loop through.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.040
So now we're applying our condition.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.910
So we're going to check to see if G x is equal to

03:35.810 --> 03:38.770
the value of the name.

03:38.770 --> 03:40.210
So pick name X

03:44.440 --> 03:48.220
and we also need to transform the use to lowercase.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.750
So that's another thing that we can do.

03:49.780 --> 03:55.690
And there's a number of ways to do that so let's add that in within the shuffle.

03:55.690 --> 04:01.660
So we're going to do response and we're going to do response to lower case so that will take care of

04:01.810 --> 04:03.620
the lower case within the output.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.120
So we don't have that uppercase letter anymore.

04:06.280 --> 04:12.530
And over here so we've got our pick name is still going to be lower case on the output.

04:12.550 --> 04:15.700
So that's another one that we still need to take care of.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.110
So we need to add in that method to lower case here as well.

04:22.770 --> 04:30.660
And we also need to update those inputs to lowercase as well as a number of different places that we

04:30.660 --> 04:36.690
had to add this lowercase this is just to make sure that the case is the same so that doesn't matter

04:36.690 --> 04:42.260
if the user puts uppercase or lowercase we can do that still do that proper comparison.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.660
So also we need to have a holder.

04:44.940 --> 04:48.120
So this is basically our guess holder.

04:48.510 --> 04:54.920
So user guess and this is what we're going to display on the output.

04:55.380 --> 05:06.980
So this gives us somewhere to either put the correct letter so concatenate it to the correct letter.

05:07.190 --> 05:13.640
And actually what I have to do is are going to transform all of G to lowercase as I think that it's

05:13.640 --> 05:15.290
getting quite a bit complicated.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.350
I'm trying to save time with the methods.

05:17.600 --> 05:23.810
So let's just simplified that one there and we could also put a variable in for the picked name instead

05:23.810 --> 05:27.340
of having that and then we could transform that to lowercase as well.

05:27.350 --> 05:31.160
So now let's also update that output.

05:31.160 --> 05:35.620
So you need to output content and output that we're going to output.

05:35.630 --> 05:36.820
Is that user.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.750
Yes.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.710
So I think we're ready to try this.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.110
Let's go and refresh it.

05:41.120 --> 05:47.600
So let's load a new country and we did get a problem there so let's see what happened.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.840
And actually didn't have the rounded brackets.

05:53.950 --> 05:59.890
And we know with functions that if you don't include the rounded brackets that actually doesn't executed

05:59.890 --> 06:02.650
it actually wrote writes that function out there.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.090
So that's what happened there.

06:04.090 --> 06:05.630
So let's try that again.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.520
And so there we go.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.430
So now we've got our country is to lower case.

06:10.510 --> 06:16.060
And I know some of them are quite long so I know it could be fairly difficult in the game but we can

06:16.060 --> 06:21.620
see that this one probably is hungry and we can't enter in our guess.

06:21.640 --> 06:26.930
So let's go out and try I guess and let's do some wrong letters by mistake here.

06:27.220 --> 06:33.510
So we still have a problem here that we can't read the value of is null.

06:33.730 --> 06:35.760
So we got to do some bug fixing here.

06:39.330 --> 06:42.790
So let's go back in here and let's see what happened.

06:42.810 --> 06:45.170
So we have an idea of guess

06:49.420 --> 06:51.970
and I had written guest instead a guess.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.610
So that was that was why we're throwing another error there.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.950
So let's try this one more time.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.050
So refresh click console and I have no idea what that country is

07:04.940 --> 07:08.360
and obviously I can go into the console I can still see the country.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.570
So let's type Taipan.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.450
So there we go.

07:12.460 --> 07:18.070
And we still need to add the lines in case that's wrong.

07:18.130 --> 07:23.510
So it's update that so user or guess at if the user guesses the wrong letter.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.220
We're going to put the dashes there.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.090
So let's refresh that again.

07:27.150 --> 07:28.210
Loden you country

07:32.200 --> 07:33.560
so do something like that.

07:33.660 --> 07:37.290
And this way we can see how correct guesses.

07:37.410 --> 07:43.770
And then this leaves it up to the user to kind of change the order update some of the letters and do

07:43.800 --> 07:48.020
as they need to until they can finally get the word properly.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.260
So that's it.

07:49.260 --> 07:55.020
And of course there's a lot of room for improvement with this scheme and you can even give people hints.

07:55.020 --> 08:00.070
We've got the flags we've got all kinds of information that's held within pick.

08:00.210 --> 08:03.390
So you can add these as hints within the game.

08:03.390 --> 08:05.520
You can load up the flag if you want.

08:05.520 --> 08:11.210
So a lot of different things that we can do maybe what we want to do add in the flag.

08:11.460 --> 08:15.270
So take a second pause the video add in the flag there.

08:15.270 --> 08:19.440
Whenever we select a new country and I'll show you how to do that as well.

08:19.470 --> 08:23.840
Within this lesson so we had an opportunity to try that out.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.660
And we saw that we can guess a country and the guess and the value.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.970
So let's do a quick one here.

08:31.970 --> 08:41.310
We're going to do image source and right now we're just going to do a blank source and let's set a with

08:41.940 --> 08:45.540
so that doesn't go wait too long.

08:45.540 --> 08:48.120
What do we'll set up with the 300 picks.

08:48.150 --> 08:53.370
So in case the width is going to be way too long we're not going to go overboard with the width of the

08:53.370 --> 08:54.610
image.

08:54.660 --> 08:59.370
So now whenever we load the country we need to update the source.

08:59.460 --> 09:02.450
So we need a way to grab that element.

09:02.490 --> 09:06.210
We can do Querrey selector because we've only got the one image.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.560
So let's go ahead and do it that way so we don't have to set a name.

09:09.690 --> 09:17.820
So wherever we're actually launching the loader we're creating the word guess we're picking out that

09:17.820 --> 09:18.690
random one.

09:18.690 --> 09:20.260
So that's what we're doing that over here.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.060
So let's do that in.

09:22.110 --> 09:23.080
So document

09:26.640 --> 09:31.720
query query selector and we'll just grab the image.

09:31.760 --> 09:37.210
Just don't forget to code around there and let's update the source.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.840
So the or the source is going to be

09:45.550 --> 09:46.740
flag.

09:47.470 --> 09:52.020
So it's true that it refreshed the code see that refresh it.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.670
And whenever we do the new country.

09:53.680 --> 09:59.100
So we get in the flag there and that's added in a space there as well.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.540
So refresh and also maybe let's make this a little bit smaller.

10:06.650 --> 10:09.290
This is turning out to be awfully large.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.650
So new country.

10:10.730 --> 10:16.370
So now we get the flags of the countries and of course you could add an additional data there as hints

10:16.670 --> 10:22.310
for for the user to make the game play a little bit more interesting.

10:22.340 --> 10:28.310
So go ahead take the source code makes a lot updates add some more hints for the user and try out the

10:28.310 --> 10:29.440
game yourself.

10:31.920 --> 10:38.340
And you can also have something that I congratulations if they got all of the characters well as their

10:38.460 --> 10:45.000
characters right as well and we know that if we loop through the length and if we actually we can set

10:45.000 --> 10:50.250
a number here and we can loop through it and we can check to see if they got all the characters right

10:50.490 --> 10:53.220
and if they did then we can have a congratulations message.

10:53.220 --> 10:58.980
So a lot of different things that you can do to update this code to improve it to make it more playable

10:58.980 --> 10:59.910
for users.

10:59.970 --> 11:07.750
But the basics are here that we're able to load the countries from an endpoint using Jaison and Ajax.
