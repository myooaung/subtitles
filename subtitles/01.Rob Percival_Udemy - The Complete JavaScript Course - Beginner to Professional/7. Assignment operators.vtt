00:01.070 --> 00:07.440
Well come back in in the previous lesson we saw how we can work with arithmetic operators.

00:07.470 --> 00:13.470
So this we're going to look at assignment operators and we've already used one of the assignment operators

00:13.470 --> 00:17.040
and the one that's most commonly used is the equal sign.

00:17.040 --> 00:26.640
So basically this gives us the ability to assign a value to a variable assignment operator if we want

00:26.640 --> 00:29.850
to take this one step further and we want to do B.

00:30.060 --> 00:41.610
But here instead of doing B equals B plus 5 we want to start with whatever the value of b is and equal

00:41.820 --> 00:47.190
to itself plus the value of A.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.800
We could do it with in this way as well.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.520
So basically we don't already have a value of b quite yet.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.340
So maybe we need to assign a value of B.

00:58.080 --> 01:07.070
So a give B a value of 4 and then over here is where we're going to reassign a new value for B.

01:07.080 --> 01:15.990
So this is essentially the same thing as doing B equals B plus a because we want to keep that initial

01:15.990 --> 01:17.060
value of B.

01:17.130 --> 01:19.380
We know that B is equal to 4.

01:19.530 --> 01:26.750
Over here we're reassigning a value to B but we're using its existing value which is four.

01:26.970 --> 01:30.700
And then we're adding a value of A which is 5.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.670
So we're going to get a value of nine now for B.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.000
And this is the same thing over here.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.180
But this is just a shorter format and this is just using the assignment operator plus equal sign.

01:42.220 --> 01:45.610
So it's going to get return back the same results.

01:45.630 --> 01:53.050
So these are both going to return back a value of a value of nine.

01:53.170 --> 01:56.640
Let's try that and go back out here and refresh it.

01:56.660 --> 02:00.280
So let's do B equals B.

02:00.330 --> 02:08.370
So reassigning a value to B and we're equal and B equals itself plus the value of A.

02:08.480 --> 02:15.200
So we're getting a value of 19 because we actually did execute these two out.

02:15.410 --> 02:16.670
And that's what's going on there.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.510
So let me try that again.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.490
So we're going to do this time.

02:20.510 --> 02:24.220
Let's do it within the assignment operator equaling.

02:24.550 --> 02:28.140
So we're doing B equals B plus A.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.330
So a shorter format.

02:29.330 --> 02:31.030
And we're turning back nine.

02:31.100 --> 02:38.270
So this was the same thing I was doing B as B plus.

02:38.990 --> 02:45.930
So now because we've already got nine when we assign another value of 5 to it we end up with 14.

02:45.950 --> 02:53.630
We could also do the same thing where we've got that assignment operator of adding we subtract the value

02:53.630 --> 02:54.380
of A.

02:54.770 --> 02:58.570
So we see that B now has a response back as 9.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.830
So we know the value of b is 9.

03:00.830 --> 03:09.440
We can even do multiplication so we can reassign the value of b and we can multiply it by the value

03:09.500 --> 03:10.860
of a.

03:11.210 --> 03:16.150
So we see that now we've got forty five because we're doing nine times five.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.590
So that's 45.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.670
We can also do instead of multiplication.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.150
We can do division.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.590
So that would bring back the number back to 9.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.580
So a number of different things that you can do.

03:27.580 --> 03:33.990
You can even do the modulus of that as well.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.810
So the value of the

03:39.380 --> 03:48.920
and B modulus of a and we see that we've got the return value of 4 because A is going to go into B one

03:48.920 --> 03:49.580
time.

03:49.580 --> 03:54.980
So that's going to leave a remainder of four so that's basically what the short format for that one

03:55.040 --> 03:56.690
is going to be.

03:56.690 --> 03:59.510
So now try it for yourself as well.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.850
Try out all the different assignment operators and try to use these short forms.

04:04.850 --> 04:09.050
So set up one with the longer format and give it some time.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.600
Play around with it and try it for yourself.

04:11.600 --> 04:20.510
So try out the shorthand for adding one value to another shorthand for subtracting one value from the

04:20.510 --> 04:28.940
original value multiplying dividing and modulus because these are going to be really useful operators

04:29.150 --> 04:30.890
as you do your programming.

04:30.920 --> 04:38.330
So open up your editor and create some of these operators within your within your javascript code.
