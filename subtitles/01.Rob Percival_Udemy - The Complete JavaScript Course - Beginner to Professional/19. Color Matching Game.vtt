00:00.710 --> 00:05.500
Welcome come back in this lesson we're going to take what we've learned in the previous lessons and

00:05.530 --> 00:07.380
we're going to build out a game.

00:07.450 --> 00:12.850
So this game has to do with remembering a series of colors.

00:12.910 --> 00:18.400
So basically the game starts say what it flashes for different colors in a roll and then it's up to

00:18.400 --> 00:20.480
you to select the colors.

00:20.590 --> 00:26.830
You can remove ones if you select the wrong ones and we can see that at the end there is an analysis.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.220
So you see that you are wrong.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.620
You guessed blue red blue green red red.

00:31.630 --> 00:35.360
So that's what our guess was it was red blue green green.

00:35.620 --> 00:40.120
So this is what we want to build out so yellow yellow blue yellow.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.280
So this is picking that at random and we see that this time where.

00:44.290 --> 00:45.090
Correct.

00:45.100 --> 00:50.980
So that's the basics of the game it's a really straightforward game and we're going to present us with

00:51.460 --> 00:56.130
a pattern and then we just need to remember that pattern and input pattern.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.490
So let's begin.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.740
So first thing that we need is we need.

00:59.740 --> 01:06.440
So we've got our message area here so we can just reuse what we've got here and next let's create that

01:06.440 --> 01:08.430
input button to start the game.

01:08.430 --> 01:11.000
So this is going to be our starting point.

01:11.020 --> 01:15.230
So this is just a regular button we'll give it a value of start.

01:15.490 --> 01:22.840
And then the next clock will OD on click to it and launch start.

01:22.840 --> 01:30.020
So this is where the user comes in and they get the starting initiation on the game.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.440
So what do we need to do here.

01:31.480 --> 01:38.200
We need to launch the game basically under start.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.720
So let's set up the start function.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.220
So we're going to run this game.

01:44.260 --> 01:48.240
We're going to create basically we need an array with some colors.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.000
So color array and then let's create that

01:55.160 --> 02:00.670
so we're going to make this game completely dynamic so we can add in any number of colors.

02:00.670 --> 02:02.020
Let's do red.

02:02.260 --> 02:06.010
And we're going to do the same ones that are available within the screen.

02:06.010 --> 02:10.540
So red green blue and yellow.

02:10.780 --> 02:16.000
And this is actually going to be dynamic because if we add in more colors then we can have more options

02:16.000 --> 02:18.060
within the game as well.

02:18.070 --> 02:22.650
So the thing that we need to do is set up some default variables.

02:22.780 --> 02:29.740
So the first variable we need a couple arrays so we need one array that is going to hold the actual

02:29.740 --> 02:32.150
sequence as it's being presented.

02:32.290 --> 02:35.170
So that's going to be building out as it's being presented.

02:35.170 --> 02:39.220
And we need a second array that's going to hold our guess.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.860
So the players yes.

02:40.870 --> 02:45.280
So those are the two arrays that we need right off the bat in the beginning.

02:45.280 --> 02:54.090
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to build out our random sequence from this array.

02:54.140 --> 03:00.980
So we're going to build out essentially the solution and then from that solution we're going to launch

03:01.100 --> 03:03.550
it and we're going to show all those random colors.

03:03.740 --> 03:12.170
So let's set up our loop and loop is going to start out as X. And it's going to loop through while X

03:12.260 --> 03:20.270
is less than four because we want to set the limit to 4 and we can always adjust this number as well

03:20.270 --> 03:21.290
later on.

03:21.290 --> 03:26.480
So we're not actually going by the length of the array because as I said we don't make as dynamic as

03:26.480 --> 03:27.470
possible.

03:27.470 --> 03:34.790
And if we do it by the length of the array then our sequence can only be limited to the number of items

03:34.850 --> 03:35.550
in the array.

03:35.570 --> 03:37.490
So we don't want to limit ourselves.

03:37.490 --> 03:40.400
So next let's create a random variable.

03:40.430 --> 03:45.850
So this one is random and we just call it our.

03:46.280 --> 03:53.860
And this one is same thing that we did before where we pick out a random item from the array.

03:53.870 --> 04:00.590
So this was all using all of that math that we saw earlier and then just simply picking out a random

04:00.590 --> 04:09.800
index value that we can then link to the array and pull back a random item from the array.

04:09.830 --> 04:14.050
So remember we have to multiply it by the length of the array.

04:14.540 --> 04:18.820
So that's color array length.

04:18.830 --> 04:20.370
So that's the last that we need to do.

04:20.540 --> 04:26.600
So that basically gives us a random item and we want to add it into the first array.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.200
So this is the range where that first sequence is going to go.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.860
So all we need to do is push that color into the array.

04:34.250 --> 04:34.840
So there we go.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.960
So we've got our array built.

04:38.660 --> 04:43.720
And next thing that we need to do is we need to set our timeout counter.

04:43.970 --> 04:49.910
So this is where we're actually going to get when we start where we get the sequence of all of these

04:49.910 --> 04:51.200
colors showing up.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.680
And this is going to be actually dependent on this brand new array that we just built.

04:56.870 --> 05:05.120
So let's open that up and let's set our timer so we need to have a global placeholder because we also

05:05.120 --> 05:10.340
want to have the ability to access the timer and if we want to get rid of the timer then we want to

05:10.340 --> 05:16.370
have the ability to to get rid of it so I'm just going to call it mighty and mighty.

05:16.370 --> 05:18.400
We don't have to have any values in it.

05:18.440 --> 05:27.650
So when we get down to starting the game let's grab my t and let's set timeout.

05:27.710 --> 05:35.150
And so basically this as we saw earlier this will time out a particular function and we know when to

05:35.170 --> 05:36.900
just set the time.

05:36.980 --> 05:45.030
So the function that we want to launch is going to be go white and we want to time it out.

05:45.070 --> 05:47.780
Now at 200 seconds.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.640
So next to that we need to do.

05:49.750 --> 05:58.160
We know that we need to create a function so go white and the reason that I have one that says go white

05:58.250 --> 06:03.410
is because I want the screen area the play area to go white in between the colors.

06:03.440 --> 06:08.840
Otherwise we would just have all the colors and if we had a repeating color we wouldn't be able to distinguish

06:08.840 --> 06:09.760
between the two.

06:10.010 --> 06:15.770
So that's what I wanted to add that one in and this one is going to really do pretty much the same thing

06:16.010 --> 06:19.140
that we're doing with an actual color one.

06:19.160 --> 06:22.720
But it's going to just show a white background.

06:22.790 --> 06:26.560
So let's I have We're going to have our game play area and output.

06:26.730 --> 06:28.830
So let's set a variable.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.290
And this one.

06:30.290 --> 06:37.760
So we're going to grab this one in the documents so it get element by id and grab that one so that we

06:37.760 --> 06:41.360
can use the object within our script.

06:41.360 --> 06:49.160
So now what we need to do here is we need to output and let's update the style of output.

06:49.160 --> 06:54.850
So we saw this earlier when we had access to style and we can set the background color.

06:55.070 --> 06:58.640
So what we want to do is set the background color to be white

07:02.320 --> 07:06.070
so this will initial it and started of white.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.220
And there's another value that we need to set.

07:09.430 --> 07:15.670
And this is going to be one that counts how many times we've actually run this.

07:15.670 --> 07:21.970
So I'm going to set another variable and I'm going to call it loop and initially loop is going to be

07:21.970 --> 07:22.680
zero.

07:22.990 --> 07:26.110
And we also should set loop at zero.

07:26.230 --> 07:32.860
Once we start because this is going to be basically counting how many times that we're actually looping

07:32.920 --> 07:34.060
through our

07:38.030 --> 07:39.690
image display.

07:40.130 --> 07:45.660
So over here once we increase that so let's increase it by 1.

07:45.770 --> 07:48.050
So we know that we can move to the next one

07:51.060 --> 07:54.180
and this one is going to be.

07:54.270 --> 08:00.700
So we're going to set the timeout and we're going to move to actually we don't need the loop here yet.

08:01.020 --> 08:04.460
We're going to go white go color.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.060
And then over here is where we set up a Go color.

08:09.270 --> 08:15.530
And so now we're setting up the function where we're actually going to display the color.

08:15.530 --> 08:24.980
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and update and show update the background color within

08:24.980 --> 08:29.680
go color to whatever the color is the current color of the real item.

08:29.690 --> 08:32.380
And remember we're starting out at zero with loop.

08:32.480 --> 08:37.190
So that's going to give us the first item in the array and then that's why also we need to increment

08:37.280 --> 08:37.770
loop.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.340
So good pause the video.

08:39.480 --> 08:43.150
That solution into the script and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:44.800 --> 08:50.020
So to update the background color all we need to do well you need to copy quite a bit of what we did

08:50.050 --> 08:55.060
earlier and we know that we've got the background color within an array.

08:55.060 --> 08:59.870
So we've got an array one and we're going to use the variable.

08:59.890 --> 09:05.950
Loop that's going to actually give us the item and then once we saw that we know that we can move to

09:05.950 --> 09:13.910
the next one and then the next thing that we want to do is we want to have the next the next timeout.

09:13.930 --> 09:21.180
So basically we're going back to white and we're going to show the white color.

09:21.430 --> 09:28.670
And so for the color itself we might want to keep it on a longer.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.020
So for this instance we're going to launch it after one second.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.950
So the white interval will be shorter than this one.

09:36.230 --> 09:42.050
And there's one other thing that we need to add in and this is going to be how we can actually break

09:42.050 --> 09:43.040
out of this loop.

09:43.190 --> 09:46.950
So we know that once we increment the loop we don't want to go.

09:47.030 --> 09:53.340
We don't want Loopt to actually go beyond the length of the time out.

09:53.420 --> 09:57.510
So for the length of the array the available elements within the array.

09:57.530 --> 10:05.390
So this is where we need to grow up the length of the array and make sure that if loop is actually greater

10:05.390 --> 10:11.360
than or equal to that then we're going to clear a we're going to clear the time out.

10:13.770 --> 10:15.570
So let's clear that time out.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.540
And the way that we clear the time out is we've already set it as an object.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.050
So you can just grab that and cleared.

10:23.100 --> 10:31.610
So now let's try out our code and before we actually try it out we do need to actually show our output

10:31.850 --> 10:34.290
because right now it's a little bit small.

10:34.310 --> 10:37.090
We don't have any styling added in as of yet.

10:37.190 --> 10:41.760
So let's quickly before we launch let's add some styling in.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.020
So let's do a with.

10:44.150 --> 10:46.700
So this will give us an area.

10:46.700 --> 10:51.360
So I believe we're just 2 400 pics by 400 pics.

10:51.620 --> 10:57.530
And let's do a display.

10:57.710 --> 11:06.390
So do a display of block and also maybe you can add in a border so just to make sure that we actually

11:06.660 --> 11:09.790
see where it's located support or block.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.970
So go back and refresh it.

11:11.970 --> 11:16.130
So there's our area and now we're starting the loop.

11:16.260 --> 11:20.360
So we're seeing that we've got all of the colors and then it comes to the end.

11:20.370 --> 11:24.150
So right now the game should be the loops would be over.

11:24.180 --> 11:28.670
And we've cleared the time out and then we can launch it one more time as well.

11:28.710 --> 11:33.190
So we want to do that in the second part of this exercise.

11:33.210 --> 11:37.650
We're going to be building out the ability for the user to actually make selections.
