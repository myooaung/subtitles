Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at a bubbling and capture and show you with the differences.

00:07.180 --> 00:09.950
So it's all about the order of events.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.560
So you can have for instance multiple event listeners on the same elements so we can have it on this

00:17.560 --> 00:18.080
one.

00:18.160 --> 00:24.440
And then if it's got another div inside then this one could have an event.

00:24.580 --> 00:30.640
And if it's got another div inside then this one can have an event and the same thing so we can have

00:30.670 --> 00:37.210
multiple divs one inside of another and they can all have a whole set of events.

00:37.390 --> 00:38.990
So let's track this.

00:39.030 --> 00:44.010
So one two three four five and let's save that.

00:44.200 --> 00:50.980
So now when we go and we refresh the page basically we've got a number of divs here one inside and the

00:50.980 --> 00:53.330
other and going all the way up.

00:53.350 --> 01:00.820
So if we add an event listener to them so let's do that now and let's set up a variable so we just call

01:00.820 --> 01:04.760
it D and we're going to get elements document.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.090
And this time we're getting elements by tag name.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.730
So let's try that one.

01:09.790 --> 01:15.790
Let's do a tag name and we're going to get all of the divs and we're going to add an event listener

01:15.850 --> 01:18.050
to every single div..

01:18.070 --> 01:20.240
So now let's do our loop.

01:20.260 --> 01:24.840
So it's for variable x equals zero.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.480
And we're going to loop while X is less than the length and then we're going to increment x.

01:33.520 --> 01:39.100
So this is going to be the same thing that we've done before where we can add multiple event listeners.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.430
And now we can add the event listeners to those elements.

01:43.510 --> 01:51.190
So selecting it by the index value and doing an event listener and I want to add a click listener to

01:51.190 --> 01:57.230
them and then we want to fire off a function in here.

01:57.370 --> 02:06.250
So let's let's set that up and we're going to call that be up for bubbling up.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.000
And right now we'll just set it as true.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.820
So there's also the default is false.

02:11.880 --> 02:17.070
So when we weren't including it before it was actually set it as the default.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.680
And then we'll update it afterwards.

02:19.680 --> 02:24.670
So now let's create a function and b up is our function.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.780
And then within here what I want to do is console log what's actually happening.

02:30.810 --> 02:42.930
So as we as we go through the different elements let's first of all console log out this and go out

02:42.960 --> 02:44.230
and refresh it.

02:44.370 --> 02:51.000
So basically what's happened now is we've added an event handler to all of those elements and we can

02:51.000 --> 02:52.710
see that as we click it.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.040
So we start out at five.

02:54.060 --> 02:58.010
Then we go to four then we go to three then we go to two.

02:58.140 --> 03:06.510
So let's output that content so that inner text that's available within that object go back out and

03:06.510 --> 03:07.590
refresh it again.

03:07.650 --> 03:13.410
So click and we can see that we're outputting all of this content so we're getting that first value

03:13.410 --> 03:14.180
there.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.200
So we're starting out at five.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.730
Then we've got four and five.

03:17.730 --> 03:23.830
So this element and then we've got 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 all the way out.

03:23.850 --> 03:27.840
So we're basically starting here and we're going that way.

03:27.870 --> 03:34.860
So if I update this and if I change it to true the order is actually going to change so let's refresh

03:35.190 --> 03:36.960
and click it in the same spot.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.470
And now we're actually starting at the parent and then we're starting to go to this one.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.490
This one this one this one.

03:44.490 --> 03:52.530
So basically this is the bubble option and you can find out more about it here on W3 dot org.

03:52.530 --> 03:57.100
So basically we've got to capture phase and we've got the bubble phase.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.240
So it all depends on what you're doing.

04:00.270 --> 04:03.350
If you're doing a true or false.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.000
Which direction the bubbling is going to go.

04:06.030 --> 04:13.860
And this is basically how how javascript or how the dorm is going to handle multiple events and how

04:13.860 --> 04:19.000
it's going to organize which events get triggered and in what order they're going to get triggered.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.370
So this is just something to keep in mind.

04:21.480 --> 04:28.320
And most of the time it's not going to be really that necessary that you need to figure out what order

04:28.350 --> 04:30.370
you want them to be represented in.

04:30.420 --> 04:36.990
But if you're dealing with a lot of events on your applications then this does become really relevant

04:37.110 --> 04:38.310
with what you're doing.

04:38.340 --> 04:39.530
So keep that in mind.

04:39.540 --> 04:46.530
And this was just a short lesson to just basically go over what bubbling up does and and the capture

04:46.770 --> 04:47.400
as well.

04:49.230 --> 04:55.680
So the bubble basically gets it from the top and then the catcher gets it from the typical order from

04:56.700 --> 04:59.970
the element and then going into the parent and then the parent and then the parent.
