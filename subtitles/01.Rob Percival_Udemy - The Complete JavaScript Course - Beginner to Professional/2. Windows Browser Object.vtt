00:01.320 --> 00:06.710
Well come in in this lesson we're going to be looking at the windows object and the browser object.

00:06.710 --> 00:11.440
Now you can open up your console and to type in console.

00:11.900 --> 00:15.790
And then window and this will return back the windows object.

00:15.860 --> 00:21.770
And as you can see there's a lot of information contained in here and you can do this on any Web site.

00:21.770 --> 00:28.040
Open up your Chrome browser and browse to any one of your favorite Web sites and do Konsole directory

00:28.280 --> 00:33.220
and you can right away get a whole lot more information about that web page.

00:33.230 --> 00:38.350
We've also got network which tells us more information about what's getting loaded.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.560
So this is what's contained within the loader of the browser.

00:42.590 --> 00:49.040
And basically this is what is used to communicate with the web servers and you can see more about what's

00:49.040 --> 00:52.630
being loaded and what types of files are being loaded the size.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.750
How much time it's taking to load them and so on.

00:56.900 --> 01:03.920
So once all of the H Tim L page gets loaded it actually gets parsed into the browser and then it the

01:03.920 --> 01:06.290
browser is the one that actually creates the DOM.

01:06.290 --> 01:08.330
So this is the document object.

01:08.330 --> 01:13.080
And this is a full map of all of the contents of your web page.

01:13.100 --> 01:20.660
It's like a tree with all kinds of branches going down grabbing all the different nodes that are available

01:20.720 --> 01:22.790
within your web page.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.720
So there is one important thing to know when it comes to the browser object and they're not.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.300
Not all browsers are the same.

01:30.310 --> 01:39.320
So although there are some standard that they do try to do things similar they're not all going to be

01:39.320 --> 01:45.590
standard and browsers can be different and they can handle some of the dorm information differently.

01:45.590 --> 01:52.280
So this is important to keep in mind when you're building applications that not all of your dorm interactions

01:52.590 --> 01:57.590
were window interactions are going to be treated the same way across different browsers.

01:57.980 --> 02:04.730
So let's take a quick look at what's available to us and basically through the windows object through

02:04.730 --> 02:08.940
the browser object and through the document object.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.580
This is where we get information that we can utilize within our Javascript.

02:13.580 --> 02:19.640
So this is our window into what's happening within the web page and gives us the ability via javascript

02:19.640 --> 02:21.860
to communicate with the content on the web page.

02:22.070 --> 02:26.090
So there are a few that I wanted to look at and some of them.

02:26.210 --> 02:31.730
One of the ones that we want to look at is history so you can actually see the history that's contained

02:31.730 --> 02:36.590
within your web page and you can find out more information and you can also go forward and backwards

02:36.590 --> 02:37.580
in history.

02:37.580 --> 02:45.660
There's also there's also events that are available within the window so you can see that just ties

02:45.720 --> 02:47.000
within the elements.

02:47.040 --> 02:52.420
There's events within the window as well so we can use ones where we've got on unload.

02:52.470 --> 02:55.220
We can also use on load and so on.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.770
So on unload means basically whenever the user is leaving the web page if you capture them here then

03:01.830 --> 03:05.590
you can make use of that before they're actually closing off the web page.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.180
And we've already looked out ones like the alert.

03:08.430 --> 03:16.090
So those are ones that we've already looked at and we are going to be looking at the interval in upcoming

03:16.090 --> 03:17.540
lessons as well.

03:19.240 --> 03:25.900
So let's open up our editor and open up our local web page and let's write our first script here to

03:25.900 --> 03:31.870
get some information that's actually contained within the web page.

03:31.980 --> 03:39.150
So we saw earlier how we can do console directory and we can actually list out the entire Windows object

03:39.450 --> 03:42.300
just by typing in console directory window.

03:42.330 --> 03:48.660
So that gave us the ability to type in the window object so we can also do the same thing if we want

03:48.660 --> 03:50.760
to loop through that Windows object.

03:50.760 --> 03:56.700
So this is an object just like anything else within javascript where if we want to loop through all

03:56.700 --> 04:02.850
the different properties we can loop through it within this type of format where we do proper properties

04:02.900 --> 04:03.970
in window

04:06.630 --> 04:10.440
and then now let's just let's just write them out into the document.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.260
So document right.

04:12.450 --> 04:17.610
And again this is typing into the dorm and we're going to let listo to that property.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.280
And let's put a space in there.

04:24.870 --> 04:29.250
And then now let's also listo out that window object.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.620
So we've got window property object so that we can take a closer look at what's actually going to be

04:34.620 --> 04:36.660
produced here and next.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.930
Let's do a line break.

04:43.980 --> 04:44.640
So go ahead.

04:44.640 --> 04:50.760
We'll save that and we're going to go refresh our page and we can see that we can output all of this

04:50.760 --> 04:51.810
information.

04:51.810 --> 04:54.640
So we've got a lot of really useful information here.

04:54.660 --> 04:58.920
We can see how wide our window is how high or window is.

04:58.920 --> 05:04.240
So these are variables that we can make use of within our javascript as well.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.650
So let me show you how I can grab those.

05:07.760 --> 05:13.300
So if we want to grab that inner with an inner height and it put them into our age Mel.

05:13.430 --> 05:16.510
So let's say let's grab wrapper.

05:16.550 --> 05:22.250
So this is what we've done before so just put output there and we'll do document.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.580
So this is grabbing into the document object.

05:24.590 --> 05:30.650
Get element by on a D and this time we're going to grab a wrapper so that we can actually write into

05:30.740 --> 05:32.600
this particular object.

05:32.630 --> 05:35.580
And now let's put some content in here.

05:35.810 --> 05:44.010
So let's do I would put an age to a male and we're going to grab that enraged him.

05:44.360 --> 05:49.880
So what I want you to do now is pause the video and write up.

05:49.970 --> 05:50.970
Finish this off.

05:50.990 --> 06:00.220
Writing out the inner with inner height of your screen and output it within that wrapper ID.

06:00.370 --> 06:05.500
So once you've done that I'm going to show you some other really neat methods that are available within

06:05.590 --> 06:07.530
a short window object.

06:08.830 --> 06:15.700
So the solution to this all we have to do is grab it via window and we can do inner height

06:21.010 --> 06:22.200
so inner height.

06:22.350 --> 06:27.520
And let's also do that other one there so that's out in the window.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.170
And in her with

06:35.800 --> 06:43.820
so save that and go back out and refresh your page so right now at the top we should be able to see

06:44.060 --> 06:51.690
our window with window height and if we actually change that and refresh the page again.

06:51.740 --> 06:58.130
So this value will change because we've actually changed how wide our our window is.

06:58.130 --> 07:03.120
So depending on how wide you've opened up your window you're going to have different values in there.

07:03.140 --> 07:06.650
There's some other information as well that we can make use of.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.820
And there's location so we know where the location is.

07:10.820 --> 07:18.850
So where the current browser window is and we can actually change that and load a separate u r l as

07:18.850 --> 07:19.300
well.

07:19.330 --> 07:21.710
So we can update the location.

07:21.890 --> 07:24.590
I can save this as index too.

07:24.730 --> 07:30.640
And then what we're going to do is we're going to open that up as index to one more where we're going

07:30.640 --> 07:33.000
to actually output our window location.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.500
So let's output to our HGA model and output the window location.

07:38.500 --> 07:43.780
So we know actually which page we're located on so window location and save that.

07:43.780 --> 07:49.330
And I actually want to show you a few more so just as we saw before where we could type an alert and

07:49.330 --> 07:51.670
we can have that alert show up.

07:51.730 --> 07:56.730
We can do even more where we can do besides just having an alert show up.

07:56.740 --> 08:02.500
So let me show you what happens when we refreshed the page and we know that this is not pop up message

08:02.500 --> 08:03.400
with the alert.

08:03.490 --> 08:06.420
And here I've got my window you are you are l.

08:06.430 --> 08:11.620
I've got the inner height and width of my current window.

08:11.780 --> 08:16.250
We can also open new windows so we can do window open.

08:17.120 --> 08:24.020
And then here we can put in you or else so because this is going to be the one that we just created

08:24.050 --> 08:30.410
or I can just open up the same one let's do window open so see what happens now and I'm going to comment

08:30.510 --> 08:31.580
at the alerts.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.330
We don't always get that alert.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.370
So you can open it up on the larger window here and I've got my pop ups blocked.

08:38.390 --> 08:40.850
So I'm just going to allow that pop up.

08:40.860 --> 08:46.390
Now this time when I load it we're actually opening up that window because we entered in that command.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.450
So this is opening up another window via javascript.

08:49.550 --> 08:55.190
And this is how we can do that where we can load the one window and we can see that it also loads up

08:55.190 --> 08:58.600
the second window and changes the focus to that second window.

08:58.910 --> 09:02.370
So we saw how we can add a window open to open up the window.

09:02.390 --> 09:07.460
We can also attach a variable to it so that this will actually sit within an object.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.690
Now and now we can actually link to that object.

09:10.700 --> 09:16.110
So before someone's so we can do a before unload.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.870
And remember this is sitting in another file.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.340
And from this file.

09:20.360 --> 09:26.170
So from index start to melt we've opened up a second window to index to h to Mel.

09:26.270 --> 09:31.300
And now we're going to fire off a function before that second window unloads.

09:31.310 --> 09:41.190
So we're going to fire off an alert and it's going to say don't go anywhere save it and go back out

09:41.210 --> 09:42.000
to the page.

09:42.020 --> 09:46.370
So we see that right now it's opening up that second page.

09:46.430 --> 09:51.680
And when I try to shut that one down so what it's doing is when I'm trying to leave this window it's

09:51.680 --> 09:53.650
actually telling me Don't go anywhere.

09:53.660 --> 10:01.250
So before I'm actually shifting over to this one here it's actually asking me to not leave before I'm

10:01.250 --> 10:01.930
actually running.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.830
And you've got quite a bit of control within the Windows object

10:09.290 --> 10:12.590
and yes there's a lot of information contained within here.

10:12.640 --> 10:18.220
But remember again that you don't have to memorize everything that's contained within the Windows object.

10:18.220 --> 10:25.830
You just have to be aware that you do have this control and you do have access to all of this information

10:25.860 --> 10:32.490
and methods that you can call upon and make use of within your javascript.

10:32.530 --> 10:34.010
So try it out for yourself.

10:34.060 --> 10:38.810
Open up your browser window and try that out for yourself.

10:40.460 --> 10:47.420
Right so the file location and in the next lesson we're going to look at what we can do with the history

10:47.660 --> 10:51.400
and how we can actually move between pages using javascript.
