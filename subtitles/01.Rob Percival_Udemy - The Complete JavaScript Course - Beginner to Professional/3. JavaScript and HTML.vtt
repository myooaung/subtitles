00:00.980 --> 00:05.350
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to be writing some Javascript.

00:05.360 --> 00:11.000
So the first thing we need to do is consider where we can write that javascript and that's where an

00:11.000 --> 00:12.080
editor comes in.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.560
I'm going to be using brackets so this is available at brackets.

00:15.590 --> 00:20.540
Oh and if you already have an editor that you're comfortable with or familiar with you can go ahead

00:20.540 --> 00:22.010
and use that one.

00:22.010 --> 00:22.810
So go ahead.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.220
Open up your editor.

00:24.350 --> 00:29.050
And first of all we need to create a place to hold that javascript.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.520
So we have a few options and we're going to be looking at all three different options that we have in

00:34.520 --> 00:40.040
order to write our javascript so we can include it within an aged him file.

00:40.040 --> 00:46.510
So I'm going to go ahead and create a brain you teach him file and I'm going to just call it Index index

00:46.530 --> 00:46.990
stuff.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.340
H t m l.

00:48.440 --> 00:54.480
So this can serve as our file in order to add javascript into it.

00:54.480 --> 01:00.950
And when we look at coding so coding essentially it is it's a set of instructions we need to pass these

01:00.950 --> 01:07.490
instructions over to the browser and the browser is the one that actually renders these instructions.

01:07.640 --> 01:13.040
So including HCM LCS and Javascript we don't need a server to render these out.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.200
This is all done within the browser.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.840
Let's go ahead and set up her e-mail template.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.370
So we'll start out with each two tags.

01:20.420 --> 01:22.900
And then within the head let's add in a title.

01:22.910 --> 01:30.310
So again opening and closing title and then once you added those in next let's move over to body and

01:30.350 --> 01:31.810
within the body tags.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.660
Let's set up a div here with Hello world.

01:35.690 --> 01:42.020
And also just underneath the div I'm also going to add a button and I'm going to show you why I'm adding

01:42.020 --> 01:43.940
this button afterwards.

01:44.190 --> 01:49.330
But let's just do a button and within the button we're just going to add some text and do.

01:49.340 --> 01:53.270
Click click here or something like that.

01:53.630 --> 01:59.010
So this is basic HVM Now we noticed that we've got opening and closing tags.

01:59.120 --> 02:06.700
And so we've got several elements here and we're ready to go to add javascript to.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.350
Right now there's nothing new.

02:08.350 --> 02:12.170
If you're familiar with age to me all this is just plain h tim L..

02:12.340 --> 02:17.330
And let's look at how we can add javascript into our page.

02:17.350 --> 02:24.450
So the first way that we can add javascript into our age to out elements is as attributes so javascript's

02:26.530 --> 02:30.280
can be added as a special h h to l element.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.930
And this basically triggers some Javascript.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.250
So we just had it in as an attribute.

02:36.280 --> 02:42.340
And this one we're going to add in is the on click and there's a number of these as well so there's

02:42.400 --> 02:48.070
the on select on change on key press down on key up.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.790
There's a number of different ones on drag on drop.

02:51.880 --> 02:57.340
And these all can be added in as attributes and we are going to be looking at these in more detail as

02:57.370 --> 03:01.610
we discuss more about what's available within the document object model.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.890
So that's coming up in the latter sections of this course.

03:05.980 --> 03:11.890
But for now it's just important to understand that we do have a way where we can add some basic javascript

03:12.160 --> 03:15.490
within our elements as an attribute.

03:15.520 --> 03:24.280
So now that I've created this special attribute within my age to all my javascript goes in here and

03:24.280 --> 03:30.400
basically this is essentially the action that's going to happen if this button gets clicked.

03:30.610 --> 03:37.150
So now we've set this up and let's open up our browser so save the file.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.340
This one is called indexed.

03:38.390 --> 03:39.400
H t m-L.

03:39.490 --> 03:42.830
So this one is available within my folder here.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.640
You could place it in any folder because really at the end of the day you don't need a server in order

03:48.640 --> 03:51.520
to run javascript so you can run it from anywhere.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.410
So go ahead.

03:52.420 --> 04:00.190
Pause the video and create this first first Each team will file with some javascript in it and when

04:00.190 --> 04:00.940
you come back.

04:01.060 --> 04:05.040
Let's take a look and we're going to see how this functions within the browser.

04:05.290 --> 04:12.220
So once you've created that go ahead and click it and then open it open it with any browser you want

04:12.460 --> 04:14.790
within the course I am going to be using Chrome.

04:14.830 --> 04:21.370
So I'm going to go ahead and open up within the Chrome browser and I'm going to size it here so this

04:21.370 --> 04:27.100
one as well I'm going to bring down to screen so that I can take a look at the source code as well as

04:27.100 --> 04:29.310
what's being output within my browser.

04:29.530 --> 04:34.530
So we've got a hello world here so this is just aged him out and we've got a button here.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.690
So once we click the button we're going to see that it fires off some javascript it says hello and this

04:40.690 --> 04:46.960
is a simple Windows object window alert a built in function that's ready to go within javascript.
