Work come back and in this lesson we're going to look at the navigator object.

00:05.270 --> 00:09.440
So the navigator object is everything about your browser.

00:09.590 --> 00:16.880
So let's open that up and we'll do a console directory and within the directory we're going to just

00:16.910 --> 00:22.270
open up the navigator objects you can see it's pop up over there and just grab that.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.680
So the same thing that we did for the windows for the document.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.040
We can see that the navigator holds a whole bunch of information.

00:30.110 --> 00:35.560
So basically it can tell you what browser you're using or the user is using.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.570
It can also see if cookies are enabled.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.340
We are going to look more at cookies later on.

00:40.340 --> 00:45.630
We can also get geo location information we can get the language.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.250
So there's a lot of information contained within here.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.600
There's also information about what the user agent is.

00:53.690 --> 01:00.610
So again this is important to be able to understand what browser your visitors are are using when they're

01:00.620 --> 01:01.880
visiting the web page.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.830
So a lot of information is contained within here.

01:05.060 --> 01:11.060
So what I want you to do now is to open up your editor and write what

01:13.890 --> 01:15.200
within the screen.

01:15.210 --> 01:21.770
So whenever though whenever someone comes to the screen output what a user agent they're using.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.050
So open up your editor and I'll show you how to do that.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.920
So we saw that earlier.

01:27.030 --> 01:32.070
So I'm going to just simply close this down and open up just our regular page.

01:32.070 --> 01:36.180
So what we want to do is we want to output the user agent.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.270
So let's try that.

01:37.290 --> 01:43.300
So we saw that under navigator we get all of that information for the user agent.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.340
So we've already grabbed our output.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.660
We're putting it in there.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.330
I can actually get rid of some of this access because we don't actually need it for this.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.000
For this lesson.

01:53.130 --> 01:58.700
So now we've already grabbed it as output and let's put that information.

01:58.710 --> 02:10.090
So we've got an output object and inner H-2 M-L and we saw that we can do navigator and have a navigator

02:10.120 --> 02:10.890
object.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.870
And the one that we want to grab So we see that we are getting some defaults here.

02:15.880 --> 02:23.740
And the one that we wanted to get is the user agent and let's refresh the page and we'll see what outputs

02:23.740 --> 02:24.370
here.

02:24.370 --> 02:31.350
So basically I can tell what browser the user is coming in on and I can check to see so I know there's

02:31.360 --> 02:39.290
a lot of information in here but basically we know that we're visiting and there's more information

02:39.320 --> 02:47.240
on Wikipedia about how the breakdown of the browser or the user agent basically is so strong here that

02:47.240 --> 02:49.280
we're producing in our output.

02:49.430 --> 02:58.550
So it breaks it down that why Mozilla then the computer that you're using the browser platform details

02:58.820 --> 02:59.860
and so on.

03:00.050 --> 03:04.070
So there's information that you can get and you can utilize within your javascript.

03:04.130 --> 03:05.600
So go ahead try it out.

03:05.630 --> 03:11.720
Open up your console checkout navigator and see what type of information is contained within there.

03:13.590 --> 03:17.610
As you never know it could be useful when you're creating your javascript.
