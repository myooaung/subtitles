00:01.120 --> 00:05.250
This lesson we're going to introduce you to Ekla script 6.

00:05.290 --> 00:09.520
So this is the latest big version change with javascript.

00:09.520 --> 00:16.890
Now javascript was started in 1995 and throughout the years there was various changes within the code.

00:16.900 --> 00:24.100
We got more functionality as the years went on and there were a number of things that developers were

00:24.220 --> 00:25.320
asking for.

00:25.390 --> 00:29.930
And then along came 2015 and the sixth edition.

00:30.010 --> 00:31.740
So this was the big change.

00:31.810 --> 00:38.310
M-A script 6 ESX and later it was renamed to X script 2015.

00:38.320 --> 00:44.920
So I know there's quite a few names there but this is the latest big version change in javascript and

00:44.920 --> 00:50.600
now it's planned that ongoing there's going to be annual changes to Javascript.

00:52.990 --> 00:59.080
And also not to worry that all of the course content earlier it still applies.

00:59.080 --> 01:05.430
So the javascript core fundamental concepts are still applicable when you're writing javascript.

01:05.470 --> 01:08.050
Except now we've got some more options.

01:08.050 --> 01:15.760
We've got some more functions that are available to us and a lot of them are very beneficial they're

01:15.760 --> 01:20.370
going to help us write code faster and better.

01:20.540 --> 01:25.310
So we're just looking at Wikipedia and there's a whole history of javascript here and there's a good

01:25.310 --> 01:28.810
summary of what's new and what the changes are.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.490
And the other thing to keep in mind when you're looking at javascript changes is that even though that

01:34.490 --> 01:39.650
there might be something you coming out with the code that Nessus that doesn't necessarily mean that

01:39.650 --> 01:46.300
you should be jumping onboard and start using that brand new language syntax that just came out.

01:46.580 --> 01:53.830
And the reason of course is compatibility because browsers update and not all of them will apply to

01:53.840 --> 01:58.100
all of those javascript updates in the same time period.

01:58.100 --> 02:05.060
So you're always going to end up with having incompatibilities and compatibility issues for the different

02:05.060 --> 02:07.570
functionalities so we've got a listing here.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.140
This is a really good list.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.360
King Gox get hub IO compatible table ESX I'll provide you a link for this.

02:16.370 --> 02:20.380
So basically on the left hand side we've got the different features.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.280
So these are all the syntax features.

02:22.280 --> 02:29.570
We've got some bindings here functions built ins built in extensions subclasses and a whole lot more

02:29.570 --> 02:36.110
so you can see there's a lot of categories of changes and also there's a lot of different browsers and

02:36.110 --> 02:41.080
compatibility for those changes within the browsers is what we're looking at here.

02:41.090 --> 02:43.100
So I know this is a little bit overwhelming.

02:43.130 --> 02:50.250
And for the most part there's only a few browsers and the really old browsers that you really do have

02:50.250 --> 02:51.260
to worry about.

02:51.390 --> 03:03.780
And also there's ways of compiling your scripts six or six script and really compiling it into an earlier

03:03.780 --> 03:04.850
version.

03:04.860 --> 03:12.330
So what Babel will do is it will allow you to write code here on the left hand side and it will present

03:12.380 --> 03:17.630
it in a format that's compatible with earlier versions of javascript.

03:17.770 --> 03:22.080
I'll give you a sneak peek into what we're going to be looking at in the next lesson so I get to write

03:22.080 --> 03:24.030
some ESX code.

03:24.030 --> 03:27.320
And we did have some changes with our block scopes.

03:27.450 --> 03:34.290
So earlier throughout the course as well whenever we're declaring variables we do the R and then we

03:34.290 --> 03:40.430
do assignment value and then we can do something like a string like hello world.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.350
And notice here on the right hand side we've got use strict.

03:44.370 --> 03:54.570
So what use strict does is it forces javascript into strict mode where it's the code has to be written

03:54.570 --> 03:55.490
properly.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.090
So basically it disables features that are confusing.

03:59.100 --> 04:07.200
It catches common errors and coding bloopers and also prevents different errors and it prevents different

04:07.500 --> 04:12.110
unsafe actions that can get taken especially within the global scope.

04:12.240 --> 04:18.640
And this is one of the big changes that we have is that we have these changes to the block scope.

04:18.660 --> 04:25.050
So instead of having all of her variables declared in the global scope we've got block scope and we

04:25.050 --> 04:27.370
are going to look at that in the upcoming lesson.

04:27.450 --> 04:34.560
But just to illustrate whatever I type him Konst a equals hello world we get the older variation where

04:34.560 --> 04:42.330
we've got we are a equals hello world so we can see that as well so if I copy and paste this and if

04:42.330 --> 04:44.300
I do another variable there.

04:44.490 --> 04:47.120
So it's just and the statements with the semi-colons.

04:47.190 --> 04:52.040
We see that the constants all get translated into v v.

04:52.230 --> 04:58.080
So basically the code on the right hand side you can copy and paste it into your javascript and you

04:58.080 --> 05:07.020
can present it to older browsers and have it compatible with those older browsers with the older syntax

05:07.110 --> 05:12.960
of javascript and we are going to be looking at in the next lesson more about block scope and block

05:12.960 --> 05:14.340
scope variables.

05:14.340 --> 05:21.570
So this was just a short introduction to what's new a javascript and what we are going to look at in

05:21.660 --> 05:23.250
the upcoming lessons.

05:24.570 --> 05:31.170
So after the video take a minute and go over to babbel J.S. IO check out the Web site you can go ahead

05:31.170 --> 05:32.170
and try it out.

05:32.340 --> 05:38.970
And as we progress through the lessons you can type in some of that brand new iOS ESX code and see it

05:38.970 --> 05:47.490
being translated into earlier version compatible code and also take a look through Wikipedia where we've

05:47.490 --> 05:52.590
got the history of javascript so you can get more familiar with different features that have been added

05:52.590 --> 05:54.510
and when they've been added and so on.

05:54.660 --> 06:00.060
And also lastly as we go through the different features that are new.

06:00.060 --> 06:06.840
With ESX you can take a look at you can see within this compatibility chart what exactly is compatible

06:06.900 --> 06:11.000
with what browsers and the next lesson we're going to jump into.

06:11.010 --> 06:12.660
BLOCK scope variables.
