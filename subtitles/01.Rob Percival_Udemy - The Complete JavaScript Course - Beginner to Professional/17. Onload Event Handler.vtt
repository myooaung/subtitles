00:01.340 --> 00:02.230
Welcome back.

00:02.250 --> 00:09.720
And in this lesson we're going to be looking at how we can trigger a function when the actual javascript

00:09.780 --> 00:10.510
loads.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.710
So let's say for instance we've got something that we want to happen but we want to always make sure

00:16.770 --> 00:25.490
that we're waiting until all of the body contents have loaded so we can do an on load within the body.

00:25.980 --> 00:32.690
And then all we need to do is simply identify the function that we want to trigger.

00:33.290 --> 00:42.770
And so this will trigger off the function and let's create that functions so function my fun.

00:43.070 --> 00:47.890
And then with and here is we can update one of the messages.

00:47.930 --> 00:52.010
So we saw earlier that we could do documents we could to

00:59.000 --> 01:02.310
were actually we can just update it because we already have it appear.

01:02.380 --> 01:17.430
So let's do upt output that inner HTL Mal and let's update that to say welcome all loaded.

01:18.250 --> 01:22.970
So that way this will actually trigger whenever the page loads.

01:23.110 --> 01:27.690
And really you're not going to see it because it happens really fast.

01:27.730 --> 01:35.260
So you can actually see it actually changing that but it is good to keep this in practice just to make

01:35.260 --> 01:40.090
sure if you actually are trying to update some of the elements you want to make sure that it's actually

01:40.090 --> 01:41.240
loaded already.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.180
So you don't want to.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.630
By chance maybe or javascript loads first.

01:44.690 --> 01:49.720
And Dawn doesn't fully get a chance to load in this particular element.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.360
So you want to make sure that everything got to load before you try to run that function.

01:54.460 --> 01:57.310
And also you're able to load it.

01:57.340 --> 02:05.800
So if you want to do on window on load so going back to window we could do window and that one is on

02:05.860 --> 02:06.510
load.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.600
So basically this one will trigger whenever the window is loaded.

02:10.630 --> 02:15.980
So then you can do the same thing where if you wanted to run a function you can run a function there.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.750
Oswell

02:20.020 --> 02:22.770
also let me add some attributes.

02:22.840 --> 02:30.060
So let's do the body in here as an attribute and then the other one I'm going to do the window as the

02:30.220 --> 02:31.340
attribute.

02:32.200 --> 02:40.290
So we'll see which one loads first and which one do you think will load first and that's

02:43.110 --> 02:44.930
And for this one because

02:48.800 --> 02:54.170
and for this one we need to do this a little bit differently where we need to create a function where

02:54.170 --> 03:06.190
we can wrap around and then have the actual execution of the code here and then close that one off.

03:06.230 --> 03:09.860
So we actually have a function where we're running that.

03:09.890 --> 03:17.750
And then within here is where we can add a window and then both of these passing the argument and then

03:17.750 --> 03:27.620
we just pick that up so do welcome and add the value that's being passed as the argument.

03:27.620 --> 03:34.070
So let's take a look at this and see which one loads and we'll notice what's actually loading is the

03:34.070 --> 03:34.750
window.

03:34.850 --> 03:40.850
So actually if I was to comment so so and if I go back and refresh it that we're actually not getting

03:40.880 --> 03:46.100
anything loading so the body isn't actually loading because we're actually overwriting.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.490
So there's only one event listener here.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.740
So either we're doing this one or this one.

03:51.800 --> 03:58.970
And because this one is the last one basically it's firing off this and we've got a completely empty

03:58.970 --> 03:59.750
function.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.070
So nothing is actually being rendered out.

04:02.090 --> 04:08.720
So if I was to actually remove the Windows completely go back and refresh the page then we see that

04:08.720 --> 04:15.200
body actually loads in mind that the order that the javascript is presented on the page is important

04:15.530 --> 04:20.120
as well as these event handlers get overwritten.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.320
So we only have one to work with here and the onload.

04:24.320 --> 04:31.700
So whether we're unloading for here or whether we're on loading for the window we can only do one.

04:31.790 --> 04:36.590
We can only do one and only one will actually fire off and that's the last one that we're going to make

04:36.590 --> 04:38.530
reference to here within our script.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.660
So we're the one that you choose.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.240
It's again up to you.

04:43.250 --> 04:49.700
Usually I prefer to take the one within the javascript just because it's a lot easier because I've got

04:49.700 --> 04:54.680
my javascript there and if I'm making edits to the javascript I don't always have to refer to my age

04:54.680 --> 04:58.070
to Moul especially if I'm using a g file.

04:58.130 --> 05:01.320
So what I want you to do now is try it for yourself.

05:01.370 --> 05:09.590
You can select either one and have the have something change when your web page loads and that's all

05:09.590 --> 05:11.400
you have to do for this exercise.

05:11.450 --> 05:17.750
Update some of your H-2 mail content as soon as the page loads

05:20.800 --> 05:22.130
and try that for yourself.

05:22.130 --> 05:23.570
Get familiar with it.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.780
Try both ways.

05:25.780 --> 05:30.490
Both approaches to the onload and get familiar with them.
