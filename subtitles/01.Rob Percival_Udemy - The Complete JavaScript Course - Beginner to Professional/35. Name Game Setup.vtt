00:06.310 --> 00:09.830
Wellcome And in this lesson we're going to be building out a game.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.900
So the game basically is going to be a set of names from an array.

00:14.920 --> 00:21.030
It's all going to be built using javascript so nothing within the of malware can be going off an array.

00:21.040 --> 00:27.220
It's going to scramble all the names in the array and the object of the game is to find the name that

00:27.220 --> 00:28.530
they're specifying.

00:28.540 --> 00:35.710
So once you hit the name then the cell disappears and you move on to the next one and you see how many

00:35.720 --> 00:38.800
you can find and how quickly you can find them and so on.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.050
So it's a fun little game and it's fully dynamic.

00:42.190 --> 00:47.050
So it will update as you update even more items in the array.

00:47.050 --> 00:48.950
So I can show you how to build this.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.820
So let's begin.

00:50.830 --> 00:58.150
So first thing that we want to do is set up the h t m l so we know that going over here we've got a

00:58.150 --> 00:58.660
button.

00:58.660 --> 01:03.790
So this is our start button and this basically starts the game and gives us the ability to restart the

01:03.790 --> 01:05.530
game and so on.

01:05.620 --> 01:14.670
So let's type that in sort of type and button and we'll set a value for it.

01:14.710 --> 01:17.360
So the value for it is start.

01:17.590 --> 01:22.920
So just like what we have here on the right hand side and we're going to do an on click.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.340
And basically we're going to start once that gets clicked.

01:27.370 --> 01:32.740
We're going to start the function start and I'm going to also have a class there to style it a little

01:32.740 --> 01:40.000
bit as well let's go up to the style and let's add in some styling for the button.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.310
So the button we've set a height for the button.

01:44.310 --> 01:47.910
So this could be 50 picks.

01:47.930 --> 01:50.260
We have set a with the button.

01:50.280 --> 01:57.420
So let's do 100 picks for the with and background color so you don't have to design it the same way

01:57.420 --> 01:58.730
that I'm doing it.

01:58.740 --> 02:07.340
So this is just a quick button design color is going to be white and border radius.

02:07.470 --> 02:11.830
So don't want to focus too much time on what we're doing here with the see assess.

02:11.970 --> 02:16.670
So we're going to create some quick CSSA here in order so we can get that styling.

02:16.710 --> 02:25.180
And then lastly the font size and of course you can always customize it afterwards to make it look look

02:25.180 --> 02:29.980
different look better and have some of the contents stand out more.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.230
So basically there we go.

02:31.230 --> 02:35.040
So we've got our button and we've also got two message areas.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.960
So let's set those up as well.

02:37.960 --> 02:45.680
And these are just divs and we're going to use classes so message one

02:48.490 --> 02:49.310
and first.

02:49.360 --> 02:55.690
Let's put a default placeholder there so welcome message.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.370
And actually let's just use IDs.

03:00.500 --> 03:08.220
So Id so message one and message to message to say click start

03:14.020 --> 03:16.930
and then we also need a game area.

03:17.170 --> 03:22.070
So let's give this one an ID and this will be where output goes.

03:22.390 --> 03:28.440
So basically this is our container for the game and this is all we really need for h t m l.

03:28.690 --> 03:33.140
So the next thing that we need I need to also add a little bit more styling.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.000
So before we begin I need to set up a box area.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.030
So these are these boxes here that you see here on the right hand side.

03:41.210 --> 03:45.060
So they're actually boxes that are 100 by 100.

03:45.250 --> 03:52.110
And this is where I'm containing the names and it's text line.

03:52.960 --> 03:59.880
So we're centralizing the text and I've also got a border around it as well.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.660
And this is just a simple black border

04:09.900 --> 04:17.720
and I'm also going to display it as inline blocks so that they stack so inline block so transform it

04:17.730 --> 04:22.970
from block to inline block because these are going to be divs or whatever we build them Motown's.

04:23.040 --> 04:26.570
So the next thing that we need to do is create some arrays.

04:26.610 --> 04:36.370
So first of all we need an array to hold the brain new elements that we're creating or the names that

04:36.370 --> 04:39.150
we're going to be creating from the other array.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.430
So that's basically the Mirei is our holder array.

04:42.610 --> 04:47.280
And this one is going to be an actual array with some contents.

04:47.410 --> 04:52.510
So we've got some names that we're going to fill out there and these could be anything so for us.

04:52.540 --> 04:57.040
Right now I've just got nine default names there that we can use.

04:57.070 --> 05:02.200
And then lastly we need one more variable and I'm just going to call this one key.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.780
So this is going to give us the ability to basically.

05:07.910 --> 05:11.750
So this will hold the value that we need to search for.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.990
So basically right now it's holding Lawrence and that's the key.

05:14.990 --> 05:18.420
So that's the value that's being searched for.

05:18.430 --> 05:21.900
So our first function that we're going to encounter is start.

05:21.910 --> 05:24.690
So this one is the one that actually starts the game.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.000
So let's add that one in first.

05:27.010 --> 05:31.910
So function and we're initiating that from the On Click attribute over here.

05:31.930 --> 05:34.510
So we're just initiating start.

05:35.290 --> 05:36.730
So this is starting the game.

05:36.730 --> 05:42.970
So the first set we need to do within starting in the game we need to build out this my array and we

05:42.970 --> 05:47.410
can populate it with information from over here from people.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.180
So let's do that first.

05:49.210 --> 05:57.460
So let's take my array and what we're going to do is we're going to take people and we're going to slice

05:57.550 --> 05:59.150
from our people every

06:02.040 --> 06:08.880
So what this does is this basically duplicates the contents of people array into Miree.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.240
So if you just do migrate close people then we're going to be tying the values together.

06:14.370 --> 06:18.750
And if we're removing from my array we're going to remove from people.

06:18.750 --> 06:24.690
So that's one of those quirks was javascript where if you're copying arrays you've got to do it this

06:24.690 --> 06:25.170
way.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.920
So this is the format to copy one array into another.

06:29.040 --> 06:35.040
So the next thing that we need to do is I want to randomize this array because you notice that within

06:35.040 --> 06:39.650
here they're not within the same order as not array is.

06:39.660 --> 06:47.790
So let's do a way to randomize and we can do it with array sort.

06:48.210 --> 06:53.460
And this is another really tricky little function that comes in useful.

06:53.460 --> 07:01.570
That gives you the ability to sort and array.

07:01.600 --> 07:08.970
So we're sorting the array function within here and we're returning within the array.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.960
So it's 0.5.

07:11.200 --> 07:16.170
Minus math random.

07:16.210 --> 07:20.470
So this is just a formula you can use as well.

07:20.470 --> 07:25.970
So this is a way to randomize the array.

07:25.970 --> 07:32.490
And then what I'll do is a console log out the my array so we can take a look at what we're doing here

07:32.490 --> 07:33.820
within the function.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.750
So just to make sure that everything is working so far.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.620
So let's go back it will refresh it.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.070
So we've got our start.

07:40.200 --> 07:45.600
And when we click start then where we've got our array there so we're clicking at.

07:45.660 --> 07:51.510
And you can see here that every time I click it I get another random assortment available to me.

07:51.660 --> 07:58.830
So I keep clicking and I'm getting a new randomising of the array so that everything is working.

07:58.850 --> 08:00.260
And so far so good.

08:00.270 --> 08:06.900
We've randomized the rate so Nexen that we need to do is we need to build out the application and then

08:06.900 --> 08:10.590
we need to run a function.

08:10.590 --> 08:22.450
So we need to build out game area and we need to after we build up the game area we need to run find

08:22.630 --> 08:23.860
the name.

08:23.950 --> 08:28.570
So we need to ask the user to find a name.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.350
So what I want you to do now pause the video.

08:31.350 --> 08:36.000
Open up your editor and create the same format that I have.

08:36.240 --> 08:43.800
Create an array and then copy that array into another array and then you'll notice that once you sort

08:43.800 --> 08:45.280
it if you do it this way.

08:45.300 --> 08:51.210
So first try it with the slice and you're going to find that you're actually sorting people as well.

08:51.210 --> 08:52.780
When you do the sort function.

08:52.830 --> 09:01.980
So this one you probably have to to copy out this statement here as it's a real short format for shuffling

09:01.980 --> 09:02.870
an array.

09:03.860 --> 09:10.130
We could also use the functionality that we had looked out earlier where we built that function to shuffle

09:10.140 --> 09:12.480
arrays although this is shorter.

09:12.500 --> 09:17.870
You can take out one as well and bring that into this project so it will do the same thing where you

09:17.870 --> 09:24.070
could pass that new newly built array and then shuffle that array information.

09:24.080 --> 09:30.140
So I want you to do as well is to create a function called build.

09:30.320 --> 09:35.420
So this is the one we're going to be building our game board and we've done this before as well in a

09:35.420 --> 09:42.750
previous exercise where we can loop through a series of values and we can build out some h t m l.

09:43.010 --> 09:49.400
So what we want to do this time is we want to loop through all of the values in the array so it's actually

09:49.400 --> 09:51.870
going to be the might or not the people array.

09:51.890 --> 10:00.290
Loop through all of them and build out a set of divs that have the contents of these elements within

10:00.290 --> 10:00.770
them.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.980
And I'll show you how to do this in the upcoming lesson.
