WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:05.230
At this point we have what looks like a game board.

00:05.250 --> 00:08.450
But we can actually interact with any of those tiles.

00:08.470 --> 00:13.400
So even if we click them it's basically going pick card not defined.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.570
So that is what our next step is.

00:16.570 --> 00:22.720
In order to create the next step of functionality where we're creating a function that we're going to

00:22.720 --> 00:24.220
call it pick card.

00:24.280 --> 00:31.580
So basically this function gets fired off by the user whenever they click the time card.

00:31.870 --> 00:37.720
So we know that we've got some parameters that we're sending over.

00:37.720 --> 00:44.970
So we know that X is going to be related to what this item is within that array.

00:44.980 --> 00:53.590
So within the tiler Ray we know that X is the index values so we can get what the value is of that particular

00:53.590 --> 00:56.800
tile by picking that up within x.

00:57.070 --> 01:01.930
So let's do that and we could have also passed it as well so as a number of ways that we could take

01:01.930 --> 01:03.320
care of this.

01:03.370 --> 01:05.590
But first let's just pick that up here.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.520
So we're going to pick up the value of the index.

01:08.530 --> 01:12.900
So I and the other thing that we're passing over is this.

01:12.910 --> 01:20.510
So we're going to pick up the value of this within t and we also know that we could console log.

01:20.890 --> 01:26.300
And this is from before that we had that event target.

01:26.310 --> 01:35.020
So basically what happens there is whenever something gets clicked that we actually fire off that target.

01:35.220 --> 01:40.730
So when we click it we get the information related to the trigger of the event.

01:40.770 --> 01:46.050
And this way we can get that information we could get the card information and a whole lot more.

01:46.050 --> 01:49.920
So there's a number of options here that we can make use of.

01:50.190 --> 01:58.500
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to check to see if a card is already flipped over and

01:58.500 --> 02:04.560
that's where we need to set another variable I'm going to set a global variable here and I call it

02:08.550 --> 02:18.180
card flipped and I'm I to set this value to negative 1 so that we know that if we've got a negative

02:18.180 --> 02:22.430
one that we don't have that value within the array yet.

02:22.590 --> 02:28.320
So let's create another function and we're going to call it card flip and within current flip we're

02:28.320 --> 02:33.120
going to pass over the two same two parameters that we took in.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.060
So we're going to get the index and the current object that's under this.

02:38.310 --> 02:46.530
So let's create the card flip and here muscle use the same parameters so that in the t that we're passing

02:46.560 --> 02:47.190
in.

02:47.190 --> 02:51.560
And now let's actually update the source of T.

02:51.720 --> 02:57.570
So because we've got t as the object from where we started out by passing again and as this we picked

02:57.570 --> 03:02.460
it up and pick a card and then we passed it over here as well.

03:02.490 --> 03:03.930
So we don't actually have to pass it.

03:03.930 --> 03:06.040
We could do the target as well.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.330
So that would work out the same way.

03:08.430 --> 03:13.500
So we could save ourselves passing a parameter for one or two we could do it within that type of format

03:13.530 --> 03:14.740
as well.

03:14.760 --> 03:25.280
So let's set a value for the source and I'm going to use placeholder the placeholder text again.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.960
So I got a copy and place it in.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.680
So this again this is a Web site that allows you to have dummy text.

03:33.820 --> 03:38.830
And this is the same thing that we're using over here and we've got some options where we can set some

03:38.830 --> 03:39.960
text in there.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.580
So I want to add in

03:46.770 --> 03:50.130
the value that's contained within the tile array.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.580
And within I we're passing through that index value.

03:55.700 --> 04:01.610
So essentially getting the value that's contained within that array and this is also useful if we actually

04:01.610 --> 04:05.840
have images set there then we don't actually have to use the placeholder image.

04:05.930 --> 04:11.870
We can just use the tile array image soever Valuev We've got within that tile array and we can just

04:11.870 --> 04:13.880
simply place that as the source.

04:14.060 --> 04:21.570
So that's the other option that we can set that up and place that in with them the source and also the

04:21.570 --> 04:24.840
other thing too is now that we've flipped over the card.

04:24.960 --> 04:32.090
What I want to do is I want to place this value now within our tile flipped over array.

04:32.160 --> 04:40.650
So we're simply going to push it in there so push that in and we're going to grab the ID of T because

04:40.650 --> 04:44.860
remember we have it as an object and we can push in that ID.

04:44.910 --> 04:49.840
So basically tyle flipped over array is now going to contain that value.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.640
So let's save it and try this out.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.120
So let's hit start.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.980
And before we do one thing I did for yet I forgot to call that a function.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.780
So let's try that out again.

05:04.100 --> 05:10.580
So now we get all of our tiles and when we click it we can actually flip it over so it can flip over

05:10.610 --> 05:17.340
all of the tiles and we do see there's one error there that we've got one coming back as undefined.

05:17.390 --> 05:22.410
So just a quick scan through that we've got sixes so we're missing one of the threes.

05:22.550 --> 05:26.240
So maybe let's try to reload that and see if that actually happens again.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.780
And if it does then we know that we're there's a problem somewhere along the way.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.350
So we're getting undefined.

05:33.380 --> 05:40.490
So what's happening here is that we seem to have a problem here with how we're setting up our values.

05:40.850 --> 05:45.050
So let's do some quick troubleshooting and figure out why we've got undefined.

05:45.050 --> 05:51.890
If I go to inspect we see that we've got card 12 but we're getting undefined so we're passing through

05:51.920 --> 05:54.640
the value of 12 here as X..

05:54.740 --> 05:58.340
And we know that the array we're looking at an array index.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.940
So we know that it's not actually going to be 12.

06:00.950 --> 06:03.910
It should be minus 1 on this index.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.730
So let's go ahead and try this again and hit start.

06:07.970 --> 06:11.630
And this time we shouldn't have anymore undefined.

06:11.750 --> 06:16.700
So sometimes it's always good to kind of do some troubleshooting and make sure that you're not having

06:16.700 --> 06:18.520
any errors or any issues.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.990
And that seems to be working properly.

06:20.990 --> 06:28.970
So it's likely that we caught this one little bug here because we know that arrays start at zero so

06:28.970 --> 06:35.730
our next step is within the pick card function because we noticed that we're not we typically within

06:35.730 --> 06:41.610
the typical game play we can't flip over all of the tiles we can flip over one where we can flip over

06:41.610 --> 06:43.350
a second one if there is no match.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.730
They flip back over.

06:44.730 --> 06:48.760
So we don't have this type of thing where we can just simply flip them all over.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.440
So we need to add the logic now within the game play.

06:52.730 --> 06:58.980
So let's look at our card pick and this is where we can figure out how many cards we've actually flipped

06:58.980 --> 07:08.150
over and if we've flipped over a card and we can see if this is our second card that we're actually

07:08.150 --> 07:09.260
flipping over.

07:09.440 --> 07:18.350
So now we can apply some logic so let's do something here where we know that earlier we had set a variable.

07:18.350 --> 07:24.080
Let's go back up to our variables and we know that we had set this variable of card flipped to negative

07:24.110 --> 07:24.690
1.

07:24.950 --> 07:33.640
So let's do a condition here and we'll check to see if card if card flipped.

07:33.650 --> 07:43.430
So let's grab that value there and we'll check to see if card flipped is larger than greater than zero.

07:43.820 --> 07:50.000
And if it is then we run this once we know that this is actually the second card that we're flipping

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
over and else.

07:52.010 --> 07:59.930
So if it's not larger than zero then we can still flip a card but we need to set whatever card flipped

07:59.930 --> 08:06.300
value is and we need to set that to the index value that we've sent over.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.750
So that's as we're just going to do that as index value.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.990
I clean this up a little bit.

08:12.020 --> 08:17.240
So basically we're going to know that this is the second card that we're flipping out flipping over

08:17.240 --> 08:25.330
essentially and this is where we need to apply even more logic within our application because this is

08:25.330 --> 08:30.460
where we need to check to see if it's a match.

08:30.460 --> 08:36.600
And if it is a match then we leave the cards flipped over so we don't flip them back.

08:36.790 --> 08:43.000
And if it's not a match then we set an interval and we flip the cards back over.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.880
So let's set up that condition.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.220
So we're going to do a condition to see if it's a match.

08:48.650 --> 08:51.040
Add some logic in there and else.

08:51.070 --> 08:57.190
So if it's not a match then what we're going to do is we're going to type into the message and do into

08:57.190 --> 08:58.560
the in our aged him.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.270
And we're going to say no match

09:04.290 --> 09:07.540
and next let's set an interval.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.720
So another global variable.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.590
And I know I've got quite a bit of global variables.

09:12.930 --> 09:18.260
But usually I like to work with the global variables first because it's easier to debug.

09:18.390 --> 09:21.690
And then afterwards I'll remove out the global variables.

09:21.810 --> 09:29.730
So let's set up let's declare a timer and then we'll make use of timer down here within this condition

09:30.020 --> 09:34.470
where we'll set the timer and we're going to set an interval.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.540
So basically this will

09:39.490 --> 09:45.400
hide the cards and the reason I'm doing it as an interval is because I want to make sure the cards hide

09:45.910 --> 09:52.770
so nothing else gets in the way and I can always clear that interval as well so let's do another function

09:53.230 --> 10:03.680
and we're going to hide the cards at 1000 1000 milliseconds so basically after one second so let's go

10:03.680 --> 10:05.460
ahead and create another function.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.670
So no I've got one open over there that I still need to finish off before we can even try the game.

10:10.670 --> 10:12.850
So this one is called Hide card.

10:13.040 --> 10:21.760
And basically this function will take the flipped cards and they're going to basically hide them so

10:21.760 --> 10:25.960
let's do a quick overview of what we've done within our code so far.

10:25.960 --> 10:34.780
So every time the card is clicked we're passing some values into our pick card and within pick card

10:34.870 --> 10:37.400
we're passing it over into card flip.

10:37.570 --> 10:45.130
So if we do have the availability we pass it over into card flip and in card flip where updating the

10:45.130 --> 10:51.550
source and we're flipping the card over we're adding it to the tile flipped over.

10:51.730 --> 10:58.200
So basically what that means is that we've got an array of all the cards that have been flipped over.

10:58.390 --> 11:05.200
And now we can make use of that because we know that the last two cards that got flipped over we can

11:05.200 --> 11:11.520
find out what the values of those are.

11:11.670 --> 11:19.590
So basically we need to check to see if the last two items in the array the tile flipped over array

11:19.920 --> 11:21.940
have a matching source.

11:21.990 --> 11:26.750
And if they do that we know we found a match to our files.

11:26.850 --> 11:29.270
So let's create one more functions.

11:29.280 --> 11:36.480
Let's open that up and we're going to basically check the source of that element because we've got a

11:36.480 --> 11:41.000
listing of the elements whenever we hit the card flip.

11:41.010 --> 11:47.340
We're actually posting the ID of the element that is contained.

11:47.340 --> 11:52.710
So whenever we click these and this is where we need to check the source of that and that this is going

11:52.710 --> 11:58.440
to be a really short function where we're basically going to grab the source and where we're going to

11:58.440 --> 11:59.720
return that back.

11:59.850 --> 12:11.160
So let's post a variable in here so let's just use a and let's use variable or we can simply just return.

12:11.170 --> 12:13.530
So we're going to return back to the source.

12:13.570 --> 12:21.080
So this is Document get element by id and the element is going to be a.

12:21.130 --> 12:24.490
And we're just going to simply return back the source.

12:24.490 --> 12:29.650
So the reason I'm doing it within a function is because that's just going to simplify our conditional

12:29.650 --> 12:30.330
statement.

12:30.520 --> 12:37.410
So now we know that we can get a conditional statement and we can check the source of a particular value.

12:37.540 --> 12:43.270
So we know that if we check the source of one compared to the source of the other one and if they're

12:43.270 --> 12:46.190
matching then we know that we found a match.

12:46.240 --> 12:53.760
So then we can take that message that match found.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.100
And if they're not matching then we know that there's no match and we can go ahead and we can hide the

12:59.100 --> 13:00.230
card.

13:00.870 --> 13:08.430
So we need to find out how we can get to the last elements that are located within the range that we've

13:08.430 --> 13:09.450
been setting up.

13:09.450 --> 13:14.850
So the last elements that are within the flipped over array and that's the value that we have to pass

13:14.850 --> 13:16.890
within the check source.

13:16.920 --> 13:24.720
So the best way to get the last element is I know this is kind of long but we can do length minus one

13:25.080 --> 13:33.330
to get that second last item within the flipped over tile flipped over array and then we can do the

13:33.330 --> 13:38.240
same thing for the other parameter.

13:38.390 --> 13:42.660
And this one we can do minus two.

13:42.680 --> 13:51.540
So let's let's try this suit and this time let's click and we see that no match was found.

13:51.760 --> 13:57.240
So we know that when we restart it and again no match is found.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.100
So that looks like it's working.

13:59.110 --> 14:04.930
And in the next lesson we have to build out some more logic here where we need to flip these cards back

14:04.930 --> 14:10.240
over and we need to clear out the interval and so on says quite a few things that we need to do in the

14:10.240 --> 14:11.600
upcoming lesson.

14:11.770 --> 14:15.990
So do take a look at the code so far and try it out for yourself.

14:16.090 --> 14:22.330
Try applying some logic here grabbing the last elements and making sure that we're able to pick up that

14:22.330 --> 14:24.370
information that we've passed in here.

14:24.370 --> 14:30.840
And we also will also need to be able to grab the ID of the element because we need to be able to flip

14:30.840 --> 14:34.780
it back over and that's what we're doing over here where we're checking the source.

14:34.930 --> 14:41.040
And when we go to hide the card we can grab the source and we can re update the source values as well

14:41.230 --> 14:42.930
just by using that ID.

14:42.940 --> 14:46.180
So the same thing that we did over here grabbing the element by ID.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.600
We can also do it and implement it when we're hiding the card.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.380
So I showed you how to do that.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.660
Coming up in the next lesson.
