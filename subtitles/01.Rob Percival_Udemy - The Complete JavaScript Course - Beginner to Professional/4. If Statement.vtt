WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.170
Welcome back.

00:02.180 --> 00:10.030
And earlier we saw the ternary operator and we saw how we can apply a condition and then return back

00:13.130 --> 00:19.100
an expression depending on what this condition evaluates to so whether it's true.

00:19.140 --> 00:19.970
We were turned back.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.060
The first item the second one gets returned.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.670
If it's false.

00:24.750 --> 00:32.130
So what happens if you actually want to have this condition but you want something to happen maybe you

00:32.130 --> 00:41.180
want an alert to happen so you can either close them within the rounded brackets and I should say no

00:41.190 --> 00:44.100
we don't want to enclose the whole thing.

00:44.370 --> 00:53.580
So I want to wrap that one and then I can drop this one and then move this one over to here.

00:53.580 --> 01:00.360
So basically if we do it this way we can see that when I entered and everything is still working the

01:00.360 --> 01:01.370
same way.

01:01.650 --> 01:10.120
So I also have the ability to add in something like if I wanted an alert and this alert will say hello.

01:10.140 --> 01:11.980
So nice welcoming message.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.580
And then what we need to do if we want to have multiple

01:20.770 --> 01:24.200
operations happening we can come separate it.

01:24.340 --> 01:31.780
And basically what's going to happen now is that the last expression is going to be the one that's actually

01:31.780 --> 01:33.220
going to get taken.

01:33.340 --> 01:42.350
So if we reverse this order or if we just leave Hello we're actually going to get a problem here.

01:42.370 --> 01:46.370
So even though it will say hello we're going to get on the phone.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.890
So the way to bring that defined by is to you comma separated.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.820
So now when I refresh it and the tape.

01:53.860 --> 01:55.240
Mike It says hello.

01:55.300 --> 02:02.610
And it goes back to welcome Mike so he can do the same thing for denied and there is a problem here.

02:02.650 --> 02:08.590
If we do want to have more things happen we want to sign different variables and different values.

02:08.590 --> 02:11.610
We can't link them together with the comma.

02:11.770 --> 02:19.000
And as long as at the end we're actually returning back a value that we're always going to get some

02:19.000 --> 02:21.990
type of input here within that inner HMO.

02:22.270 --> 02:26.070
So ideally this is the best way to present it.

02:26.080 --> 02:32.680
It's really good if you want to have a really short format for the if statement but if you want something

02:32.740 --> 02:33.550
longer.

02:33.610 --> 02:35.730
And that's where we use the statement.

02:36.010 --> 02:42.170
So what I want to do now is I'm going to rewrite what we've got here and I'm going to place it within

02:42.280 --> 02:45.360
an if statement and then we'll do a quick comparison.

02:46.690 --> 02:53.680
So basically the if statement allows us to once again evaluate the condition and if the condition is

02:53.680 --> 02:55.690
true that it will run.

02:55.690 --> 03:05.540
What's being set within that first expression so do our same condition here.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.100
And let's let's go down to

03:11.180 --> 03:13.960
over here and I get a set log in.

03:13.980 --> 03:17.150
So we're going to use that same plug in that we had before.

03:17.150 --> 03:18.950
So we do live in true.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.900
And this is what we're going to do to start.

03:21.050 --> 03:25.420
I'm going to comment at this prompting and to get rid of the stuff here as well.

03:25.430 --> 03:31.670
So basically it won't ask us any analyst come back tonight because we're not going to have a value for

03:32.200 --> 03:33.440
that user input.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.880
So it's going to come back to night

03:37.710 --> 03:43.200
and they should declare that variable because otherwise I'm going to get an error there so user input

03:43.650 --> 03:48.980
and I'm just going to leave user input as blank.

03:49.010 --> 03:56.060
So next let's go down to here and we're going to put log in and we saw earlier that log in.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.510
Just point easing logging on it's own.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.120
We can do the same thing as we did with equal equal.

04:02.120 --> 04:02.770
True.

04:02.990 --> 04:06.880
So now we've got the curly brackets.

04:06.950 --> 04:10.370
And then within the curly brackets we can do something.

04:10.370 --> 04:12.260
So let's update our inner

04:15.200 --> 04:17.250
welcome.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.100
It was true.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.150
So do something like that.

04:22.180 --> 04:30.050
So now when we refreshed we see get welcome it was true because what's happened now is that this if

04:30.160 --> 04:32.460
statement got executed.

04:32.700 --> 04:38.680
Checked the condition of log in and we know that log in is true because we've set it to True.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.670
Just up here.

04:39.760 --> 04:47.310
So it seems if the specific condition is truthy and if it is then it executes this content.

04:47.650 --> 04:51.250
So what happens if it's not true.

04:51.630 --> 04:52.950
So we have an option.

04:52.980 --> 04:58.220
And that's really the nice thing about these statements that we also have the option.

04:58.230 --> 05:04.810
So sometimes you'll find that programmers will just use the if statement by itself.

05:04.910 --> 05:08.670
And they're not going to have something happening if this isn't true.

05:08.990 --> 05:12.010
But we do have an option and that's where else comes in.

05:12.020 --> 05:19.000
So elf's gives us the ability to output something if that particular condition is not true.

05:19.250 --> 05:24.140
And again to get rid of this and I'm going to say that I'd

05:27.040 --> 05:33.750
do it was not sure to update this to be false.

05:34.060 --> 05:38.760
Go back refreshed and we get denied was not true.

05:39.190 --> 05:46.840
So how do we take what we did within the turn every operator and apply it with in a conditional statement

05:47.550 --> 05:48.660
and if statement.

05:48.760 --> 05:56.170
So what we want you to do now pause the video and get rid of what we did up here for the Turner statement

05:56.530 --> 06:02.050
and create those outputs here within this type of format within the if statement.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.610
So you've got an opportunity to try this out.

06:07.830 --> 06:13.840
So let's update our code and we've got the user input we're asking for the prompt.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.900
So we do need that we don't need not want any more.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.320
We still need to grab the element within the output.

06:20.370 --> 06:24.400
And here is where we've got our condition.

06:24.420 --> 06:30.360
So just like what we did in the temporary OPERATOR We've got our condition over here right in the beginning

06:30.420 --> 06:39.030
of the if statement and the other thing that we did is that we had multiple expressions here.

06:39.030 --> 06:39.810
So let's

06:42.980 --> 06:44.070
update this.

06:44.090 --> 06:48.330
And now we can clean this up a little bit as well.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.840
So we've got that output.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.200
And then we also had that denied.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.650
And then we just did a column separation with the user input.

06:56.870 --> 07:04.290
So let's just add that to the end here and add that to the end here and not get rid of this stuff up

07:04.310 --> 07:04.840
here.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And I can also get rid of the like.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.430
So now let's try it and see if it actually works the same way.

07:12.490 --> 07:18.730
So save refresh and first let's enter the name that's there and we see.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.230
Hello welcome.

07:20.230 --> 07:21.710
It was true.

07:22.120 --> 07:29.490
So next let's enter in a name we're entering nobody and we get denied.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.580
What's not true.

07:30.580 --> 07:39.420
Nobody And there's really a great advantage to doing it this way because you see you've got an opportunity

07:39.570 --> 07:42.030
to set multiple values.

07:42.090 --> 07:50.370
So even though the Turnier operator is a lot shorter if you're looking to do apply quite a bit of logic

07:50.820 --> 08:00.690
within your code it might be easier to use an if statement so that you can also updates and do even

08:00.690 --> 08:01.220
more.

08:01.230 --> 08:06.960
So if I have a variable and HCM I'll put or something like that.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.340
And let's just put this one blank right now.

08:13.400 --> 08:18.890
I can also update my h tim output.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.390
I could shorten this

08:23.190 --> 08:25.420
and then this one I could always do at the end.

08:25.440 --> 08:34.230
Because now I know that I've got one value from each T.M. output and I can simply put it there so I

08:34.230 --> 08:37.380
can really simplify what's happening here.

08:40.740 --> 08:44.560
Just meet together in

08:47.710 --> 08:52.140
save that and clean this one up as well.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.490
So don't need all of this here at the ends to get the quotes.

09:00.470 --> 09:04.080
So it gives us an option to do even more.

09:04.220 --> 09:07.090
So we're taking some type of action.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.920
We're updating this.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.200
We can even ask even another prompt in here.

09:12.290 --> 09:12.880
So welcome.

09:12.980 --> 09:13.960
It was true.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.860
And maybe over here we've got another prompt.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.130
And we'll just ask them their level or maybe we'll ask them their age.

09:27.210 --> 09:29.310
And variable age.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.960
And then over here we can apply something else to happen as well.

09:36.180 --> 09:45.020
So we can take the value of age that we're studying in here and make use of it within our HMO.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.530
So let's let's

09:50.190 --> 09:54.360
ternary operator in here and we're going to check to see if

09:57.210 --> 09:58.990
so do each T.M. outputs.

09:59.020 --> 10:06.720
So we're going to add to that HMO output so some additional context to that.

10:06.800 --> 10:11.930
And this is where we're going to use age and we're going to use a territory operator for this one so

10:11.930 --> 10:13.890
we've got a combination of both.

10:14.060 --> 10:17.630
So we're going to check to see if age is greater than 18.

10:17.810 --> 10:30.960
And if it is then we're going to add you are over 18 and otherwise we're going to say you are under

10:31.800 --> 10:32.960
18.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.060
So now let's try the set.

10:35.060 --> 10:42.480
So we're going to get one prompt asking us for our name and if our need is within the user names then

10:42.480 --> 10:50.330
we can run through the logic here and output ask and ask the age and then check to see what their age

10:50.330 --> 10:55.770
is update that into the cement output and then we can see that within our HMO.

10:55.950 --> 10:59.540
So let's let's save us and go back in here.

10:59.730 --> 11:03.380
So we need to be within the within the array.

11:03.480 --> 11:09.210
So if we just type in something that's not in the array we see that denied was not true and we're not

11:09.210 --> 11:13.440
even going to bother with the age because we know the person is not in the range.

11:13.650 --> 11:20.180
So that's let's see if the person is in the array we output Hello and now we're asking their age.

11:20.190 --> 11:23.200
So you say 19 and then welcome.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.100
It was true.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.190
You are over 18 John.

11:26.760 --> 11:33.300
So this is a great way to do a combination between the two and really programming is all about creating

11:33.300 --> 11:39.480
that set of instructions for the application to run through.

11:39.580 --> 11:46.210
And this is where logic is really really important because it gives us the ability to set different

11:46.210 --> 11:56.530
paths and run different pieces of code depending on what values we've got and what are met or are not.

11:56.740 --> 12:04.800
So what I want you to do now is take what you've learned and try it for yourself create your own separate

12:04.810 --> 12:13.240
file create an array of users and their names ask them about what their name is check to see if that

12:13.240 --> 12:14.990
user is in the array.

12:15.130 --> 12:23.200
And if they are then run some code create some code create some variables and create an interesting

12:23.230 --> 12:26.040
output to be returned back to the user.

12:26.260 --> 12:31.700
And then the next lesson we're going to explore even more with what we can do with if statements.
