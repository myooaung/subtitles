Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to look at a document query selector.

00:05.150 --> 00:12.210
So this is another way and another really common way in order to specify and select elements.

00:12.230 --> 00:17.090
Basically it allows you to select a limit that matches a specified selector.

00:17.210 --> 00:20.080
So let's put up so variable E L.

00:20.210 --> 00:26.210
And we're going to do document because again belongs in that document object and this time we're going

00:26.210 --> 00:29.580
to use the method queery selector.

00:29.780 --> 00:37.400
So basically what this will do is this will return back that first element that matches that selection

00:37.940 --> 00:40.540
and it follows CSSA format.

00:40.670 --> 00:45.540
So if we want to return back message we need to include that hash.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.750
So the same way that you would write your CSSA styling.

00:49.790 --> 00:52.100
You can do it the same way in query selector.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.240
So let's go back.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.600
Refresh the page.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.870
Type in E-L and we're able to grab a message.

00:58.130 --> 01:04.160
So you're probably wondering well what happens because I've got a number of them with the class of output.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.870
So what's going to happen in this instance.

01:06.890 --> 01:10.200
So let me show you and we're going to do output.

01:10.240 --> 01:15.840
So following C-s us again for classes we do that Daut.

01:16.130 --> 01:23.720
So refreshing it and E-L and we see that we're grabbing the first element within each team L that actually

01:23.840 --> 01:27.830
returns back and matches our selection process.

01:27.830 --> 01:33.860
So this is another really useful way of making your selection within your elements.

01:33.860 --> 01:41.110
So also let's say for instance that we're looking for output but we want so I'm going to create a parent

01:41.110 --> 01:54.230
here and I'm going to give it a div of pick me so that we can see that and I'm going to drop an element

01:54.290 --> 01:55.820
inside of there.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.880
So now what we can do and we notice that let's do some CSSA here.

02:00.920 --> 02:08.670
So if we wanted to highlight that when we came to pick me and then we can do output.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.840
And this is another really great way to practice it is that you can use CSSA.

02:14.990 --> 02:21.880
So if you can select it within CSSA You can also select it within Javascript.

02:21.890 --> 02:23.730
So let's go back and refresh it.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.950
So we see that this selection worked.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.890
And if this selection worked in CSSA we know that we can grab that same element here within the output.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.950
So let's refresh it again.

02:34.970 --> 02:43.220
So go to the page save it and go back to the page and this time let's see what we can return back for

02:43.220 --> 02:43.790
L.

02:43.820 --> 02:53.030
So we are able to select that particular element just simply by using the same values that we use within

02:53.090 --> 02:59.720
our query selector so also really useful if you've got inputs.

02:59.730 --> 03:07.790
We've got a type of input and we've got let's set up a bunch of text inputs and give it a name of first

03:10.460 --> 03:13.420
and then we'll do some more text inputs.

03:13.640 --> 03:22.390
And this one can have a name of last so we know that when we use CCS we can find out we can use input

03:23.000 --> 03:28.780
and we can use the square brackets and we can be more specific with some of the attributes.

03:28.910 --> 03:35.850
So we want to pick out the one that has a name of last and this one.

03:35.870 --> 03:40.600
Let's do a background color so we'll do background color and we'll make it red.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.070
So it really stands out.

03:42.080 --> 03:42.970
So let's go back.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.750
Refreshed the page.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.910
So we see that we've got that one in red.

03:46.910 --> 03:53.270
So basically what this means is that we can do the same thing here within the query selector so I can

03:53.270 --> 04:02.330
literally copy my US I can go out and I can refresh it and now it is not input that we're selecting.

04:02.350 --> 04:04.240
So this is really useful.

04:04.240 --> 04:13.870
So what I want you to do now is to go ahead and open up your h tim l editor and create some inputs just

04:13.870 --> 04:21.630
like I did over here and grab it via the input and then next challenge yourself do some CSA us highlight

04:21.640 --> 04:28.240
one of the elements and then copy that and place it with the Querrey selector and output that content

04:29.610 --> 04:34.980
and then once you've made your selection input a value if you're selecting within the input fields and

04:34.980 --> 04:45.000
put a value of it worked sauce also you how to do that so well and we know this as an input so we can

04:45.000 --> 04:47.310
set a value for it.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.620
So we can write.

04:50.670 --> 04:51.600
It worked.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.000
Go back and refresh the page.

04:54.090 --> 04:54.630
And there we go.

04:54.630 --> 05:00.570
So now we see that we're actually able to type in and make that selection using query selector.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.330
So go ahead try it for yourself.

05:02.340 --> 05:05.240
And in the next lesson it'll look at query selector.

05:05.270 --> 05:09.270
All so that's going to be the alternative to query selector.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.140
If we've got a number of elements that we want to return back.

05:12.170 --> 05:12.880
So it's coming up.
