WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:06.320
So if you had an opportunity to try this out now the first thing that we needed to do is add in the

00:06.320 --> 00:07.850
ability to output.

00:07.850 --> 00:12.870
So we saw this before we grabbed that element and now we can output content into here.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.380
So now let's add in that condition.

00:15.380 --> 00:22.850
So we know that we can check the value of C S and see if it's equal to p s so C S is the computer selection

00:23.000 --> 00:24.930
P.S. Is the player selection.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.120
And if they're actually equal then we know that this is a tie.

00:29.180 --> 00:33.870
So I want to have a variable as basically a placeholder.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.640
It's going to start out as blank and this is where we're going to add in

00:40.530 --> 00:41.490
that it's a tie

00:44.430 --> 00:48.990
and we're also going indicate if the if the player is a winner or a loser.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.800
So it's a tie.

00:51.810 --> 00:54.460
So we're going to add into that H to m-L.

00:54.540 --> 01:00.640
So we know that if C-s is not equal to us we've got a lot of conditions to work out.

01:00.660 --> 01:01.870
So let's try that.

01:01.890 --> 01:05.100
And we know that we can add that into that statement.

01:05.280 --> 01:12.350
And then at the end of the day we're going to do output dark inner h t male is equal to.

01:12.540 --> 01:17.790
So it's going to be Player versus computer.

01:17.860 --> 01:21.390
And so there's a lot of styling that you could add into this as well.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.790
So feel free to update this with styling.

01:24.790 --> 01:27.160
I'm just doing some really basic HVM here.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.640
I'm not going to worry too much about the styling for this one.

01:30.640 --> 01:36.220
This is just a simple exercise to demonstrate how we're outputting and doing the rock paper scissors

01:37.030 --> 01:38.690
so do player.

01:39.130 --> 01:43.820
So I just want to be able to output that content so I've got the player's content.

01:43.930 --> 01:49.400
I've got the computer's content so let's output that for display.

01:49.400 --> 01:55.340
I make a line break there and then last but not least let's add in what happened the result.

01:55.340 --> 02:04.930
So basically this result is going to be what happened after we run all of our conditions so we can try

02:04.930 --> 02:07.140
this out and we can refresh it.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.070
So let's let's do rock and hit.

02:10.090 --> 02:10.840
OK.

02:10.870 --> 02:12.820
So rock versus rock.

02:12.820 --> 02:13.540
It's a tie.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.070
So that one actually worked.

02:15.100 --> 02:21.050
And that was a nice Fluke there that both the computer and myself picked the same one.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.710
But this isn't going to be always the case.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.530
So we need to make some conditions.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.930
So let's add these in.

02:28.210 --> 02:36.480
So I have to do is to really think about the logic of this application and we can really do this with

02:36.490 --> 02:37.770
him conditions.

02:37.770 --> 02:39.990
So let's start with the very basics.

02:40.050 --> 02:45.670
We know that the player selection so the player is selected either rock paper scissors.

02:45.810 --> 02:50.600
So it's going to be displayed within us as our P or ass.

02:50.610 --> 02:56.360
And I really hate typing scissors that's why having these first characters is going to be really ideal.

02:56.370 --> 03:03.360
So p s and we're going to check to see if the player has selected a rock.

03:03.720 --> 03:14.890
And if they have then we know that the rock beats the scissors and we know that that's how the player's

03:14.900 --> 03:15.570
going to win.

03:15.740 --> 03:22.720
And if the if the computer hasn't selected scissors let's say they've.

03:22.850 --> 03:28.880
We know that the player hasn't the computer hasn't selected rock either because we've done that condition

03:28.910 --> 03:29.870
over here.

03:29.870 --> 03:31.980
So there's only one other option.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.300
So if it's not scissors then it's paper and if it's paper then the computer wins.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.210
But we've already set this to false.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.290
So we don't have to worry about that one.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.050
So let's do our condition.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.350
We'll check to see if the player's selection is rock.

03:50.570 --> 03:58.130
And we're also going to have a condition here to check to see if the computer selection is equal to

03:59.800 --> 04:06.670
scissors and we know that if this is true then the player wins.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.740
So we just need to set that to true.

04:08.740 --> 04:14.910
We know that if the player selects rock and a computer select scissors then the player wins.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.560
So let's add in some additional conditions here.

04:19.690 --> 04:27.090
So we're going to check next going through some of the other possible options and we're going to see

04:27.090 --> 04:31.800
if the player's selection and the order of views actually doesn't matter.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.050
So player selection is paper.

04:34.050 --> 04:36.720
We could just as easily chose scissors.

04:37.140 --> 04:44.400
So what I want to do now is pause the video and update the rest of these conditions so I know that paper

04:44.640 --> 04:53.510
and if the computer has selected rock that means that we won.

04:53.770 --> 04:56.370
And so we can do the same type of statement there.

04:56.470 --> 05:01.450
And then last but not least we know that there's only one other option and that's the player selected

05:01.450 --> 05:02.390
scissors.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.400
And then we can do those conditions as well.

05:05.410 --> 05:09.620
So take a minute try it out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

05:09.700 --> 05:18.010
So if you had an opportunity to try that out so we know that if the player selects paper and the computer

05:18.220 --> 05:19.180
selects

05:22.710 --> 05:26.080
rawk that means that the player won.

05:26.100 --> 05:28.610
So that's one we can include there.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.030
And one more.

05:30.060 --> 05:35.110
So there's one more possibility and this one is just going to be the last default.

05:35.190 --> 05:37.430
We know that the players selected scissors.

05:37.530 --> 05:40.920
So we don't have to do any other condition there for the player.

05:41.070 --> 05:46.090
And here we just need to check to see what the computer has selected.

05:46.110 --> 05:54.650
So if the player selected scissors and the computer's selected paper and we know that scissors cut paper.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.880
So that turns out to be true as well.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.000
So now we've got all of our conditions.

05:59.010 --> 06:02.070
We know that if the win is true or false.

06:02.230 --> 06:08.540
So we need to do in one last condition check here and that's to see what the value of win is.

06:08.730 --> 06:11.540
And if win is true.

06:11.640 --> 06:18.090
So if any one of these conditions were met it's going to set wind to true and basically meaning that

06:18.090 --> 06:19.980
player wins.

06:20.490 --> 06:28.740
And we also know that if the player didn't win else we know that the HD amount is that the computer

06:28.740 --> 06:29.340
wins.

06:29.370 --> 06:35.370
So if the player doesn't win then and if it's not a tight game then basically that means that the computer

06:35.430 --> 06:36.310
wins.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.540
So I think we're ready to try the suit.

06:38.550 --> 06:43.210
So let's refresh make our selections let's do rock.

06:43.330 --> 06:43.960
OK.

06:44.070 --> 06:50.280
So we've got player versus computer rock versus scissor result player wins because we know that the

06:50.280 --> 06:52.090
rock crushes the scissors.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.750
Let's try that one more time.

06:53.760 --> 06:59.470
So let's do a paper and we've got paper versus paper so the result.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.680
It's a tie.

07:00.690 --> 07:09.480
So one last thing that I did want to add in and that means that if for instance we do s we do s versus

07:09.480 --> 07:10.080
rock.

07:10.140 --> 07:15.420
So we know that the computations are still going to work out that this is scissors versus raw and we

07:15.420 --> 07:20.190
know that the computer the rock crushes the scissors but we're not actually putting scissors we're just

07:20.200 --> 07:21.550
outputting ass.

07:21.630 --> 07:28.150
So let's update that within the conditional statements so that we can actually have those full values.

07:28.260 --> 07:32.540
So I need to do now again pause the video and add that part in.

07:32.580 --> 07:39.570
So make sure that even if the user of the player selects only the first character that we're still good

07:39.630 --> 07:42.970
in that we can still write out either a rock paper scissors.

07:43.090 --> 07:46.250
So I did try that out and I showed the solution.

07:46.410 --> 07:51.220
So the solution for that is that we can overwrite the value of player.

07:51.330 --> 07:56.760
So we know that if we've done our condition check here we've checked to see if the player's selection

07:56.850 --> 07:57.910
is rock.

07:58.080 --> 08:04.710
So we know that even if the player had typed in rock or if they typed in are then the player should

08:04.740 --> 08:06.310
always equal rock.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.590
Because that's the actual selection that was made.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.790
Next we can do the same thing for here.

08:12.810 --> 08:15.550
So the player can equal two paper.

08:15.810 --> 08:20.920
And then last but not least the player can equal two scissors.

08:20.970 --> 08:27.000
Just clean that up a little bit there and let's write the scissors and then we should be ready to try

08:27.000 --> 08:27.760
this out.

08:28.650 --> 08:34.140
So now let's refresh instead of scissors and it's going to put s ands

08:37.060 --> 08:38.260
I think I got to save that.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.400
So I think I didn't say that properly.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.850
So let's try that out again.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.340
So now we've got scissors versus paper.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.840
Result player wins.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.580
So now we're all ready to go with just the first character.

08:52.680 --> 08:57.280
So we don't always have to have the user type in the full rock paper scissors.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.760
They can just pick the first character.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.100
So now it's up to you to take the code.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.560
Try it for yourself make some updates to it.

09:05.760 --> 09:11.780
You can make it look a whole lot better by adding in some styling and as well in the upcoming lessons

09:11.780 --> 09:17.420
when we're going to look at functions and we're going to look more at what we can do with the dorm.

09:17.730 --> 09:22.590
That's going to open up the door to a whole lot more possibilities with the source code.

09:22.590 --> 09:29.730
And as within the other exercises as you learn more Javascript You can always come back make some updates

09:29.730 --> 09:33.530
to the code and really customize it and really build it out.

09:38.040 --> 09:43.080
So go ahead and try this out for yourself within your own editor and see if you can make happen with

09:43.080 --> 09:44.790
rock paper scissors the game.
