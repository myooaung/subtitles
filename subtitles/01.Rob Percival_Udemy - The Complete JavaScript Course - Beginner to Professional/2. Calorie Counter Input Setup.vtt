00:00.860 --> 00:04.460
The next few lessons we're going to be building out a calorie counter.

00:04.470 --> 00:08.180
So basically it's going to ask the user for a bunch of inputs.

00:08.280 --> 00:13.510
It's going to make a calculation of how many calories they use or should be taking per day.

00:15.670 --> 00:20.030
So to start this type of project off we actually need a formula first.

00:20.050 --> 00:25.960
So I'm going to go over to Wikipedia and they have a really good formula here for the Basel metabolic

00:26.110 --> 00:26.760
rate.

00:26.800 --> 00:33.110
So basically it will calculate what your calorie intake should be per day.

00:33.190 --> 00:38.890
And it's got a bunch of formulas down here so we're going to take one of these formulas down here and

00:38.950 --> 00:41.500
we're going to apply it within our application.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.810
So we've got an imperial calculation and the metric calculation.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.060
So let's go ahead and copy these out.

00:49.210 --> 00:55.150
Open up into our editor and I get to just place it within the script area so that we can reference them

00:55.240 --> 00:55.840
later.

00:55.990 --> 01:01.720
And there's also the metric calculation there so if you're building out a metric calculator you could

01:01.720 --> 01:03.810
use the metric formula.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.010
Now it is important to be able to

01:08.750 --> 01:13.720
gather all of the correct information within the same format as the formula.

01:13.730 --> 01:16.950
So now we're ready to go ahead and set up our form.

01:17.060 --> 01:20.930
So this is going to be street h t M-L where we set up our form.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.460
Let's give it an ID so that we can reference that.

01:23.480 --> 01:31.000
So just call it my form and then within here we're going to add all of our inputs.

01:31.040 --> 01:36.630
So looking at the formula we need to determine whether it's a male or a female.

01:36.710 --> 01:39.280
So for that we could just use radio buttons.

01:39.320 --> 01:48.850
So we'll give her an ID of f and give it a type of button is a radio button and give it a name.

01:48.860 --> 01:56.690
So this is for essentially for the gender and so if this one is checked off this is going to be for

01:56.700 --> 01:57.410
female.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.940
And then the other one is going to be for male.

01:59.940 --> 02:07.130
So it's two female that's going to wrap it in a div here.

02:07.350 --> 02:09.630
So both of these I want on that same line.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.960
So it's just do it like this and leave a space.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.250
Copy that and I copy this one out.

02:16.260 --> 02:24.060
I'm going to change this into a male so next value that we need we need to get a weight.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.110
We see that the next item in the formula is weight.

02:27.110 --> 02:28.700
So that's in pounds.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.640
So let's go ahead and add that input.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.540
So this one is going to be weight

02:35.690 --> 02:37.850
and just an input.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.520
And we're going to do a new American put.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.790
So give us an idea of weight so that we can reference that later within our javascript.

02:45.890 --> 02:46.850
Give it a type.

02:46.850 --> 02:49.190
So the type is going to be number.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.420
And let's set a default value.

02:51.530 --> 02:56.140
So usually I like tabs of these default values where we start out here.

02:56.180 --> 02:58.150
So the next one that we need is height.

02:58.190 --> 03:00.360
So I going to remove some of the whitespace here.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.470
Copy this one.

03:01.490 --> 03:04.090
So we've got wait and let's do height now.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.490
So height is going to be imperial.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.160
So we're doing feet and inches.

03:09.230 --> 03:13.150
So let's first do height in.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.950
So the first one is going to be height in feet.

03:16.950 --> 03:18.260
So this is going to be a number.

03:18.270 --> 03:21.150
We'll give it a default value of 5.

03:21.270 --> 03:24.050
And the next one is going to be inches.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.640
So I have another input field right next to it.

03:26.730 --> 03:33.940
And this one is going to be the height in inches so it's not one in inches and we'll give it all so

03:33.960 --> 03:39.860
we can leave the default value or maybe will do default value of 6.

03:39.950 --> 03:46.190
And also I'm going to set a max value here so the max value that I want the user to be able to input

03:46.280 --> 03:47.540
is 11.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.290
And let's set a minimum value.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.430
So let's set the minimum value of 0.

03:51.530 --> 03:54.780
So this is all going to be him L5 that's going to control this.

03:54.870 --> 04:09.450
And after this input so do feats and this one was going to do this and wait so do pounds for weight.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.650
And now let's do another one.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.040
So we need to get age.

04:13.060 --> 04:19.680
So the next one that we need to do is age and we'll do an input for age.

04:19.710 --> 04:25.500
So just use the ideal age and we'll give it a value of 30.

04:25.510 --> 04:28.700
So this is a number of years.

04:28.920 --> 04:36.150
And we also have one more value down here so this is recommended intake depending on how active the

04:36.150 --> 04:37.550
individual is.

04:37.590 --> 04:44.970
So we can set a number from what from 1 to 5 and depending on what the number is we can add that into

04:45.000 --> 04:45.870
our formula.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.560
So let's do that in as well.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.090
So do one more value here and this is going to be just a numeric value.

04:54.090 --> 04:58.040
So this is going to be maybe something like lifestyle or something like that

05:03.080 --> 05:05.690
and we'll give it an idea of lifestyle as well.

05:08.010 --> 05:15.110
And so this is a number and this is going to be a number anywhere from 1 to 5.

05:15.300 --> 05:21.150
So do men value of one and max value of five.

05:21.270 --> 05:22.790
So there we can restrict it.

05:22.890 --> 05:23.980
And as

05:28.700 --> 05:32.800
well just do one equals low activity

05:37.030 --> 05:44.130
and 5 equals high high activity.

05:44.140 --> 05:44.650
So there we go.

05:44.650 --> 05:48.860
So let's save that let's clean it up a little bit with the beautify function.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.940
Go back out and refresh it.

05:50.950 --> 05:51.590
So there we go.

05:51.610 --> 05:57.240
So now we're we've got all of our inputs and maybe one of these we can set to the default.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.110
So next what we need to do is hook up the Javascript.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.460
So that's coming next in the next lesson.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.390
We've got all of our inputs here all ready to go.

06:06.490 --> 06:12.220
And the way that we're going to set up our javascript is that if any of these values change that we're

06:12.220 --> 06:16.240
going to fire off a javascript function.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.370
So we're looking at the On Change event listener.

06:19.380 --> 06:26.220
So what I want you to do now is to try to go ahead and set up the javascript function that's going to

06:26.220 --> 06:29.360
listen for any changes within these inputs.

06:29.460 --> 06:36.210
And I'm going to show you the solution coming up in the next lesson and I'll give you a hint for the

06:36.210 --> 06:41.280
solution that we're going to be looking at a change within the entire form.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.080
So I'm not going to be looking at changes individually into the inputs because there's quite a few of

06:46.080 --> 06:46.650
those.

06:46.680 --> 06:51.510
So I want to try to save myself some time and only look for changes within the form.

06:51.510 --> 06:53.110
So go in and set that up.

06:53.130 --> 06:59.700
Open up your editor and build out an event listener that listens for changes within any one of these

06:59.700 --> 07:02.770
inputs within the form and then fires off a function.

07:02.850 --> 07:05.250
And also the solution coming up in the next lesson.
