This lesson I want to do a quick update on the YouTube API and how to enable them how to remove them

00:07.710 --> 00:09.190
how to disable them.

00:09.190 --> 00:14.730
I don't always get your key whenever you log back in and you do need to have a Google account in order

00:14.730 --> 00:19.120
to get your youtube API and also access all the different API.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.380
So you do have some information here right.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.840
When you go into the dashboard you're going to see what eyes are available.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.820
You're going to see the requests that you've made you're going to see errors.

00:27.870 --> 00:35.310
You can disable at it at any time and it also keeps track of Stott's of your API being used.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.680
If you go into credentials you can see that API key.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.920
So if you ever want to remove it you could simply you could edit the API key or you could just delete

00:43.920 --> 00:44.360
it.

00:44.370 --> 00:50.340
So I'm going to go out and delete the one that I used in the previous lesson so whenever you create

00:50.340 --> 00:52.170
it you can always delete it.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.960
And basically now if we try to go to that you are still going to be sitting there but if I try to go

00:57.960 --> 01:02.180
to it it's going to say that this is not available anymore.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.390
So basically that should be gone.

01:04.410 --> 01:05.670
I refreshed the dashboard.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.930
It should be gone out on my dashboard as well.

01:08.010 --> 01:13.140
And if you ever do need another API you can always go to enable.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.390
And this one is YouTube data API and you can see there's a lot of other API as well.

01:18.390 --> 01:23.320
So go out and you click it and you can create credentials for it at any time.

01:23.370 --> 01:27.390
And this one is just the defaults that are used.

01:27.430 --> 01:31.950
We can just do the API key and you can also add credentials for it.

01:31.950 --> 01:35.210
So you can choose where it's calling from.

01:35.280 --> 01:41.640
You can see the data will be accessing public data user data and getting the credentials.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.340
So there's a lot of options as well.

01:44.340 --> 01:48.600
You also have key restrictions so you can restrict IP addresses.

01:48.600 --> 01:54.790
You can restrict the HGT you refer Web sites so you could only allow certain Web sites.

01:54.840 --> 02:03.090
And if you do none then this is what I was using as well where I had no restrictions that the web application

02:03.090 --> 02:09.410
could simply search through as long as the key was there and search through that API.

02:09.780 --> 02:15.610
And it is there is quite a lot here and Google really does offer a lot of stuff.

02:15.630 --> 02:20.850
So this is one of the things that it does take some time to kind of flip through it and take a look

02:20.850 --> 02:22.330
through all of this.

02:22.650 --> 02:27.870
But it is worthwhile to get comfortable with it because getting familiar with API is the YouTube one

02:27.870 --> 02:31.050
is great to work with because it really does have a lot of data.

02:31.110 --> 02:38.010
So I do encourage you if you don't have a Google account to set one up and take advantage of the YouTube

02:38.010 --> 02:40.750
API as well as the moppy pieces that are available.
