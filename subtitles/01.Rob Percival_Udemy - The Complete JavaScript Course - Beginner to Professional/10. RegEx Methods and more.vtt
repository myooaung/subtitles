00:01.050 --> 00:06.580
In the last few lessons we've been looking at regular expressions and I know there's quite a bit to

00:06.580 --> 00:08.400
learn with regular expressions.

00:08.470 --> 00:15.040
So I want to do a quick run through in this lesson in order to go over a few other aspects that are

00:15.040 --> 00:17.290
available within regular expression.

00:17.350 --> 00:23.890
So the ones that I want to look Klak look at is I want to look at some regular expression methods so

00:23.890 --> 00:28.710
we know that with regular expression methods we need to establish a pattern.

00:28.810 --> 00:31.600
So let's go ahead and create that pattern.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.700
So first then we need to do establish our pattern.

00:34.720 --> 00:43.180
So this was we're going to use P And We need to create a brand new regular expression object.

00:43.180 --> 00:50.830
So let's go ahead and create one of those and now included within here so this is where our pattern

00:50.830 --> 00:51.580
goes.

00:51.580 --> 00:54.590
So for this case we're just looking at Java.

00:54.730 --> 01:02.920
So we're going to match the words Java that's included in this text area and we're going to show you

01:04.240 --> 01:08.340
couple different methods in order to output those patterns.

01:08.350 --> 01:14.050
So the first one that we're going to look at is test so variable result 1.

01:14.110 --> 01:17.760
And let's set this one up to do the test.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.830
So this is going to take the pattern which is p.

01:20.830 --> 01:25.180
So we're looking for the word Java within our string.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.490
And next the method.

01:27.490 --> 01:33.560
So the method is test and what test will do is this will return true or false.

01:33.760 --> 01:40.200
And lastly we need to get our string value in to the rounded brackets.

01:40.240 --> 01:47.920
And now what we can do is console log the soat into our log so we can actually see if this is true or

01:47.920 --> 01:48.720
false.

01:48.730 --> 01:54.820
So when I log out that result one goes into the browser refreshed and when we hit extract We see that

01:54.820 --> 01:55.700
it's true.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.690
If I get rid of Java and try to extract We see that it's false.

02:00.700 --> 02:06.530
So basically this gives you a really quick way to do a quick check of the contents there.

02:06.770 --> 02:13.000
And the other option that I want to show you the object method that I want to show you is execute so

02:13.000 --> 02:20.840
execute will actually return back even more so we're going to do that same pattern the same string value.

02:20.980 --> 02:23.620
And I going to put it within the console.

02:23.620 --> 02:31.070
So let's go back and refreshed the page and extract and this should actually be results too.

02:31.230 --> 02:34.850
So go back again refresh the page and hit extract.

02:34.990 --> 02:40.420
And this time we see that we're getting a whole bunch of information that's being returned here.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.820
So first of all we get the value.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.490
So we've got Java.

02:44.920 --> 02:49.660
And if I include at a number of other times and I extract it.

02:49.690 --> 02:53.210
We're going to still see that first occurrence of it.

02:53.320 --> 03:00.730
So we know that it occurs on index 9 and we get that whole input being returned as well.

03:00.730 --> 03:07.090
And we can make use of this information that's being returned in a number of different formats because

03:07.090 --> 03:12.370
this is just pulled into an object within javascript and then we can really easily call to the index

03:12.370 --> 03:15.790
the input and we can also get that returned value.

03:17.340 --> 03:23.940
So when it comes to regular expression try with the simple stuff first and then try to get even more

03:23.940 --> 03:25.320
complex queries.

03:25.380 --> 03:31.750
So Reg x our dot com has some really great examples and they're definitely worth checking out.

03:31.770 --> 03:37.270
So this one in particular pulls out all the four letter word so that's what I've got here on the page.

03:37.290 --> 03:44.810
So we see that it's highlighting all of the matching words and we can also ignore the case and multiline.

03:44.820 --> 03:48.940
So again we have those parameters there that we can add to the expression.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.430
We can also pull back different words.

03:51.510 --> 03:58.770
So we see that this one is pulling back a series of words we can pull out for numbers so I can bring

03:58.770 --> 04:04.680
this one in and we can see that it's automatically highlighting the phone numbers and also just pulling

04:04.680 --> 04:06.040
out certain words.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.900
So we've got test and it will pull back.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.990
E r i n g e d r s.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.040
So even if we have tests that will be pulled back test test staed gets pulled back.

04:20.060 --> 04:25.950
So there's a number of different options here that that are getting pulled back and that's all coming

04:25.950 --> 04:32.580
back from this regular expression which of course you can take and you can copy into your java script

04:32.790 --> 04:35.170
and make it work within your own code.

04:35.190 --> 04:40.380
So definitely try to check this as well as do some Google searches and there's a number of really great

04:40.380 --> 04:44.870
tools to find out more about regular expressions and to learn more about them.

04:44.940 --> 04:51.350
And I do advise to start out with the simple expressions and work your way up.

04:51.390 --> 04:58.920
So try something with you just typing in a simple word and then also try number combinations.

04:58.950 --> 05:06.120
So getting all the number values and then move along from there so up to all the letters capital letters

05:06.480 --> 05:13.350
including all of you can also flip it and do the non numbers server.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.620
And that's not a number.

05:14.740 --> 05:15.460
And so on.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.380
So this is similar to what we saw earlier

05:20.110 --> 05:24.150
and it does take some time to get really familiar with regular expressions.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.940
So do practice and try it for yourself.
