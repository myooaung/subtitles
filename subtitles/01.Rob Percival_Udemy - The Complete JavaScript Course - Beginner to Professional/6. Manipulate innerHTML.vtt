00:01.540 --> 00:05.750
Wellcome And this lesson I'm going to show you even more you can do with the dong.

00:05.890 --> 00:11.650
So we saw earlier how we can output content and this lesson I'm going to show you how you can get content

00:11.740 --> 00:16.680
that's input dynamically and then make use of it within your javascript.

00:16.690 --> 00:19.840
So for this we need an input field.

00:19.840 --> 00:24.570
So this is just a regular text input and we need to give it an ID.

00:24.700 --> 00:29.140
And this is going to be our way to identify this input area.

00:29.350 --> 00:38.650
And I going to give this one ID of VHDL so that we can use this as a value and get the user to actually

00:38.650 --> 00:41.830
add some information within this value.

00:42.160 --> 00:42.820
So that's it.

00:42.820 --> 00:50.320
And now let's refresh the page and we can see that we've got this in Point area and we can type in content

00:50.350 --> 00:51.030
in here.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.900
So let's see how we can actually grab the contents of that input.

00:55.930 --> 01:04.370
So you set up a variable and I'm going to call it a and let's do the document document and get element

01:04.410 --> 01:08.620
by id and in this case we called it VHDL.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.640
So let's grab it within that type of format so we can do a.

01:12.740 --> 01:18.620
And we can see that this input has a value associated with it because we've typed something in there

01:18.830 --> 01:21.970
and it's not showing up with in the input.

01:21.980 --> 01:26.490
Looks like a log in the directory of a.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.170
So we can take a closer look at what's actually contained within this object.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.810
So we see that we've got

01:35.530 --> 01:42.790
we've got inner text and inner H-2 now but it's still it's still there's no values in there because

01:42.790 --> 01:48.130
we don't actually have any in our tax turn each to Mel for this particular type of element.

01:48.170 --> 01:53.110
We can see that the node is an input so we can utilize that as well.

01:53.140 --> 02:06.100
So if we want to find out if it's an input we can always type in a and we can see we can do node type

02:08.310 --> 02:14.950
that that returns one and the other one was no name.

02:14.980 --> 02:19.330
So let's take a look and we'll see what type of element that is.

02:19.330 --> 02:21.330
So this is an input element.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.180
So let's see what else is contained within here.

02:24.310 --> 02:29.500
And we see that there's quite a bit of information so we see that we've got a client with we've got

02:29.500 --> 02:35.500
our client height Let's scroll all the way down to the bottom and we see that this is the one that we

02:35.500 --> 02:43.490
actually want to take a look at because we've got a value here called Tass and we can also see that

02:43.510 --> 02:48.530
when we update it and we need to actually print that value again and again.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.560
So let's just clear.

02:50.680 --> 02:56.900
And let's do a value and we can see that now that value has updated.

02:57.130 --> 03:04.750
So if we update it again if I do a value we can see that we've got the new content that's already in

03:04.750 --> 03:05.130
there.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.460
So this is how we can utilize it and we can now do it again.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.460
We will see that we've got.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.750
Hello world.

03:12.760 --> 03:18.280
So just as we're selling the value we could also update the value as well.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.130
So it's too updated.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.900
You can see that using javascript.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.460
I can actually update the contents of that input field.

03:26.830 --> 03:32.750
So this is giving us a lot of power and a lot of things that we can do with our script.

03:32.800 --> 03:38.800
So the challenge for this lesson is open up your or create two elements.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.470
What should be a div and the other one input.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.340
And with that with time in some tasks.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.880
So just do hello world.

03:48.040 --> 03:55.930
And what I want you to do with it in your script is to grab the contents of the div with the ID of output

03:56.320 --> 04:00.550
and place the value into the input field.

04:00.550 --> 04:01.630
So go ahead.

04:01.630 --> 04:06.980
Pause the video and I'll show you the solution coming up anytime your editor for this one.

04:07.090 --> 04:07.560
So go ahead.

04:07.570 --> 04:11.940
Open up your editor and try it.

04:12.110 --> 04:15.310
I know you had the opportunity to give it a shot.

04:15.410 --> 04:17.540
So let me show you the solution for this.

04:17.660 --> 04:21.690
And just as previously there's a number of ways to do this.

04:21.740 --> 04:29.870
You can do this all with one statement but I know use some variables and I think Rob that elements separately

04:30.410 --> 04:35.570
using the variables and then I'm going to make the update from the content that's contained within the

04:35.570 --> 04:36.370
variables.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.240
So document that element by ID

04:44.530 --> 04:46.340
so you get element by ID.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.090
And now we need to specify our element so that one is output.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.190
So we're going to place the output.

04:52.450 --> 04:59.220
And now because we created one I can grab the other one and this one is going to be l.

04:59.280 --> 05:04.640
So we just create the owl and it's got an idea of the how.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.160
So now the next statement is the actual updating part of that.

05:10.180 --> 05:14.540
So we know we've got Al and this one is value.

05:14.540 --> 05:18.400
So we get equal to output and hinter.

05:19.150 --> 05:22.040
So we just use interface to UML.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.950
And now let's try this.

05:24.010 --> 05:30.460
Refresh the page and we see that hello world is written up there and we've grabbed that element interface

05:30.460 --> 05:34.060
to Mel and we've placed it within our four.

05:34.080 --> 05:39.990
So the next lesson I am sure even more that we can do with the dorm and we're going to create some more

05:39.990 --> 05:47.490
interaction using a user input the prompt and then putting that content that we're picking up and placing

05:47.490 --> 05:49.120
it within our HMO code.

05:49.230 --> 05:51.080
So that's coming up in the next lesson.
