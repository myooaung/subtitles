00:00.680 --> 00:08.450
Work come back and from previously we know that the document is the dorm the document object model and

00:08.510 --> 00:15.050
this is what the key is to manipulate h tim L. So we've been using get element by id where we've been

00:15.050 --> 00:22.580
grabbing an element from the document and using the ID and then pulling that back in and making use

00:22.580 --> 00:24.950
of it within our Javascript.

00:24.950 --> 00:30.740
So in this lesson I want to show you more about what's available within the document object how you

00:30.740 --> 00:36.910
can traverse through the document object get information about a button and a whole lot more.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.750
So taking a quick look at our script.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.650
So we've got an input button.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.290
It's got go.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.180
You r l.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.310
So it's got an On Click event within it.

00:46.430 --> 00:52.280
So let's open that up within our browser refresh that and we'll take a closer look at what's available

00:52.320 --> 00:53.690
with the dorm.

00:54.050 --> 00:57.290
So we look at all the different elements.

00:57.370 --> 01:05.710
Let's pop over to the console and word to console directory.

01:05.710 --> 01:14.560
So a list out document and this time we're actually going to grab the my form object so that we can

01:14.560 --> 01:18.690
take a closer look and see what's available within this object.

01:18.700 --> 01:26.230
So by using Konsole dry this gives us a directory listing of all the information contained within our

01:26.710 --> 01:28.340
element within our object.

01:28.390 --> 01:34.710
And then we can see more information about it so we can see that it's got enraged him.

01:34.740 --> 01:36.310
So it's got that input.

01:36.580 --> 01:43.120
And when we look when we scroll down we can see that we've got all of these on click events.

01:43.150 --> 01:46.390
So we've got a lot of those and we are going to be going through those.

01:46.390 --> 01:50.940
So these are really important as well when you're creating that interaction within the dorm.

01:50.950 --> 01:57.160
We've got our age to e-mail we've got scroll positions so we've got a lot of information in there that

01:57.160 --> 02:04.830
we have access to within our javascript so we can actually even see more.

02:04.830 --> 02:14.730
So if I go into here and if I do document and so document body so we know that the document object has

02:14.730 --> 02:19.240
body and then there's children within here.

02:19.260 --> 02:25.270
So we saw that earlier within the dorm and within the children so to see what children are available.

02:25.350 --> 02:30.990
So basically what we've gone in and we've gone through a few levels that are available within the dorms.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.950
We started out at the documents so this was the route where we started out.

02:35.040 --> 02:42.060
We went into body because we know within our script our next element is the body and then the body itself

02:42.120 --> 02:43.450
has children.

02:43.470 --> 02:45.810
So what are the children that are available within the body.

02:45.810 --> 02:49.260
So we know that we've got three different children here.

02:49.260 --> 02:54.940
We've got a div we've got a form and we've got a script and we also have this one up here in my form

02:55.020 --> 02:56.860
and we've got the wrapper.

02:57.300 --> 03:06.930
So the wrapper is as a div wrapper and the my form is a form and this is why we were able to previously

03:06.930 --> 03:12.750
where we could go document my form and then we could go within the form and we could see what children

03:12.750 --> 03:13.420
are there.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.010
And then we could go you are l and then we could see value.

03:17.070 --> 03:25.310
And this is where we are able to pull back the value that's contained within that URL so we can also

03:25.310 --> 03:30.950
go up one level so we know that there's multiple inputs here within the children.

03:35.610 --> 03:42.810
And if I go to input so we don't have an ID for this input because this is the one if we go down we

03:42.810 --> 03:44.700
see we've got our on click event.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.990
So that's this one over here.

03:47.070 --> 03:49.260
So we know that we're looking at.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.790
So we've got this input here.

03:50.790 --> 03:54.160
This one had an ID and this one actually didn't have an ID.

03:54.210 --> 03:58.920
So but we can still see it and we can still access it within our

04:01.590 --> 04:03.260
javascript via the door.

04:03.270 --> 04:06.630
So we know that children and it's got zero.

04:06.630 --> 04:11.340
And then child number one and then this is where we've got our information.

04:11.340 --> 04:18.480
So let's let's try something out and we're going to try to update the value of this button simply by

04:18.480 --> 04:29.660
accessing content within the dorm so we know that it's we can go document we can go my form and then

04:29.720 --> 04:31.480
we can go within the form.

04:31.520 --> 04:42.440
So we know that there was children within the form and we know with them those children.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.710
So we go back out here.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.650
So there's there's the input that we're after.

04:47.890 --> 04:56.800
And let's let's do children again so pull that one back up and we'll do children one.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.130
So this is where we can get access to that particular element.

05:00.190 --> 05:04.750
And the good thing about Crome is whenever I hover over it you can see that it also hovers over here

05:04.810 --> 05:08.380
as well and it gives us more information about that.

05:08.380 --> 05:15.640
So if I pull this back and if I do value and let's say let's do hello world.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.500
So what do you think is going to happen here.

05:17.740 --> 05:23.770
So if you said this value is actually going to update and change the hello world you're correct because

05:23.770 --> 05:30.700
we actually can't access any one of the elements within the document within this type of format.

05:30.700 --> 05:36.610
Because remember again that this is an object and just as we saw earlier with objects we can go through

05:36.640 --> 05:43.000
all the different objects that are inside of other objects and going down from the parent into the children

05:43.000 --> 05:45.830
into the children and then we have access to them.

05:45.910 --> 05:52.790
And there's a number of built in methods as well that are available to us and we also know what we can

05:52.790 --> 05:56.090
do within the console we can do it within Javascript.

05:56.090 --> 06:05.570
So if I was to grab this and if I was to open up my editor and with him here I pasted in I save it I

06:05.650 --> 06:11.420
go back out and if I refresh my page that we know that we can do the same thing where we can update

06:11.420 --> 06:12.470
that button.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.920
So what I want you to do now is try it for yourself.

06:16.070 --> 06:24.040
So if you already have a simple web page open go ahead and open that up and try it out.

06:24.110 --> 06:30.830
Traverse to the various elements and try updating some of the values within it directly within the console

06:31.070 --> 06:36.630
to get really familiar with how you can traverse down through the different elements and you can try

06:36.660 --> 06:40.130
it for yourself as well you can go to your favorite web page.

06:40.510 --> 06:46.730
So open up your favorite web page any web page and try this for yourself so you can go down and you

06:46.730 --> 06:52.820
can do document and we know that everything is within body and then within the body so the body has

06:52.820 --> 06:59.450
some children so we can see that this particular one has body children and there's a number of elements

06:59.450 --> 06:59.950
in there.

07:00.110 --> 07:02.370
So we've got the third child in there.

07:02.460 --> 07:09.470
And so maybe Let's just grab the third one and we'll update the inner h Tamal with it.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.970
And also you can have some fun with this as well.

07:12.140 --> 07:18.510
So we know that children and if we grab the third one and we've got an option that we can do in our

07:18.530 --> 07:21.310
age to Mel and update it.

07:21.350 --> 07:23.580
So this one is Google's Web site.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.000
So let's update it.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.340
So watch when I press Enter what happens to that element.

07:28.820 --> 07:35.930
And we see that now we've updated it to say Google and we've gotten rid of that whole Google logo and

07:35.970 --> 07:37.410
now it just says Google.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.980
So this is what we can do.

07:38.990 --> 07:43.880
And this really shows the power of the Dohrmann remember again that this is just for that instance of

07:43.880 --> 07:49.150
the Web site that's being loaded that we didn't actually change any of Google's source code.

07:49.150 --> 07:54.950
It's just the instance of the Web site that's been loaded in the dorm that we have access to and that

07:54.950 --> 07:58.130
we can change and manipulate really easily.

07:58.140 --> 08:06.230
We can also go down several other layers if we want so we can maybe erase this one as well.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.580
And let's try to get to that import form

08:13.790 --> 08:25.190
so that one is the form itself and then the form itself is going to have to children in their so it

08:25.190 --> 08:27.300
can be kind of challenging.

08:27.920 --> 08:34.320
But you can get the idea that you can actually go down and you can update quite a bit of what you're

08:34.340 --> 08:41.890
doing within the dorm and you can see that the children also have children and you can go all the way

08:41.890 --> 08:45.070
down and he could also pull back things like the ID.

08:45.190 --> 08:50.650
So we see that this children there's an ID there so we can pull back the ID of the element and so on.

08:50.710 --> 08:55.470
So we can pull back a whole bunch of information we can also get the name if we want.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.910
So do try it out for yourself and see what you can do.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.350
We can also get the type.

09:03.460 --> 09:09.940
So any one of these attributes we can pull back and basically this means that we can make use of it

09:09.940 --> 09:11.580
within our Javascript.

09:11.620 --> 09:18.310
So go ahead try it for yourself and get used to traversing through the dorm and being able to select

09:18.400 --> 09:22.840
various elements using the document body method.
