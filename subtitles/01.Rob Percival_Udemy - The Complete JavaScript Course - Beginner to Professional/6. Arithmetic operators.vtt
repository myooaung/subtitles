00:01.100 --> 00:06.860
Welcome back and in this lesson we're going to look at arithmetic operators so basically they're going

00:06.860 --> 00:10.990
to give us the ability to polarize some arithmetic on numbers.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.330
So this is only working with numbers in the previous lesson.

00:14.330 --> 00:21.020
We saw that if we had a number of strings that we could actually combine them together so we could set

00:21.020 --> 00:28.030
up a variable to call it my string and we're going to equal that to a.

00:28.130 --> 00:32.970
And then we're going to equal space.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.870
So Plus that one so there's another string.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.750
And then lastly let's DO B.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.870
So we know that the value of my strings when I go back and if I refresh it and if I want to get the

00:44.870 --> 00:53.920
value of my stream it's going to be a concatenated with space concatenated with B.

00:53.960 --> 01:03.650
So this is how we can add strings together but we can also use operators such as the plus sign to add

01:03.740 --> 01:04.630
numbers together.

01:04.630 --> 01:17.650
So if we do something like this so I call it my total and I'm going to equal this to five plus five.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.650
So now that we've got a couple of numbers there and when I refreshed this and if I want the value for

01:24.650 --> 01:27.300
my total I can see that it's 10.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.590
So this is the same thing that if we go out into the con. We do six plus six.

01:32.750 --> 01:40.310
We can do four plus six and we see that it does the computation we can even string a number of views

01:40.310 --> 01:44.700
together and we can even have some larger numbers.

01:44.870 --> 01:53.310
We can have some decimal places and so on we can even have a really long numbers.

01:53.570 --> 02:01.420
So basically it's going to return back whatever that computed result is from all of these together.

02:01.430 --> 02:05.870
Now it does work as well within the order of operations.

02:05.870 --> 02:08.090
So basically if I had

02:10.790 --> 02:15.360
five plus five and then I multiply with five.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.650
So let me show you how that works.

02:17.660 --> 02:25.440
So you get so we get my total and we see that five plus five.

02:25.440 --> 02:31.010
So let's take in the order where we're doing multiplication division first and then we're doing addition

02:31.010 --> 02:32.270
and subtraction.

02:32.270 --> 02:35.710
So what's happening here is we're doing five times five.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.920
So we're getting 25.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.810
And then we're adding 5 to it.

02:39.950 --> 02:46.540
And if for instance we want to do five plus five first then we can add in the brackets.

02:46.540 --> 02:49.340
I could do five plus five.

02:50.990 --> 02:54.560
And then here is where I'm going to multiply it by five.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.630
So what do you think the total here is going to be.

02:56.780 --> 03:03.260
And if you said 50 you are correct because we're taking whatever is within the brackets first and then

03:03.350 --> 03:05.230
we're doing the multiplication.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.130
We're doing the stuff outside of the brackets afterwards.

03:08.150 --> 03:10.780
That's where the multiplication is actually done.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.520
After the addition or subtraction.

03:13.520 --> 03:21.610
So just as we were doing five plus five we could do nine minus five and so on and so on.

03:21.770 --> 03:27.270
So think you got the point here that we can do any number of arithmetic we can do multiplication.

03:27.290 --> 03:34.640
We can also do divisions of want to do nine divided by three so we used that forward slash and not to

03:34.640 --> 03:38.000
be confused with the backward slash we use forward slash.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.640
And this is where we can get the total.

03:39.710 --> 03:47.120
So we can work out any type of value here and we can construct total and get that response turned back

03:47.120 --> 03:51.860
in here and we could just as easily set up these as variables.

03:51.860 --> 03:59.610
So if we had a he calls 5 we have variable b equals 10.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.270
If we do a plus b

04:05.000 --> 04:11.750
A plus B then my total is going to be and we're going to actually put this within the console's going

04:11.750 --> 04:16.060
into the con. line so that it will have to always type it out there.

04:16.070 --> 04:21.440
We're going to console log whatever the value of the total is when we go back to refresh the page and

04:21.440 --> 04:24.210
we see we've got 15 coming in there.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.330
So there are some other ones that you might not be as familiar with.

04:28.340 --> 04:34.280
And another one that's commonly used within javascript is called modulus.

04:34.430 --> 04:41.360
So that's m u m o d u l u s and this is the percentage line.

04:41.990 --> 04:46.370
And basically what this does is this returns the remainder.

04:46.370 --> 04:51.490
So we try to put a into B as many times as we can.

04:51.620 --> 04:55.790
And then whatever the remainder is then that's what's going to get output there.

04:55.790 --> 04:59.570
So let's try this out and we'll refresh the page.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.700
So we get a total of five

05:04.740 --> 05:10.920
because we're trying to put that smaller number into the bigger number so it's going to go out one time.

05:10.920 --> 05:16.680
So typically when we're doing this we do something like this where we're going to reverse it and we're

05:16.680 --> 05:21.480
going to have the bigger number with the smaller number going in there and we see that the total is

05:21.480 --> 05:21.940
1.

05:22.050 --> 05:28.850
So basically we're trying to fit a B as many times as possible and then whatever rubbings.

05:28.860 --> 05:34.440
So if I change this to three what do you think the output now is going to be for my total.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.490
And if you said 3 you're correct because we can fit 5 in there twice to be twice.

05:40.620 --> 05:44.490
And then we get a remainder of three.

05:44.490 --> 05:51.670
So five minus 13 is eight eight minus five is three.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.840
And that's where get in that total of what's left over.

05:55.140 --> 06:03.870
We can also increment numbers so we could do another one here where we can increment B and I can also

06:05.160 --> 06:06.890
decrement a.

06:07.050 --> 06:14.040
So we're subtracting one off of that and I'm going to put all those values out so we can see what the

06:14.040 --> 06:17.850
values are of B at this point.

06:17.850 --> 06:24.000
And this is a good use for a console log whenever we've got any values of variables that are changing

06:24.440 --> 06:29.520
that we want to see what it is before the change and then we want to see what the value is after the

06:29.520 --> 06:30.040
change.

06:30.150 --> 06:32.130
Let's go out and refresh it.

06:32.130 --> 06:38.880
So we see that be coming into this line of code line 13 gets a result of 13 because that's what the

06:38.880 --> 06:45.990
variable is initially set to be incremented increment is just by 1 by increment of 1.

06:45.990 --> 06:50.850
So next we print out B again and we see that it's 14 now.

06:50.850 --> 07:01.980
So now we're looking at the value of B which is 14 and we've got a value of a which is no longer 5 because

07:01.980 --> 07:03.900
we're subtracting off of it.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.270
So the value of a now is four.

07:06.390 --> 07:11.020
So we're doing 14 modulus 4.

07:11.040 --> 07:18.990
So 4 goes in to 14 three full times and leaving two left over.

07:19.230 --> 07:28.550
And this is also very useful if we're detecting if a value is odd or even.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.800
So we can do something like this.

07:30.910 --> 07:35.010
And if we have a value of zero.

07:35.050 --> 07:42.970
We know that the number is even if we have a value of them is going to change that to 12 so that we

07:42.970 --> 07:51.460
get a value of 13 and if we get our direct return of one on the modulus we know that the number is odd.

07:51.850 --> 07:59.800
So this is one of the uses that is commonly done for modulus and this is how we change determining if

07:59.860 --> 08:03.190
our role for instance that we're outputting is odd or even.

08:03.340 --> 08:06.090
And there's a number of other uses for this as well.

08:07.550 --> 08:15.380
So what I want you to do now is open up your editor and start adding in some numbers there.

08:15.410 --> 08:19.740
So create a number of variables that have number of values there.

08:19.900 --> 08:27.730
And set those up and create an addition of those.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.160
Also a subtraction and so on.

08:30.400 --> 08:39.400
And lastly let's take what we learned in the previous lesson with prompt and let's ask for a first value

08:39.610 --> 08:45.450
and then we're going to add that to a second value which we're going to ask for as well.

08:45.490 --> 08:50.990
And then lastly let's output that total into the alert.

08:51.160 --> 08:56.170
So tripods in the video now and I can assure you the solution to do that.

08:56.500 --> 09:02.350
Taking in what we've learned within this lesson the previous lesson and also the solution coming up.

09:02.350 --> 09:03.490
So Pozza video.

09:03.580 --> 09:04.910
Try it out for yourself.

09:05.050 --> 09:07.950
And I'm going to give you the solution in just a minute.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.240
So we had the opportunity to try this out for yourself.

09:13.360 --> 09:18.520
And let's take what we learned in the previous lesson and I'm going to overwrite some of the content

09:18.520 --> 09:19.680
that I have here.

09:19.720 --> 09:29.800
I'm going to just use the prompt and I and I just to first number that the user wants to use and next

09:29.860 --> 09:31.980
will do prompt again for B.

09:32.110 --> 09:35.350
And then this will be second number.

09:35.530 --> 09:38.390
And I can get rid of some of the stuff here.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.410
So the total is going to be a plus b

09:45.620 --> 09:48.780
to a plus b as a console log.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.210
Let's just alert this information.

09:51.470 --> 09:53.350
So Alerta total.

09:53.420 --> 09:59.460
So let's let's try the soda and I don't need the string part up here so I can get rid of that.

10:00.110 --> 10:04.430
And let's open up her browser refresh the page and we'll try that.

10:04.430 --> 10:11.440
So the first lady asked us for our first number let's pick a number do for second number six.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.800
And then we see that the total is 46.

10:15.080 --> 10:23.330
And this was a trick question because we know that we're taking in prompts or treating in strange values

10:23.870 --> 10:26.590
so we're not actually taking in numeric values.

10:26.750 --> 10:35.990
And basically what that means is that we do need to change that type because if we do type of and if

10:35.990 --> 10:45.590
we do a we know that OK there if we do take type of a we see that it's a string and we actually have

10:45.590 --> 10:48.120
to convert string to a number.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.190
And there's a number of ways to do that.

10:50.190 --> 10:55.050
And the easiest one is just to specify that a is a number.

10:55.250 --> 11:05.990
And now if we do type of a and actually I have to set a two equal number.

11:06.530 --> 11:07.240
A.

11:07.530 --> 11:09.730
And now let's try this type of.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.800
And we see that we're getting back a number.

11:11.880 --> 11:16.190
So now I'm able to add so I have to convert do the same thing for B.

11:16.350 --> 11:24.300
So I would have to do B equals number and we need to convert B into a number.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.810
And let me add that equal sign in there.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.330
So B.

11:30.480 --> 11:36.310
And now I can do a plus b and we see that we get the result that we're looking for.

11:36.480 --> 11:42.810
So there's a number of ways to apply this and I just going to apply it here when we're creating our

11:42.810 --> 11:43.870
total here.

11:43.950 --> 11:48.430
So we're going to do a number a number B

11:51.320 --> 11:53.460
and save those numbers.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.160
Let's try that and refresh.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.390
So first number is 3.

11:57.410 --> 12:02.170
Second number is 7 and we see that we get a total of 10.

12:02.270 --> 12:06.460
And let's also add in total of

12:10.280 --> 12:11.780
total of 10.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.080
So do try that for yourself.

12:14.090 --> 12:19.330
And remember if you are working with numbers you do need to make sure that that type is a number.

12:19.430 --> 12:25.460
So taking in what we learned earlier that all the prompts are returning it back as strings.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.090
So we need to convert it to a number.

12:27.170 --> 12:35.940
So use this type of method built in again within javascript to convert a number string into a number

12:35.960 --> 12:36.720
format.

12:38.330 --> 12:42.940
So coming up we're going to look at assignment operators That's coming up in the next lesson.
