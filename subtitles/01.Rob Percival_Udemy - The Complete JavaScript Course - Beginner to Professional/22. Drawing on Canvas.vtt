00:00.730 --> 00:04.210
This lesson we're going to be looking at the canvas tag.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.890
So this is new.

00:05.930 --> 00:11.140
H tim L5 and all you need to do is set up canvas tags.

00:11.250 --> 00:18.900
We need to give it an idea and I've already set up for this idea of canvas one I've already set up some

00:18.900 --> 00:21.140
styling so that we can actually see it.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.430
And then just close that off so you don't actually have to put in the contents and here you can put

00:26.430 --> 00:27.460
something in there.

00:27.570 --> 00:33.480
And if your browser doesn't actually support canvas then whatever message is in there is actually going

00:33.480 --> 00:34.450
to get output.

00:34.710 --> 00:41.280
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to access that canvas element and we do this the same

00:41.280 --> 00:49.720
way that we've done this before where we set up a variable and then we do document get element by ID.

00:49.830 --> 00:58.980
And this is accessing our element using the dorms or grabbing canvas one and we're going to put that

00:59.040 --> 01:01.760
into the object canvas.

01:01.830 --> 01:08.580
So the next to that we need to do with canvas is we need to create a drawing object so set up another

01:08.580 --> 01:12.910
variable and this one can be whatever you want to call it.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.330
Lot of times that's it's getting the drawing ability so getting the context.

01:18.360 --> 01:28.330
So I'm going to just call it CTX and this is where we access canvas and we do get context.

01:28.350 --> 01:37.650
So this is actually going to give us the ability to interact with our canvas element within our aged

01:37.650 --> 01:38.030
himself.

01:38.040 --> 01:45.180
So this is get context and the context and the drawing is going to be done within 2d.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.910
So that's all we need in order to hook up our canvas.

01:48.930 --> 01:54.510
So the next thing that we can do is we can actually start drawing into the canvas.

01:54.740 --> 02:01.140
And if I go out here and if I refreshed the page we've got a default size for canvas.

02:01.250 --> 02:05.400
So this is what we've got showing up here and now we're all ready to drawn here.

02:05.420 --> 02:13.760
We can also adjust the size of it so that we with canvas we do have height and width for canvas so we

02:13.760 --> 02:20.380
can set those and this is actually different than the canvas style height and width.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.100
So this is the amount of pixel space that we have to draw with.

02:24.350 --> 02:31.880
So I'm just going to set one thousand by six hundred and we'll go back and we'll refresh it.

02:32.010 --> 02:34.930
So that essentially gives us a bigger drawing space.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.130
I actually didn't want to make it that wide.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.620
So let me make it less wide.

02:39.630 --> 02:43.040
So 400 by 600 because I'm on the split screen here.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.950
So there is a default size and we saw the default size there.

02:47.070 --> 02:50.240
And now we're setting up a size for it.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.300
So 400 by 600.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.750
And again this is different than the style.

02:55.920 --> 03:01.630
The style is well you could set and that would change the dimensions of the canvas.

03:01.650 --> 03:07.860
So this is the canvas width and height so not to be mistaken with the style width and height.

03:07.920 --> 03:13.220
So now the next thing that we can do is we can draw within our canvas.

03:13.950 --> 03:19.210
So we've got the dimensions of our canvas area.

03:19.320 --> 03:27.420
And what I'm going to do now is to in canvas has its own specific methods just like a lot of what we

03:27.420 --> 03:29.940
saw earlier with in the dorm.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.280
We can also be really specific.

03:32.310 --> 03:36.520
And these are specific methods that are related to the canvas object.

03:36.600 --> 03:42.210
And this is all done by javascript's so we can incorporate javascript within these methods.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.890
So there's one called Phil WREC.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.910
So we're just accessing the CTX objects.

03:47.910 --> 03:53.560
This is the draw object and this gives us access to all of these methods to draw.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.210
So we needed some parameters that we needed to pass in here.

03:57.270 --> 04:02.800
So we need a starting point where we're drawing we needed x and y coordinate.

04:02.820 --> 04:07.350
So this is related to the candidates with and the canvas height.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.890
The next thing that we need to set is we need to set

04:13.760 --> 04:14.990
a width and height.

04:14.990 --> 04:23.150
So if we want this one to be 100 picks and we want 100 picks high then this essentially build so our

04:23.210 --> 04:24.300
rectangle.

04:24.470 --> 04:29.900
And if we go out here and if we refresh it we see that we've got a blank a default.

04:29.900 --> 04:35.990
So the default color is black and we've got a rectangle staring at pixels.

04:35.990 --> 04:41.150
So going by the x axis so we're going to 10 and we're going 30 down.

04:41.150 --> 04:46.020
So that's our starting point and we're going 100 and 100 down.

04:46.040 --> 04:53.380
So we've got the width of 100 and the height of 100 and it's easy is that to draw something within Kandace.

04:53.390 --> 05:01.370
So what I want you to do now is pause the video go out into your browser and create a canvas element

05:01.970 --> 05:05.480
and then link to it using Document get element by ID.

05:05.480 --> 05:15.470
So grab that as an object and then add in the GET context to the giving that new object the ability

05:15.470 --> 05:25.220
to utilize the HMO five canvas methods and then go ahead and draw a rectangle somewhere within your

05:25.310 --> 05:26.870
canvas spacing.

05:26.870 --> 05:29.680
So go out and try that within your own editor.

05:29.780 --> 05:34.510
And I'm going to show even more that e can do with canvas.

05:34.680 --> 05:41.370
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and when it comes to drawing there is quite a lot we can

05:41.370 --> 05:41.840
do.

05:41.880 --> 05:50.300
We can also set colors so we can do CTX and we can set a specific color style to that.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.700
So this is Phil style

05:56.070 --> 06:05.870
so what Phil style will do is this will give me the ability to set a fill color into it and so fill

06:06.090 --> 06:14.910
style is just a color value so we can use hexadecimal we can use our G-B we can also use the named values.

06:14.950 --> 06:17.880
So just going to make it a red color.

06:17.980 --> 06:23.950
So now the way that the script is going to read is that we're going to grab that canvas object into

06:24.730 --> 06:32.450
the canvas variable then we're going to create a brand new variable CTX we're going to use canvas and

06:32.450 --> 06:36.190
we're going to attach get context which gives us the ability to draw.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.630
We're setting a canvas height and width.

06:38.630 --> 06:45.440
So this was optional but it's always a good idea to implement this so that you can set the height and

06:45.440 --> 06:50.210
width that you're going to be working with so that you know that what your parameters are and then next

06:50.270 --> 06:53.150
we're doing Phil style so we're setting a color.

06:53.270 --> 07:00.320
And then afterwards we're doing fill rectangle and we're basically drawing out our rectangle So let's

07:00.320 --> 07:06.110
go out and refresh and we see that refreshing it gives us a nice red square.

07:07.680 --> 07:14.170
So let's add one more thing in here because we do want to use some javascript and then have to add the

07:14.170 --> 07:16.000
ability to do a random color.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.640
So now every time we refresh and we're actually going to get a random color to the square and this is

07:21.640 --> 07:29.200
how we can start using javascript and implementing it within our HTML5 canvas element.

07:29.430 --> 07:35.650
And there's a lot of parameters that we can set when it comes to utilizing canvas.

07:35.650 --> 07:38.970
So we've got another one that we can set align with.

07:38.980 --> 07:45.280
And as you can see we've got line cap dash offset the join line to line with.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.160
So we've got a lot of options that are available to us.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.360
So this is the pixel width of the line.

07:51.610 --> 07:57.580
So if I go back here and if I refreshed we don't actually see anything because we're not using us any

07:57.580 --> 07:58.530
lines yet.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.880
All we've done is built a rectangle.

08:00.970 --> 08:02.740
So let's add in a line.

08:02.740 --> 08:08.200
So again calling that CTX object and this one is for stroke.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.600
So I've got a number of options for stroke.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.090
So it's two stroke style.

08:13.270 --> 08:16.790
And this is where again we have an option for a random color.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.070
Let's go out and do that.

08:18.220 --> 08:20.390
We'll do a nice random color there.

08:20.440 --> 08:26.480
So make it nice random colored and notice that we're still not actually outputting anything.

08:26.620 --> 08:33.340
And lastly in order to output some content we're going to do a stroke rectangle so this one was a fill

08:33.340 --> 08:36.110
rectangle so that automatically filled it.

08:36.250 --> 08:44.260
So next let's do a stroke rectangle and this is going to utilize the stroke attributes where we've got

08:44.320 --> 08:46.950
the same parameters that we have up here.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.590
But we can use stroke.

08:49.600 --> 08:58.060
So what I'm going to do is I'll just move this one down by let's move it down by 150 and we'll keep

08:58.060 --> 08:59.390
the parameters the same.

08:59.590 --> 09:03.190
So we see that now we've got a line with 10.

09:03.220 --> 09:09.610
We've got another rectangle that we've drawn here and this one has the same dimensions so it's 100 by

09:09.610 --> 09:14.390
100 but this one's starting at pixel spot 150.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.820
It's not what I want you to do.

09:15.850 --> 09:26.200
Pause the video and build its rectangle a rectangle and just use stroke for this rectangle so use the

09:26.260 --> 09:27.860
stroke rectangle.

09:27.880 --> 09:35.920
You can set a width so we see when we get rid of the stroke style that we do have a gray area around

09:35.920 --> 09:40.930
there so I can refresh it and we can see that this one the color is still changing because we've got

09:40.930 --> 09:46.710
that Phil style but we're not setting any with and we're not setting any style into it.

09:46.960 --> 09:51.900
So these are some of the options that you can do when you build your own rectangle.

09:51.940 --> 09:59.030
So in the next lesson we're going to look at even more that we can do with our canvas and I'm going

09:59.030 --> 10:02.000
to show you some more cool things that you can do of canvas.

10:02.120 --> 10:07.770
And then we're going to bring in some javascript in order to do even more with canvas.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.440
So all of that is coming up in the next set of lessons.
