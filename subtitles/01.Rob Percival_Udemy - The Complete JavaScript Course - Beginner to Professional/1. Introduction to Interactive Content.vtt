Welcome to our section on interactive content with javascript we're really going to be connecting our

00:07.340 --> 00:08.960
javascript to that dorm.

00:08.960 --> 00:14.150
So we saw earlier that there's so much information contained within the dorm and there's so many things

00:14.150 --> 00:18.970
that we can do when we pull back information that's contained already within the browser.

00:19.190 --> 00:25.610
So this is one of my favorite sections because I love and I enjoy using javascript to interact with

00:25.610 --> 00:28.350
web pages and just make things happen.

00:28.370 --> 00:33.170
There's really something truly amazing that you can do with javascript when you create those interactions

00:33.410 --> 00:39.110
and you can visually see things happening and creating interactions with Web users.

00:39.120 --> 00:45.410
And what's happening within their screens and in this section we're going to be basically making our

00:45.410 --> 00:47.450
web content come to life.

00:47.450 --> 00:53.000
So we're going to be looking at what's contained within the browser window and accessing that and making

00:53.000 --> 00:54.740
use of that within our code.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.230
We're also going to show you how you can open windows and access content that's contained within the

01:00.230 --> 01:00.800
window.

01:00.860 --> 01:06.980
So everything within the Windows object model so that's the one that the browser builds.

01:07.130 --> 01:13.910
And that's where we get also access to the history and we can interact with information that's contained

01:13.970 --> 01:16.160
within the browser window.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.600
And then of course the document object is actually sitting within the Windows object.

01:21.740 --> 01:27.370
So Windows object just sits outside and it gives us some really cool functionality as well.

01:27.470 --> 01:32.960
So we're able to go backwards and forwards in history we're able to see the user's history we're also

01:32.960 --> 01:39.230
able to set timeout methods within that window and we can even do things like getting the latitude and

01:39.230 --> 01:40.840
longitude of the user.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.030
And of course they do have to agree to that.

01:43.100 --> 01:48.080
But you can pull that back into your code and you can do some pretty cool things with that latitude

01:48.080 --> 01:53.480
and longitude such as one of the exercises that we're going to be doing is that we're going to be placing

01:53.480 --> 01:59.960
a marker on the map wherever the user coming in and viewing our Web page is located.

01:59.960 --> 02:06.380
So I know a little bit creepy but withes just shows the capabilities that are available and the information

02:06.380 --> 02:09.320
that we have access to within javascript.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.460
We're also going to look at event handlers and what happens when there is mouse events page load events

02:16.460 --> 02:17.570
keyboard events.

02:17.660 --> 02:24.950
So all kind of events and this is where that interaction happens because the user is going to be triggering

02:24.950 --> 02:29.510
something they're going to create some type of interaction within the web page and we're going to pick

02:29.510 --> 02:31.820
it up in javascript and make use of it.

02:31.850 --> 02:38.060
So we're going to be also building you are IDE generator so a generator that takes input in from the

02:38.060 --> 02:46.250
user and generates an output and also an image carrousel so image carousels are very useful very common

02:46.250 --> 02:52.750
within web pages and also you build one from scratch using javascript also form validation.

02:52.760 --> 02:58.130
So every form you need to validate and make sure that the user is putting in the data that you're expecting.

02:58.220 --> 03:03.800
So form validation is a very useful functionality that you can do with javascript.

03:03.800 --> 03:12.200
I'm going to show you how within this section also how we can force form inputs so we can set it up

03:12.260 --> 03:16.620
so that it's only picking up digits or it's only picking up characters.

03:16.820 --> 03:22.550
And it's not going to allow the user actually to input anything but a digit or a character so it can

03:22.550 --> 03:28.460
basically quietly block off what the user can be putting into that input field.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.500
Also drag and drop drag and drop is a really cool functionality.

03:32.570 --> 03:35.960
And this is all available within the section.

03:36.020 --> 03:42.050
So we're going to show you how we can drag content from one element and drag it into another element

03:42.050 --> 03:43.390
and drop it in there.

03:43.550 --> 03:48.600
And also one more project that we're going to build out and we're going to build out a game.

03:48.680 --> 03:55.700
So this game is actually going to scramble names and then it's up to the user to guess which ones of

03:55.700 --> 03:58.570
the presented content are the scrambled names.

03:58.700 --> 04:05.090
So this is going to be a really nice neat functionality exercise where you can get really familiar with

04:05.180 --> 04:07.260
what's available within the dorm.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.040
So this section has a lot of great stuff and I know you're excited to get started.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.460
So let's get started coding some interactive content using javascript.
