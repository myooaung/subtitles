00:00.940 --> 00:08.070
Well come back and this lesson we're going to look at arrays and looping through the values of an array.

00:08.080 --> 00:18.850
So first of all we create a list of arrays so let's say let's do one called and user names and let's

00:18.850 --> 00:19.910
create that array.

00:19.930 --> 00:27.890
So we're going to have some users in here so with this will stick to lowercase.

00:29.850 --> 00:38.920
And so there's some users now some usernames with an array and that's refreshed thought out there and

00:38.920 --> 00:47.680
we know that within the consul here I do use are names as a quick refresher on arrays.

00:47.920 --> 00:54.630
Every array has a length value so you can actually use that and loop through an array.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.490
So let's do a for loop.

00:56.560 --> 01:04.840
We're going to do variable x started and set it equal to zero because we know arrays start at zero.

01:04.840 --> 01:11.830
So the first index value of the rate is zero and we're going to loop through X while it's less than

01:12.040 --> 01:18.170
usernames length because this is a value that we can grab a hold of.

01:18.580 --> 01:23.740
So we can make use of it within our script and then we just need to increment x.

01:24.400 --> 01:35.450
And now let's outputs and we use our favorite h to Mel and we need to output the value of the username.

01:35.530 --> 01:44.540
So let's do the user names and place X with him here and then concatenated together with a line break.

01:46.550 --> 01:51.850
So do you think doing this is going to put our value of our array.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.440
So let's take a look and see see what our output is.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.030
So I refreshed it.

01:58.050 --> 02:06.290
Indeed we do get all of the usernames within the array so we're able to loop through and pull back all

02:06.290 --> 02:08.130
of the information.

02:08.140 --> 02:16.200
So in a better way to do this if you want to loop through an array we can use while.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.380
So this is another option that we have because we know with while

02:22.980 --> 02:29.160
it doesn't actually live through unless this condition is true and then we can do something with those

02:29.160 --> 02:30.040
values.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.760
So let's set up our while loop here.

02:33.830 --> 02:39.870
So they'll loop it out twice or loop it out a number of different ways and then up to you depending

02:39.870 --> 02:45.620
on your scenario and what you're trying to do accomplish to be able to choose which is the best way

02:45.620 --> 02:48.450
and which is the quickest way to put that content.

02:48.750 --> 02:52.390
So with a while loop we need to set up a starting point.

02:52.500 --> 02:59.050
So let's use value of x and we're going to equal X to zero.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.340
So we don't need this value of x anymore that we're looping through.

03:02.390 --> 03:06.170
So that's where we're just using that same one at this time.

03:06.290 --> 03:11.130
Let's loop through while there is a value here.

03:11.450 --> 03:19.490
So we know that if we increment X past the value that's within the user names we're going to throw an

03:19.490 --> 03:19.930
error.

03:19.940 --> 03:25.490
And basically we can't pull back this value anymore and that's where we're going to break the loop.

03:25.490 --> 03:28.460
And that's where the wild conditions are going to come in.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.430
It's good to know that at this point this loop is over.

03:32.820 --> 03:34.360
So let's see if this works.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.470
So let's go refresh it.

03:36.680 --> 03:42.550
And we are able to pull that loop values within this type of format as well.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.760
So I want to give you a challenge actually.

03:46.780 --> 03:51.150
So what if we want to loop through this array and backwards.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.050
So we saw that we're taking.

03:53.070 --> 04:02.020
Mike John Larry but what I want you to do is to produce Larry John and Mike using a for loop.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.320
And if you want positivity you open up your editor give it a try.

04:07.420 --> 04:13.990
So all we're doing is and so Mike John Larry it's Larry John Mike that we want to put in our output

04:13.990 --> 04:16.930
area and I'll show you how to do that.

04:16.930 --> 04:21.830
Coming up so I get an opportunity to try that.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.460
And now I will give you the solution for this.

04:24.650 --> 04:29.310
So what we want to do is we want to loop through it backwards.

04:29.550 --> 04:38.740
And the way to do that so set up a variable and this variable x is not going to be equal to zero.

04:38.870 --> 04:47.990
It's actually going to be equal to the value of usernames length minus 1 because this is an array.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.860
And we know that we go all the way to zero.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.630
So this is where we want to set up the array.

04:54.710 --> 05:01.270
And then this value is also dependent on what our conditional value is in break out of the array.

05:01.490 --> 05:09.780
So we need to check to see it while x is equal is greater than or equal to zero.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.050
So we know that once it hits.

05:12.110 --> 05:25.560
So we want this loop to stop and the next we want to decrease the value of x so out of that loop and

05:25.620 --> 05:29.940
that's part we can add that in as well.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.250
So let's try this out.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.820
So is that works.

05:32.890 --> 05:40.330
And we are able to with loops we're actually able to reverse them starting out with the higher number

05:40.450 --> 05:47.530
and then decreasing the value of x as we loop through.

05:47.590 --> 05:54.000
And there's one other way to loop through arrays and this one is also very popular.

05:54.070 --> 05:59.340
Also a great way and this is new with us 2015.

05:59.380 --> 06:05.360
So basically some of the older browsers may not be compatible with this type of format but you can try

06:05.360 --> 06:05.820
it anyway.

06:05.830 --> 06:11.920
And if you've got your users are coming in and the newer browsers then you can go ahead and use this

06:11.920 --> 06:15.980
way because this is actually the simplest way to put those values.

06:16.030 --> 06:22.760
So we loop through and we get a value of.

06:22.980 --> 06:27.240
And this is where we placed the name of the array.

06:27.900 --> 06:36.290
So we're getting a value of usernames and we're just looping through it and it's as easy as this where

06:36.290 --> 06:38.710
we can put value.

06:39.030 --> 06:42.490
So instead of the user names we're putting value.

06:42.500 --> 06:49.190
So this is the one that's actually going to be the holder for the item as we loop through all the different

06:49.190 --> 06:50.760
items within that array.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.090
So let me show you what happens now.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.470
So let's this one over here and I know I should have a way to differentiate this.

06:58.610 --> 06:59.360
So let me

07:02.670 --> 07:04.940
let me add something in here too.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.540
To essentially break it

07:10.390 --> 07:12.790
so get rid of the value and

07:15.420 --> 07:18.350
for an and call it for it.

07:18.990 --> 07:19.620
So there you go.

07:19.620 --> 07:24.820
So I another way to output your content that's contained within your array.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.900
And this again this is probably the easiest way to do that is simply to loop through all the items in

07:30.900 --> 07:31.740
the array.

07:31.830 --> 07:37.930
Assign a value so this one is holding the value of the item within the array and then all we're just

07:37.950 --> 07:40.220
doing is we're making use of that value.

07:40.350 --> 07:46.240
So this could be anything it doesn't need to be value it can be it can be be it can be whatever value

07:46.240 --> 07:47.500
we want assigned to it.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.160
So it doesn't matter on the output.

07:49.170 --> 07:54.310
This is just the container the holder for whatever was in this array.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.180
So what objects.

07:56.220 --> 08:02.560
There's also a lot of great ways to loop through objects and that's coming up in the next lesson.
