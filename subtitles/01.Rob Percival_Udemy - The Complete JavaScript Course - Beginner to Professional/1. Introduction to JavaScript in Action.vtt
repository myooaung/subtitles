In this section we're going to be showing you javascript in action.

00:04.870 --> 00:11.230
So it's a section where you can practice and work alongside a number of projects in order to get even

00:11.230 --> 00:13.270
more familiar with javascript.

00:13.270 --> 00:15.880
Take what you've learned in the previous lessons.

00:15.910 --> 00:22.180
Put it all together and start building out applications practicing javascript with a number of mini

00:22.180 --> 00:28.960
projects and exercises that we've got contained within this section to continue to expand as the Course

00:28.960 --> 00:31.980
grows and expands to new content.

00:31.990 --> 00:37.270
We're going to be adding a number of many projects in order for you to practice and get even more familiar

00:37.270 --> 00:41.150
with javascript and apply what you've learned in earlier lessons.

00:41.290 --> 00:47.470
And remember you can always go back to some of those earlier lessons and take those earlier projects

00:47.740 --> 00:53.560
expand on them as you've gained more knowledge with javascript and make them even better.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.480
Try them out.

00:54.580 --> 01:00.840
The source code is always included in order for you to take that source code and work with it customize

01:00.840 --> 01:02.950
it and make it even better.

01:02.950 --> 01:08.140
This section's going to give you a number of examples of how to work with javascript and you're going

01:08.140 --> 01:10.470
