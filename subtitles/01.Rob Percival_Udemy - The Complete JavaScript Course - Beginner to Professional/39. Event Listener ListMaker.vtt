00:00.930 --> 00:05.460
Welcome back in in this lesson we're going to do a practice exercise.

00:05.460 --> 00:11.430
We're going to take a little bit of what we've done earlier and improve on it and then we're also going

00:11.430 --> 00:16.770
to build out that list of friends and we're going to make that list editable.

00:16.770 --> 00:23.780
We can also remove items from the list we can add items and we can edit the existing items.

00:23.790 --> 00:29.000
So this is all going to be done via javascript via a dynamically generated list.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.790
And we are going to do some of what we learned earlier.

00:32.790 --> 00:36.600
So first off let's start out by creating our array.

00:36.660 --> 00:42.200
So we need an array that's actually going to fold hold all of our friends list.

00:42.270 --> 00:47.490
So we're going to use that same friends list that we had earlier where we had a number of different

00:47.490 --> 00:49.400
friends that we could utilize.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.150
So I simply copy and paste it from the earlier project.

00:53.190 --> 00:53.880
So there we go.

00:53.880 --> 01:04.150
So we have our friends list and the other thing that I wanted to do is I wanted to build it at my table.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.160
So on load I want to fire off the function called build.

01:11.340 --> 01:16.920
So let's save that and next let's add in the function build.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.880
So basically this one is going to build out our table.

01:21.880 --> 01:28.800
So in this exercise we're going to the a table and the first column is going to have the name the second

01:28.800 --> 01:31.000
column is going to have delete.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.560
And the third column is going to have an edit option and then depending on which one gets clicked that

01:37.560 --> 01:41.980
we're going to take some type of action within the rest of the cells within the role.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.990
So let's start by creating a variable HMO.

01:46.110 --> 01:51.550
And a lot of this is going to be very similar to what we did earlier but we are going to make it different.

01:51.720 --> 02:00.930
So this is going to be called the click table and close off that H1 and then we know that we're ready

02:00.930 --> 02:03.190
to start opening up our table.

02:03.720 --> 02:12.200
So next thing that we need to do is we need to create our loop in order to build out where our table.

02:12.240 --> 02:23.480
So starting at zero we're going to loop through while my array length is greater than x.

02:23.550 --> 02:29.230
And then when that statement's no longer true that we know that we can break out of the loop.

02:29.340 --> 02:33.320
So within the loop itself let's build out our each to m-L.

02:33.330 --> 02:37.250
So we're going to concatenate him all together with that cell.

02:37.500 --> 02:46.920
So first thing that we need to do is set up a table row and then within there we've got a table and

02:46.980 --> 02:53.130
then within that table we're going to have the value from the array.

02:53.130 --> 02:54.490
Some of us will add that in.

02:54.510 --> 02:55.910
Now at this point.

02:56.430 --> 03:00.960
So we'll just add that in.

03:01.200 --> 03:09.760
And then next let's go back into our string and we'll close off that table cell and open another one.

03:09.990 --> 03:14.900
And so within this one I want to have a hyperlink.

03:14.920 --> 03:21.640
So basically this hyperlink is not going to go anywhere and when it gets clicked we're going to add

03:21.880 --> 03:22.790
action.

03:22.990 --> 03:26.350
So data action is going to be delete

03:30.350 --> 03:37.340
so when this gets clicked that and this one in this instance what we want to do is delete that element

03:37.730 --> 03:38.800
so delete that out.

03:38.810 --> 03:46.280
So we just call it D L for short and close that off and then we can close off the table cell and let's

03:46.280 --> 03:48.180
open up another table cell.

03:48.320 --> 03:55.970
And in this one what we want to do is we want to create the opportunity to add it so instead of delete

03:56.690 --> 04:05.280
we're going to have our table action is going to be at it and we're going to type and edit.

04:05.690 --> 04:12.110
So we're going to give the ability to edit when that gets selected and then just close off the table

04:12.110 --> 04:12.680
roll.

04:12.950 --> 04:21.340
And there's a few other parameters that we still need to add in and we need to add in an ID so to ID

04:21.440 --> 04:27.810
and we can do ID and just simply add X to it.

04:28.460 --> 04:36.340
So let's do that so that we always get a unique ID value and other thing that I want to get in is data

04:36.440 --> 04:44.200
roll so that we actually know what the index value of x is and we can always refer to it at any time

04:44.410 --> 04:51.650
whenever we make our selection.

04:51.650 --> 04:56.060
So next thing that I want to do is I'm actually going to use a query selector.

04:56.060 --> 05:02.130
So not always using IDs and basically So we've built out our H-2 mail.

05:02.150 --> 05:07.410
I'm going to clean this up a little bit so I know it's kind of a little bit Kramm there.

05:07.490 --> 05:16.170
And so whenever we finish off our loop then the next step is to add it in to our inner h t m l.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.840
So let's take care of that.

05:18.110 --> 05:27.110
And this time we can do documents and we'll use a query selector query so query selector and we're going

05:27.110 --> 05:36.200
to select the class output and then within the class output Let's update the enraged him out of that

05:36.230 --> 05:40.260
element with that each to him I'll tell you that we've been building out.

05:40.490 --> 05:45.140
So go out to the page try it out and I can make this smaller as well.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.420
So basically there we go.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.240
We've got our table it's all ready to go.

05:49.340 --> 05:54.960
So the next thing that we need to do is add in our event listeners.

05:55.100 --> 06:04.320
So I want you to pause the video and I want you to use queries selector all and select only the elements

06:04.560 --> 06:08.300
that have an attribute data action delete.

06:08.490 --> 06:13.620
So loop through all of those and pick up those values.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.930
So that's it.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.050
And just to make things different.

06:17.190 --> 06:20.080
We're looking for the attribute delete.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.220
So notice that we don't have any classes on these Zoe.

06:24.360 --> 06:31.110
The only information that we have is that we've got a hyperlink and that they've got a data action attribute

06:31.110 --> 06:38.510
to them so paused the video and create that statement sole It is using query selector and selecting

06:38.510 --> 06:39.350
those.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.360
And this is a little bit tricky.

06:41.490 --> 06:45.940
So the solution for this and I set up a variable.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.310
So this is a d data.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.480
Action is delete and or died.

06:56.100 --> 07:06.630
So document and let's use the one that we're using is query select or all because we have multiple elements

07:06.690 --> 07:09.170
that might contain this information.

07:09.270 --> 07:11.940
And let's go back into this.

07:12.150 --> 07:19.770
And we need to make our selection of that attribute and in order select after you attribute we use the

07:19.770 --> 07:20.880
square brackets.

07:21.060 --> 07:24.990
And then within the square brackets and we saw this earlier as well.

07:24.990 --> 07:40.210
We can make our selection and we can check to see which one has the attribute delete.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.890
So the next step is to loop through.

07:43.110 --> 07:48.150
So let's say a console log that out and just make sure that we were able to actually pick all of them

07:48.150 --> 07:49.610
up.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.300
So let's refresh the page go into the console and there we go.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.250
So we were able to pick all of them up.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.700
They're all anchors that's why they're all A's and they're all anchored tags.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.060
So they're picking up all nine of them that are on the page.

08:06.100 --> 08:06.900
So that's great.

08:06.940 --> 08:13.390
And now we know the next step is that we need to loop through them and add an event listener and the

08:13.540 --> 08:16.160
list of that we want to add is click.

08:16.360 --> 08:22.570
So I want you to pause the video and create that loop instead of adding the On Click event which we

08:22.570 --> 08:23.580
did earlier.

08:23.620 --> 08:30.250
I want you to add add event listener to them and the click event and then add in and set up a function

08:30.510 --> 08:34.310
that whenever it gets clicked we logged something out into the console.

08:35.860 --> 08:40.700
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution coming up.

08:40.700 --> 08:47.170
So if you had an opportunity to try that out and now let's create our loop.

08:47.380 --> 08:51.830
So we need to loop through all of the items that are available.

08:51.880 --> 08:59.680
So we're going to use X again and we're going to loop through while the length of while the dad length

08:59.770 --> 09:05.550
is greater than x and we're going to continue to increment that.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.590
And now the next thing that we need to do is add an event listener.

09:09.790 --> 09:13.300
So for every single one we need to attach an event listener.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.720
So let's do this.

09:14.750 --> 09:25.390
And so that's our object and add that listener and the listener that we're listening for is click and

09:25.430 --> 09:33.860
we want to fire off an anonymous function so set that up and basically whenever it gets clicked we're

09:33.870 --> 09:35.820
going to console log.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.110
Well just console log this for now.

09:39.180 --> 09:44.660
So now let's go out and refresh the page and make sure that we've got that hooked up.

09:44.730 --> 09:50.530
So we're listening for delete and whenever we click it that fires off.

09:50.610 --> 09:55.890
So there's one thing that I did want to add in and notice that when we go out here and we refresh it

09:55.950 --> 09:59.100
and we click it we're actually trying to move to another page.

09:59.100 --> 10:04.890
So even though it's the hash it's still a tablet it still has a default action on it.

10:04.890 --> 10:12.060
So what I want to do is remove that default action and do remember when we looked at this earlier there's

10:12.150 --> 10:16.290
a built in method that's called prevent default.

10:16.650 --> 10:22.260
And basically if we if we add this then we can prevent the default action.

10:22.290 --> 10:28.390
So we go back to refresh and we see that now we're not actually following through on those click events.

10:29.540 --> 10:35.900
So the next step is that we need to actually remove it from the array and then once it's removed from

10:35.900 --> 10:39.300
the array we're going to rebuild this again.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.690
So the next step we need to remove it from the array.

10:42.950 --> 10:49.350
So we need the index value and luckily for us we've got the index value in data roll.

10:49.430 --> 10:52.210
So we need to get that index value.

10:52.220 --> 10:58.060
So that's the value that we need to pick up in order to remove it out of the array.

10:58.430 --> 11:04.360
So now we know that we can use this in order to navigate up.

11:04.370 --> 11:08.730
So let's do that we'll do this and we're going to go using.

11:08.750 --> 11:12.170
So we we have a number of options so we can go to the parent

11:16.260 --> 11:17.380
or instead.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.270
We can also use closest.

11:19.290 --> 11:24.090
So we saw that last time and I think the closest works best.

11:24.210 --> 11:31.140
So because that usually it depending if our structure changes or if we added any additional elements

11:31.220 --> 11:33.090
then that's not going to throw anything off.

11:33.210 --> 11:38.920
And we're always going to make sure that we're searching for this data roll attribute.

11:39.210 --> 11:45.900
So let's take a look and we're going to check to see the closest data roll and then what we need to

11:45.900 --> 11:48.630
do is we need to get attribute

11:51.550 --> 11:55.710
so we need to get the value of the attribute data row.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.000
So pick that up

11:59.790 --> 12:03.860
and let's log that out in the console so we can take a closer look.

12:03.870 --> 12:08.730
And just to make sure that we're actually picking up that index value before we try to delete it.

12:08.730 --> 12:10.170
So we know that six.

12:10.170 --> 12:11.030
That's three.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.190
That's two.

12:12.210 --> 12:13.790
And we know the first one is zero.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.150
So that's perfect.

12:15.150 --> 12:22.550
Now the next step is to remove it out of the array and we can use splice in order to remove it.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.740
And that also allows us to track that value.

12:25.740 --> 12:30.170
So going way back in the earlier lessons we're working with arrays.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.330
Let's set up and let's remove.

12:33.810 --> 12:39.140
So just give it a variable of R and this is going to be the item that we're removing.

12:39.180 --> 12:44.900
According to the index value that we're able to pick up from our data roll.

12:45.060 --> 12:51.720
So this method is called splice and we need first to provide an index value.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.030
So that's the index value and we want to take one of the items.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.100
So we're turning it as our.

12:58.200 --> 13:03.940
And we're pulling that information it's pulling out that item out of the array.

13:04.110 --> 13:08.110
And then next we can simply relaunch build.

13:08.130 --> 13:14.070
So once we've removed it from the array we're going to relaunch build and we're going to build a brand

13:14.070 --> 13:15.660
new H2 Mal here.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.660
So let's go ahead and try that out.

13:17.670 --> 13:25.670
So refresh and when we hit Delete we see that we can delete out those values that we're selecting delete.

13:25.830 --> 13:31.210
So we've got a delete working and we see also that we've got the item that we're deleting from that

13:31.210 --> 13:32.700
array popping up there.

13:32.970 --> 13:38.760
So the next part of this is edit and this one is actually going to be a little bit more complicated

13:38.850 --> 13:40.040
than that delete.

13:40.260 --> 13:46.410
And then lastly we also want to be able to add in items and the add in is actually going to be relatively

13:46.410 --> 13:49.930
easy because we're simply going to push into the array.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.750
So all of this is going to show you in the upcoming lesson.

13:53.830 --> 14:02.460
So I take the core source code that we have right now at this point and update and add a new item into

14:02.460 --> 14:03.330
the array.

14:03.330 --> 14:08.460
And you can do it within the same format where you can simply add into the array and then launch and

14:08.460 --> 14:14.240
build again and rebuild the structure that each time will tell it table structure again.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.620
So go ahead and try that out in the next lesson I'll show you how to do that and how to complete the

14:19.620 --> 14:20.150
edit part.
