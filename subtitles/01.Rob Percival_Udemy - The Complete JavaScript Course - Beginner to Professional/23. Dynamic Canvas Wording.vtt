WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:05.220
We'll come back here and I'm going to show you some more things that we can do with canvas.

00:05.340 --> 00:10.130
So the previous lesson we got introduced to canvas and there's even more we can do.

00:10.130 --> 00:17.250
So if you want to simply draw a line we can actually move the positioning of where we're starting to

00:17.250 --> 00:26.460
draw so we can set up position of our start drawing and that's X and Y so we can use the same parameters

00:26.520 --> 00:28.130
and we can start at that 10.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.950
And this time I'm going I started out to 70.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.660
So this is our starting point.

00:33.660 --> 00:38.240
So think of this as if you're putting a pen down on a piece of paper.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.740
This is where you want to start it.

00:39.750 --> 00:45.780
We're going to put it at 10 and to 70 So that's roughly around where my cursor is.

00:45.780 --> 00:49.230
So next to that we want to do is we want to draw a line.

00:49.260 --> 00:54.530
So we're going to move our line and we're going to use lying to.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.570
And this requires two parameters again.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.450
So it needs another point.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.390
So this is our starting point.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.620
And then this is our ending point.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.320
So let's end this at 1 10 and 3.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.350
70.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.750
So what do you think is going to happen here.

01:12.770 --> 01:20.300
And one last thing that we need to do is we actually have to apply the stroke and the stroke is basically

01:20.300 --> 01:22.950
telling us that we want to.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.930
So we've got our move so we're moving our starting point.

01:25.940 --> 01:33.240
So essentially our pen we're starting up to 10 x coordinate 10 and y to 70.

01:33.260 --> 01:38.700
We're moving it to 110 and 370 and then we're applying the stroke.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.150
So let's go ahead and refresh it and we see that we get to apply a basic line.

01:44.150 --> 01:52.750
So starting point ending point we can draw a nice line and just as we saw earlier where we've got a

01:52.750 --> 01:55.190
line with and we've got a stroke.

01:55.310 --> 02:00.590
So if we've set those then those values are still going to be the same and they're still going to get

02:00.620 --> 02:06.640
implemented when we're actually drawing any other strokes on our canvas.

02:06.650 --> 02:10.260
So the thing that we can do is we can draw a circle.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.590
So this again we need a starting point.

02:13.670 --> 02:21.020
So let's start and we're going to use begin path and begin path is going to do is this is going to give

02:21.020 --> 02:27.790
us basically lifting up the pen and moving it to our new location.

02:28.010 --> 02:33.220
And we're going to add in so we're going to do CTX and we're going to build an ark.

02:33.370 --> 02:43.900
So what an arc does is this basically allows us to create a rounded format for our for our drawing.

02:43.910 --> 02:50.070
So basically we're able to draw circles using ARC.

02:50.250 --> 02:55.730
So we need a starting point and the starting point is going to be the float x and the float.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.130
Why.

02:56.130 --> 03:00.470
So this is the center point of where we want to draw our circle.

03:00.630 --> 03:07.390
So I set this at 60 and I'm going to also set this at

03:10.560 --> 03:11.570
430.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.660
So that's where our circle is going to be.

03:14.710 --> 03:19.380
Next thing that we need to set is a radius for the circle.

03:19.420 --> 03:22.460
So in order to add in radius.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.380
So however far we want to go out.

03:25.440 --> 03:33.910
So I only go 50 picks out the next promotor that we're looking for is we need to have a starting angle.

03:33.910 --> 03:37.840
So this is basically the angle that we want to start at.

03:37.870 --> 03:41.320
And if you're drawing a circle you don't need a starting angle.

03:41.350 --> 03:48.920
And then lastly we need to have one more parameter here and this is going to be the float

03:51.850 --> 04:00.790
end angle and we can use actually PI for this so this is bringing in the javascript math and we can

04:00.790 --> 04:09.040
do math PI and that's going to give us the PI parameter that we can bring into our content.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.900
And then lastly one other thing we need to do is we need to apply stroke.

04:14.050 --> 04:20.220
So go ahead and refresh it and you can see because we're actually picking up those random colors.

04:20.230 --> 04:21.880
So there's our circle.

04:21.880 --> 04:29.460
So what do I need to do now is paused the video and draw a circle with a line through it.

04:29.500 --> 04:36.880
So go ahead and open up your editor and draw a circle with a line through it and you can make use of

04:37.270 --> 04:42.220
some of the things that we've done here earlier within this lesson where we've drawn a circle we've

04:42.220 --> 04:43.310
drawn a line.

04:43.390 --> 04:50.860
So all you have to do is figure out what coordinates you're starting with for X and for y and where

04:50.920 --> 04:55.710
you're ending off to on the line and then the same thing for the circle where you're going to start.

04:55.720 --> 05:02.670
How big the circle is going to be and where it's starting at x and y position.

05:02.770 --> 05:08.630
So go in and try that 8 and I'm going to show you one other thing coming up within this lesson.

05:08.710 --> 05:17.160
And we also have another option for drawing within our canvas and we can actually use text.

05:17.340 --> 05:25.230
So this one again the CTX object and I'm going to use fill a text so fill text is basically going to

05:25.230 --> 05:28.540
allow us to write something on our canvas.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.030
So of course signator rate Hello world.

05:31.140 --> 05:37.800
And then I just need to specify where that hello world is going to be located.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.340
So again we're going to need an x and a Y position.

05:42.690 --> 05:55.280
So I'm going to use starting at x 10 and I'm going to use y of 5 for the and we also have an option

05:55.340 --> 05:58.600
for a maximum with but I'm not going to utilize that.

05:58.610 --> 05:59.350
So there we go.

05:59.390 --> 06:06.830
So now we've got some text and we've actually got some more options for the text itself so we can set

06:06.920 --> 06:11.240
a text size because we saw that this is actually really small.

06:11.240 --> 06:16.300
So let's go ahead and set a size and the size is going to be a string value.

06:16.430 --> 06:24.120
So we can set a size and I'm going to use 24 picks for the size.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.190
So let's go ahead and refresh it.

06:26.630 --> 06:32.640
And one other thing too that we need to include in here is we need to include the font type.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.890
So you set it as Aeriel.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.550
So now let's refresh.

06:37.580 --> 06:38.450
And so there we go.

06:38.450 --> 06:40.560
Snow we've got some bigger text.

06:40.730 --> 06:46.100
And notice the other thing too that the text is taking the fill style property.

06:46.100 --> 06:53.580
So it's actually taking that same color filler value that we have within Phil's style.

06:53.690 --> 06:58.430
So that's some other way that if you wanted to you can set a color of text.

06:58.670 --> 07:03.940
And the thing now that you've got canvas you can actually save that image.

07:04.040 --> 07:12.260
So I'm just simply clicking on it and I can copy that image and I could save it as a download and we

07:12.260 --> 07:15.540
can see that it automatically creates a PLG file.

07:15.620 --> 07:18.470
So this is just that image that we've actually created.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.980
So it's actually creating a real image here.

07:21.140 --> 07:26.870
And this is really exciting when it comes to building out stuff within your web page because you can

07:26.870 --> 07:37.860
actually generate images with canvas so what I want you to do now is to create an input field and whenever

07:37.860 --> 07:40.250
that input fields and also a button.

07:40.410 --> 07:46.920
So whenever that button gets clicked that we're actually going to update and add in some text within

07:46.920 --> 07:50.030
the canvas we're not going to output it into our ID.

07:50.130 --> 07:56.720
We're actually going to write it into canvas and I'll show you the solution coming up so be had an opportunity

07:56.720 --> 07:58.190
to try that out.

07:58.190 --> 08:02.690
So we're creating an input so the input is just a regular text input.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.650
Are you given an ID so we can grab it within our javascript.

08:06.710 --> 08:12.160
We're going to call it my words and we'll close it off.

08:12.910 --> 08:19.990
And then also one more input and this is going to be a button and this one will give it an ID.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.960
Or actually just going to do an on click on this one.

08:23.170 --> 08:29.540
So whenever it gets clicked then we're going to fire off and we're going to call it a draw.

08:30.070 --> 08:35.890
So basically whenever this gets clicked then it will actually draw it into the canvas.

08:35.950 --> 08:42.720
So the next available slot and the value is going to be called the value for it draw on as well.

08:42.820 --> 08:49.240
So we can go back and we can refresh our page and now we've got our option to draw and actually it to

08:49.240 --> 08:55.270
move this above the canvas just so it looks a little bit better above there so we don't have it kind

08:55.270 --> 09:02.610
of off to the side because I don't want to go through with styling and actually do a line break here

09:02.800 --> 09:04.800
so that it's below.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.500
So there we go.

09:05.500 --> 09:10.860
So now we've got an input here and we're ready to fire that off with draw.

09:10.990 --> 09:14.890
So it's create our function and the function is draw.

09:15.070 --> 09:22.620
So basically what we want to happen here is we want to draw some type of words here within the canvas.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.160
So every time we click it we want to draw those words.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.170
So now so these are global objects.

09:29.200 --> 09:36.010
So we know that we learned earlier from global objects that we can really do this really simply where

09:36.220 --> 09:38.910
all of those values are ready globally available.

09:38.950 --> 09:41.140
So we don't have to reset any of those.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.870
And all we have to do is do the fill taxed.

09:44.890 --> 09:49.250
So that means that we need to get a value for the full text.

09:49.390 --> 10:00.730
So let's do my words and we'll do documents get element by IDs a grab that my words field and we'll

10:00.730 --> 10:02.690
pull back the value from there.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.110
So we know that whenever we do this we can't insert it this way.

10:07.120 --> 10:15.410
So now let's refresh the page let's say test and draw and there we go so we can draw it there.

10:15.700 --> 10:22.780
So that's all we have to do in order to draw onto our canvas and we can do a whole lot more we can run

10:22.780 --> 10:28.360
any one of these and we can have some calculations and we can do a lot of really cool stuff when we

10:28.360 --> 10:34.450
start combining what canvas can do and adding in javascript alongside with it.

10:34.450 --> 10:38.840
So there's a lot of options for us to do some really cool stuff.

10:38.890 --> 10:44.800
So the other thing that you might want to do is you might want to track where the words are located

10:45.040 --> 10:46.930
so that you can actually move them down.

10:46.930 --> 10:56.650
So I've got my y position at 540 So maybe we'll set a global Y and we're going to set it at 540 as a

10:56.650 --> 10:57.610
default.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.250
I'm going to change the height of this to a hundred.

11:00.250 --> 11:06.070
So it will give us a little bit more space to play with and I'm going to use variables instead of these

11:06.070 --> 11:07.660
default values.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.490
And then every time I write to it I'm going to increase.

11:11.740 --> 11:14.830
I'm going to do y equals Y plus 30.

11:14.830 --> 11:18.730
So that will give me enough space to add even more words.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.750
So let's try this.

11:19.780 --> 11:25.710
So let's do a test and we'll do test two and a bunch of other stuff.

11:25.720 --> 11:32.200
So now we can draw and we can write directly into our Kandace.

11:32.200 --> 11:39.210
That's as easy as that to write into Kandace So the next lesson I'm going to show you something else

11:39.210 --> 11:46.170
you can do with canvas where we know now that we can actually create images and we can take these images

11:46.230 --> 11:52.830
and actually add them into Kandace so you can actually have multiple canvases and add images.

11:52.980 --> 11:58.940
So take some random generated images and then apply them to a third image.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.190
So I show you how to do that.

12:00.210 --> 12:01.380
Coming up in the next lesson.
