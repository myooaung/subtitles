00:00.560 --> 00:06.480
It the previous lesson we saw how we can create a cookie where we could do something like this and we

00:06.480 --> 00:14.040
can create a cookie so we can call another cookie where we can create a cookie test we can give it a

00:14.040 --> 00:15.300
value of it.

00:15.330 --> 00:18.350
So we'll just go hello for a value.

00:18.390 --> 00:24.320
And then lastly we can set it for the number of days that we want the cookie to exist.

00:24.470 --> 00:32.250
And now we can console directory that document object and we can take a look at what's been set within

00:32.280 --> 00:36.220
our cookies and now we see that we've actually got three cookies in there.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.750
So the next step is to retrieve those cookies.

00:39.750 --> 00:46.200
So we saw that we can set the cookies and we also need a way to get those cookies out of our Document

00:46.260 --> 00:47.240
object.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.940
So we need a name that we're going to be searching for for the cookie.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.600
So just to name and then down here.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.540
Let's set a variable.

00:55.650 --> 01:03.000
So we'll just see my cookie and this is going to be the cookie that we're going to search for.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.150
So that's our cookie.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.180
And let's set up a name so we can pull back any one of them.

01:10.290 --> 01:11.810
Let's do test.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.090
So let's do that one that we've just pulled in.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.210
So for my cookie I want to see the value of test.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.240
So the number of things that we need to do here.

01:20.460 --> 01:27.510
And the first one is that going to the cookie we need to set up a function for that and variable so

01:27.510 --> 01:30.960
we need to find the pattern that we're looking for.

01:30.960 --> 01:39.660
So basically this is the name and concatenated with the equal sign so that we have actually this value

01:39.660 --> 01:44.280
that was the one that we're looking for and what we're going to do is we're going to loop through all

01:44.280 --> 01:45.780
the values of cookies.

01:45.840 --> 01:51.480
We're going to split this into an array and we're going to then take those values loop through them

01:51.780 --> 01:56.650
and return back the value of the cookie.

01:56.660 --> 02:03.350
So do you remember earlier within the array when we were looking at the strings string methods that

02:03.350 --> 02:06.970
we saw way to actually split a string into an array.

02:06.970 --> 02:12.680
So that's what we're going to use this time and we're going to list out all of our cookies.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.160
So just give it a variable of C..

02:15.350 --> 02:18.820
And what I wanted to do is I want to split.

02:18.830 --> 02:23.990
So this is the document cookie object.

02:24.230 --> 02:31.520
And we're going to use the Split method and we need to split it with the semi-colon.

02:31.520 --> 02:38.130
So we see that over here they've got the semi-colons in there so we need to split it within the semi-colons.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.400
So once we split it what I'll do is our console log out.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.070
What are split hairs.

02:43.190 --> 02:49.030
And basically this is going to create an array under C and it's going to have all of these values here.

02:49.080 --> 02:54.900
Let's refresh and we see that we've got all of those values are available there.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.220
So we've got the first one the second one and the third one.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.530
And also notice the space here in the beginning.

03:01.790 --> 03:06.540
So next thing that we need to do is we need to create our loops so let's set up our loop.

03:06.650 --> 03:13.940
So the same thing that we've done many times before where we're looping through while X is less than

03:14.000 --> 03:18.770
the length of the array which is C this time we need to increment x.

03:18.800 --> 03:26.210
So of course we can eventually break out of that loop so we're looping through the values and let's

03:26.270 --> 03:28.870
set up a value for the cookie.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.570
So we know that the cookie is going to be c x.

03:33.620 --> 03:36.060
So this is the value that we're going to be looking at.

03:36.320 --> 03:41.060
So maybe we can even pull this into the console and let's put that.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.440
So this is the value.

03:42.440 --> 03:47.110
This is the current value as we continue through the loop.

03:47.120 --> 03:55.580
So basically we're able to loop through all of the values and next we need to check to see if the cookie

03:55.610 --> 03:57.070
is going to be found.

03:58.180 --> 04:05.770
And notice that we also have a space in front here so we need to remove those spaces before we can continue.

04:05.770 --> 04:12.460
So let's set up a variable in order to hold our value and then we're going to remove that space using

04:12.490 --> 04:15.710
the substring.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.880
So let's use this and we're going to set up a Taren every operator in order to pull this information

04:20.880 --> 04:28.790
back and we're going to take the value of c x and we're going to check to see if character out.

04:28.950 --> 04:33.220
So we're going to check to see the first character at zero.

04:33.360 --> 04:39.440
So basically the first character here and we're going to check to see if it's blank.

04:39.990 --> 04:43.920
And if it is I'm going to put t in place there.

04:43.920 --> 04:50.880
So basically what we need to do is we need to clear out that those spaces and we need to rewrite.

04:51.030 --> 04:55.400
So basically we want to have t if there is no spaces then we're fine.

04:55.410 --> 05:05.840
If this isn't if this is false then we're just using the initial value of c X. And if this is true then

05:05.840 --> 05:10.070
we need to clear out and remove that first space.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.450
So.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.180
So there are a number of ways to do this.

05:15.210 --> 05:20.430
And this time I'll show you doing it the territory operator so we haven't used that one in a while.

05:20.430 --> 05:24.710
So that basically gives us two different values.

05:25.620 --> 05:30.960
And if we return back false then we take the second one and if we return back true then we take the

05:30.960 --> 05:35.940
first one and for the first one we need to take the substring value of it.

05:36.120 --> 05:44.070
So we're going to use the string methods and use substring and what substring will do is we can specify

05:44.100 --> 05:46.650
how many characters we want to remove out of it.

05:46.650 --> 05:53.450
So take note that first character and first of all let's see if this actually works we'll refresh it.

05:53.460 --> 05:57.050
And we were able to get rid of that first whitespace.

05:57.060 --> 06:02.210
So there's a number of other ways to do this as well to remove that whitespace.

06:02.220 --> 06:07.980
So what I want you to do is go back to some of the previous methods that we've used and try to recreate

06:07.980 --> 06:13.110
it and create remove all of that first part of the whitespace.

06:13.170 --> 06:18.060
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you some more solutions coming up so paused the video.

06:18.150 --> 06:24.210
Open up your editor and create a string with the space in front of it or an array with the number of

06:24.210 --> 06:26.520
variables if you don't have the cookies set.

06:26.530 --> 06:32.100
Or if you do have the cookies set you can go and use the cookies create a few cookies and then loop

06:32.100 --> 06:35.840
through those and remove out that first part of the whitespace.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.730
So try that out and I'll show you some more solutions coming up.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.030
So let me show you some other ways to trim white space.

06:44.050 --> 06:49.690
So set up t again and this time we're going to use the trim method.

06:49.720 --> 06:57.730
So this is a builtin method a string method and string method and all we need to do is trim so we can

06:57.730 --> 06:58.250
do that.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.760
And let's try this one out and refresh it.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.340
So our whitespace is gone.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.270
So this might be the simplest one.

07:04.420 --> 07:10.270
And one more that I want to throw in there just as we are coming off the regular expressions.

07:10.270 --> 07:15.790
Let's do one as a regular expression and get some time to practice regular expressions.

07:15.790 --> 07:20.670
So I know that we need to set that value and we can do a replace.

07:20.830 --> 07:24.310
And then here is where the regular expression is going to come.

07:24.310 --> 07:32.940
So this one might seem a little bit complex but basically it will remove out any whitespace that's in

07:32.940 --> 07:36.490
front or after any of the characters.

07:36.630 --> 07:42.910
So basically it's going to remove the whitespace from the beginning and from the end.

07:42.990 --> 07:48.530
So let's go back and refreshed and there again we see that we are able to remove the whitespace.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.390
So you could do any number of these.

07:51.390 --> 07:53.090
These are all going to work.

07:53.100 --> 07:58.890
They're all going to give you the ability to remove the whitespace so that you can continue to loop

07:58.890 --> 08:00.940
through the cookie values.

08:01.350 --> 08:09.980
So that was our removing of the whitespace and the next thing that we want to do is we want to return

08:09.980 --> 08:15.690
back our cookie value if we've found it.

08:15.950 --> 08:19.350
And this time I've got another challenge for you.

08:19.400 --> 08:28.460
And earlier we did see how we can get the index Buzan index of we can see if a value was sitting within

08:28.520 --> 08:29.490
the array.

08:29.510 --> 08:36.710
So we need to do the same thing and loop through the array or check in the array and see if the value

08:36.710 --> 08:38.180
of p is there.

08:38.180 --> 08:41.510
So go ahead and try that out and I'll show you the solution for that.

08:41.510 --> 08:43.740
So the solution for this was that.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.860
Now we've got t is going to hold these values as we're looping through them.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.680
So we don't have to do anything else we can just use t.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.950
And we're going to use the method index of.

08:54.950 --> 09:00.810
So basically this gives us the ability to check to see if a value exists.

09:01.040 --> 09:09.190
And we know that if it exists they're going to return back a value of zero.

09:09.290 --> 09:15.440
So the value that we're looking for is P.E. and we're going to check to see if we do get a value of

09:15.440 --> 09:17.820
zero being returned back.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.420
And if we do then we know that we can con. We can log something out.

09:22.430 --> 09:28.330
So let's first log some information and then next I'll show you what else we can do with this.

09:28.340 --> 09:33.940
So let's go back and refresh and we see that we are able to find that cookie.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.540
So it's being returned we are logging it out.

09:36.590 --> 09:41.230
We were able to identify it and pull it out of our document cookie.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.900
So using a number of the different methods that we had seen earlier.

09:44.960 --> 09:51.330
So now we need to actually extract that value out.

09:51.410 --> 10:00.350
So instead of consoling alog let's do a return and we're going to return back the value of t and we're

10:00.350 --> 10:06.850
going to substring that so scup substring the value of t.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.030
And we're going to get the length of it.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.570
So the length of our original P

10:17.750 --> 10:23.660
and the length of so are going to return those back into the value that we're requesting.

10:23.660 --> 10:24.820
So let's try this out.

10:24.950 --> 10:32.800
And now let's see what the value of my cookie is and we see that we're returning back.

10:32.810 --> 10:33.390
Hello.

10:33.500 --> 10:40.570
So basically we're able to pull back this information because we originally sent over a value there.

10:40.670 --> 10:47.810
And what we're doing is we're pulling out the length of the value that we're looking for.

10:47.810 --> 10:55.310
So for looking for test we're pulling that back out and then we're returning it back as a substring.

10:55.310 --> 11:00.770
We know that within the console log there we were able to see the cookie value and we were able to simply

11:00.770 --> 11:01.760
return that.

11:01.790 --> 11:06.410
And then lastly So as we finish through our loop.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.740
So I'm just going to clean this up a bit.

11:08.780 --> 11:14.860
So as we've finished through our loop we need to have a return in case the cookie isn't found.

11:14.870 --> 11:18.430
So we're just going to return it back blank.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.200
So let's go ahead and try this.

11:20.200 --> 11:26.690
So let's see if there's a cookie and let's call it X..

11:27.420 --> 11:35.410
So we see that that's coming back undefined or if we try cookie ID we see that we get a value of 5.

11:35.580 --> 11:41.710
So we do have our way to return back the values from the cookies themselves.

11:43.300 --> 11:49.810
And one more function that I did want to create and that is to actually delete the cookies so to function

11:50.140 --> 11:52.830
and the cookie.

11:52.840 --> 11:58.820
And what this one will do is this is going to delete out the cookie value from the cookie object.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.360
And what we do.

12:01.580 --> 12:09.520
All we have to do is we have to just take that same value that we had in creating the cookie so we know

12:09.520 --> 12:15.390
that we can pass through the name and instead of a value we're just going to leave it blank.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.900
And we're also going to do instead of days we're going to do a negative one.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.960
So that will ensure that we actually delete and remove out that cookie.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.230
So let's go ahead and refreshed the page.

12:26.230 --> 12:33.700
And now let's see if we can read a cookie we can delete the cookies so let's do our cookie first and

12:33.700 --> 12:36.280
this time let's grab ID.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.750
So we see we've got a value of ID.

12:40.210 --> 12:43.060
And now let's try to delete the cookies.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.050
So this is our new function that we created to delete the cookie.

12:46.210 --> 12:52.300
So we get undefined and let's go back to read the cookie and it's blank so that cookie doesn't exist

12:52.300 --> 12:53.910
anymore it's completely gone.

12:53.950 --> 13:01.480
And this is how you can work with cookies and set them up to run in the back and hold information store

13:01.480 --> 13:05.700
information that the users provided in their browser.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.280
So the next time they're accessing your web site you can read the cookie.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.040
If it's already there in place.
