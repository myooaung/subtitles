WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.140
Welcome back.

00:02.150 --> 00:07.340
And in this lesson we're going to build out an image carousel using javascript.

00:07.430 --> 00:16.290
So what we need in our web page is we need to basically create our image.

00:16.400 --> 00:21.310
So I'm just going to set up an image and give it an idea so that we can grab it.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.840
And this is going to be just my image

00:27.610 --> 00:32.610
and the source right now we don't actually need to have a source because we're going to add the source

00:32.700 --> 00:35.290
and dynamically with Javascript.

00:35.290 --> 00:39.390
So this is actually all we need in order to initiate our project.

00:39.760 --> 00:46.090
And all we need is a function in order to start our image Carrousel.

00:46.190 --> 00:50.810
So let's set up some basic parameters for images.

00:50.870 --> 00:53.920
So I want to generate some dynamic images here.

00:54.020 --> 00:57.810
I'm going to use placeholder as well that we used last time.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.940
And we also need a holder.

01:02.940 --> 01:08.870
So this one will just be my I am image place.

01:09.180 --> 01:14.310
So we're going to start that at zero so we can start out with the first image in that array.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.140
Next let's set up an array.

01:16.170 --> 01:22.880
What that's going to actually contain all of our images and what I'm going to do is I'm simply cannot

01:22.890 --> 01:24.900
just output numbers here.

01:25.290 --> 01:29.910
So you could also do this as well and I actually have real images.

01:29.970 --> 01:36.270
So I just want to save some time here and I'm going to use the place sold it anyway so that will give

01:36.270 --> 01:42.280
me a variety of images and I'm going to set different values on those images.

01:42.360 --> 01:47.130
And also I want to also have another array where I have colors.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.670
So Image image is c..

01:51.750 --> 01:59.130
So this will be my array which corresponds to that and saves me the trouble of building out images where

01:59.130 --> 02:02.290
I can simply output them the colors here.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.930
So let's create some colors.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.720
So do some different shades.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.270
And actually it doesn't matter which colors I'm using.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.610
And what's so we have a wide variety.

02:22.610 --> 02:33.330
I just want to have the same amount of colors as there are items in the array above.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.600
And let's add one more color and

02:39.480 --> 02:39.820
so there.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.950
So we've got a variety of colors.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.690
We've got our images.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.810
So everything is all ready to go.

02:45.910 --> 02:53.380
And now all we need to do is set up and change our image picture so we need a couple of functions for

02:53.380 --> 02:53.780
that.

02:54.560 --> 03:02.670
So let's set up a function to switch image.

03:02.800 --> 03:10.680
So this function is solely going to swap our images and we're going to increment the value of image

03:12.090 --> 03:15.930
so any incremental value of image place by one.

03:15.930 --> 03:26.370
So basically this will change the image once we go over to the s w image so this should be for a switch

03:26.370 --> 03:32.000
or swap let's call it swap image.

03:32.140 --> 03:37.010
So this will actually swap the image to the next one within the array.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.540
So now we just need to update and build out our image.

03:43.600 --> 03:51.760
So let's set a variable and create a holder for that image that we've got within our h tim L so that

03:51.760 --> 03:55.320
we can grab that particular image.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.700
And here we're going to do.

03:58.920 --> 04:11.400
So do my image and this is Document get element by ID and it was my image the idea was my image.

04:11.400 --> 04:17.660
So grab that value and the next line we can set our source.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.260
So that's my image and source.

04:21.270 --> 04:24.500
And then we need to specify the source for the images.

04:24.660 --> 04:29.870
So we're going to use the placeholder dot com as well.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.920
It's the same thing that we did last time and then we'll just adjust some of the parameters so we know

04:34.920 --> 04:43.740
that we've got a parameter here for collar's so we can take the array this array

04:47.090 --> 04:50.890
and we'll use whatever value is in Image place.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.610
And this is turning up fairly long.

04:55.610 --> 05:02.420
But next we need to do a slash so do a slash for the caller.

05:03.360 --> 05:07.720
And then lastly let's update that text on the image.

05:07.860 --> 05:15.750
So we'll have it equal to image and then I'll make the last value dynamic as well.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.920
So this is going to be whatever the value of image is image.

05:19.930 --> 05:23.340
Place index's.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.470
So let's refresh the page and we'll try it out.

05:26.730 --> 05:34.230
So notice that we don't have an image set yet so we can open up our console and that that function was

05:34.230 --> 05:35.230
swapped image.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.420
So when we do that we see that we can create our image.

05:38.670 --> 05:45.150
And again if we do it again we change to the next image and next image and next image.

05:45.240 --> 05:50.660
So we know that the next step is to fire off that particular function.

05:51.120 --> 05:58.970
So what we need is another function that can continuously loop and fire that off.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.770
So we saw earlier where we had a timeout interval.

06:02.940 --> 06:09.870
But this time let's have another interval that we're going to use and this one is going to set a constant

06:09.900 --> 06:13.200
interval so this interval will constantly keep firing off.

06:13.380 --> 06:16.800
And this is exactly what we need for images.

06:16.800 --> 06:22.760
So we don't want it just to fire off one time and stop we want it to fire off over and over again.

06:26.300 --> 06:35.480
So I'm just wrapping it in a function to start image and then within here we're using the built in method.

06:35.480 --> 06:42.140
So this is set interval and basically it calls a function or executes a code snippet repeatedly with

06:42.140 --> 06:44.690
a fixed time delay between each call.

06:44.900 --> 06:51.920
So it works very similar to the other interval that we saw earlier where all we need to do is specify

06:52.370 --> 06:54.520
a function that we want to fire off.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.050
And then how often we want to fire it off.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.850
And again in milliseconds.

06:58.970 --> 07:03.950
So every two thousand milliseconds will be every two seconds.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.930
So let's try this out.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.360
And we're still going to be missing.

07:07.370 --> 07:08.830
One other thing.

07:08.840 --> 07:19.010
So let's let's fire off star image and now that we fire this off we see that now we're getting images

07:19.610 --> 07:23.370
and it's firing off it's alternating every two seconds.

07:23.600 --> 07:31.400
So the last thing that we need is we need a way whenever the page loads that we fire off start image

07:31.720 --> 07:34.840
to get this image carousel started.

07:34.850 --> 07:42.050
So what I want you to do now pause the video and write that into the script and we have looked at this

07:42.050 --> 07:49.040
before that there's a number of ways that whenever the page whenever the body loads or the window loads

07:49.130 --> 07:54.770
that we can fire off a function so show you the solution coming up.

07:55.720 --> 08:01.180
So you get an opportunity to review what we looked at before and there was a number of ways so we could

08:01.180 --> 08:05.340
do the window on load or we could do the onload attribute.

08:05.440 --> 08:12.730
So I was going to do the onload attribute within here and it's simply as simply just grabbing this function

08:13.000 --> 08:19.300
so that whenever the page loads that we just fire off the start image and we saw how that was working

08:19.360 --> 08:20.050
earlier.

08:20.200 --> 08:25.390
And there's actually one thing here that I've noticed that is still going wrong is that we've got Image

08:25.450 --> 08:31.780
undefined because what's happened is our image place has run out of images.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.500
So that's why that is happening.

08:33.670 --> 08:39.190
So I want you to do now is pause the video and come up with a solution for that.

08:39.340 --> 08:44.620
So we know that we've run the course we've run through all these images and we know that arrays have

08:44.680 --> 08:45.560
a length.

08:45.730 --> 08:52.630
So we can grab that length and if our images have passed the length that we've got to reset this back

08:52.630 --> 08:54.120
to zero.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.400
So try that out and I'll show you the solution for that.

08:58.410 --> 09:01.500
So the solution for that is a conditional statement.

09:01.620 --> 09:07.650
So whenever we need any piece of logic applied we always turn to conditional statements and this is

09:07.650 --> 09:09.600
where we can ask that question.

09:09.720 --> 09:22.350
If this value has actually exceeded the length of our images array then we know that we've got to stop

09:22.350 --> 09:24.320
this and we've got to reset it.

09:24.540 --> 09:29.450
So if that has happened then all we have to do is reset it back to zero.

09:30.340 --> 09:36.690
And I to swap this out to be one second go back refreshed the page.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.290
So now we see we've got it triggered.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.400
We started it.

09:39.400 --> 09:45.090
We've gone through and we're hitting 7 and we're going to undefined and 1.

09:45.250 --> 09:52.030
So we're still running into a problem here that this is still running too long so we need to update

09:52.030 --> 09:53.560
it with the equal sign.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.570
And that way we know we're only going to run till 7.

09:56.650 --> 10:02.070
So there's one other thing that also we should update and take care of.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.020
So do you know what that is going to be.

10:05.040 --> 10:10.840
I notice that whenever we trigger and we start the image we don't have a default image loaded in there.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.780
So there's a number of options that can take care of that.

10:13.780 --> 10:20.590
So what I want you to do again is pause the video and come up with a solution how we can have a default

10:20.650 --> 10:22.080
image on the start.

10:22.210 --> 10:25.880
So notice that it's completely blank and then it goes to three four.

10:25.930 --> 10:30.800
So wait stop one second before it actually loads the image.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.070
So go ahead and try it out.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.110
And I'm going to show you the solution coming up as well.

10:36.350 --> 10:39.850
So the solution to this is a number of ways to go about it.

10:39.860 --> 10:43.250
We could trigger this function right away.

10:43.370 --> 10:48.190
So without having to wait the Millis the 100 milliseconds we could trigger it.

10:48.200 --> 10:55.210
So we could do something like this and go out and refresh the page.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.710
So what happens when we refresh the page.

10:57.710 --> 10:59.450
I know it's going pretty quickly.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.730
So we're actually starting at image too.

11:01.760 --> 11:08.900
So that is a solution but it's not ideal because we're incrementing the value so we could also start

11:08.970 --> 11:12.720
with the default value of place image to negative 1 if we wanted.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.160
So that would take care of this as well.

11:15.240 --> 11:21.380
There's a number of ways to do this to get it to start but in each one or if we wanted to we could just

11:21.380 --> 11:28.180
simply update the value here with some of the default values that we have.

11:28.430 --> 11:35.630
So that is another option that we could do that we could simply do this and just make it clean it up

11:35.630 --> 11:42.820
a little bit and we could refresh it and then get rid of the swap image there because that's adding

11:42.880 --> 11:44.550
one to that image.

11:44.560 --> 11:52.570
So the ideal way is probably just to set that value here and that way we're starting at Image number

11:52.570 --> 11:53.710
one.

11:53.710 --> 12:02.230
So there's a number of solutions to that one and we can see that now it's starting at number one.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.040
So what I want you to do now is to try this out for yourself build out some images.

12:07.110 --> 12:13.160
You can get rid of the placeholder dot com and out and some real images and make that update to the

12:13.160 --> 12:16.660
source code with actual real images not using placeholders.

12:16.690 --> 12:16.920
Con.
