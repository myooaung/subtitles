00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.830
So let's create a one more method to delete

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.580
the information from the collection of the list.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.150
So first thing, we're going to perform delete operation, right?

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.090
So you need to use the delete mapping.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.035
And you have to provide some proper URLs.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.225
So I'm going to use the employees again, employees.

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:25.220
And then I'm gonna create another return.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.825
So it's the delete operation.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:30.230
And then I'm going to pass the Employee ID here.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.755
So it's the daily mapping math dot.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:43.130
So public, delete employee.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.395
So the employee will have some in Dasa input which is nothing but employee ID.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.450
But as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.999
you have to annotate your input as a path variable.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.240
So which means my neighborhood path variable.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.155
It's trying to read the input from the URL path.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:05.540
And the next thing which we need to do,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.610
we have to call the employee service metadata service

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.305
which contented delete matter, right?

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:20.465
So employee EMP is a quote service dot delete employee.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:24.005
Of course the mother will not available because we have to create now.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.810
So EMP ID.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.705
So let's create the method.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:34.865
And here let's try to remote.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:37.520
We are, we are working with the hardcore data, right?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.400
So we need to daily D,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.245
Employee ID which is passed to year.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.650
We have the Riemann, that particular object from the list.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.990
So list dot I don't return on,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.270
say employee I did over here and I'm going to use a while loop here.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.665
So I'm going to check,

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.870
we all know how to extract be.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.660
I mean, use the AI during the while loop, right?

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.310
So here, hydrated dot

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.915
next employee and it's going to be implemented.

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:29.180
So if and then they employ various you're done.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.870
We need to check the input which is originally sued.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.405
For that matter, employee ID,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:42.395
which is equal to our employee ID from our collection.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:51.560
So which means all you need to do is we remove the employee from the collection, right?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.120
So how are we going do that? Simple thing.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.820
So I iterator dot remote and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.525
then return the employee.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:17.819
Or else we're going to return. Return.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.590
Okay, so now everything in place,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.420
let's go back to the controller.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.780
So we received, we call that LED employee here and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.335
it gives you the employee back the data did employee.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.380
And then other thing which we need to do.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.450
Okay, So how we are deleting it,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.950
so we are diluting the employee and returning it. Okay.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.155
So next thing, what if the employee is not available?

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:49.580
That is it possible to read?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.460
So can simply copy paste this code, right?

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.975
But that's anyway, we have a global exception handler.

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:03.140
So whenever the employer not for the exception triggered,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.480
it automatically gives you this response back.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.485
Great.

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:15.095
So it's say we don't have time and let's restart your server once.

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:17.060
And then we'll go back and create,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.230
really try to delete some of the existing employees.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.810
The application is getting started now.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.480
So Tamika distraught at the port number 800 81.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.580
Now let's go back to our postman.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.260
I'll trigger a request.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.304
So let's go back to the post man.

00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:40.850
And let's try to call the first mountain,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.410
which we'll ignore all the employees.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.820
So we have 1, 2, 3 4,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.140
1, 3 5, 1 2, 3, 6.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.195
Let's try to remove 1234.

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:49.070
So I'm going to create a new request here.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.210
So let's copy this.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.850
Copy this Control C. Let's create a new request and it is going to be a delete method.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:08.510
And here, then I use the delete and then what is the Ideally at time 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.060
Okay, so now everything is in place.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.569
All we need to do is just try AND a request.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.480
Do you want to happen? It is 200.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.015
Ok. Which means the employee remote successfully.

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:22.460
Let's go back and call the all employment.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.990
That's when we trigger now,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.785
we should be getting only two implies because one of the month, day later.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:31.360
See, we've got only two. Okay. Guess what?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.270
What'll happen if you're trying to delete something which is not existing.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.625
So under 355, I think we can try for asset because we just wanted to write.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.485
So let me click Send again.

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.030
See what I've been employing.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.910
Not fun because we have the exception handling in place.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.520
So whenever this exception triggered automatically,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.100
every Global Exception Handler will take care of it.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.330
Okay, thank you.
