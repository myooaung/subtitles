00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.425
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome back.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.630
So we have everything in place.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.970
We created our entity for employee at the same time,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.655
bigger than entity for IT, department asset.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:12.360
So next thing, we need to start implementing them at times.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.560
So we have him Blake,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.660
until it has a multiple mentors in it, right?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.595
So we're going to replicate the same method.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:20.280
But only thing is you're not going to use him play D,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.900
which is a hard-coded information.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.655
We're going to use a Realtime Database.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.725
But before we are proceeding further,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.210
Let's go back the bomb at eczema.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.775
Let's comment out this security dependency here.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:32.655
And you know, the reason why we are coming down into security

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:37.335
because if I'm not commenting out the security every day might under service,

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.410
I have to provide the username and password information.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.160
So we have common toward the dependency from home.html.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.230
At the same time we come into the username, password,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.855
IND, application, and property as well.

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:52.880
So let's go back to our controller here.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.575
Okay, So here's the deal.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.240
We have imply continuity.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.365
We don't want to touch it,

00:00:57.365 --> 00:00:59.090
okay, if it doesn't exit implementation.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.410
So instead, we're going to create a new controller and we'll create the same at.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.850
That's what interests are obese.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.709
We're going to use the repository.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.095
So let's create a new class here.

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:15.900
Maybe we can call them as an employee at APL controller.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.130
Okay, So before that,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.440
let's go to the database and see what are data is available.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.210
Let's searching data.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.160
And an employee we have 1, 2,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.860
3, 4 different employees here.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.120
Okay, so first thing,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.040
let's try to fetch all the information.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.730
First thing, the moment you create a controller,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.340
we need to annotate with the rest controller.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.870
That's the first thing which we need to do.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.380
So next, let's go back to our motto.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.170
So first thing we need, get all employees.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.650
Good.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.865
So let's copy this method.

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.280
Let's go back and paste it here.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.830
Okay, so now we have a method here.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.820
So this a mother which I'm gonna call now for now I'm going to make it as another here.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.310
Okay, so how we are going to get the data?

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.155
We need to have the repository in the first place for a fall employees and entity.

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:08.180
So if you wanted to get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.555
the information or perform some database operation to the employee,

00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:15.035
we need to have the repository because we don't want to use the entity manager.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.120
We're gonna use JPA repository.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.305
So the first thing what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a new class,

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:24.680
a new interface here called a nasa employee repository.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.925
Employee repository.

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:37.580
Okay, so here we're going to extend the JPA repository and we need to grow it.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.220
What other entity I'm going to use it here,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.390
dy, and today I'm going to use here,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.890
it's going to be employee.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.575
And the primary key is going to be along here.

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:53.070
And most important thing you need to annotate with the repository.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.440
Okay, so now we have employed repository.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.965
All we need to do, just create instant for that and a lot of map it.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.765
So here what I'm gonna do here,

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:11.555
we're going to create employee repository, EMP repository. Okay?

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:14.490
So we need to auto wire did.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.940
Okay, So that's good.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.470
So next thing, we need to use the employer repository and get the inflammation.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.480
Since this employer Repository extends

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.940
the JPA repository and we provided the employee entity as an input.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.030
So it will give all the information which we required.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.575
So the first thing we're gonna do,

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:36.480
employ a frustrated dot.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.065
Find all my thoughts.

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:42.365
So if you take a look at the final amount that it will give you a list of employees.

00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:44.285
That's what we are requiring, right?

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:47.060
Okay, So here let's modify the URL as well.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.170
So JPA slash implies,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.079
so the moment I provide api slash employees,

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.450
it has to fetch the information from my real-time database, right?

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.434
So let's start your application.

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:03.665
We might end up with some issues.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:10.680
Let's see what is the issue? Obligations getting started.
