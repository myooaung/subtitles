00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's start the development.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.040
So the first thing we need to create

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.770
the proper deduce we're going to deal with the employees, right?

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.750
So the first thing we need the models,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.429
or we can call them, I suppose.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.880
So what I'm gonna do, the first image you're going to do was create a Java file,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.300
which is a maybe first thing we let's create a package.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.680
So package.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.960
So I can call them as a model.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.425
So under the model, what we can do is we can create a Java file,

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.930
and this is going to be employee dot Java.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.050
So which contains some information about the employee.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.625
Let's ask some basic information.

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:40.775
So private and N2 generated are going to be employee ID.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:50.644
And then it sounds something like private string name.

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:56.130
And then write rate.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.595
Spring, and maybe we can have an email here.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.115
And the next thing which we need to do,

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:09.620
just create the constructor in correct on.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.140
And then we need to have the,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.170
sorry went into how the status and headers.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.460
So that is important.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.180
So let's create getters and setters for all of them. And click OK.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.265
So now we have the employee,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.440
which contains the employee information.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.520
But the next thing which we need,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.740
we need the DA whew, right?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.295
So we all know the purpose of employee D or whatever the DAO,

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:35.540
it will provide the information to the controller.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.640
So go over is calling that particular method.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.370
They will give you some information to the APIs.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.009
The next thing which we don't do, let's create the controller.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.010
And the controller must be under some different directory.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.810
So I'm going to create a new package here,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.240
and I'm going to call the message surveys,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.060
or you can call them as controlled as well.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.640
So under the service, I'm going to create our main controller.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.405
And the control is nothing but controller is the one which will handle the,

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:01.715
all the rest API methods.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.480
So make all the master employee controller,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.135
right? Imply a controller.

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:11.780
Okay, so now, so we have the imply a controller.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.190
So what are we trying to do?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.060
We're trying to create the implant mother,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.845
unable and post mothers and everything, right?

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.540
The first thing we need to understand it well,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.995
one of them, it does we want to create.

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:27.115
All right, so let's start with a simple one.

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:29.080
Retrieve all the employee information.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.120
But for now, we don't have any employee information.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.730
So first thing which we need to do is we need to go back to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.145
our employee DO and create some methods to provide the data.

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:43.880
So I'm going to model and create employee ID over here.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.785
Employee Diego in.

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:51.520
So here I'm going to implement a few things here.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.980
So I'm going to create a static and I have

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.610
a list of employees.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.565
Okay?

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:16.700
So next thing which we need to do is write some static information correctly.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.605
So whenever somebody is calling the list,

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.455
list must contain some information so that they can process.

00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:24.395
So I'm going to create some hard-coded data here.

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:27.740
So let me great, no hard-code it and then we'll resume back.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.595
So I just created some static data here.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:37.280
So then we have to create some thoughts which will return the list of all employees.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.700
So I'm going to write it down,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.670
write a method which will return employee and staff

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.035
employees and then autonomies get all employees.

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:49.955
So all we need to do,

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:53.345
just simply return the list here.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:57.335
Okay? So this is a method which we're gonna call from our controller.

00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:58.535
Even you might ask,

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:00.800
we can do the same thing in the contour as well.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.610
Yes, you can.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.395
Anyway, it's again, it's going to be job of it,

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:05.825
but keeping things segregated,

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:09.560
which will make everyone to understand the code in a much better way.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.230
So let's go back to imply controller and here,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.850
so this is our employee controller, right?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.030
So we need to tell the spring application that this particular class is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.660
going to be a controller class.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.700
So you need to annotate with the rest controller.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.610
The first thing is then the next thing we're gonna do.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.940
I want to create our rest API method,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.355
which we'll add in all the employees, right?

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:36.815
So what I'm gonna do is,

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.155
and it's going to get mapping math.pi.

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:42.950
So you need to use the annotation get mapping.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.130
So when, whenever someone trying to access this

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.560
particular why employees, and now what'll happen?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.595
The method gets invoked dilemma that I'm going to right click.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:05:06.570
And it's going to be a list of employees and get all.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.290
So here's how we want to get the information from the employee deal,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.655
how to create object.

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:17.990
And then we need to use the object instance to call D miter, right?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.190
But what we're gonna do,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.799
we're gonna use the auto y add functionality,

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:24.320
which will automatically helps me create

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.010
the object and it will readily available when we are trying to use it.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.799
So employee Diego, and it's going to be a service.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.050
Okay, so here what I can simply do is I'm gonna return,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.565
return and my surgeries,

00:05:43.565 --> 00:05:48.635
which contains some methods and I'm going to call get all employees.

00:05:48.635 --> 00:05:52.080
So now we all done.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.915
So we have our first get a payment.

00:05:56.915 --> 00:06:00.125
I mean SGP method which will return all the employees.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.405
So now the next thing which we need to do,

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:07.890
we have to download the postman and we'll ptsd a METAR.
