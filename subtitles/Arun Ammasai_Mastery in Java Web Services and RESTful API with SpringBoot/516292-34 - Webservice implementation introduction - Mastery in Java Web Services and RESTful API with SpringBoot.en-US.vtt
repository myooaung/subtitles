00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:04.230
So we created a soap web services, right?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.855
But the one thing, this is our wisdom, right?

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:08.490
So anyone can access my visit.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.715
We'll write that is no security deposit.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:18.780
So we cannot create any web services in such a way because there is no security on it.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.540
Anybody can access, anybody can go to this,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.105
this gel and they going to access my method.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.775
For example, I'm going to access get all employees.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.690
I'm just going to click Okay.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.695
See, I got the response.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.370
But we need to have someone in the middle,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.080
too wild it all over request,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.490
whether it's a valid request,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.695
valid request in the sense where the request is coming from a valid user.

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:45.710
So if it is a valid, is it then only our side?

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.680
We supposed to allow the person to access our methods.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.455
So that is what all about the Spring Security?

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:59.105
So we're going to implement this spring security on top of our Web Services.

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:01.640
The, okay, so let's go back to our intelligent ID here.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.624
Let's take notes. So let's apply security.

00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:09.420
So what do we need in the first place we need interceptor.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.300
So you must be able to understand what is the interceptor,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.620
that it's a request coming before even execute the request

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.165
will intercept the request and we'll validate whether it is coming from the valid user.

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:24.350
If it is a valid user,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.840
then we're allowing their equals two plus state.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.570
So that is where the intercept that comes into place.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.740
So for the interceptor,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:41.640
we're going to use the XW security and intercept are so x ws security and perceptron.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.850
Okay, so once you have the XW security interceptor,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.180
you how to us in few things inside your security insert interceptor.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.330
The first thing, how your web service will react,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.460
which means that the callback.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.790
So once somebody is calling your web service,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.830
it'll go to your security interceptor.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.970
It will validate the header information like our authentication information.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.960
It's like username and password is existing if it is exiting into the valid,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.705
whether it is matching with our security policy.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:19.550
If it matches, then it will return a true or it will block the user.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.040
Okay, so that is where we need to have the call

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.845
back so we can call them as a callback handler.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.635
And then every security has to follow them.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:30.620
Policy configuration, we'll have a lot of different kind of policy,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.790
but we are going to follow the basic policy, the security policy.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.260
So I'll have the XML.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.290
We can use it in the resource that will create XML file under

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.325
our resource folder called SS security policy dot XML.

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:46.790
So whenever the security interceptor is initiated,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.335
that will go to the security policy and Italy use the validations from over there.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:55.100
And then, so once we have the callback,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.960
we need to say the security policy and security policy as part of call.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.210
But what are the important things which are taken care,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.040
we need to set the username and password using.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920
Maybe I'm not going to retrieve anything from the DB,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.180
so I'm going to use the simple one.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.040
So I'm in the very basic one.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.370
So I'm gonna make yourself simple password validation callback.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.005
Simple.

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.830
Boss will add validation.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.240
That is a class called a simple password validation callback handler.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.085
So we're going to use that one.

00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:35.650
So these are the important things which we need to know.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.470
But if you add all of them,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.670
It's not done yet.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.300
So we have the interceptor which contains the call back under security policy,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.820
and we need to add our interceptor into

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.155
an existing intercepts because spring always trends with its own interceptors.

00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:52.000
So we need to add

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:02.179
our interceptor to existing interceptor.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.650
So, so how do you get the existing intercept pair?

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.170
So we have a class called W security or after.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.790
So we can extend the particular security class and then we can override

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.370
the mother because the method in that class we are going to

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.460
extend our web server is configured adapter,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.280
which contains the method called interceptor.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.015
So and that particular method contains a different kind of list of interceptor.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:30.050
In that particular list we're going to add our own interceptor. That's all.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.540
Okay, so let's start implementing that to say

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.450
your dipolar security implementation in the next video.
