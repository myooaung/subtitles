00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.275
Hello everyone, welcome to this course.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:11.745
In this course, we are going to create web services using Java.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.120
So there are two important things we're going to cover in this entire course.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
The first one is create a soap web service using a spring.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.695
And then we're going to create a rest API is using

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.130
a springboard that had different kinds of web services.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.265
And we'll talk about in detail in the upcoming lectures.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.890
And what is it we're going to cover in this particular course.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.800
We will talk about what is a spring and the details about the Spring framework.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.450
And why do we need a spring in the first place?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.325
And not only talking about why do we need a spring,

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:47.390
we're going to talk about some examples as well to x squared y spring

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.220
is much necessary for a devil as citizen development.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.450
And the only example we are going to use the new Java eight futures, which means we are,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.700
we might use a Lambda expression,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.960
we will use the streams,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.670
will use functional interfaces,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.465
and we might use some parallel streams as well.

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:10.280
So just be ready for it.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.815
So the two things important.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:16.070
So first thing, we're going to create a soap service.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.860
And the second thing is we're gonna create a rest API.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.625
The slopes, that is we are going to use a spring and the rest API,

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.815
we are going to use the springboard.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.375
And not only that,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.540
we're going to cover the exam mls.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.140
So ODE is an XML and we'll talk about XSD schemas.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.900
What is existing schemas and why do we need them?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.615
And we'll talk about the jacks big glasses.

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.210
So what is the purpose of the x-ray glasses?

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.855
And we'll talk about each and every one of them.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.170
So let's jump into the next lecture.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.780
We'll start exploring what is a spring.
