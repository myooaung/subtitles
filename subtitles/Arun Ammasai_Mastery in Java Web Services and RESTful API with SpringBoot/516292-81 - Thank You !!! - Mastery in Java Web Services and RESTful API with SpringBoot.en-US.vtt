00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.324
Hello everyone, Welcome back. Awesome.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.490
We complete a discourse, right?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.085
So first of all, a big thanks to each and every one of you to choose in this course.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.670
Okay, so indeed, we did learn a lot from

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.085
this particular course about soap web services and a restful web services.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.640
So now it's time for us to develop our own application,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.040
to put all of our learnings into it.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.415
So start design and Dojo developments.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:39.550
That is the first thing which we need to do whenever we learn something new.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.425
And all the course materials as available in

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.875
GitHub and the links will be shared in the resources section.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.660
And once again, I wanted to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.815
congratulate each and every one of you to complete in this particular course.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:56.945
And I know that you guys have worked very hard to complete this course and well-done.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.105

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.695

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:08.645
And thanks again. I look forward to possibility collaborate someday.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:10.160

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.060
