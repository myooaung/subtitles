00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.900
So we use our entity manager to insert our data, right?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.750
And let's try the IGP repository as well.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.060
Jpa repository is a different kind of version.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.070
Maybe it's not a different kind of version,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.870
it's a different approach actually.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.109
So even though you're using JPA repository also,

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.549
as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:23.460
JPA repository internally uses the entity manager.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.545
So basically what your repository saying,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:27.180
I will communicate to the entity manager,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.575
I will take it off everything.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.840
I will take it off the transaction and storing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240
the information between information. I'll take care of it.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.610
All you need to do is just implement or extend my GP repository.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.550
That's all. So let's go back and create our own another matter.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.370
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create the same kind of method,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.230
but simple, different one.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.500
So here, instead of saves water and I'm going to use something like

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
perceives student, persist student.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.115
I'm going to keep the same name as my method name aswell.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:00:59.990
And pretty much everything is same,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.045
but one implementation is gone unchanged.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:03.635
So now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:07.490
I need to have the user repository as an interface.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.660
Okay, so I'm going to create a new interface here.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.640
Or let's go back to the project.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.785
And here we have a model under the model.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.290
So we have stored and D. Okay,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.880
so here I'm going to create a new,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.890
okay, so I'll create a new class here.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.395
I'm going to call them as student.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:33.240
Okay? Its interface student repository.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.980
It's a student repository.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.780
Okay, so let's create that.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.520
And it is going to be extends our JPA repository.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.765
So JPA repository, which will accepts two input first,

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.025
what is the entity?

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:55.205
So are individually we're going to use is going to be a student.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.705
And what is the primary key?

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:59.990
Primary key is our long, that's all.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.860
And this is a positive because as I mentioned earlier,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.555
it is communicated the database of your Obviously, it's a repository.

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:10.610
That's what we did in the previous examples as well,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.950
like what we need to store it into you.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.975
So here we did the repository,

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:20.780
but here you don't need to use the transactional because the JPA repository,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.400
it'll taken care of it.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.190
So now let's go back to our student controller here.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.425
And I'm going to create one more intense here like at auto wired.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:37.100
And this time it's going to be student repository.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.185
And I'm going to call them. I said repo.

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:42.470
So I'm going to perform the same operation first time I'm using the DAO,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.850
which is the entity manager.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.334
Second one, I'm using the student repository which extends the JPA repository.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:53.510
So all I need to do is just copy this and paste it here.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.780
And here. You don't need because this seems set mother,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.610
which we created manually.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.345
Okay, but when you're using the repository,

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:06.440
they have their own methods all we need to just make use of them. That's all.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.135
So we're going to use the same method which accepts a entity.

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:12.710
So now we know what to do,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.540
right, let's rewrite our application.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.260
Application is getting started.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.059
Okay, So it is data.

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.250
So now, what do we need to do?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.754
Let's go back to our postman.

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:40.555
And this is the first one, right?

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:42.565
So either it's click a saint.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.365
Yes, it is created.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:45.835
So now all we need to do,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:51.100
we need to use the let me copy it from the method itself.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.515
So perceives to student, right?

00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:57.760
But input is going to be the same student and name

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.520
I'm going to modify as John and the age is going to be 28.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.575
So I'm going to click Send again.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:07.480
Okay, so 200 success.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.425
So which means I have created two different Students, right?

00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:20.315
So all we need to just go back to our crew and refresh our database.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:23.250
And we'll see what happens now.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.575
Say now, let's try to use it. Test Connection again.

00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:31.550
Again, it will throw some air because every time when you stop the server,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.620
it will create a new database.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.780
So to find out where it is, I mean,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.430
what is the database name and only you need to go to

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.840
the console here and here it is showing.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.990
So this is where your hashtag console and database.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.410
Let's copy this just in case if you want,

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.105
if you don't want this to be happened,

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:52.310
I cannot keep change my database name.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.970
You can hard-coded in the obligate unprompted.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.410
I'll show you how to do that.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.215
So Test Connection, Connection successful,

00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:01.460
and let's click Connect.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.390
And here, let's go to the student and run it again.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.265
See how many students are here.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.140
There are two different codons because one

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.310
used by entity manager and another one is using the repository.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.150
Okay, the next thing, I don't want to keep on changing the database all the time.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.820
So I wanted something static.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.245
I can't keep change that.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.990
So what you can do is you can simply provide

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.860
that default database information in your application that properties so far.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.200
Now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do that.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.405
Go to your application at properties.

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:35.510
And you're going to provide this information,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.075
data source URL and driver class and the username ND database platform.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.150
So let's start page whatever application,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.180
but we'll talk about in the next video.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.820
What are the other methods which we can make use of it

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.700
using the repository we just tried only the save, right?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.250
And it has some additional methods

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.680
which we can make use of it we'll talk about in the next video.
