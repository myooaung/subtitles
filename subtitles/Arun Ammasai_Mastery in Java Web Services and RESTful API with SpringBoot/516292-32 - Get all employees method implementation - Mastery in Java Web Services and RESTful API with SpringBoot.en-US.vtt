00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.195
Let's move on to the next method.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's go and have a look at the employed xs

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.660
d. So here we have our get all employee, our request.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.690
So now we need to process this one and also remove all employees.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.980
For now, we're going to process and get all employee requests.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.675
So let's go back to the notes we'll try.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:26.620
So we need to write a method which will accept employee request as an input and return.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.485
Good employee response as an outcome.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.555
So this is the signature for the metadata.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.310
Let's go to the endpoint configuration.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.900
Let's write the method here.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.755
So first thing, it's a B,

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:41.420
it's a payload matter, right?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.915
For now let's define a method and then we can add the, the payload informations.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:47.705
So public.

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.540
And the response which I'm expecting from

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.510
this particular method get all employee response.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.490
And here get all employees,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:09.605
all employees, which will accept the request of get all employee request.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:11.960
So if you take a look at the RAM,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.325
Player equity does not have any any specific parameter and may be specific,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.965
valid in it like a employee ID, employee name.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:21.620
It's just a in a request object.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.530
So you don't have to pass anything in saying that request.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.685
So now we've got all the employee details here and I mean,

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.190
the method signature and then what do we need to do?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.375
They have to return, right?

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.280
So for now I'm going to return nothing.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.745
So it just return null just to remove the complete an issue.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.035
So the next thing, what do we need?

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.360
Do we have an employee services, right?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.680
So in this RVs matter,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.900
we have to write a new murder to fetch all the employees, right?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.740
So what we can do. So I have to write a method, okay,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.170
so what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna use the service.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.060
Instead of service.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.420
Services don't get all.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.015
So I get all employees.

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:03.350
So get all employees.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.810
And since the mother is not available,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.479
so all employees in the method is not available.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.835
We will get an a compilation issues all we need to do,

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:12.665
just create a method.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:19.730
And this method must return a list of employees, right?

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.640
And this is the signature which you're looking

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.775
from this particular method has to return a list of employees, right?

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:29.075
And return, what do I need to do?

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:30.290
We have the list of employees you have,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.725
you don't write any specific logic because we already have the list of employees.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:37.670
All we need to do, just return the employees here.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.220
Now let's go back door endpoint configuration where again, they get there.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.590
Let me create a variable for it.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.420
Okay, so list off all employees.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.340
And the next thing we need to do,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.180
we have to map the data into a good employer as well?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.070
Because if you take a look at the get employed respond

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.245
to its content list of employee details.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:58.610
So now what happened?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.440
So we have a list of employee and we need to convert the employee to employee details,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.630
which is a response on guilt.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.130
So how we can do that?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.270
We already have a method for converting your employee as a employee detail, right?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.380
So all we need to do, just use the same method and make the changes.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.980
Okay. This method is accepting get employer sponsored visa,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.820
a specific for our first get employment that we can make a small change.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.710
We don't need to pass the employer response again.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.175
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna just pass the employee.

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.350
And then what I'm gonna do is,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.730
and here we have employee, right?

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.755
So I mean, the response,

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:41.270
all we need to do is respond to dot set employee details.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.320
Instead employed it is all you need to register called the employee.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.110
So this method is going to return employee details.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.659
So return employee details,

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.460
we're just making the changes on the fly.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.530
Written employee details, sorry.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.280
Okay.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.970
So whenever I want to convert I employee into employee data,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.115
all you need to do is just use the same method.

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:11.870
So here we have a list of employees,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.760
right? So what do we need to do?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.605
We have to call this method,

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:17.900
but this is a list and this is a single update.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.900
So all I need to do just I'd read d,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.840
all employees and then do the conversion.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.150
Okay, So how we can do that?

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.050
I'm going to use a streaming in Java 8 stream, right?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.625
So all employees, first thing we need to write a stream out of it, right?

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.085
And I'm going to use a map.

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.620
That's a map is a method which will accept

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.395
them one type of parameter to another type of parameters I'm passing.

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:50.649
Employee as an input. So employee,

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:53.710
so what I'm gonna do, I'm an employee object, right?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.385
So I need to pass employee object and I haven't written as an employee details.

00:04:57.385 --> 00:05:00.265
So I can make use of the map employee method here.

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.050
So in the map employee method,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.540
I can simply ball the employee object here.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.860
Or if you want, you can write

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.220
your own normal forage might that if you're not sure I want to Java,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.735
you can use a normal Java.

00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:12.850
And then once it is done,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.070
you need to collect the data as a list back.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.670
Collect us to list.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.770
So so now what happens?

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.650
So it will give you a list of employee details, correct.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.350
So dot w.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:40.770
So employee details, or you can call them as an all employee details.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.650
Okay, so now what do we need it to be addressed?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.955
Send the response back, right?

00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:48.020
So what is the response?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.160
Get all response.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.065
Maybe I can make it simple here.

00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:54.245
So here I'm just calling a method, right?

00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:55.775
Control-c.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:58.640
And here we have all employers rescinded of all ambulance.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.170
I can directly use the method call.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.760
So services.js, all employees.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.490
And then this will give you the list of emblazon.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.405
Then I can open a stream out of it so I can reduce one line of a code here.

00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:12.905
So maybe I can put it something like this so you can see it in a proper way.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:16.310
Okay, so the next thing, or I need to do,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.235
I need to send the response back, right?

00:06:19.235 --> 00:06:23.165
So here we have a get all employer is quantitates create object for that.

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.880
Employer response is a quarter.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.505
Response is equal to new employee response.

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.635
So now we have all employee details,

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:38.430
all we need to do, just add the response to it and then send it back.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.850
So, okay, we need to use,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.650
get employed a delta dot,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.660
add all and all math dot,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.660
and that's it. Okay, fine.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.600
So we're going to directly send us a response, right?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.190
Because it's a web methods,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.915
so you need to send us a jacks by element.

00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:02.780
So here introduce the checks were element.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.575
Sometimes it will not, it will work without Jack's filament asked well,

00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:08.790
to subdue the version that you're using, right?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:15.355
And then we need to talk about the request payload and the response payload.

00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:18.595
So again, in this method,

00:07:18.595 --> 00:07:20.830
the name is going to be the same,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.510
but the input requisites different.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.875
So what are the input ecosphere?

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:27.055
It is a good All employee request.

00:07:27.055 --> 00:07:29.350
So we're going to use that.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.560
So because your method will identify whether this particular method is called by with

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.820
this particular request and response payload because the into

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.395
clause is the data and we have to convert the data and then back as a response.

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:47.545
That's similar way we need to do that equals payload as well.

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:50.320
Because we already did that in our first method, right?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.155
So I'm just directly making a change request payload.

00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:59.390
And then we have to send S or Jack's elements so we cannot directly send.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:05.565
So new object factory,

00:08:05.565 --> 00:08:10.775
don't get all employer response.

00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:13.940
And then you need to pass the response on it.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.690
That's all.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.370
So now we have everything in place,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.295
all we need to do, just build it and run it.

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:21.605
So for now I'm going to stop the server.

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.210
And here you will have some error.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.560
Isn't the map employee,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.955
employee previously we send the response ND imply been funnel.

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:29.435
I'm not going to use the employee,

00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:32.285
so I can directly pass the employee alone here.

00:08:32.285 --> 00:08:35.520
We don't need this end response.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.069
Okay, So let's start the application.

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:41.390
It may take a few seconds,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.840
just wait for a few more seconds, and then we'll test it out.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.415
Let's bring starter. And this might be good.

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:54.155
Okay?

00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:57.905
Okay, the application start at the damn good observer started now.

00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:01.940
So let's go back to our browser and let's close the existing

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.365
one and let's stretch the hour is del ones and click the whistler.

00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:09.440
And here the method which you are trying to look for good employee already tried.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.610
Now we need to try and get all employees and get all in I mean, get all employed.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.650
Equity does not need any specific input.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.485
All you need to do, just click go.

00:09:18.485 --> 00:09:22.970
See what happened now, we got all the employee details.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.795
So the next method which we're going to try, delete an employee.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:31.730
So maybe you're going to give it a try and then you can continue the video anyway.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.770
In the next video, we're going to create a new method

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.515
for remove a specific employee from a list.

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.400
Thank you.
