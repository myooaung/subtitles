00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:03.450
So now what are you going to do?

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.890
So we have a simple exit day, right?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.645
So then the next thing,

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.240
so we need that data in the first place so we

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.330
can try to fetch some information from the data.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.510
So now we have the xs t. So using these exits t,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.745
we can create the jacks be classes, right?

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.590
So how we can create a Jack speak less,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.930
I don't want to create it separately.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.970
It has to create automatically.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.875
And there are multiple ways you can create the jacks week classes.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:36.045
The first one is you can directly click your employee exist DNE you can create,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:38.070
you can generate the XML documents or

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.360
you can create a Jack speak less of that Java classes.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.730
Or you can go to the Tools and you can even the same option

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.015
available here as well like tools,

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.190
and you can see an option here.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.250
So XML actions here we have multiple options, whether you're not decorator,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.280
DD, DTD file, our XML file,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.964
or you want to convert the XML into I XSD,

00:00:57.964 --> 00:00:59.420
say all the options available here,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.670
but I'm not gonna do that because whenever I make

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.370
a modification my XSD to have to happen automatically,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.260
I don't want to go back and see that.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.885
I want to go back and change the class again and again.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.470
So that is why we have another plugin which is available in spring,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.480
which will help us do automatically create the Java classes based on the exit state.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.200
So what we're gonna do, so let's go back to the POM file here.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.260
And we need to add a plugin in.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.220
And so, so here let's go down.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.680
And here we have a plug-ins, right?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.015
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna,

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:38.180
we're gonna try to add one more plug-in here.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.345
Okay, So that plugin is for now.

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:42.890
I don't want to type the entire thing,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.150
so I just already copied it.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.580
So you can just copy paste into or I'll give you the URL in the resources that you can

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.820
go and you can download the app or you can just copy the plugin snippet.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.830
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.480
I'm gonna same play-based,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.850
whatever the item we just provided here.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.625
So I'm going to add the plugin here,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.560
okay, just take a look at the plugin here.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.200
So this is a group ID and this

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.395
is the artifact ID and a version which you are going to use 1.6,

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.095
the most important thing, the configuration.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:17.995
Okay?

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:20.650
So if you take a look at the configuration just schema directory.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.380
So from that I need to find the excess defense.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.780
The existing file is available under the resources, right.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.590
So we have an employee to take this D under the Resources folder.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.030
And that is what is mentioned here,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.380
the project database directory,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.345
which is nothing but your root.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:36.415
Under the rudy, we have the SRC folder.

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:39.295
Under the SRC folder we have a main and then we have a resource.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.505
Instead the resource we have the dot XSD file.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:44.680
So that is why it's called a schema data tree.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.710
Xs d is nothing but it's a schema file.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.560
And then, so take the schema file and you need to generate the Java classes.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.210
So once you generate the Java where it needs to be placed,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.925
so you can keep all the Java files.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:05.060
Again, my root directory and SFC remain under the Java, which means here.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.255
Right? So now what we're gonna do,

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.100
we have a plugin added here.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.990
The next thing which we need to do,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.230
we need to update the map and dependencies, right?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.325
So right leg your employee management and go to my oven and try to reload our projects.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:27.139
If you're using Eclipse, it's like update your projects, update man properties.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.140
So so it's updated is done.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.580
So next thing which we need to do,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.520
we have to Rena maven clean install

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.540
ones to download all the JAR files from your repository.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.025
So what we can do is,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:43.145
so normally there are two things which you can do.

00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:44.900
We add at the plugin here,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.930
so which means it's all you'd have to automatically create the files here, right?

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.090
So first thing, let's start the application.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.850
One's just clear all.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.685
And I'm going to start the application once.

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:07.590
Save it. So that's bringing a starter now.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.465
Okay, the application started now.

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:16.505
So just go to your project and right-click and just give it a refresh.

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:18.410
And if you don't find it here,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.480
which means the project is God not refreshed

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.805
properly or the build is not happen properly.

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:26.405
This kind of problem will occur in Indonesia as well as the eclipse.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:29.570
So all you need to do once you've made any changes in the POM file,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.990
just open them Ivan properties and just ran the installed,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.300
which is inside is nothing but Emory and cleaning style,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.160
which will do a build again.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.660
So just started. It started. Now.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.615
It might take few minutes to download all the drivers again.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:50.850
Just wait for a few nanoseconds.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.880
Ok, so everything is done now the build is a success, right?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.130
So the next thing she has rightly or project,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.020
and I think we don't need a reward because the moment the build is success,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.430
the folder is automatically created.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.215
So com dot bytecode velocity,

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:20.675
and there we have four wriggle hace promise.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.615
Here we have a good employee requests, get employer response.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.250
And if you open a play requests,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.000
you should be able to see our employee ID,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.740
which is created in the existing.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.180
So this is the employer equal rights under the employee requests,

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.510
we have only employee ID,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.340
so that is what available in the request.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.550
So how you would employ response needs to be looks like your employer is

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.715
point must contain four fields, right?

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:47.300
So let's open to get employed as pons here see you can have employee ID,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.450
employee name, and a location and a zip code.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.270
So basically, if you're using that particular plugin,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.810
it automatically takes your x is free to create the Java classes. Okay?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.360
So in the next video we'll start implement,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.640
start writing the configurations like creating

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.190
endpoints and creating the configuration changes.
