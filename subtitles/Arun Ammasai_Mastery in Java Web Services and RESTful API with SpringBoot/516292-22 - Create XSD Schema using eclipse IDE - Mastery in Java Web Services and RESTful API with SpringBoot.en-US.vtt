00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.610
So this is a very simple XSD we created in the previous era, right?

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.190
And you might see that it's an error here because I just created

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.980
a complex type and I need to provide the implementation for it.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.410
So inside the employer requests,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.780
I had to provide what are the elements which are looking for.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.430
So anyway, we're not going to try that.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.450
So what I'm gonna do is if you have an eclipse in installing Node mission,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.500
it's much more easier or there are some additional IDs available to generate x is d,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.910
So you don't need to tell them softwares.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.800
So instead of installing some software,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.810
I'm going to use Eclipse.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.864
So opening my Eclipse and just create some simple Java projects.

00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:42.310
And I'm gonna name them as the excess degeneration.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.530
Okay, so here what I'm gonna do,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.265
I'm gonna create a new on there.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:53.470
And I'm going to create a XML schema file,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.675
which is nothing but it's an XSD file.

00:00:55.675 --> 00:01:00.895
So I'm going to name them as an employee, not XSD.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:05.590
So in Eclipse, it's much easier to create

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.790
the Xist is so instead of going to the source view,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.675
what you can do is you can go to the Design View.

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:18.685
So, so here you can create the elements.

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:20.350
So what I'm gonna do the first thing,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.345
I'm going to create a new element here.

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.660
So the element is going to be good.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.710
Employee, employee request.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.425
And by default it asking to a string,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:34.730
but it's not a string type.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.365
So I'm going to set the type as the new and it is going to be a good employee request.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:43.700
Got it.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.159
So now we have get employed equals created.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.485
So what are the elements that are available?

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.890
You need to add something like ID.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.335
So what I'm going to now I'm going to add element inside.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:02:00.890
So I'm going to call them as an employee ID.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.630
And this is going to be an integer type.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.040
So I'm going to double-click here and you can choose something like integer type.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.575
Okay, and save it and you can go back.

00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:13.690
And now we have the get employer aqueous,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.095
which contains the employer and the ID.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:18.790
So if you want to, if you go back to the source,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.740
so you should be able to see what we have done.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.545
So we created the good employee request.

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:26.095
Now let's go back to the intelligence, see what happened.

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.900
We did the same thing here, but here we did manually.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.580
And now another thing here we have a complex way forget employer request,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.795
and here we don't have anything,

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:37.840
but here we created one more element inside our good employee records.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.005
Here we have an employee ID which is an integer.

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:42.670
Okay, so now it's easy for query,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.730
easy to create an excess D&D exist is right.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.330
So the next thing we're gonna do is go back to the design version.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.840
So we have to formal structure for employer response as well, right?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.530
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna click a new element here.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.925
And this is going to be good employee and a response.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.130
And again, it's going to be a string.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.315
So we need to modify that to get employment as once a complex type, right?

00:03:08.315 --> 00:03:12.875
Get employee response.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:16.145
So employee response, we have a multiple types of

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:19.250
information in it like employee ID name, something like that.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.975
So I'm going to add few elements in it.

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:25.980
So first thing is going to be employee ID.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.960
Employee ID here.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.370
And that employee ID,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.050
we know that that is saying digiti bright,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:46.175
so it choose integer type and then insert element here after the employee ID.

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.580
So this is going to be employee name,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.260
and that's a string anyway.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.835
And add element.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:55.385
And for example, it's a little location,

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.765
again is going to be a string.

00:03:56.765 --> 00:04:00.275
And maybe we can add something like a zip code are pinned quote,

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:02.360
I'm going to add something like a zip code here,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.489
which is an integer.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.360
Okay, so now let's go back to the design view and take a look at it.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.530
We have the get employee request and we have the Get it employee response as well.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.285
So here you can see these are designed and when you go to the Source, see what happened.

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:21.650
You know, how they get employer requests.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.040
It's a complex type. So instead the complex like we have the employee ID.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.080
So we're going to use this employee ID to fetch the information from the response.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.854
So we are going to create some offline repository,

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:34.745
which means a hard-coded data.

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:38.180
So we'll create some random five or six employee information

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.740
and we can fetch the information

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.350
from that particular collection using

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.965
the which employed is passing to that particular collection.

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:48.140
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do, the,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.870
another thing, the names which we are using, It's a different here.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.860
So what I do is I'm going to cooperate this one.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.195
So we're going to use the same right,

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:02.780
Control C. And I'm going to keep the same namespace here until we end, until we,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.910
so this is the proper x is d. So now what I'm gonna do,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.115
just copy the entire thing

00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:12.725
and copy it and go back to our employee access to here and paste it.

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:15.380
Now, everything looks simpler.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.010
But if you're much, our x is two.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.060
You can directly create it.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.515
You don't have to go to any other ideas to create the x's day alone.

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:26.165
So now we have the XSD.

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:27.500
The next step, what we're gonna do.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.820
So using the XSD,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.340
we're going to talk about how we can create a jacks week classes.
