00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.825
When it comes to development,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.505
the first thing which will do,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:10.590
which ID we're going to choose that are notified is available in the market.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.155
But there are two important IDs,

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:14.565
which is very familiar.

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:17.835
The first one is going to be Eclipse,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.755
and the second one is IntelliJ.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.440
So it's up to you what choice,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.450
which ID you're going to choose.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.280
And I have seen lot of tutorials using Eclipse IDE.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.680
So what I'm planning to do is I'm going

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.935
to run through the entire course using the intelligent ID.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:38.240
But in the next video,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.055
I'll show you how to create a project,

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:41.780
a spring project using Eclipse.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.600
At the same time, I'll tell you how to configure

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.244
intelligent ID as well to configuring this spring projects.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:50.285
So just as I said,

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:56.435
which idea you want to try and install the ID and then we'll move onto the next video.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.020
Thank you.
