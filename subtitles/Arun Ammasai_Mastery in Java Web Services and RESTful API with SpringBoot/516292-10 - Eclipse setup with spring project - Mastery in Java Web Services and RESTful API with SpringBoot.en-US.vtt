00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's start with the Eclipse IDE.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.215
I just opened I Eclipse IDE workspace.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.465
The first thing which we need to do,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.420
just go and create a new project.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.100
The way we can create a new project,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.335
you can directly click New Project here or you can go to File and then New,

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.270
and then you can search for the project.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.345
And here it'll open up a wizard.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:26.475
We are, we can choose a different kind of a project,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.905
the one which we are looking for under the spring.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.890
So here we have a spring and the spring would,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.230
let's expand this spring and the spring.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.625
But here you can create a spring, a starter project.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.835
But when you're trying,

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.665
it might not be available for you.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:47.855
So which means you don't have the spring add on installing newer Eclipse ID.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.780
And if you're not able to see first install it,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.475
let me show you how we can do that.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.115
So go to Help. And there you can go for

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:59.030
Eclipse marketplace where you can find all the different add-ons.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.590
So once it launched,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.530
just stop the search and go and search for

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.495
the type spring and search for it might take a second.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:12.020
See now we've got a list of plug-ins here.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.500
The one which we need to install is a spring 23.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.395
It's a supportive plug-in for

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:22.235
Eclipse where we can create our how to create your projects.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:25.535
I mean, uh, spring project, it's already installed.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.320
If it is not installed in your machine,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.540
you can go ahead and click Install and restart our ID.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.640
Okay, so now we have everything in place.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.285
The next thing that you're going to do is just click Create a new project.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:39.860
It's not a Java project.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.390
Create a project.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
And we're going to search for springboard.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.940
And here we're going to create a spring, a standard project.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.800
So let's click Next.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.665
And, and just how I look at it here,

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:59.480
Service URL chose HTTPS, started springing Io.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.220
So which means in Zhao,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.884
when it comes to a spring,

00:02:02.884 --> 00:02:06.620
you can download the project from the direct repository service you are,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.140
which means the starter star dot spring that I owe.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.870
Or you can configure the add-on and you can

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.680
directly download the project anyway, Eclipse IDE itself.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.635
So let me show you how it can be done in the internet browser.

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:27.620
Let's copy the URL here and open your browser and go to the same URL.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.945
And here you can find

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:32.960
a different page here

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.140
where you can choose what kind of a project and what we're going to have a language,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.355
whether areas in Java code Lynne are groovy and what is the version you want to download?

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:46.430
And you can grow it some group name and the artifact ID and the project description.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.070
And you can choose which version you are going to use.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.350
You're going to use 16, 11, or eight.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.280
That's up to you.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.315
So normally, let's go with the eight version,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:57.830
okay, and then you can,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.845
when you click Generate, you know what happened,

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:05.660
it will download as a zip file which contains all the project files.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.965
Anyway, we're not going to use it.

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:08.675
In case if you want to use it, what you can do,

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.840
you can open the folder and you're going to extract

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.080
the demo dot zip and you can import the project in Eclipse.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.530
But for now we have the Add-on installed in our ID, right?

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.735
So we can go in and create a project over there.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:26.360
So the service you are a star data spring dot io and name is,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.360
let me give my first spring

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.465
up Spring application and I'm going to use Maven and I'm using Java 8 version.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:40.880
And you can provide any group names.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.905
So calm not I'm going to use bytecode velocity, which is my blog.

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:48.470
And then my first obligation.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.580
And if you want to change something,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.905
you can change it here or you can directly click Next.

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.585
So in the next screen,

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:58.880
you can choose what are the dependencies you wanted to add.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.840
But you might have thinking in the browser why I'm not able to see that.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.865
So let's go back to the eye here.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:08.120
And here. Here you see something called dependencies, right?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.580
So you can click Add Dependencies and you can add them.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.545
For example, if you want to add JP,

00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:17.420
you can search JPA to give you the JP here. You can add it here.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.510
Or if you want some other dependency like a spring web,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.570
search for web and it will give you all the results so we can

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.475
choose whatever the required dependencies which we needed.

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:31.250
So let's go back and here for now.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.810
I don't know anything.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.605
Since you, you, you, you should be able to see hash two is spring the spring,

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:40.745
Spring Web Services here because these are frequently used in my mission.

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.770
So for now, we're not gonna do anything.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.180
We just need the standard project.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.525
So I'm going to click Next and Finish.

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:50.630
So normally it will take just 10 to 20 seconds to download

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.140
the project and added a newer Project Explorer.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.185
Okay, so let's expand it and save it once.

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.600
So whenever you're pointing down odor,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.710
make sure you just update your project Mao and update which will download

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.760
all the JAR files in your from your mouth and

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.205
deposit into your local repository which is available in your local machine.

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:24.050
Got it. So now we have project are what we're gonna do.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.370
So you're not gonna make any changes,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.390
is just a sample, right?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.615
So here you have my first application dot Java.

00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:32.854
This is a launcher file which are annotated with a Spring Boot application.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:35.360
So the moment you can run the application,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.815
you can run the application.

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:40.370
You can select the project and you can run Nessa Spring Boot application

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.855
or you can right-click here and you can run S Spring Boot app.

00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:51.260
Anything is fine. So let's right-click the project and we can run as sorry redness.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.450
Spring would app.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.840
In the console, you should be able to see

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.470
the full details like that

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.740
this spring started or not and what is going on in the background,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.810
everything will be displayed in the console.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.295
So when I'm doing it the first time,

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:14.309
it might take a while just to patients.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.070
So we'll talk about in details in the upcoming sections.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.535
But up, but for now I'm just creating a simple project and I'm just showing you,

00:06:22.535 --> 00:06:27.395
see here, started my first spring application in just a 20 seconds.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:30.335
So now the application is up and running.

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:32.270
So if you want to test it out,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.840
we're going to add some HelloWorld here and you can just restart the server again.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.475
You should be able to see you or if you're sea salt here, let me do that.

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:42.170
So since we're here,

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.490
and I'm going to mention,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.860
so welcome to Spring application.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.190
So all I need to do is just stop

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.520
the server and just run it again. Right-click.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.160
Run this Spring Boot app.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:16.025
As I said earlier, it might take a few seconds, say start loading.

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:18.470
And so we got to consult loaded here,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.555
so everything is centered.

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:22.880
So once the application launch two,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.295
we should be able to see, Welcome to see.

00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:25.865
We got it.

00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:30.110
The server is up and running and now we should be able to see the outcome of it.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.450
Okay, so in the next video,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.460
we're going to use the intelliJ IDE to setup the spring project. Thank you.
