00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.815
Welcome back.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:05.550
So we just insert a simple employee, right?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.175
But we did not add any department do it.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.580
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna write a new method to only store

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.005
the department based on the employee ID.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.780
Okay, so let's create a new data here.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.720
I'm going to create a new employee her age and may let calm and sent.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.610
So today another input here.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.525
Okay. So minimum age.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:32.520
Okay, Let's consent.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.275
So now AJ is created.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:38.475
Let's go back to the database and validated data once in

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:45.380
a JS which is a employee 87 and we don't have any department for employee 87.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.775
Okay. So we don't have anything.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:47.975
So now what we're gonna do,

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:53.135
we're gonna insert at Department for this particular employee IDs 7.

00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.810
So let's go back to our individuality and it's open employer control.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.120
But before we start to imply controller,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.030
we're going to work with the department, right?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.900
So we did created a repository for employee,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.545
but we have to create the repository for department as well,

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.825
because this repository only for employee.

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.290
So let's create a new interface here.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.970
And it's going to be department repository.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.280
And again it's going to be extends our JPA repository and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.820
that this belongs to department and that primary keys along.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.625
And we need to annotate with the repository.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:38.525
That's the first thing.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.430
Okay, so now that is done.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.710
So let's go back to our imply repair controller.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.175
The first thing we need to do,

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:49.955
we have to introduce the auto wide here.

00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.405
This is for the new one.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:57.785
So department depository, department repository.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.765
So now let's go back and write a month.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.610
So let's copy the same method.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.290
We're going to make small changes in it.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.525
Until we end here,

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:15.245
I'm going to simply saying like add departments or departments.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:18.125
So here what I'm gonna do,

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm gonna pass two inputs here, okay,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.520
So one is for the searching

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.120
the employee ID and as they can on as input for my department.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.320
And the first value is going to be a path param and in path variable,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.935
which is going to be my employee ID.

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:37.880
And then a request body,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.310
which is going to be my department.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.145
The Department. Okay. Got it.

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:57.500
So then we add department and then we need to pass the employee EMP ID.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.030
So as our response,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.660
I'm going to send this as a in the head does.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.940
Okay, so now let's find out the employee.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.200
Now we have the employee ID.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.755
The first thing which we need to do is search and find the employee.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:14.075
So how we can do that employee dot find by ID.

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.055
And we have the input employee ID,

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:19.340
which will return a optional of employee,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.295
but we need to get the employee from the optional.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:23.855
So use the get method.

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:28.355
Now we have an employee and in case if we don't have the employee exist,

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.950
we need to send this response, right?

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.360
Like employee not found exception,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.950
it's do that as well here.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.390
So employee that is done.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.370
So the next thing, what do we need to do is so we have the department entity here.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.810
The first thing we need to add the employee to our department so it can identify,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.940
Okay, I am belongs with this particular parent.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.660
Right.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.405
So the way how we can do that,

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.620
we have employer, right?

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.360
Sorry, we have a department, right.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.710
So department dot sit employee the employee

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.375
with you all didn't viewed as a employee here in the line number 56.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.670
Now, the set employee is done.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.855
Now what we need to do,

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:13.880
we have to use the we already have

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.195
the department and we have the US IN we have the employee DTO.

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:20.120
I'm I'm an employee entity which is already added into

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.705
the department itself now all we need to do is pause is the department.

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:25.655
So what are the other values for department?

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:29.510
We need to provide a department name rate which is coming as part of the request body.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.760
So the next thing what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.230
the department repository and say Mother,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.780
which taxable entity and the entity we're going to use,

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.110
it's going to be a department which is coming from the request.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.895
And let's everything is good.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:47.045
We got the employee and the employee now department.

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:52.100
And which means so when the department stored in our department table,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.070
it has the kind of duty to the employee ID as well.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.175
Let's save it and let's erase whatever application on wartime.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:04.890
Let's do that. Replication the Getting Started now.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.900
A key, so our application is started and the port number eight is the right one.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.294
So the next thing, what do we need to do is go to the postman and eggs AUD request.

00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:26.480
Okay, So before, Let's see what are the target URL,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.880
this is the w or would you want and try?

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.520
Let's copy the URL here.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.015
And let's copy up to this area.

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:38.660
Copy and go back and provide.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.555
So here I have localhost AIDS rate one and JB add department that I mean,

00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:49.490
they employ you, you're trying to update the department is let's verify it one more time.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.510
Notice it.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.975
We just don't even AJ is employee ID is seven.

00:05:56.975 --> 00:05:58.625
Let's go back to the Bozeman.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.010
The employee I am trying to look for is seven,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.675
which is a newly created and it doesn't have any department in it.

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:09.710
And then we need to provide them my body and we're going to pass

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.390
the DJ is on ISI input and department contains only the department name rates.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.215
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna create a cluster here and which contains

00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:25.290
depart and n. I'm going to get a new department here, maybe payroll department.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.900
And we don't let's go back and check where if a wants go to

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.325
the department entity and make sure you have the same department,

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:40.460
copy and go back and patient and hopefully, yes, it is correct.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.770
So now what happens when I hit the request first,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.700
it will literally employee based on the employee ID

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.780
and then this department will be added into the employee,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.205
which means to our AG S employee, Let's click sent.

00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:57.830
Okay, so two, not one created,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.050
which means the employees updated.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.495
Let's go back to our database and verify it.

00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:08.195
So this is the employee table which is a 7.

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:13.580
Aj is so we need to verify this employee ID as any department associated to it.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.740
So let's go back to department here and z here we have the employee ID 7,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.505
which is associated with the payroll department, right?

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:27.089
So the next video, we'll try to delete any one of the employee.
