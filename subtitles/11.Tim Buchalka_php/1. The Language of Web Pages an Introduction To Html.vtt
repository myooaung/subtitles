00:05.190 --> 00:07.320
With all we've learned so far.

00:07.560 --> 00:15.260
We can create an array that contains a list of articles we can use an IF statement to display a message.

00:15.390 --> 00:23.220
If the list is empty and we can display all the articles in the array regardless of its size using a

00:23.220 --> 00:27.180
far each loop.

00:27.180 --> 00:33.980
However when we view this in a browser it's all on one line and we haven't got any formatting.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.350
I'll lay out a tall to do that.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.870
We need to use it to email.

00:43.380 --> 00:43.640
H.

00:43.650 --> 00:51.460
T email are hypertext mark-up language is a way for you to tell a web browser how some text is structured.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.630
It's not a programming language like P HP.

00:54.630 --> 00:56.700
It's a mark-up language.

00:57.030 --> 01:01.110
We make up parts of a document to make them appear.

01:01.190 --> 01:05.680
Act in a certain way when the document is viewed in a web browser.

01:08.210 --> 01:13.870
H t email consists of a series of elements of which there are two types.

01:13.880 --> 01:22.850
The first is used to wrap some text and consists of an opening tag and an end tag for example to mark

01:22.850 --> 01:25.380
up a piece of text as a paragraph.

01:25.400 --> 01:33.080
We close it in paragraph tacks the opening tag marks where the paragraph begins and the closing tag

01:33.410 --> 01:35.970
marks where it ends.

01:36.170 --> 01:43.550
Tags are the elements name surrounded by angle brackets and the closing tag has an additional far would

01:43.550 --> 01:45.470
slash before the elements.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.140
Name.

01:49.310 --> 01:57.070
H t mailed tags can also have attributes for example to make a piece of text into a link that you can

01:57.070 --> 01:58.210
click on.

01:58.230 --> 02:08.020
We use the they are anchor elements we wrap the text of the link in a tags and add an H ref R hypertext

02:08.020 --> 02:12.870
reference attribute to the opening tag.

02:13.090 --> 02:17.790
This contains the address that you want the link to go to when it clicked on.

02:20.170 --> 02:26.560
Attributes are specified with the name of the attribute followed by an equal sign and the value of the

02:26.590 --> 02:29.350
attribute in double quotes.

02:29.350 --> 02:33.470
Note that there are no spaces before or after the equals sign.

02:36.850 --> 02:44.220
The second type of astm element is one that doesn't have a closing tag as it doesn't wrap anything.

02:44.590 --> 02:50.500
For example to insert an image into a web page we use the image element.

02:50.730 --> 02:58.990
This soss attribute specifies the name of the image file you want to display with tags like this you

02:58.990 --> 03:05.440
can optionally put a closing slash at the end and you might see this done in other people's code but

03:05.440 --> 03:07.370
it's not required.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.690
Will learn more about all these tags we've just seen later on.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.160
Let's look at an example.

03:17.430 --> 03:21.850
We'll create a new file and call it index.

03:21.900 --> 03:22.670
It's 2:00 a.m.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.090
in here.

03:26.130 --> 03:27.670
Let's add some text.

03:30.240 --> 03:36.140
And even though we have these lines of text on separate lines with blank lines.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.900
Carriage returns at the end of each line.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.030
When we open this file in a browser

03:48.130 --> 03:50.950
it's a whole appears joined together.

03:54.650 --> 03:58.250
Let's fix that by adding some ace to email tags.

03:58.280 --> 04:02.170
First let's mark up the title as a header.

04:05.380 --> 04:12.520
Headers in h t email have different levels which is what this number is which will then about later.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.930
Then let's mark up the paragraphs using the paragraph tag.

04:18.370 --> 04:23.100
And finally let's add emphasis tags to this word here.

04:28.260 --> 04:36.180
Now when we view this in the browser we have the title formatted as a heading on its own line and in

04:36.180 --> 04:47.340
a larger font we have two paragraphs separated by a carriage return and this word has been emphasized

04:47.400 --> 04:55.350
by making it italic the XT team of tags are hidden when you view the web page like this as the browser

04:55.370 --> 04:59.450
has used them to change how we see the documents.

04:59.730 --> 05:06.420
But you can if you want to view the soss to see the s t AML.

05:11.460 --> 05:17.680
Finally in this video I just want to mention what's known as the web servers default document.

05:18.150 --> 05:25.740
We've called our H team mail file index that h.t. AML and this is what we put in the web browsers address

05:25.740 --> 05:27.980
bar to view the file.

05:28.470 --> 05:32.790
However if we remove this and don't specify anything.

05:34.230 --> 05:41.340
The web server will look for a file card index to h.t. email by default so we can remove this from the

05:41.340 --> 05:45.390
address and still see our file later on.

05:45.420 --> 05:48.550
We'll see how we can do this with P HP files too.
