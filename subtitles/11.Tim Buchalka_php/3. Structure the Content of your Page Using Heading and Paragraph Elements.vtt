We just marked up the title of a page using a heading element

00:12.680 --> 00:19.550
heading elements let you mark up certain parts of your content as headings are subheadings to just like

00:19.550 --> 00:28.630
a book has a main title chapter titles subtitles and so on an eight team old document Cantu X Tim L.

00:28.640 --> 00:34.280
has six heading levels from 1 to 6 denoted by the elements.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.870
H 1 through 2 hate.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.170
6.

00:38.510 --> 00:42.110
The most important heading on the page is use the etch one.

00:42.170 --> 00:47.750
Then if you have a subtitle lower down that will be h 2 and so on.

00:47.750 --> 00:55.610
Although there are six levels you'll probably only ever use three of four.

00:55.640 --> 01:01.520
We've already got an H heading in our code so let's add some subheadings.

01:01.970 --> 01:07.310
If it makes sense according to the structure of your document you can have as many heading elements

01:07.370 --> 01:09.760
at the same level as you like.

01:09.860 --> 01:15.710
So for example let's add a subheading before each paragraph.

01:16.970 --> 01:24.760
This H1 would be the main heading on the page and these 8 two elements are the subheadings.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.930
In the browser we see the heading here and the subheadings here and here.

01:33.930 --> 01:41.640
As you can see from this example the browser renders the H one element in a larger font and H to slightly

01:41.640 --> 01:45.120
smaller.

01:45.120 --> 01:50.350
This continues all the way down to heading level 6.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.220
Now the styling in the actual font size is decided by the browser.

01:55.800 --> 02:01.620
Don't be tempted at this stage to use a different heading element to change the font size when it's

02:01.620 --> 02:03.550
displayed on screen.

02:03.570 --> 02:12.180
We'll see how we can change font sizes colours type faces and so on later on for now we're just semantically

02:12.360 --> 02:18.450
marking a power document which means we're just telling the browser what the various parts of our document

02:18.510 --> 02:21.410
are.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.590
In addition to the headers we've already got some paragraphs of text.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.890
We mark these up with a P of a paragraph element.

02:35.810 --> 02:42.170
This simply creates a block of text that is separated from the others by a blank line and some vertical

02:42.170 --> 02:45.330
space.

02:46.250 --> 02:50.910
You can have as many paragraphs as you like in NH to timal document.
