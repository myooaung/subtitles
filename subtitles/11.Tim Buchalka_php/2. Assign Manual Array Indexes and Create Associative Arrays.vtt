When we created this array the indexes were assigned automatically by P HP if we vihar dumped the whole

00:13.180 --> 00:21.670
array like this and look at this in a browser we see that the first element of the array has an index

00:21.670 --> 00:23.110
of zero.

00:23.140 --> 00:27.810
The second one has an index of one and the third one has an index of two.

00:28.030 --> 00:33.400
The indexes are created automatically starting from zero.

00:34.780 --> 00:42.430
However it's possible to manually specify the indexes when we create an array to specify an element

00:42.490 --> 00:50.320
index right to the index followed by an equal sign and a greater than sign like this then the value

00:50.320 --> 00:55.420
of the element the index can be any whole number you like.

00:55.480 --> 01:02.700
They don't have to be sequential and you don't have to specify the index for all the elements.

01:03.040 --> 01:09.110
Any that aren't specified will be assigned automatically continuing on from the previous one.

01:12.400 --> 01:19.040
For example let's add some indexes to a couple of elements in our array.

01:20.200 --> 01:28.330
Then when we dump out the every variable in the browser we can see the indexes that we've assigned the

01:28.330 --> 01:31.110
first element as an index of one.

01:31.210 --> 01:38.050
The second has an index of three and as we didn't specify an index with a third element it's continued

01:38.050 --> 01:41.570
from 3 and assigned the index of four.

01:45.270 --> 01:53.190
You can also use a string as an index arrays with string indexes are sometimes referred to as associated.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.690
Erase.

01:54.690 --> 02:02.370
You assign these in the same way but make sure you include the quotes around each string index.

02:02.370 --> 02:07.550
Note that you can only use integers are strings as ARRAY indexes.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.900
You can't use other types.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.500
Let's change the indexes on these elements to strings.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.450
Turning it into an associative array.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.230
In a browser it looks like this.

02:28.230 --> 02:34.680
With each element having a string index instead of a numeric one.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.080
Individual elements in an associative array access.

02:44.090 --> 02:53.690
In the same way for example lets display the second element of the array by adding the index of the

02:53.690 --> 02:57.100
second element like that.

03:01.180 --> 03:06.310
And in the browser this prints out the second element of the array.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.380
Find the link in this video.

03:10.380 --> 03:13.770
Let's tidy this up a little bit in p h.

03:13.770 --> 03:17.850
P You don't need to put every instruction on just one line.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.160
You can put it on several lines.

03:20.250 --> 03:27.420
If it looks cleaner for example let's put each index and each element on one line

03:30.540 --> 03:32.040
like that.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.440
Much easier to read.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.930
You'll see this a lot when you see other people's code.
