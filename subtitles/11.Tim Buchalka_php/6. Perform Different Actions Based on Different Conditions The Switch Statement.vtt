00:05.150 --> 00:12.320
There's another control structure mph P which does something similar to if L. if and else

00:15.290 --> 00:22.460
it's called a switch statement and it's used to compare a variable of value to many different values

00:22.940 --> 00:26.590
and execute code based on that comparison.

00:29.550 --> 00:37.920
For example let's conditionally execute some code based on the day of the week which is contained in

00:37.920 --> 00:47.850
this variable then that starts our switch statement passing in this variable.

00:47.850 --> 00:55.610
Then we add a series of case blocks with the value we want to compare the variable to in each block.

00:55.950 --> 01:04.590
Let's add mun our Monday as the first one which is the work case followed by the value followed by a

01:04.590 --> 01:07.290
colon and then the cold.

01:07.290 --> 01:10.420
We want to execute.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.190
Note that although we use curly braces for the whole switch statement we don't use curly braces for

01:17.190 --> 01:18.340
the code blocks.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.670
Inside each case.

01:22.970 --> 01:30.710
Let's add another case far Tuesday and so far the rest of the days of the week.

01:33.480 --> 01:41.630
With the day you variable set to queue for Tuesday let's see what happens when we run this cold.

01:42.060 --> 01:49.440
We get Tuesday printed out but we also get the rest of the days of the week printed out too.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.500
With a switch statements.

01:54.530 --> 02:00.980
Once a case has matched the value it doesn't just execute the code for that case.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.300
Rather it will continue down to the end of the switch statement.

02:06.350 --> 02:10.550
You might actually want this behaviour which is why it does it like that.

02:10.580 --> 02:11.850
But if you don't.

02:12.110 --> 02:22.910
All we need to do is add a break command at the end of each block like this.

02:22.910 --> 02:31.020
Now if we try running this code we get just Tuesday as we wanted.

02:33.630 --> 02:42.030
There's one more thing we can add to a switch statement and that's the default block at the end.

02:42.030 --> 02:46.370
This is equivalent to an else in an IF statement.

02:46.590 --> 02:52.740
This code is executed if none of the case statements match the variable.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.190
Let's change the variables value to something that doesn't match.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.670
And then we try that in a browser.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.050
We get the code from the default block.
