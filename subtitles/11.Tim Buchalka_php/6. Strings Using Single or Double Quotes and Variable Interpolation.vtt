00:05.500 --> 00:11.450
When we create a string variable we can use single R double quotes.

00:14.450 --> 00:19.580
For example here we have two strings one enclosed in single quotes.

00:19.580 --> 00:23.580
And the other in double quotes you can use either.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.270
But the quote used at the start and the end have to match.

00:28.500 --> 00:36.480
If you want to insert a quote character into a string for example like this in a single quoted string

00:36.960 --> 00:43.490
then you can't just use the quote character as P P will think that's the end of the string.

00:44.190 --> 00:48.560
You can either use the other quotes to enclose the string.

00:49.310 --> 00:55.410
Ah you can escape the quote inside the string by putting a backslash in front of it.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.010
If we print these two out.

01:03.110 --> 01:07.720
Then the strings are printed out containing the quote inside the string.

01:10.730 --> 01:17.270
If we're using double quotes around the string we can also use this method to insert some special characters

01:17.720 --> 01:21.210
for example a new line character or a tab.

01:24.820 --> 01:32.920
For example if I add a new variable containing three days of the week and I separate these with a backslash

01:33.020 --> 01:36.320
N and then print this out.

01:39.430 --> 01:47.200
In the browser they appear on one line because that's how the browser shows new line characters by default.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.130
But if we view the source.

01:50.470 --> 01:56.650
We can see that each backslash N. character has been converted into a new line.

01:57.070 --> 02:04.330
Will learn more later on about how the browser interprets h.t. dml.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.090
We also just saw how to concatenate strings.

02:08.380 --> 02:13.160
For example we can come katin 8 a literal string and a variable.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.720
And in the browser we get the strings join together.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.940
We can also insert the variable directly into the string.

02:27.110 --> 02:32.450
If were using double quotes for example like this.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.880
This is called variable interpolation.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.750
And in the browser the result is the same.

02:43.960 --> 02:50.850
Finally if you want to insert a variable into a string and it's not clear where the variable ends.

02:50.920 --> 02:56.500
For example if you have some letter characters straight after it then you can surround the variable

02:56.710 --> 02:59.880
with curly braces like this.

03:01.490 --> 03:06.430
If you are not interpolating variables are inserting special characters.

03:06.440 --> 03:14.330
It doesn't really matter if you use single or double quotes using single quotes used to be ever so slightly

03:14.330 --> 03:15.060
faster.

03:15.260 --> 03:20.290
But in recent versions of P 8 p It doesn't really make any difference.

03:20.330 --> 03:24.220
Likewise with concatenation interpolation.

03:24.470 --> 03:32.250
Use which ever you think makes your code easier to read unless you can Catton ating hundreds of strings.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.940
There's no real difference in performance between the two.
