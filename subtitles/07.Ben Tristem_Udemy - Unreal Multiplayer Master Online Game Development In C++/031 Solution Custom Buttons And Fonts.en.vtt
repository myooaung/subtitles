00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.040
Okay welcome back.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.580
So we're going to have a look at that button pack as a first quote port of call.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.740
I have got my downloads here and that button pack in my downloads.

4
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.700
Which I have personally made in GIMP.

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.910
No I'm not a very good artist so these buttons are a little bit rough.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.830
And if you want to learn how to do these kinds of buttons much better than me then Mikey who makes the

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.890
gimp course for us is the guy to go and look for and he has got a whole course about how to use it properly.

8
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.390
And if you do know how to use GIMP.

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.530
Well I have included the gimp file in the download so you can go ahead and select these three buttons

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.540
the button the clicked button and the button highlighted and go over to our content browser and get

11
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.870
that drag over from the download.

12
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.190
Import those three buttons go to back to our main menu select our.

13
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.830
Host button.

14
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.310
Go through its image and with that image loops opening up.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.630
I am likely to click and drag go and select the image button.

16
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.800
Okay so that has given us this image and I could try and do it as a box draw as a box but you'll see

17
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.930
it doesn't work particularly well the reason for this is that I have created a scan line effect in here

18
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.100
that scanner in effect is getting stretched and scanlan effects aren't really meant to be stretched

19
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.580
so it's better off if we just use draw as image here for my particular button.

20
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.480
You might choose to do different now.

21
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.130
You'll see that inside this text you've got a size box already.

22
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.780
So what we can do is we can make use of this size box to get the.

23
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.280
Image of the button image to the right aspect ratio.

24
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.660
So let's do that.

25
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.850
What kind of looks about right is enough.

26
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.580
That looks about right now with that text.

27
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.620
I want it to be centralized so I'm going to click the text go to the slot the size box slot and align

28
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.400
it Centre in both directions.

29
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
Now I want to change the colour of the text.

30
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.880
I can go to appearance colour and a passive t use the colour picker and now the colour pic can be a

31
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.890
bit weird.

32
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.730
Sometimes not always where you think it is the exact colour so you might have to hover around in different

33
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.550
places and eventually you might find it as I just it.

34
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.360
Okay so I now have a text with the right colour.

35
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.530
I'm going to copy that colour and opacity from the appearance you can right click and hit copy and select

36
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.060
the other text in our game and right click on same current pastie and hit paste that updates their colour

37
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.190
in a pastie.

38
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.810
In fact I need that done that for joined because I'm going to delete that join bot button and just copy

39
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.740
the host button because I've changed significantly much that it's going to be hard to replicate.

40
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.830
So right click click on the horizontal box and paste it there and then I'm going to reorder it in my

41
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.520
horizontal box so that it is back where the join button was.

42
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.710
I'm going to open up the join button go to its host text and actually rename it to join as it should

43
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.920
be that again.

44
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.230
So now if I go ahead and hit play we've got a very cool looking menu but the hover over it isn't quite

45
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.750
working yet and the fonts are a bit rubbish so let's fix that.

46
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.010
First off the button let's select both of them you can do that by control clicking on both buttons in

47
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.650
the hierarchy and then you can go to the style and we can change the hover style first date its image

48
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.840
to be Button highlighted for me.

49
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.270
And draw.

50
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.720
As image rather than box.

51
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:09.580
Then that will go over to Prest and change that to button clicked and draw as image again.

52
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.230
Now let's go ahead and play it and see whether that's working with the Hoveround the click yet.

53
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.010
Hovering is highlighting them correctly.

54
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.440
Click is highlighting them differently.

55
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.190
Which is exactly what I'm looking for.

56
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.170
I'm pleased with that.

57
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.560
One more thing I'm noticing is that with this particular background image having the light in the middle

58
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.330
I think I need more space here in the middle of my vertical box.

59
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.480
So I'm going to go to my size box that contains the vertical box and increase its height I think.

60
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.100
A little bit.

61
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.130
To try and offset that position difference.

62
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.230
Just like so I might add a size box just above the main menu to bring it down a little.

63
00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:03.530
So copy that size box paste it underneath the just above the main menu and I might change it's fill

64
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.480
to be about point five.

65
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.570
So just so the menu is hovering about here.

66
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.860
The buttons just a bit below.

67
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.130
Go ahead hit play and how that looks.

68
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.460
Yeah that looks pretty pretty good to me.

69
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.460
I'm quite happy with that.

70
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.830
Good luck.

71
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.910
On second thoughts I don't like that size box there.

72
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.790
It feels like it just unbalances the whole thing.

73
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.970
Main Menu at the top.

74
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.810
Host and join at the bottom that looks much better to me.

75
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.640
So I changed my mind.

76
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.520
But sometimes it's like that when you're doing you ice stuff you just kind of have to try it and see

77
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.010
how it feels and I'm sure you've found the same thing doing the challenge finding the font.

78
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.400
It's going to be pretty easy.

79
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.550
You just go over to Google fonts and download the font that you wanted.

80
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.710
So let's do that.

81
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.630
Hit the download button.

82
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.350
You get a Zip.

83
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.490
You open the zip.

84
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.580
You extract the zip.

85
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.700
And then once you have extracted the zip you can look for the t t f file which is the font file and

86
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.320
you can drag that into unreel which I believe I need to open up the content browser for.

87
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.890
And I'm actually going to create a font subfolder in the menu system folder new folder and I need to

88
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.600
set the content Braz to rename it fonts.

89
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.150
And in that font folder is where we are going to drag that tgf file.

90
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.760
So to do that might need to drag it from the extracted folder.

91
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.470
Like so.

92
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.530
And they all ask you Would you like to create a new font asset using the imported font face as its default

93
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.240
font.

94
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.600
Yes to all.

95
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.720
And I'm going to use that font selecting the text for the main menu the text to the host and text for

96
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:58.240
join go appearance font font family select and go to the audio regular or audio wide regular font.

97
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.000
Excellent.

98
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.790
We've got a really cool futuristic looking font.

99
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.100
Got a nice futuristic looking background.

100
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:12.400
It all scales properly and we've got nice different looking buttons that react to us clicking on them.

101
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.070
Great stuff.

102
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.920
Pat yourselves on the back for having a really cool looking menu now and I'll look forward to seeing

103
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.030
what your menus look like.

104
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:26.690
Do go ahead and share screenshots of the menus that you ended up creating in the forum and I will love

105
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.180
to see the results that you come up with okay and I'll see you next video will be making this menu just

106
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.420
that bit more functional.
