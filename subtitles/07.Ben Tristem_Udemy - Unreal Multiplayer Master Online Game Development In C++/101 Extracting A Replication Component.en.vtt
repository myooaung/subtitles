00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.650
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.730
We are going to be doing well leaving our actor very barren indeed as you can see here.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.640
It does very little other than take and do some input binding and set up its components.

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.160
So basically and if we look in the C++ the C++ is doing a very bare minimum.

5
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.350
Here's the input binding.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.980
Here is the trick which is doing basically have some debug stuff and we're just setting it to replicate

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.260
and setting up our components and replicator which is exactly what we're doing in this lecture creating

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.750
that replicator component so that we can take out some of the gubbins to do with replication.

9
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.820
Let's dive in and see how we can do that.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.510
OK.

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.320
So in the last lecture we dealt with the movement component and unsurprisingly in this lecture as you'd

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.740
probably guess from the title we are going to be dealing with the replication component instead.

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.670
Okay so let's go ahead and give that a shot.

14
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.180
Let's have a go at creating a replication component where we know what the first step is.

15
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.930
There's no particular surprise there we're going to get add new new C++ class and again select an active

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.050
component again because it doesn't need to have a transform and we are going to call it the go cart.

17
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.850
Movement a replication component bit of a mouthful but we don't have name spaces in on real So how do

18
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.890
we have to make these long names.

19
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.990
Otherwise we'd put this under the namespace for go kart and that would be fairly straightforward.

20
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.710
In fact you'll notice here that you've also on top of that insult of not having name spaces.

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.910
Got to keep your class names under 32 characters which is really hard to hear what we're going to do

22
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:47.010
is just called this the go cart movement replicator make area so we gonna go ahead and create that class.

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.090
Okay and with a movement replicator in hand let's go ahead and get ourselves.

24
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.800
What are we going to do.

25
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.420
Well we're going to move across the go cart.

26
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.080
A few things from go cart dot H.

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.860
But before we do that there is one caveat with a component is that by default it will not replicate

28
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.150
unlike the actor where things on the actor particularly propertys that have got replication on them

29
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.000
where I'm looking for one in particular yes replicated using for service state.

30
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.740
This one will replicate by default because an actor is set to replicate but components on an actor that

31
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.940
is set to replicate will not replicate.

32
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.210
By default you need to both have the actor set to replicate and the components set to replicate.

33
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.880
So let me just show you this by going in to the blueprint definition for our class.

34
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.410
Let's go over up to the root of the crazy cart asset and go into the BP go cart.

35
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.120
Open up that BP go cart and bring it into the main pane of the editor.

36
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.780
And if we go and have a look at this then looking at the go kart level and looking at the details pane

37
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.990
we are going to look for replication which there is a whole section on and it says that here we've got

38
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.480
replicates movement and also just replicates his set.

39
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.930
So this act of will replicate but as we've seen before you don't have this check.

40
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.310
The actor will not even be considered for replication.

41
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.610
Now let's have a look at our movement of component.

42
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.920
If we go and have a look at the moon component and expand it out because it's collapsed up like this

43
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.200
because we don't edit anywhere.

44
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.390
And of course you've probably been shouting at the screen the whole time telling me that with components

45
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.510
it's better to do visible anywhere.

46
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.440
Well let's go over to our go cart Don H and change that moving component from anywhere to visible anywhere

47
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.800
because that way it won't allow us to try and repoint it let's build it and see that's corrected the

48
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.330
error.

49
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.920
Quick reminder for those of you who may have forgotten what this means is that edits anywhere would

50
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.200
have allowed us to change the component being pointed to which isn't what we want we don't want to be

51
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.970
able to edit that pointer.

52
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.150
We do however want to be able to see the contents of that pointer and that shows up differently in the

53
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.370
editor in unreel.

54
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.450
So if we go over there and select that movement component now you can see that we don't have that dropdown.

55
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.310
We've just got all the properties of the human component which is what we want to have.

56
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.780
You'll notice that in here we have a property called component replication that says component replicates

57
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.080
and it's currently set to false and that is the default.

58
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.740
So that's what we're going to have to change.

59
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.550
We are going to want it to have enabled replication.

60
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.390
So let's go ahead.

61
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.110
First of all and in a go cart cpe we are going to create this default object.

62
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.930
So I'm going to have to first create a visible anywhere you property and is going to have to include.

63
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.590
I'm going to have to include first of all the go cart movement replicator.

64
00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.380
So at the top just under the go cart movement component include the go carts.

65
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.750
Movement replicate.

66
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.540
H.

67
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.590
And we are going to change moving component to movement replicator.

68
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.570
And change go cart Movent component here in that type as well to replicator.

69
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:27.680
So and then in our C++ in the constructer we can copy this creative force subobject and change out all

70
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.700
the components for replicators.

71
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.860
In fact I should just copied this.

72
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.370
That's what I do now.

73
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.430
So it's going to be movement replicator is an instance of the movement replicated type.

74
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.250
And the name of it is going to be a movement replicator as well as build that and see if we get that

75
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.560
object in an editor case so back over to visual studio where the bill has clearly finished got a moving

76
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.360
component and movement replicator and you can see the movement replicator isn't replicating.

77
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.960
So let's fix that and we know we can change the OR.

78
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.650
Where in the constructor so goats Luke Movent replicators constructer And here well we could actually

79
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.340
try to guess what the property is actually called those component replicates.

80
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.370
Let's see if we can find such a property.

81
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.400
Go to Visual Studio component.

82
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.530
Replicates.

83
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.320
Nope.

84
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.090
Maybe just replicates.

85
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.550
There is a set is replicated here and I think that is the one we want.

86
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.650
So we're going to do that set.

87
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.080
It's replicated in our construct go ahead and build.

88
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.780
You can also check this in the documentation linked here about component application.

89
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.530
It talks a little bit more about that how we've got this check box and also so that we can do the set

90
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.820
is replicated.

91
00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:00.160
So let's head on back to the real editor and select our component Movent replicator and as you can see

92
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.640
it hasn't checked the compound replicates but it has changed the default if we reset a default if we

93
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.550
hadn't created this in the blueprint already then you would have seen that component rep case would

94
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.340
have come in as checked by default.

95
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.260
Obviously we can always turn this property off at any point but we aren't going to want to do that are

96
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.470
we.

97
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.480
So that's going to be its default for this particular component.

98
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.460
Hooray.

99
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.150
So the next step is to move the member declaration's cross.

100
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.940
I'm going to do that is not going to make it part of the challenge.

101
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.630
But if you feel comfortable with knowing what we're going to move across into this replicate component

102
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.960
then by all means pause now and have a go and then come back for the challenge definition.

103
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.780
OK.

104
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.190
So I'm going to move ahead.

105
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.670
Plough on.

106
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.490
Go to our go cart dot H.

107
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.430
And I'm going to be bringing some more things out.

108
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.390
Or we're going to be taking out everything to do with reparation basically.

109
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.130
So we got this acknowledged moves.

110
00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm going to take that out and move that into the movement replicator as a private member.

111
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.040
Like so.

112
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.320
So locklair moves.

113
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.480
What next.

114
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.340
Got to go cart dot H.

115
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.650
We're going to go to Kate these server functions.

116
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.660
They can come across server state.

117
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.950
It can come across on rep.

118
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.700
Yep unacknowledged moves.

119
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.080
Yes that can come across too.

120
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.390
And that pretty much leaves some very very little in our actor which is just what I wanted to see.

121
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.980
So let's stick these in the private section let's fix up the indentation from the you properties and

122
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.550
the U functions that's gone awry and save that.

123
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:40.750
And the next step is going to be up to you to move the function implementations just as we did before.

124
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.250
So the change is very similar to refactor you know pull across the method implementations change the

125
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:53.420
class namespace is proof exacta functions and and Spicks the references in the go cart that cbp and

126
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.840
create an excesses you need and fix any bill there.

127
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.830
So possibly.

128
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.300
And have a go.

129
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.280
Okay welcome back hopefully this was fairly straightforward.

130
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.180
It's very similar to the challenge in the last lecture so you probably got a little bit of practice

131
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.200
by now.

132
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.990
So we are going to the C++ file something that's slightly different here is we are going to need to

133
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:20.700
change get lifetime replicated properties that wasn't actually in the head file because it gets auto

134
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.420
generated for us but we are going to need it.

135
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.040
I'm going to pull that across then.

136
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.460
Get in some text just debug stuff we're gonna leave it in the actor.

137
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.650
What about all the contents of tic.

138
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.970
Now you have a look at this you can see the contents of tic you're actually doing a heck of a lot about

139
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.750
replication.

140
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:44.380
So what I'm actually going to do is take this whole thing this whole shebang and cut it and bring it

141
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.330
across.

142
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.150
So tick on actor it's going to be doing very little.

143
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:57.530
But at the replicator take he is going to be doing all that job of actually replicating.

144
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.680
Okay.

145
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.270
That seems good.

146
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:07.320
Let's go to the go hotsy Keaton continue the stripping job so we've got this on.

147
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.140
Rep. CLAY acknowledged moves so fast just to unwrap.

148
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.500
By scrolling down.

149
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.600
Be happy.

150
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.090
Then we got clear acknowledged moves.

151
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.940
Cut that out.

152
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.880
Put that in as well.

153
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.860
Then we've got some binding staff.

154
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.650
And then we've got the server.

155
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.280
Our P.S. stuff which when I move over to the BPP as well.

156
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.480
Okay so that's good we've moved everything across.

157
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.130
Let's go ahead and build and see what an error has be.

158
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:44.200
Hopefully there will be not too many but I think there will be a fair few because we have changed a

159
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.550
fair bit so actor by the way is looking really thin and nice that's what I like.

160
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.770
Actors should be mostly made out of components and not be too heavy itself.

161
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.260
Although if you go and look at the engine code you will see that the Unreal Engine doesn't really follow

162
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.640
this necessarily.

163
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.150
There are some very very happy acting classes in there.

164
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.800
I prefer to move things as much as possible in two components.

165
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.340
Now I'm noticing something right off the bat which is going to be problematic and that is it.

166
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:19.810
The ego can't move isn't visible here in the component replicator So we are going to have to include.

167
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:30.600
Our Go Cart movement component header in the movement replicator header told do that.

168
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.720
That should help things out a little bit more.

169
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.830
So F go cart move is going to work.

170
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.180
And there will be another issue which is the go cart state.

171
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.990
Just thinking ahead a little bit here we could actually follow the build her errors first because that's

172
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.030
going to look at the BUILD errors talking about the unrecognized type ego state which is exactly what

173
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.880
I was about to say.

174
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.670
I'm kind of pre-empting it a little bit.

175
00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:01.100
The ego can't state it does not have and the Go can't date is something to do with replication.

176
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.180
So really it should come out of the go cart.

177
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.150
H.

178
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:11.620
And we should move that across in to how replicator dot H instead ha I just notice something.

179
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:19.310
If you do a controlled shift V in Visual Studio then it doesn't try and reformat the text so we don't

180
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:24.610
get any issues with you property formatting and being mucked up which is great.

181
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.360
So I'm going to do that from now.

182
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.470
So we move that across that should at least help with the go carts state error that we were having previously.

183
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.670
Let's go ahead and build again see what the next area.

184
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.920
Let's have a look at the output.

185
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.770
And lots of areas.

186
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.840
Let's go up to the first such error.

187
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.850
Okay so now we're actually having errors in the replicator dot C++.

188
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.730
So here it's not being able to find references such as the reference to the movement component for example.

189
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.590
So to populate this movement component what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to create.

190
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:11.890
First of all a property point of property here in the go cart movement replicator.

191
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.050
And it's just going to be a new property.

192
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:22.850
And is going to be a property that is a you go cart movement component point.

193
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.240
Which is unsurprisingly going to be called movement component.

194
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.870
So and then this moon component we can go ahead and set in begin play big in play when everything is

195
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:40.480
constructed and everything's hunky dory then we can go to create this MoveOn compound.

196
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.420
But what are we going to set it to.

197
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.540
Well we're going to have to do a find component by class.

198
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.670
Which by the way here is the documentation for that fine component my class is a method on a actor.

199
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.380
So we need to do with this find component by class call up to the owner.

200
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.600
So let's go back to visual studio and we're going to do a get on a harrow.

201
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.700
Find component.

202
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.180
By class.

203
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:18.950
And then we are going to put the type argument of that class which is going to be the you go can't move

204
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.410
component like so.

205
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.640
And that's pretty much do the trick.

206
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.680
That seems to be complaining Well let's go ahead and build and see whether that complaint remains.

207
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.320
So we've got many errors but that one is no longer one of them.

208
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.220
So I think we've fixed the issue with the movement component.

209
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:44.660
Next up we have at this role being undeclared now actually the component does have a get role I believe

210
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.710
so we can do a get on a roll.

211
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.110
And that without having to do get ona it's just a little short cut which is nice.

212
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.160
So we can replace that in a few places where we've used role how to get remote role has no such nicety.

213
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.870
So he has to get owner.

214
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.800
Harrogate get role instead which should work just fine.

215
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.660
Now complaining but we'll see whether that fixes itself and then get owner again.

216
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.630
We need to do with this it's him.

217
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.740
It's a proxy I notice.

218
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.370
We could have done a switch statement here.

219
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:20.510
We almost could do a switch statement except for this logic here which is why we're not doing a switch

220
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.880
statement just in case you're wondering now how about this a go cart business.

221
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.150
Well we need to find and replace that don't we find replace a go cart we're that not you Movement component

222
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:39.570
but you Movement replicator in said let's do that six occurrences replaced which looks good.

223
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.180
Okay.

224
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.370
And what up next.

225
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:48.800
So we've got the get owner done let's go ahead and build because we made a fairly sizable change one

226
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.140
to see what they build there as are now.

227
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:57.190
So the first error we get is about the you go cart movement replicator illegal use of this type as an

228
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.770
expression but you'll notice that underneath that it does say that do read the lifetime identify is

229
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.540
not found.

230
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.540
So it looks like we've gone include missing from our go cart copy.

231
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.980
And sure enough in here we've got that unreel networking header which we will probably need in our replicator

232
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.990
seeing as it's all to do with networking.

233
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.400
So let's go ahead and build again.

234
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.210
Okay so now it's looking like we're on home turf.

235
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:27.740
So we've got this set actor transform which I'm fairly sure we can just do a get owner.

236
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.350
Arrow with and I think for the next thing we are going to be in the same position because the next one

237
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.990
is the get transform which can also do a Get on Arrow for and that looks like the end of those errors

238
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.750
so let's go ahead and build and see whether that is actually the end of the errors.

239
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:50.610
Okay a bit unhappy that unreal seems to have crashed with that comp. But let's just close that that's

240
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.300
their error.

241
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.590
Probably our own fault and launch it up again.

242
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.690
I think it was just a transient error because we had the blueprint open and we'd updated a few properties

243
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.020
of it and so on and so on.

244
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.150
But if it was a transient error we will soon find out where we.

245
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.010
Hey so it's opened up without crashing which is always a good thing.

246
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.080
So let's go ahead and open up the blueprint class again in fact.

247
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:15.860
No need.

248
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.050
It seems to have built successfully.

249
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.610
I've kind of missed that in the fact that it crashed.

250
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.780
So we actually got to the stage of it successfully building.

251
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:28.050
So now that it has successfully built I'm going to refresh the visual studio project file so that we've

252
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.370
got all the rinse with leaves disappear.

253
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.670
That should happen.

254
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:39.100
And just like so well as me to reload and things like the squid he's under get ona seemed to should

255
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:46.020
hopefully disappear because now we have updated all that includes and various things that we needed.

256
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.500
And let's go ahead and hit play and see whether it's going to work now.

257
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.710
So I'm going to put my autonomous proxy on the right the server on the left and drive the server round

258
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.260
came all looking good so we can see it replicated to the autonomous proxy.

259
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.700
Let's go and do the same thing with the autonomous proxy's seems to drive around.

260
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.200
He's not just a ring.

261
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.150
So our.

262
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:17.170
Autonomous proxy replication code is working we can try them out with a latency as well so let's go

263
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:23.180
with net lag on thousand like we've done previously and keep driving around.

264
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.590
So far not jumping back in front of our simulated proxy yet that happened one second later.

265
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.600
More or less.

266
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.650
So everything seems to be working just as it was before except now we have it nicely refactored into

267
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.980
two separate components.

268
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:44.950
The replicator and the movement component and you can see that the actor is doing a bear very little.

269
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.140
In fact great stuff.

270
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.170
So I will leave it there.

271
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.110
And in the next lecture we'll be looking at how we can do the following.

272
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.350
The finishing touches they polishing off on these components.

273
00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.150
I see there.
