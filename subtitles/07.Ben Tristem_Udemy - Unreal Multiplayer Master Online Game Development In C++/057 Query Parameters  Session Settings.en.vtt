00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.110
Welcome in this lecture we are going to be making our final session much more interesting by actually

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.970
finding some sessions so here I am in a standalone game I'm going to go and host on this game and I'm

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.690
going to go in to the unreel editor and I am going to hit play and you can see a long message here saying

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.830
that it's starting to find sessions.

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.620
And there we go.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.200
We have found a session with a long U you I.D. that you I.D. is of this game here.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.470
In fact I'll prove it to you by quitting the game entirely.

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.170
It's totally quit the game.

9
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:45.110
And if I go and stop and play in the editor then we will see that fine sessions finding sessions and

10
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.000
it's finished fine sessions but no such game was found so it really was that game that we just hosted

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that it was found and I'm going to show you how we do this.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.360
By setting up some session settings as well as setting up query settings and iterating over the list

13
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.390
of query results that come back.

14
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.330
So let's dive in and see how it's done.

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.680
So last lecture was a bit of a cliff-hanger wasn't it.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.600
We had this fine sessions and we had a call-back from fine sessions but we didn't actually find any

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.160
sessions.

18
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.260
We didn't print out the results of said fine session.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.540
So in this lecture we are going to be doing just that.

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
But the first thing we need to do.

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.230
Because I don't want to be leading you down a dark dark dark blind alley here is we need to adjust our

22
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.690
sessions settings and our querying settings that start with the session settings.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:42.010
So when we go ahead and create our session that we in our create session method we actually have as

24
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.030
Session settings which we have just left as default for now.

25
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.120
Now this default settings aren't going to be enough.

26
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.180
Unfortunately we're going to have to set them up so you can find the documentation online for yourself

27
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.970
for EFF online sessions settings.

28
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.690
I am just going to do it using the autocomplete and my own knowledge of it.

29
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.250
SESSIONS I think is a struct so we can just use the dot operator and there's lots of things in here.

30
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.070
Lots and lots of things in fact.

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.870
But let's have a look at some of the important ones.

32
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.910
The first one is is LAN match.

33
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.000
We're going to have to set that to rule because we are going to be searching for things over the local

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.270
network even if it's on the same computer.

35
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.550
The second thing that we want in our session settings is going to be the number of layers.

36
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
So there's a few a couple of settings for this that as the number of private connections a number of

37
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.910
public connections.

38
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.630
We want the number of public connections and I'm going to set that to just a number greater than one

39
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.030
basically and then we have the session settings.

40
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.420
One more thing we are going to be setting up here all of these unfortunately are necessary and the other

41
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.930
one is should advertise.

42
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.440
That is basically going to make it visible to our find sessions without should advertise you're probably

43
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.370
gonna need to send out a personalized invite to your friends so should into advertise allows us to circumvent

44
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.840
that.

45
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.450
So that has set up and configured some session settings right.

46
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.800
Let's have a look at query parameters when we're doing our find sessions call.

47
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.590
We are passing in a session search object and that session search object could actually have some settings

48
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.180
in it.

49
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.490
There aren't very many settings that you can have here.

50
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.630
Well they are but they aren't.

51
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.520
They're basically named parameters.

52
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.650
Let me show you one little bit easier.

53
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.610
Again you can look at the documentation for f online session search for this one.

54
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.350
The one that we're going to once set is B is LAN query.

55
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.250
We're going to once set that to true.

56
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.620
So I'm using an arrow here because we've got a pointer but there is one more thing one more session

57
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.010
setting that we could want to use.

58
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.120
We're not going to be using it just yet but when it gets the steam we will be using it.

59
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.260
And that is that the query settings object itself which if you do a dot on you can see there is a get

60
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.860
and set operators.

61
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.100
And what do they take.

62
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.770
What does set Take for example.

63
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.850
Well set takes an F name which is going to be the key and a value type which is going to be the value.

64
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.700
So the idea here is that the query settings aren't defined by the API of f online session search but

65
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.130
rather by the AP.

66
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.500
I of whatever you're using for example if it's steam or other things then there are going to be different

67
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.270
parameters that you can send in there at the moment.

68
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.500
Just the fact that it's LAN query is going to be enough.

69
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.870
And now let's have a look at down at our age to do our on a session on find sessions complete.

70
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:49.110
We have access in here to our session search object and what can we do with this.

71
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.540
How can we get hold of the results that we want.

72
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.550
Well let's go into the documentation for online sessions search.

73
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.370
You can see that here there is an object called search results which happens to be a t array of F on

74
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.550
line that session search result type.

75
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.590
Now for those of you who need a refresher on array I include the documentation here which talks about

76
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.180
all sorts of operations that you can do with teh array including a section on loops.

77
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.200
So let's see or iterating.

78
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.730
I'm not sure what the terminology they're going to use here.

79
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.260
Yeah iteration.

80
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.810
So in here you can see various methods you could use use whichever one you feel comfortable using.

81
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.120
And I'm going to put this up to a challenge for you to iterate over this t array.

82
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.180
You're going to these sessions that have been found you found sections are in the session search as

83
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.110
I've just showed you use the t array docs for iterating and what happens if you use default settings.

84
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.320
What happens if you remove the settings I've just told you to add in.

85
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.210
What are you going to get.

86
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.490
Make sure you're logging out in the case where you get zero search results as well and make sure you

87
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.530
test it out with a separate game instance are you going to launch a game.

88
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.160
It's going to have to host and then you're going to have a look at what sessions are printed out in

89
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.750
the editor.

90
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.500
Pause a video and have a go.

91
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.640
Okay welcome back.

92
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.300
Let's dive in with this.

93
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.660
So first things first I am going to check for validity.

94
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.870
So we're going to do a session search is valid but we also want to check whether it's successful so

95
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.090
I'm going to roll that into one if statement is going to say if success.

96
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.010
And double ampersand session search.

97
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.330
Is valid.

98
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.960
And then we can go ahead and we can do what we want to do.

99
00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:01.080
We can say let me fix my indentation which has gone a bit awry then we can say that we finished fine

100
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:10.580
session and I am going to do a full loop over its results so we're going to do the session search arrow

101
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.750
and then we said it's the search results that we're looking for it's a T array iterating over it couldn't

102
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.750
be easier.

103
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.280
And I'm going to actually use auto to deduce what type we've got here.

104
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.940
So I'm going to do auto ampersand to make sure that it's a reference to whatever we get so that we're

105
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.670
not copying things basically.

106
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.790
And this is going to be a search result.

107
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:41.360
And then we use the colon to use the for loop iteration style for loop range based for loop.

108
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.340
For those of you who know a bit about C++ this called arranged for loop and then we've got this search

109
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.980
result typed back if I hover over it let's see what that actually is.

110
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:59.850
That is an F online session the search results so let me just swap that out for that f online session

111
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.300
search.

112
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.370
Result.

113
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.070
You could have seen it from the type of the tea array in search results.

114
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.700
I'm going to take a reference to it.

115
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.830
As I said because I don't want to copy it and I'm putting it in front of it.

116
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.120
Now that's just to be explicit.

117
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.710
It's perfectly legitimate just to use the auto keyword.

118
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.340
If that's what you prefer to do.

119
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.390
So we're going to have this search result in here let's see what our search result provides search results.

120
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.800
Dot because it's a reference on a pointer weakness a dot and there's a couple of things in here.

121
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.190
We can have the session.

122
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.290
We could have the ping in milliseconds to said session.

123
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.000
We can see whether it is valid.

124
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.940
And we can see the session I.D. So I'm going to go with that getting that session I.D. string and printing

125
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:52.560
it out so let's get our log message get any log message really and then we are going to say this found

126
00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:02.340
session named and we are going to include the P.C. s to format some string of string that we're going

127
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.570
to have to put a star in front of to get the internal representation.

128
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:14.880
And it's going to be Search Result DOT gets session I.D. string like so that's going to return an F

129
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.050
string for us which will represent the session.

130
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.690
So let's go over in to one real in fact let's build first or his better build before you try and test

131
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.370
things out.

132
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.710
Okay that has successfully completed.

133
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.410
And let's go and try it out.

134
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:36.070
Like I said we're going to have to launch up a hosting session of the game so I'm going to go to my

135
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.530
new project right click on it and launch game.

136
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.350
And then when we launch the game and hosted the game we can go into the editor and see if the log messages

137
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.770
are being printed whether we are getting any sessions or whether we're getting zero sessions.

138
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.930
So let's try this out.

139
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.360
Here comes the game.

140
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.280
Doo doo doo doo.

141
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.960
That's a hit host game is being hosted.

142
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.780
Let's go over into the unreel.

143
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:06.050
Ed let's hit play and see it's starting fine session start starting session still finding sessions and

144
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.120
it has found the session and it's given us a session name that is hunky dory That's fantastic.

145
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.990
Now I'm not going to go ahead and test this.

146
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.400
Actually I am going to test this.

147
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:22.520
I'm going to go ahead and remove one of the things that I told you to add which is actually the query

148
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.630
parameter.

149
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.070
This one saying me is LAN query.

150
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.040
If we go ahead and remove this and if you had tried removing some of the settings yourself you might

151
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.070
have seen that if you removed all the settings they would have you would have got zero sessions come

152
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:43.370
back but if you removed just that query setting then you are going to be just fine because it's going

153
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.770
to look for both LAN matches and non LAN matches.

154
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.160
So that's going to be okay.

155
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.330
But in this case you do need to say that the session is a land that you do need to say that it has public

156
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.570
connections to and you do need to say that it advertised.

157
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.450
If you dont do any of those things you are going to get zero.

158
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.620
SESSIONS found at the end.

159
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.240
So let's go ahead with built.

160
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:11.390
Let's go ahead and launch up a new project launch game and we are going to go back in to editor and

161
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.970
stop the currently playing game because we want to add new code who doesn't not reload so it's going

162
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.580
to be using the new code.

163
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.870
When we launched up the game here's our lovely menu Let's go ahead and host.

164
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.270
Here I am hosting Let's go over into the editor Let's hit play.

165
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.970
Starting to find sessions.

166
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.330
Let's see what happens as we find sessions like Sessions Band sessions.

167
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.790
It did manage to find a session and you can take my word for it or you can.

168
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.060
Well you shouldn't take my word for it you should definitely try it.

169
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.960
You should try removing the settings and see that you don't actually find any sessions as a result.

170
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.620
So congratulations we've actually managed to print out some sessions.

171
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.490
We've found sessions managed to print them out.

172
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.600
Next is going to be joining.

173
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.520
But before we get to joining sessions we want to have a bit of a nice interface here because obviously

174
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.110
what we've got so far is just a little bit of text telling us that it found the session.

175
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.180
We want to be able to get hit join get a server browser click on a server and hit join there.

176
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.510
So that is what we're going to be tackling next.
