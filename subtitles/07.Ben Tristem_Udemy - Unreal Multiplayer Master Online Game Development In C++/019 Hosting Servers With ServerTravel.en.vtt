00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.680
We are going to be creating a lobby area like this one here very empty and spacious.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.030
But what we're going to do is that from this lobby we'll be able to execute commands such as the host

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.290
command and this whole command is going to take us in to the game as the hosting server or the client

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.710
server which will allow other users to then come in and join this server.

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.550
In fact let me just show you an example of that.

7
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.320
Here I am loading in another client to connect in with my first server and my first client.

8
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.130
And let's see how that looks.

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.890
Here we go.

10
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.290
Success.

11
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.390
We manage to host from within the game.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.820
That's where you can learn to do in this lecture.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.620
Let's dive in and see how.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.400
So for starters with and joining and hosting we don't really want our users to be spawning in to this

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.130
level where they're going to be playing.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.560
That's just a little bit confusing especially when they are born in they're on their own.

17
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500
It kind of looks like something went wrong.

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.820
So let's start off by creating a lobby for our players to spawn up into and then from there they can

19
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.100
execute the console clones to go and host a server or join a server.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.260
So that kind of makes a bit more sense doesn't it as go into the content browser go up to the top of

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.130
that content browser go to the puzzle platforms and add a new level here.

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.040
In fact let's first add a new folder.

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.750
Call it maps.

24
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.180
And in the maps folder we are going to add a let's see a level call it lobbying.

25
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.280
And then it can open up said lobby.

26
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.210
So being a selected level as we go and you can see it's all black at the moment so maybe we want to

27
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.520
copy across a few of the things from our other level first and let's go back it up.

28
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.570
Down to the third person cvp Maps third person example.

29
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.670
And let's see what do I want to import from here.

30
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.100
And I want all the lighting and stuff.

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.700
So actually what might be slightly simpler is to start off with a copy of this level so I'm going to

32
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.720
backtrack just a little bit and we are going to duplicate the third person example map.

33
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.190
I'm going to call it the lobby.

34
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.580
I am going to move that up to root of my content by click and drag or expanding out the side first and

35
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.080
then clicking and dragging.

36
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.860
Or better yet let's expand out puzzle platforms and put it where we intend to put it so let's go to

37
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.650
maps delete the lobby that I just made.

38
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.350
Backtracking just a little bit and move the lobby from the third person cvp Maps to puzzle platform

39
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.240
maps.

40
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.360
Let's move it there.

41
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.230
And we've got ourselves a lobby which we can go ahead and open up saving the selected.

42
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.390
And obviously it looks the same except I'm going to strip it bare.

43
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.240
So what we're going to do is take all of these areas.

44
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.250
And delete them.

45
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.010
All right moving platforms that lovely moving platforms go ahead and delete them.

46
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.450
Make sure you are in the lobby as it can't tell.

47
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.850
Up here that I am.

48
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.600
Yeah.

49
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.880
I don't want to delete them though it's got references and so on and so forth.

50
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.690
And I'm just going make it really clear that they are in the lobby first by putting our place start

51
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.620
a little bit closer to the centre and pointing it at this text on the floor that says third person at

52
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.210
the moment.

53
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.420
It's going to be turned in to saying lobby.

54
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.570
So they clearly know that they are in the right sort of area.

55
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.950
So where do we have that text.

56
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.700
Little bit hard to get hold of.

57
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.400
We've got a floor.

58
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.290
We've got the war.

59
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.740
Text render actor that's the one.

60
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.670
Now I'm sure I can change the text that we get.

61
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.710
I can change that to a lobby.

62
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.740
So now if I go and play in this level you can see that I am in the lobby and I can get rid of that help

63
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.340
actor if possible because that doesn't seem very helpful.

64
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.840
We've got nothing there.

65
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.300
Go ahead and hit play that we are in the lobby.

66
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.160
It's quite clear that we're in the lobby.

67
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.360
So we would then be able to execute our consul commands from and here's this thing like host for example

68
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.940
they go.

69
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.420
I'm able to host.

70
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.590
Well except I'm not.

71
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.810
So that's the next bit to be able to actually implement hosting to host.

72
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.090
We have to be able to travel between maps.

73
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.150
Now let's take a little time to overview what it means to actually travel between maps.

74
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.220
Let's take a look at this slide so we've got a map here.

75
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.330
Here I have literally taken that analogy to mean the map of Europe and what happens is through some

76
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.710
process which you're going to look at in the next lecture.

77
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.460
Bit by bit player controllers will connect you to the map.

78
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.670
So one at a time.

79
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.100
A couple may join in and we've got three players all playing around in the same map.

80
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.280
Now what can happen is that the server can execute a command called server travel and say oh there's

81
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.580
another map I want you all to move over there server travel to map them the two in this case Africa.

82
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.420
Okay.

83
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:25.760
And now when that happens all the servers one by one have to reconnect to the new map and move themselves

84
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.830
in to the new map.

85
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.870
So the controllers don't get destroyed they just get moved in to a new map and that map gets loaded

86
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.510
on each of the individual clients if they're collected over the network and everyone gets is happy.

87
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.130
In the new place.

88
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.150
So that's what we want to do.

89
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.510
We want to have a server travel.

90
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.090
Now how is server travelling done that's Have a look of go over to our visual studio.

91
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.480
And the place we're going want to do this is in the host for now we're going to be adding to the bottom

92
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.550
here rather than overwriting a screen message we want to keep a screen message there.

93
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.330
Server Travelling is a function of the world that we're on.

94
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.240
So we're going to have to get hold of the world.

95
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.770
So it's you world is the type of the world going to get oh you well pointer for world.

96
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.580
And again that's going to equal to get world now get world can see return null As is something that

97
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.540
we always need to be worried about with pointers so I'm going to do a null check and early return just

98
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.520
like soap.

99
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.850
And now from that world pointer we can use the arrow operator to do a server travel.

100
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.610
Now for me I didn't need to include any headers.

101
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.510
Because it seems to be included already so we can do a server travel.

102
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.520
What is in that server travel let's go and have a look at that.

103
00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:01.420
So over in the chrome I've got the new world server travel now it takes in a U R L and also whether

104
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.420
it should be absolute and whether it should skip game notify.

105
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.780
Well these first two the second two rather are defaulting or ready to send values so all we need to

106
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.620
provide it with is a U R L.

107
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.520
So that you are real is exactly the same form as we were giving on the command line.

108
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.230
It starts with game.

109
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.360
And then so would vanish.

110
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.770
Game forward slash and then it's the U R L to your map which in our case let's go and reference that

111
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:44.680
it is third person C P P E forward slash maps forward slash third person example map.

112
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.340
Okay.

113
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.500
And that's the u r l.

114
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.490
So hopefully what this will do is travel us from our lobby to this other map.

115
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.390
Let's go ahead and build and see if it does what is intended.

116
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.110
So the build has successfully completed.

117
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.220
Let's go over to the UN real Ed and play in our lobby.

118
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.420
Okay here we are.

119
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.060
Now let's type in the host command.

120
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.830
And sure enough we are spawned in to our third person example map exactly as we would expect.

121
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.310
And what's going on in the background is that our player controllers being reconnected to the sample

122
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.750
map here.

123
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.780
Fantastic.

124
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.250
Okay so the point here though is not just to move into the example map it's Daschle host a game.

125
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.800
So how do we host a server using this example of travelling.

126
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.680
Well that's actually all done through the u r l.

127
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.180
You may have noticed that there isn't a command line.

128
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.520
There isn't an argument in server travel that says I want to be the host of this game that's actually

129
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.710
done as part of the year or else so let's take a look at what that means here.

130
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.490
There is a section on the command line arguments in the in real documentation on you are real parameters.

131
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.270
Now notice this little bit that we've got games maps and then question mark listen.

132
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.400
And this is part of the server options down here.

133
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.270
There are a few other server options as well such as is LAN match.

134
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.220
A is from invite a spectator only at the moment.

135
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.240
We are interested in listen which is specify a server as a licence server.

136
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.450
By this it means that you are a game that is playing but also listening to other people and that's what

137
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.370
we need to make as open for connections from the outside world.

138
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.550
Okay so let's go on over.

139
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:44.270
In two visual studio and put on the argument for listen like so and build and then give that a shot

140
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.980
build complete.

141
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.430
Let's go back in to unreel and play.

142
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.580
And we can go ahead and host.

143
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.860
And what you'll see is something not entirely different to what we saw before.

144
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:05.730
So now it's going to be a challenge to test that out both with listen and without.

145
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.230
Listen let's give that a shot.

146
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.540
What's your challenge definition.

147
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.500
Well it's to test hosting.

148
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:17.110
You're going to do that by well hosting a server just as I did by using the host command in the editor.

149
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.870
Then connect using a standalone game using basically exactly the same way as you would have connected

150
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.480
via IP address before.

151
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.540
And just try it out without the listen.

152
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.150
Argument in the U R L and see what happens so pause a video and have a go at this challenge.

153
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.290
Okay welcome back.

154
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:46.370
Let's dive right into this so I am going to go ahead and spawn up our server in unreel so going to type

155
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.030
in the host command and hosts are now hosting apparently.

156
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.960
So let's go ahead and create a standalone game and try and join in.

157
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.240
So I'm going to do this actually with power shell so power shell is very much like a command prompt

158
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.780
on Windows.

159
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.830
Now Mac this is.

160
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.530
You don't have.

161
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.500
This isn't relevant because you are a Mac.

162
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.370
Turmoil is already super fantastic anyway but command print on Windows is a little bit rubbish.

163
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.380
So power chelles just a little bit better.

164
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.460
And I didn't introduce to this at first because it has a few more complications but one of the nice

165
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:26.150
things about it is that it lets you scroll back through your history of commands so you don't have to

166
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.680
go typing them in every single time.

167
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.260
So here for example I've got a history of running my game with a log.

168
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:41.720
And with a map and you'll notice there's just one syntactic difference between power shell and command

169
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:49.110
prompt and that is that the command has to begin with the ampersand with B and symbol.

170
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.600
That's just a weird quirk.

171
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.570
Don't worry about the details of what this might mean.

172
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.030
It's really not super super important.

173
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.500
Okay so what I can do now is I can edit that command and just remove the map and replace that map with

174
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:10.620
the local IP address 1 and 2 not 1 6 8 for me 1 99.

175
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:17.090
Your IP address may vary and I am going to launch that up to connect in that to our listeners server

176
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.700
that is hosting in the editor.

177
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.220
Here comes the game lets see whether its worked well.

178
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.810
Im very excited.

179
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.980
Here I am.

180
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.110
And is my other dude.

181
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.550
Look it doesn't look like we have ended up in the same place.

182
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:40.060
Well if we take a look at the log for the client and you'll notice that what we've got here is a warning

183
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:46.130
saying travel failure failed to load package and then you'll notice the map is a bit messed up by this.

184
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.610
P eyes zero string okay what could be going on there.

185
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:56.230
Well I reckon the issue is probably that we are mixing something playing in the editor with a standalone

186
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.220
game so let's try and do these both as standalone games.

187
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:10.450
So what I'm going to do is launch up a game that is in our lobby so it's going to be forward slash game

188
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.120
forward slash puzzles or platforms.

189
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.060
Forward slash maps.

190
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.760
Forward slash lobby.

191
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.920
Let's load that up.

192
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.080
And here it comes.

193
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.590
See if we are indeed in the lobby.

194
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.310
No we're not.

195
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.970
So it hasn't actually loaded up the map that I would expect it to.

196
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.580
Let's go and see why that is.

197
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.580
Has it given us any warnings while trying to load up the map.

198
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.290
Go up near the top.

199
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.550
No no no warnings there.

200
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.430
We're going back into unreal.

201
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:52.870
It does look like our lobby is actually not saved so let's make sure that we save the lobby.

202
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.770
These are all issues that you might run into.

203
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.120
So just running through them here.

204
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.120
And let's try launching up hour after closing down the game.

205
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.970
First let's go and try and launch up again that game with the lobby.

206
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.140
Okay this time had more luck.

207
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:17.040
We're actually in the lobby this time so I'm going to open up the console and host.

208
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.460
Okay.

209
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.050
So this guy is now hosting.

210
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.790
Let's launch up another game this time try.

211
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.040
This time we'll connect in rather than launching up a map.

212
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.860
Well let's see whether it's working as intended and we're actually going to connect in together.

213
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.390
Okay.

214
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:41.350
More like this time as you can see there are now two of us in this map and we are sharing the same map.

215
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.460
And as you can see the one that had hosted is here.

216
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.620
And the other one is the one that we connected in.

217
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.750
So this has worked.

218
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.860
There was an issue when trying to do it hosting one from the editor and the other one joining in so

219
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.370
that we can't easily combine.

220
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:06.280
That's a good learning that we can't easily combine Ed hosted and non-edited to host it.

221
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:12.550
And then I would like you to go ahead and just try without the list option what you find is that they

222
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.380
won't actually connect in together because one of them won't actually be a listening server.

223
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.880
So that's also a useful thing for you to see.

224
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.110
Okay so that's great.

225
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.970
We've now created a mechanism to host from within the game the next lecture we're going to create the

226
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.930
mechanism to join from within the game.

227
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.080
So I'm looking forward to seeing you in that next year.
