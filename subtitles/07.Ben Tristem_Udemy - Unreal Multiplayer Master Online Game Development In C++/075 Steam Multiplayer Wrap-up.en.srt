00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,270
Welcome to the end of the season multiplayer section and what a fun section it's been.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,510
Right.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,260
We've been able to go from only connecting overland and v.p Ends and messing around with UI.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:22,080
And we've got it to the stage where we actually are connecting over the Internet with people you know

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,260
we can put it out there on Facebook.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,440
We can put this game out there on it and let people play the game without having to have any funky coupland's

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,560
that we're amateur any command line stuff.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,770
And it's a big step.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,580
Big step to be able to connect that way.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,720
So I'm really excited to see what you guys come up with with just the abilities that we've got so far

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,550
we've got a lot we can do with game play.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,850
I want to see what games you design.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,020
I want to see you playing them with each other and I want to see different lobbying mechanics maybe

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,460
different game mode mechanics and things like that and use your knowledge from this section just go

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,890
a little bit further and share in the community website share on Facebook group share in discord and

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,530
get playing with friends and see what the experiences get.

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,820
Game play testing.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,540
Yeah basically that's my challenge to you.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,980
Go out there and create something novel and play it with other people.
