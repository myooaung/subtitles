1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,260
Welcome.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,450
In this video we're going to be polishing off the last bit of you.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,530
That doesn't work which is our join button on the second joins green.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,150
So now that we've got our join game submenu pop up.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,640
And we want to be able to type in an IP address and we want to then hit the join button and be able

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
to go to that IP address.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,620
And sure enough as I have just done I have gone and joined in a game that was hosting on my own machine

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,580
and I'm able to play with the dude over here.

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,660
Fantastic.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,610
So that's pretty much the I entirely sorted at the end of this lecture.

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,430
So let's dive in and see how it's achieved.

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,900
So our menu is starting to take shape.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,300
We are able to host we're able to join and go to a different menu go back from that menu type in our

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,210
IP address hit the Joined by and but nothing happens.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,630
So we're going to have to fix that join button pretty damn soon.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,050
But before we do that I just want to fix one annoyance one pet peeve that I have which is that if I

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:16,320
play the game from the filesystems if I go to my you project right click on my you project and then

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,620
go to launch game and then we'll see that the game actually ends up launching doesn't start off with

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,490
the main menu which is kind of silly really because that's the whole point.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,990
That's the whole reason that we've been having our our game set up this way.

21
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,090
And at the moment it's still showing up in the lobby which is not ideal although it does still have

22
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,880
the old functionality so it does still work.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,250
So now that we have pretty much surpassed that with the functionality of our menu or we will have done

24
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,230
by the end of this lecture I would just might go ahead and set up the correct.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,610
Start up level as a starting point so let's go ahead and do that.

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,130
We remember how to do it in the settings and it's in project settings.

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,710
And then we go and look for the start up.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,290
Map and so on eds start-up map let's have a look instead for default.

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,630
Default mode then we got default maps.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,310
And sure enough under here we've got a game default map which I'm going to go ahead and swap over to

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,930
our main menu and while we're at it.

32
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,450
I'm going to change the the edita default start-up map to Main Menu as well because in this particular

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,790
project we're all about that main menu and that's what we really want to be seeing and testing out.

34
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,730
So up next we want to make that join submenu actually do something to make that happen.

35
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,110
We need to get the IP address from the text field when we hit the join button how we're going to do

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,380
that.

37
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,250
I hear you ask.

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,390
Well it's very much the same as we've been doing everything else.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,790
We are going to bind the text field into our C++.

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:05,040
So let's go and have a look first in our widget blueprint and take a look at the text editable text

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,310
box that we've got here.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,170
Sure enough there we go.

43
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,800
We've got an editor will text box somewhere and I want to hover over this to see what the class is for

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,930
our edits look editable box.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,060
So I will hover over this.

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,670
It's not telling me anything so I'm assuming that it's an edible text box is actually the name of the

47
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,360
component so we can go and check this out in our C++.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,540
Let's hop head on over into visual studio.

49
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,130
And go to our menu and Dot H.

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,110
And she know we're going to be doing this in the C++ at the top of the C++ like we did last time with

51
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,420
our widgets which we want to include the editable text box.

52
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,950
So let's try them out.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Hash include quote components.

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,890
And then editable text box sure enough editable text box is right there.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,600
Fantastic.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,310
That's exactly what we're looking for.

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,250
That means that you a text box is going to be the component type so we can go into our head a file and

58
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,880
you could be following along very quickly with this at this point because we've done this many times

59
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,520
before.

60
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,460
So I am going to call this the IP address.

61
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,250
It's going to be a new property.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,360
It's just copy and paste this.

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,620
I'm not copying and pasting because I've got something in the clipboard.

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,310
I'm going to paste that there so I'm going to copy the any bind with it really anything will do.

65
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,240
It's got all the same structure to it.

66
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,150
So we take our editorial text box that I copied and try not to scroll in and out too much.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,760
Let's go back to a normal level and let's paste in.

68
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,750
And the type that the editable text box is going to be you editable text box and the name of the property

69
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,130
isn't.

70
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,110
We join menu but rather the IP address.

71
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,800
Address field.

72
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,380
We can take this IP address field name and go over into our editor.

73
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:12,780
And rename that editable text box component to whole widget to the IP address field so we'd then have

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,580
a way of it being found by the C++.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,300
Let's make sure all of that works.

76
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,020
Let's go ahead and build that compile is successful.

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,280
So something has certainly been done correctly.

78
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:33,870
Let's go ahead and have a look at what we're going to do with this editable text box field that we just

79
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,750
created.

80
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,730
If we go to initialise then at least here we can use it to have a look at our auto complete.

81
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,640
In fact I shouldn't do the auto complete trick because that's not fair on the people on Mac.

82
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,350
Who for whom auto complete isn't necessarily as straightforward So let's have a look at the documentation

83
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,420
which is just as good.

84
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,510
Here are the edible text box documentation's which are in again the links of your lecture.

85
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,220
Let's have a look at what could be going on here let's just do a little scan of the variables.

86
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,330
Do a little scan of the functions and see what we get.

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,730
So we've got a set text that might be handy.

88
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,490
Got set.

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,070
Hint text.

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,120
We have got set text and we've got get text as well as having some properties along here.

91
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,720
Some variables that is one called text one called text.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,280
DELEGATE.

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,180
Not entirely sure what the text delegate would do but we could always find out if we wanted to.

94
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,150
A set where there is a password or is read only and other such cool niceties.

95
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,100
So that's going to be quite useful for.

96
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,670
So it's your challenge time to call the join function we are going to be making that join dialogue functional

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,380
the way we're going to do this is to hook up that join button to actually do something.

98
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:54,060
Going to tweak the interface as appropriate and call the join function and test it thoroughly so pause

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,300
the video and have a go at this challenge.

100
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,950
Okay welcome back.

101
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,250
Let's dive right into this.

102
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,060
So first things first I am going to go over to visual studio.

103
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,350
And.

104
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,200
I am going to bind that second join button the join button that is on the join screen itself.

105
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,830
So you see we've got a joint but we've got a cancelled join menu button.

106
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,390
And I am going to do a join join menu button so let's try that one out.

107
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,230
It's going to be a little bit of a weird name so let's actually think of maybe a better name.

108
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,140
Maybe something like that confirmed join menu button something like that.

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,220
I think cancelling confirm makes more sense than join join menus.

110
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,150
They might just think I made a typo.

111
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,830
And that would just be silly wouldn't they.

112
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,790
So Will do and confirmed join many button.

113
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,870
I'm going to take that and copy it in to the editor.

114
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,010
And I am going to go to the actually find the join button itself which is currently called button underscored

115
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,860
to helpfully named after and I'll change that to the Confirm join menu button.

116
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,340
We can go ahead and hit build on our visual studio project file.

117
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,690
Like so.

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,290
And in the meantime let's think about what we're going to do with our confirm.

119
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,340
Join menu button Well for starters we're going to want to call a function.

120
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:28,260
And I think I'm going to create a function next to the host server called join server and I can just

121
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:35,820
go ahead and copy this as a starting point and we'll call it join server and join server is what we're

122
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,700
going to connect our confirm and join menu button up too.

123
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,160
So I'm going to do that over in the C++ and copy basically cancel cancel join many button.

124
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,910
And use that as the starting point.

125
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:57,950
Also going to copy be confirmed join menu button name identifier and replace it in that copied code

126
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,320
that has been fed a quick set up.

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:10,340
Next up I'm going to copy the join server declaration into C++ just after our host server deck definition

128
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,010
in the C++ is where I'm going to implement it.

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,760
Implement the body remove semicolon.

130
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,100
Do the namespace.

131
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,650
Okay so that's the join server done.

132
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,140
We just now need to hook it up in the binding and dynamic.

133
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,560
So I will copy the name in fact the whole namespace name or copy that.

134
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,030
Including all the semicolons.

135
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,390
And I will paste that in to add dynamic.

136
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,230
Basically I always copy and paste things I don't use very much memory.

137
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,090
Maybe that's because my memory's not particularly good.

138
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,980
I just learn to copy and paste things really quickly and I find that really helpful.

139
00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:01,600
So the next thing to do is we've got join server and we want to call our menu interface with a join

140
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,620
call but we don't have a join call yet.

141
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,670
So let's go ahead and open up our menu interface.

142
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,710
Dot H.

143
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,540
Remember this the only the DOS H that we actually care about.

144
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,800
That's where we want to implement our join.

145
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
But what's the signatories going to be.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,450
Well to find that out we can go to our game instance and see what the signature of join currently is.

147
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:28,200
Go to our puzzle platform game instance dot H and find the join function which is on line 30 for me

148
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,240
and it takes an F string konst reference.

149
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:37,630
So I'm going to take that over to my menu and face.

150
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,680
And I am going to paste it in them.

151
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:48,700
It's going to be virtual because like host we want it to be implemented by subclasses in this case the

152
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:55,240
game instance and we want it to be a pure virtual which means we need to put an equal zero at the end.

153
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,890
To make sure that it has no implementation and the compiler will be fine with the fact that it has no

154
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,560
implementation now because we've chosen exactly the same signature I don't have to worry about implementing

155
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,360
it in the game instance.

156
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,230
We know that it's already implemented there.

157
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:16,230
So I'm going to go over into my menu not see P P and do a null check for the menu interface so it's

158
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,270
going to be an if menu interface.

159
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,960
Not equal now.

160
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,080
No pointer.

161
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,550
And then we can do the body of our IF which is going to be menu interface.

162
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,960
Arrow and then we are going to call and join.

163
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,900
Except we need to pasek in F string so how are we going to get hold of that f string.

164
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,230
Let's create a string variable here.

165
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,390
Which is going to be the address.

166
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,440
And what are we going to.

167
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
Well and let's pass that into it.

168
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,810
Join as well.

169
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,610
So what are we going to set that address from.

170
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,940
Well you may have guessed it is coming from the field.

171
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,600
So let's figure out how we get hold of that let's go and have a look at our documentation again.

172
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,720
There is a function that I thought was pretty promising when I looked through it the first time which

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,050
was get text which returns an F text object.

174
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,030
Let's have a look at the F text documentation as well.

175
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,660
And sure enough.

176
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,220
There's somewhere in here let's have a look for just search for f string.

177
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,560
Somewhere I think there will be a conversion to an F string.

178
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,030
Build source string.

179
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,050
Doesn't sound like it.

180
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,750
From string there's a from string I think there'll be a two string somewhere.

181
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,860
There may just be a two string so let's have a look for that.

182
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,730
Yep sure enough there is a two string.

183
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,160
It just wasn't showing up in the search because there's these ellipses or dot dot dot after an F string.

184
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,530
So that is all okay so we can do a two string on the straight.

185
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,570
The text we get back.

186
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,170
So it's going to be what's the name of our property.

187
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:18,620
Again I'll go to the main many dates to refresh my poor memory and it is called IP address field.

188
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,740
Go back into the C++ IP address field.

189
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,230
It's going to be an arrow.

190
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,710
Then it is going to be get text.

191
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,580
And then we are going to do on the text.

192
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,090
I believe it's an F text so it will just be a dot.

193
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,970
And then it be.

194
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,640
Let's see we said it was a two string.

195
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,660
Sure enough it is.

196
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,840
And that's a return a string for us to put into the string.

197
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,420
Now if we want to be careful about memory usage then we can make this a contest f string reference and

198
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,200
if you're not comfortable with why that is you don't have to use it like that either.

199
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,800
Okay so we've just returned.

200
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,750
A constant string reference from our IP address.

201
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,140
Get a text field and we're passing it in to join.

202
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,040
Fantastic.

203
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,600
So this is all great.

204
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,890
I'm just a little bit paranoid about our IP address field being null So I'm just going to do a little

205
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,630
check.

206
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,120
For the IP address field.

207
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,740
There we go.

208
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,970
So now it will return if our IP address field is not good.

209
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,050
So let's go ahead and build that and see whether Now when we hit a join button we're calling the right

210
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,350
thing.

211
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm also going to check against the challenge definition that I've done everything that I said I would

212
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,260
do.

213
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,510
Hook up the join button tweak the interface.

214
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,170
Yeah we've tweaked the interface we call the join function and we then have our testing it.

215
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,830
That's the last step on the process.

216
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,280
Okay.

217
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,630
Successful build.

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,830
So that's step one done at least we've got a successful build.

219
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,470
Hardest part sometimes is to get the bill to succeed.

220
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,170
And I'm being lucky in these videos because I'm not showing you too many of the build failures so that

221
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,570
must be either me improving or just preparing well.

222
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,530
So let's go ahead and try and join when you go to and type in an IP address.

223
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,290
And join.

224
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,680
And you can see is definitely calling the write function.

225
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,900
Because we've got our little green join now there isn't a server running.

226
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,640
So this is actually going to do anything.

227
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:37,740
So let's close this down and go ahead and launch a server from our puzzle platforms folder and right

228
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,630
click on the project.

229
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,230
Launch game.

230
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,890
And I'm going to do that twice so that we have two games.

231
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,330
Here I am in game number one in this game.

232
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm going to host.

233
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,310
And then I'm going to go over into my game number two.

234
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,950
And I'm going to join from there.

235
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,570
And my IP address is 1 9 2 1 6 8 dot 1 ninety I believe.

236
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,840
Let's go and join.

237
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,730
There I am I am ingame.

238
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,710
It's not quite working.

239
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,420
I've got.

240
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,100
But shot at the moment.

241
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:21,410
But if I go in to the host game that does have control.

242
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,950
Then we definitely can see that there is another player there.

243
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,590
This is a good start.

244
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:33,490
So let's go ahead and go to our menu and figure out what's going on.

245
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,110
Okay so you may guess it.

246
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,360
You may think that okay we've gone and joined and we got exactly the same problem as host.

247
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,160
So hopefully you have drawn your conclusions and you have pointed the finger of blame at the game in

248
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,790
since.

249
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,130
Which is not removing the menu when it is moving onto a new level.

250
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,410
So to do that we will go to our game instance dot s.p..

251
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,640
We will find that culprit to join function.

252
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,780
Another beginning of it.

253
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,650
If we have a menu we are going to tear down said menu.

254
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:10,310
So just the same as we do in our host We're going to do in our join.

255
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,850
Go ahead and build that and see if we can test it.

256
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,830
Okay.

257
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:20,130
The build has succeeded at least so let's go over to the puzzle platform folder and in there we're going

258
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,500
to launch up a couple more games again to try this a second time launch game right click the launch

259
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,410
game and then we will be able to host a game and hopefully join the game this time.

260
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,080
So Game 1 and 2 have loaded I'm going to host from this particular game and I'm going to go and stand

261
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,690
on the cube just to say hi to the user that's going to be joining in very soon.

262
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:48,040
And let's go over in to our other instance of the game.

263
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,120
Hit the join button.

264
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,910
Take us to another menu we go to one line to add up 1 6 8 again.

265
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,670
1.

266
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,710
90.

267
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,690
And we hit join hasar.

268
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,640
We are in the right level we have control.

269
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,790
We can jump around on the same block as our other dude.

270
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,240
And the other dude is now here and he can control as well.

271
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,480
And we're all happy.

272
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,600
Everything is working fantastically all from the menu.

273
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,080
So a few more polishing tweaks to be done but mostly that's it that's mostly the menu completely polished

274
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,520
off.

275
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,250
So Pat yourselves on the back and I'll see you for the next couple of videos.

276
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,700
Well just be rounding this whole thing off.
