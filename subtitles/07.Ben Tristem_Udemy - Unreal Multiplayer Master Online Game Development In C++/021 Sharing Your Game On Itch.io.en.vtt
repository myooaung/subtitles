00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.070
Welcome.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.060
So in this lecture you can tell I'm in a very familiar environment.

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.740
Our lobby except something a little different about how I launched up our game and that is that I launched

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.030
it not from an executable on my computer but one that I downloaded through it.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.670
It was a service for sharing games for indy's it's completely free to use unlike Steve.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.610
So what you can do is create your own landing page just like this basic one that I've got here.

7
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.570
And we're going to show you how to do that how to upload your builds and why it's so cool to do it through

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.770
the app and why it's so much more secure so you can hit the launch button here.

9
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.710
Once you've downloaded the game and it will just fire up the game like this on any of your friends or

10
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.670
other coast udts computers let's figure out how we can do this.

11
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.130
So the first step as you might expect to getting to sharing a game with your friends and family is to

12
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.740
build that game.

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.220
Now we are going to be mostly building for p.s. and Mac.

14
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.150
You can obviously do things on Android and IAW.

15
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.720
But generally speaking we're going to be targeting those two platforms and here's how we do it.

16
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.770
We're going to start off by building our game and then we'll talk about where we're going to share it

17
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.300
so let's go over into unreel now.

18
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.210
And the way to bill is very straightforward and very simple you just go to file.

19
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.440
Package project.

20
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.900
And then you select the platform you want to build for either Windows or Mac.

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240
Now if you're on Mac you can only build for macra if you on Windows you can only have windows you can't

22
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.240
cross build for each other.

23
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.560
Not not in any meaningful way.

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.410
You have to be on the platform that you want to use.

25
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.740
So I won't go ahead and build for Windows 64 bit.

26
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.170
Now it's gone ask me where I want to put that so if I navigate to my project.

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.230
And let's see where that where we are there.

28
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.870
So this is the great project and we don't have a folder to put builds in yet so I suggest you create

29
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:11.580
a new folder and do name it build because that is a kind of a default a convention if you like.

30
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.130
And if we select that folder Let me show you why I chose to do that if we go over to my project and

31
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.190
at the root of the a real project you'll notice I've got a ignore which we covered in the source control

32
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.330
lecture by open that in any text editor of our choice.

33
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.560
I'm going to open it up in a text editor called atom but you could use Notepad you could use anything

34
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.460
you like to open up that ignored file.

35
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.270
And we're going to notice that there's a bunch of stuff in here lots of things being ignored some deep

36
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.000
deals and all sorts stuff.

37
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.760
But the interesting thing is that build or build forward slash star which means anything under build

38
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.990
it's being ignored which means that if we put files in build they won't go into version control which

39
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.640
is great because we don't want them in version control.

40
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.570
So while that's building and that can take a while to build it we head back into Unreal.

41
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.060
You can see at the moment is doing a process called Cooking which will take quite a while like real

42
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.320
cooking I guess.

43
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.270
And what we're going to want while we're doing that is somewhere to share the game.

44
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.270
Now I'm going to introduce you to a service called H Di O or just H.

45
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.970
And it's a great place to share indie games because unlike steam they don't require a 100 pound sign

46
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.620
up fee.

47
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.060
You can get started and sharing for free.

48
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.340
So if you aren't already a member on it or haven't heard of it before then go ahead and register your

49
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.420
register yourself.

50
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.870
Now I already have an account as you might guess I'm against just go ahead and log in with said account.

51
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.320
But two accounts in fact one for getting their TV in one for myself and you end up on a page like this

52
00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.360
once you log in and is indeed prompting you to upload your first project to die out.

53
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.330
Else go and do that.

54
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.460
Create a new project and we're going to be creating a project for the puzzle platform so I'm going to

55
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.480
call this.

56
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.520
Puzzle platforms.

57
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.400
Demo it automatically generate a yourself for me and I can give it a short tagline or description which

58
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.080
I believe goes in the top of the page.

59
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.520
I was going to go with a cheesy tagalong like tackle moving platforms with friends.

60
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.370
Now we get to classify our game.

61
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.520
I'm going to choose to classify it as a game rather than as a book or a sound track or a tool.

62
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.080
The kind of project.

63
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.390
Now here's an interesting one you've got a couple of options downloadable h.m.s. Flash Java applet unity.

64
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.660
Now obviously we're not unity and we're not really building anything that you can play in the browser

65
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.270
so the only option we have left is a downloadable.

66
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.050
And that's what we're going to go with because we're going to have downloadable executables on a project

67
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.920
page and a little bit more about the security about that in a minute.

68
00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.040
Next up you've got your release status you can choose from a number of preset release statuses.

69
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.360
I'm going to go with prototype at this stage.

70
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.850
You can choose the pricing model so people really enjoy your game.

71
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.570
They can pay or donate so you can have a zero price or donate.

72
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.700
You can have paid in which case you give a minimum price for people to download the game and you can

73
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.890
have no payments if you basically don't want to deal with people donating to you which I'm going to

74
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.050
go with for now.

75
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.340
And then we'll have uploads which we'll see in a minute.

76
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.950
Once our file has built description that this ongoing copy from the description for our gitte have repo.

77
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.330
So that's it her voice passion real multiplayer.

78
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.340
And we have our puzzle platforms repo there.

79
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.980
With a description at the top of the page.

80
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.580
And that's what I'm going to go ahead and stick in.

81
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.610
I know.

82
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.400
Next up we get to choose John right now Milagro for platform as my John.

83
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.280
You can add lots of tags in here like unreel 64 bit to any of the art styles you're going for to help

84
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.060
people find your game.

85
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.960
You can choose a custom noun.

86
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.020
That's a bit weird but the default is game so it will talk about your game as being a game or you could

87
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.680
call it amazing VR experience or something like that.

88
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.840
If that's what it is or amazing multiplayer experience it's really up to you what you choose the acustom

89
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.070
now.

90
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.660
I'm going to leave it as it is.

91
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.620
Next up you've got a community option.

92
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.180
So we're almost at the end of the options now and there's quite a few but we got there now.

93
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.240
You can allow comments you can disable comments you can have a discussion board at all sorts of stuff.

94
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.110
Here you can figure that out I'm sure.

95
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.710
And then we've got visibility and we'll talk a little bit about visibility in a moment so you've got

96
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.200
a draft where you can share a secret link restricted where only people with a password can access the

97
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.890
page and public.

98
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.630
Which ones.

99
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.350
I've got something to view and saved.

100
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.210
I can make it public.

101
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.190
So we've got the start of a game.

102
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.260
I'm going to go ahead and save that page to carry on with later.

103
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.150
And you see it takes me to this site to my page with a welcome message of welcome message.

104
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.580
And he goes you can see a very basic page at this stage but you can really spruce up there's an edit

105
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.410
theme button here that allows it to choose background colours allows you to choose background images

106
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.170
and banners and so on and so forth.

107
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.430
And if you want to see what's possible then just go and browse around it.

108
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.810
Is website just going to go in another tab and show you that something like the ones that are on the

109
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.500
top page.

110
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.510
Here you go and click on those.

111
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.330
Then they've got really cool banners and they really don't look like they're part of it IO at all.

112
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.230
They just look like cool landing pages for games.

113
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.980
So it can really help you get started on landing pages like that.

114
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.890
So I'm going to close that example down.

115
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.750
Now as I mentioned I was going to talk about security.

116
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:55.530
So here you've got a website that allows you to upload random executables and download other people's

117
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.270
random executables.

118
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.760
Now if that sounds dodgy to you then you've got a good sense of security because you shouldn't be downloading

119
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.530
it executing a random people's executables generally very bad idea.

120
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:14.780
So sure distribute the link around but encourage people to use the H dot IO app instead of the website.

121
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:20.220
The reason for that is that if you use the app it will run the executables inside what's called a sandbox

122
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.200
a sandbox basically protects your computer from the executable.

123
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.720
Make sure that it can't access anything outside the science sandbox so it can't delete your files access

124
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.510
your bank details or anything scary like that.

125
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.590
To download the dyre app then you just go to the website and there is a download link in the left hand

126
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.140
bar.

127
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.270
There's also often a banner at the top talking about the downloads you can download it and it looks

128
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.130
like this very very similar to the website itself.

129
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.900
You've got basically what is essentially a browser in here.

130
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.310
And you can see it's got back buttons a refresh button a you are albar.

131
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.640
And when you open up multiple games it opens them up as tabs here so that you can always navigate between

132
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.140
a few open games that you've got you can buy them you can download them in the app and fundamentally

133
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.860
you can play them.

134
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.800
So let me go ahead and show you from my library I've got an example of a game it's called tangent.

135
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.510
It was part of the ludum Dare game challenge and built in 48 hours.

136
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.390
It's quite fun.

137
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.520
What fun little games shows you what possible in a very short space of time.

138
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.110
I've already gone ahead and downloaded this and once you've downloaded the game you'll see that there

139
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.120
is a launch button.

140
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.720
If you click this launch button then it will go ahead and fire up that game inside the sandbox.

141
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.600
As I mentioned.

142
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.650
And you can see it is totally playable as I'm doing now.

143
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:48.340
But without any risk of a random executable to my computer which is always a good thing so I highly

144
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:54.590
highly recommend you use the H app for playing games that are downloadable.

145
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.210
Obviously if you're playing it on the website itself there is an issue there.

146
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.960
So next up let's go ahead and share the game that we've just built on it.

147
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.940
I know that's going to be your challenge.

148
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.460
To share your game.

149
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.320
First of all build it like we just did create an itch game.

150
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.240
Like I just did.

151
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.680
You'll probably need to create an account if you haven't done so already upload upload your game to

152
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.030
it.

153
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.530
I oh there was a field for it.

154
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.720
You're going to have to zip it up first.

155
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.530
You can't just upload a folder So you're going to have to create a zip of that which on whichever operating

156
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.790
system you're on that should be fairly easy to do.

157
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:35.830
And go ahead and share it with a friend and see can they download it in the IO app.

158
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.140
Are there any issues.

159
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.580
Can you figure them out.

160
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.590
So do it with a patient friend has what I'm talking about and do it maybe with another course student

161
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.320
using the forums to coordinate or using discord.

162
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.640
Pause video and have a go.

163
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.270
Okay welcome back.

164
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.330
So let's have a go at creating our own game now in games.

165
00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.800
Just minimize the entire App for now and show you how to upload from within the web.

166
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.370
So we've got our puzzle platforms demo project that I've already created.

167
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.490
Let's go ahead and edit the game.

168
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.490
And on the edited editing page we've got an upload files button as I mentioned.

169
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.840
It won't just take folders.

170
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.070
So we need to go ahead and zip up the game and go over to my puzzle platforms directory.

171
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.560
I'm going to go in to the build folder.

172
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.050
And you'll notice in the build folder.

173
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.160
Unreal has created this folder called Windows.

174
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.110
No editor.

175
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.070
That is the build for Windows.

176
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.320
Obviously as the name suggests it runs without the editor it's a standalone game you can try it out

177
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.730
if you go and open it up and double click on the puzzle platform.

178
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.910
Scott XY.

179
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.540
Then it loads up very much as it would when we were launching it from the command line.

180
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:57.120
And obviously you've got access to the console like we did there so you can go ahead and host a game

181
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.490
if I get my completion right.

182
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.930
And you'll notice that especially on Windows you get a firewall alert saying do you want to allow access

183
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.270
to this executable.

184
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.120
Obviously you don't want to allow access.

185
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.560
If you want it to be able to play over the Internet which of course we do.

186
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:19.370
So here we are playing around inside the level and testing.

187
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.840
Okay so that's how the build works.

188
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.380
Let's go ahead and make it in to a zip file as I was suggesting go up the bill folder.

189
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.920
I'm going to right click on the windows no edit.

190
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.300
Then I'm going to go.

191
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.340
I've got a rather long right hand right click menu here.

192
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:47.020
The reason for that being I've got just a lot of Ed extensions and we want to go down that to the send

193
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.210
to compress the zip folder.

194
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.510
That's just the windows built in zipping tool and you see it create a zip called Windows.

195
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.300
No edit.

196
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.900
That's exactly what I want.

197
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.700
Now that's completed we can go ahead and copy that path using whichever way you want right click or

198
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:13.390
cattrell see or get a copy path button on the Windows Explorer you can put it there and then we are

199
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.360
going to hop over into it.

200
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:22.750
I Oh and upload files and I can paste in the path for that build that I wanted.

201
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.360
And you can see it'll start uploading.

202
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:33.800
Now you can do this via a Dropbox upload so you dont have to upload via the browser if thats convenient

203
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.400
for you can do it that way.

204
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:41.900
And also if youre very command line sapi DO check out their tool call them Butler which allows you to

205
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.560
upload your bills directly from the folders and there's some pretty clever stuff like if you have already

206
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.060
upload the bill before and this is just a new version.

207
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:58.120
It will only upload the changes so you won't have to upload massive games every single time.

208
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.790
Very good.

209
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.800
If you've got limited bandwidth on your Internet or you upload speeds particularly poor then Butler

210
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.420
will save you a lot of upload bandwidth.

211
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.520
Do go ahead and read their documentation.

212
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:15.920
It's here with get started and with the knowledge that you have about the command line that we've used.

213
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.580
You might be able to figure it out.

214
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.780
There's an extra little bonus challenge for you to try and figure out if you can use to upload to the

215
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.750
game project that you've created here in the browser.

216
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.400
Another thing you might do to consider sprucing up your game page and making it more likely that people

217
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:39.640
want to download your game is to include a little cover image and perhaps a game play video on YouTube.

218
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.560
This way people dont have to download the game to see what theyre getting into.

219
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.960
Really helpful.

220
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.700
And some screenshots and things like that will also really really help.

221
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.380
All that kind of visual marketing and selling is going to help you both get your friends to download.

222
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.670
I know that your friends and you think oh theyll download anything that you put on Facebook but it needs

223
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.740
to be pretty otherwise people really are lazy and don't bother to download your game and see how cool

224
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.290
it is.

225
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.590
You want to show them how cool it is right off the bat.

226
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:16.760
So when sharing is often best to share with a public visibility or access if you go to the bottom going

227
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.910
to save that as public you can configure the settings a little bit further.

228
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.200
For example you could disable downloads or line not sure why you'd want to do that.

229
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.880
Or you can market as unlisted so that when people search for it they're not going to find it up to you

230
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.450
whether you are a bit shy and don't want it to be listed.

231
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:41.070
You can put it like that so they'll only be able to find it if they know that you are real to your game.

232
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.330
Now the reason you might you want to do public rather than draft or restrict it is because draft and

233
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.510
restricted will not allow you to download in the entire App.

234
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.010
Only public will allow you to download.

235
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.860
Let's head back up and see whether the download is finished.

236
00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.190
Upload I should say.

237
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.630
Yes it has.

238
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.990
Okay so now we can see what options we've got with that upload.

239
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.000
First of all we've got the drop down which says executable you can choose what kind of download it is

240
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:13.070
maybe it's not executable maybe it's source code or that book or a documentation a mod a graphical asset

241
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.650
blob of as an executable So that's what the default is fine.

242
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.360
Next you get to choose the platform the executable is for.

243
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.240
Mine is for Windows.

244
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.890
I'm going to check that one off.

245
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.240
You can also hide this file prevents from being downloaded.

246
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.890
You probably only do that if it was something that you were using as part of your description because

247
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.200
it really doesn't.

248
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.730
It's not very useful if you want to upload a game.

249
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.000
The other important thing you can do is change the display name windows no editor is obviously a very

250
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.520
terrible display names.

251
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.290
I'm going to call it Windows 64 bit.

252
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.820
That's a much better display name.

253
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.270
And there you go.

254
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.350
Windows 64 bit and it will download that when there's no edits sip.

255
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.570
Obviously you could have changed the name of the windows no editor zip in the first place.

256
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.360
So I'm going to make it public.

257
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:03.810
I'm going to make it unlisted at this point because I'm a bit shy and I'm going to go ahead and save

258
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.100
the game and go and view the page and see what it looks like.

259
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.780
So they go.

260
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.980
Now we've got a description and a download button that says Windows 64 bit.

261
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.780
And I go ahead and click it I'll of it they download it.

262
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.990
But I want to show you that we can also go ahead and find this in the editor so copy you orell.

263
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.190
Ed I mean the app.

264
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.730
Let's go over to itch and I just want to show you how we would get to that you are up so we could try

265
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.060
putting it in the search bar.

266
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.060
But I think we wouldn't get very far with that.

267
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.260
Indeed we don't.

268
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.630
It looks a bit weird I in fact have no idea what just happened there so we can go to the doctor I know.

269
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.270
Element in the sidebar and you'll notice that we can't change the U R L there so you might think oh

270
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.990
no we can't use you or else.

271
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.900
Actually we can.

272
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:56.370
And the way we do it is by going to another game and then suddenly your old becomes editable so we can

273
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.580
paste in the your elf our game and go to that page.

274
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.810
They go are not logged in.

275
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.590
So you can see that basically are not logged in account would see this.

276
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:11.490
And I've got a description I've got a place to leave a comment if I was logged in and you see I dont

277
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.270
have the download in the main section but I have it over in the right side bar.

278
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.820
So what I can do is I can go ahead and click install and it will set off the download for that game

279
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.080
and will be able to play it just as I showed you with the tangent game demo.

280
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:31.000
Try playing around with restricted and other types of visibility for your game.

281
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.540
You'll notice that they don't actually work when trying to download them unless it has updated its apps

282
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.490
since the recording of this video.

283
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.840
Okay so Im going to leave the video there and leave it up to you to see that.

284
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:48.310
Once you have downloaded this you can launch the game and play it and it will be playing with in sandbox

285
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.000
although you wont be able to tell that thats actually whats going on.

286
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.870
Congratulations on putting your game out there into the world.

287
00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.430
Big pats on the back that takes a lot of courage and go ahead and share it in the community.

288
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:06.370
Big up your game and get some users to play it and play it together play it with you and give you some

289
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:06.990
feedback.

290
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.950
Thats why I really suggest having the comment thread there so that you can see the feedback rolling

291
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.120
in for your game.

292
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.130
Obviously share it with your own friends as well and give people instructions on how to host and join

293
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:24.250
games because thats not done vira you yet but that will be solved in the next section and I will see

294
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.120
you there.
