Welcome to a brand new section and in this section we are going to be talking about Steam multiplayer

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,210
probably long awaited for some of you who are very excited to get in to using steam as a proper multiplayer

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,200
backend.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,970
So this actually is going to be all about connecting it to your friends over the Internet.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,210
We are going to be talking about how to use the steelworks back and see how that integrates into one

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,200
real and we are going to fundamentally take the project that weve been working on in previous sections

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,690
and make it really easy for you to spruce it up and play it with your friends is going to get to the

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,820
point where its ready for you to say hey guys go and download this on my HBO account for example and

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,150
you'll just be able to play with anybody who's online at the moment.

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,920
That means that you'll be able to share this game with your Facebook friends in groups and forums to

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
get some actual feedback.

12
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,860
That's going to be great.

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,100
Great stuff so I can't wait to get started on this content.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,530
Let's dive into it.
