00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.750
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.330
We are going to be correcting our lobby so that now we as you can see here we've got our players who

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.480
can run around in the lobby and you going to have it so that when there are three players we move on

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.870
to the game together.

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.450
So let's see how that's going to look.

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.420
You are going to be able to join with a third player here.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.120
There's my game instance called Boom.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.140
Then a select boom.

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.400
And we're going to join it.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.760
And when we joined that level there go you can see that everybody has transitioned in to the third person

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.850
example map.

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.450
And we are ready to play.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.940
So everyone's been lobbied together until there were enough players and then we can start actually playing.

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.800
Let's dive in and see how we do this.

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.090
It's so exciting we're going to be learning about a concept called seamless travel So let's dive in

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.230
and see how it's done.

17
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.990
So before we go any further I really want to fix that bug that we've got in our game if we go and host

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.420
a game you can see that at the moment.

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm not a third person.

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.610
I'm just some default spectator porn which is not ideal.

21
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.020
We do want to be a third person now.

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.570
The reason for this is that we haven't been calling super in these virtual methods that we've overidden

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.950
which means that any implementation they may have had in the parent classes just being ignored and it's

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.560
just calling hours.

25
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.530
So we do want to call super was that soup with a capital S then chalong colon and in post logons case

26
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.710
that's going to be post logmein.

27
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.860
And then we can just pass it.

28
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.910
The argument that we were given which was new play at this make sure that the superclass implementation

29
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.540
is getting called will do the same thing with lock out because we don't know what is in that superclass

30
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.410
and we shouldn't know what's in that superclass but we do need to always basically call up to Super

31
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.580
unless we know for sure that we are doing the right thing by not quoting super In fact I don't think

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.130
there is a good reason really why you would never call super.

33
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.260
You might call it in a different place in your method you might say that my code needs to run before

34
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.260
the superclass code but you certainly wouldn't want to just.

35
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.800
Say that your code is more important than anything that's in the superclass.

36
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.500
So with that build successful Let's see if that has eradicated the bug I'm going go ahead.

37
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.090
Play host.

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.660
And sure enough there I am either the third person again which is great.

39
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.430
So the next thing we want to do we have left a little stub of code where we are doing this we log saying

40
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.080
that we reach Three players instead of saying that we've reached the free players.

41
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.080
Why don't we go ahead and actually start the game.

42
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.790
That's what we want to do with this right.

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.060
So we can do that we've got a game it's the s.p. where we've got a server travel and we can go over

44
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.370
in to our lobby game mode C++ and where we have our eui Log we can go ahead and we can replace that

45
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.910
with a server travel.

46
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.490
And we're going to had server trouble to the right thing were going to have to get the correct world.

47
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.870
So just follow along with me on this one.

48
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.650
I'm going to get the world from the game isn't C++ as well.

49
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.600
And so that should alleviate the warning about getting the world.

50
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.830
And then we can get the correct map.

51
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.820
So where was that.

52
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.860
That's at our third person s.p. Maps third person example map.

53
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.540
Now I'm actually not happy with where that map is.

54
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.230
So I'm going to take this opportunity to move it somewhere a bit closer to our lobby.

55
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.520
So I'm going to right click and see.

56
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:34.890
I am just going to drag it up to the content folder to do that I need to add my sidebar for the source's

57
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.360
panel Ain the content browser then I can just track it right into puzzle platforms map and move it there.

58
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.640
Then I can get puzzle platforms map.

59
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.860
Where I got my third personal example map now and I'm going to rename this to game so I can just be

60
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.430
at game map and I'll go ahead and save.

61
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.990
Us open up the map because it seems to want to have those changes saved.

62
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.610
So they get saved and now I'm going to go over to Visual Studio and all I need to do now is change game

63
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.500
lobby to game and that should do the trick.

64
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.170
Now what I'm interested in seeing is when we build this how is that travelling going to look.

65
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.030
Is it's going to work and we're going to try it out in its own instance in a separate game instances

66
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.960
set up in a power shell.

67
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.400
So let's launch those games up now that the build has been successful going to launch up three so that

68
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.870
they can all join in one by one.

69
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.410
And then when they have all joined in we should automatically transition to ad game map.

70
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.430
So Game number one is going to be the host.

71
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.830
The next game is going to be something that we join in.

72
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.120
And same with that third game.

73
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.220
So I will open up the join many for both because it takes all the time to scan and then want it when

74
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.260
finished scanning we can select the game and we can join.

75
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.770
So we've got a second player in the game.

76
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.790
Now let's go and get our third player and we should all transition over to the game map to join.

77
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.610
Okay.

78
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.720
There's no one there and it's kind of seems to have frozen a little bit.

79
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.770
What's going on there.

80
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.380
Okay.

81
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.410
And then here we are.

82
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.150
We are all in the game map together.

83
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.650
So what was that freezing all about.

84
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.070
Why were we suddenly freezing when we were trying to travel from one session to the next.

85
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.470
Why was it not smooth and easy.

86
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.090
Now the reason for that is something called seamless travel.

87
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.570
In fact in this case non seamless travel because the way we were travelling to the new map is called

88
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.210
non seamless.

89
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.760
You can see all about seamless versus non seamless travel in this documentation page on the unreal website

90
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.370
and it tells you about the main differences.

91
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.900
But I'll tell you the main difference is just again the idea with non seamless travel is that.

92
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.230
The server first disconnects all the clients and tells them to reconnect to a new map and then itself

93
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.450
loads a new map so that's why we were getting that freeze because our client was joining in the map

94
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.000
and then was being told oh actually disconnect and join this other map so that this connection takes

95
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.940
time and is obviously not seamless.

96
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.740
So in seamless travel what we do instead is we move everybody over to a transition map before then moving

97
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.950
on to the actual map.

98
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.010
So the reason for having that transition map is a little bit technical.

99
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.440
And I think very specific to unreal in certain.

100
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:47.110
It's in a certain way the transition map basically means that you need to have a map loaded at any time

101
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.570
in and really you can't not have a map load it.

102
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.450
And if we have maps that are very large then transitioning between two maps means that we have to load

103
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.930
two large maps into memory and that can take up a lot of memory and probably memory that some clients

104
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.200
might not have.

105
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.450
So what we need to do is we need to transition first to a very small map which is going to be our transition

106
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.650
map which could be just like a loading screen.

107
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.420
And then once we've transitioned to that small map we can then get rid of the old map from memory because

108
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.210
we've got a map loaded and we can load the other big map into memory before transitioning to that map.

109
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.360
So I think the idea here is that because we need to have both maps loaded at the same time to do a smooth

110
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.900
transition when doing this client seamless thing.

111
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.060
So we're not actually having to disconnect and bit hazy on the exact details but the idea here is that

112
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.950
when you're transitioning you need a track when you are doing a seamless transition.

113
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.890
You need a transition map in place and by default there is a transition map so we can just use seamless

114
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.180
travel by default anyway.

115
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:57.250
And it's very easy to do because the game mode we have a variable that says Be use seamless travel and

116
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.600
by default this is false.

117
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.260
Which is why we're seeing the behaviour that we are seeing.

118
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.520
So let's go ahead and actually use this variable I'm going to copy it.

119
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.970
And this is obviously in your documentation.

120
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.360
In the links then we're going to go to Visual Studio and we're going to enable it before we do our server

121
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.750
travel.

122
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.450
So we're going to be use seamless travel equals true.

123
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.050
Just before we set off our own server travel let's go ahead and build that and see whether we get a

124
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.580
better result in our game once the build is finished I'm going to go ahead and open up the games you

125
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.140
can do the same sort of pause video because you don't want see me doing all that.

126
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.370
So I've gone ahead and launched up our game like I've always done I've created a host that you can see

127
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.060
here and I've joined in with one player now about to join in with the third player.

128
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.890
So let's go over to that player's game and we've got you can see the host my game.

129
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.170
That's my machine.

130
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.020
Click on that and I'll go join it.

131
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.940
Now hopefully what we'll see is a pretty seamless transition in.

132
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.450
There was no blocking there.

133
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.250
There were no issues at all that is seamless travel at its best for us.

134
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.180
So the next step is for you guys to get your hands dirty yourselves.

135
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.420
You're going to add a transition map you are going to read the documentation that I've given you on

136
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:10.760
it.

137
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:17.050
Add a custom transition map for yourself so creating a map setting up however you need to in the documentation

138
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.070
and display some loading text in that transition map.

139
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.720
Okay so pause a video and have a go at this.

140
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.730
Okay welcome back.

141
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:32.730
We're going to dive right into it so I'm going to close down my game here is three instances of the

142
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.500
game gone and we're going to look at how to set up the transition map.

143
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.500
It's in the documentation here.

144
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.500
Well actually it's a bit cryptically in the documentation here because it says it's configured through

145
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.910
the you map settings transition property and that by default it's empty.

146
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:55.350
Now you might infer that they use maps transition the you game map transition settings are actually

147
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:01.200
in our settings in the editor so if we go to settings project settings which is what you might expect

148
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.250
it's project related and then you search for the transition map then they go you will find that there

149
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.610
is a default empty property.

150
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.210
So we're going to have to first of all create a map.

151
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.530
Now I can close the settings down to do that and I'm going to go and add new in our puzzle platforms

152
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.340
maps section do a new level.

153
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.600
I'm going to call it transition or transition should do fine.

154
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:36.720
Going to open up that transition level save and we are going to add some text to this level.

155
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:44.000
So to do this we are going to create ourselves a UI component going to right click.

156
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:51.180
Currently in the maps section and I am going to go and look for the right section user interface section

157
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.090
go to the widget blueprint create a new widget blueprint prefix or with a view.

158
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.600
We just call it loading.

159
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.320
Because that's all it's going to be is going to be some loading text.

160
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.430
Let's go ahead and set that up so we're going to have a new widget that's going to add in some text

161
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.660
very very simple six and text in the middle there.

162
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:19.820
I'm going to set the text to be loading and I'm going to make it much much bigger.

163
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.100
Loading.

164
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.270
In fact let's have a loading game dot dot dot.

165
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.580
And I am going to.

166
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.740
Let's see.

167
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.270
I'm going to make sure that this is larger.

168
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.790
So go to the appearance make my font size something like 40 or even 50.

169
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.970
And then I'm going to make sure that it is centred and justification for the text is centred.

170
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:47.040
I'm then going to make sure that we actually anchor it Centre as well.

171
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.780
Like so.

172
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.400
And that's the position is all set up correctly like that.

173
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.390
In fact I noticed that.

174
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.250
That's not quite right.

175
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.410
We need to do something with our alignment here.

176
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:06.140
I think we're gonna have to do our alignment at that point five and point five and our size is not quite

177
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.640
right.

178
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.670
So again to make the size bigger.

179
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.830
Whoops that wasn't the size.

180
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.710
I get make the size of our box larger.

181
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.080
And reset the x and y positions.

182
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.200
Should be possible to reset them to zero I believe.

183
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:34.590
Guess and our loading is right in the centre of the screen we can compile we can save.

184
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:41.940
We can go to a transition map go to its blueprint menu and open the level blueprint where on begin play

185
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.550
we are going to try and load this widget.

186
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.010
So I'm going to.

187
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.740
Search for create widget.

188
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:58.180
Mike so and I'm going to select the class to be our loading class the opening play.

189
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.780
Let's see whether we actually need an opening play because I'm going to just go ahead and add it to

190
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.740
the viewport.

191
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.400
Add to viewport like so now we don't need to take any user input input so we shouldn't need to do any

192
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.330
more than that.

193
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.060
Let's go ahead and play this.

194
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.520
Yeah sure enough it is shown the text so I'm fairly happy that we don't need to add in an owning play

195
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.260
because it doesn't need to deal with any user input.

196
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.260
So now that we've got our transition map we can go back to our project settings and we can search for

197
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.740
that transition map or transition property or just transfer.

198
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:38.480
And I can select the transition map as our transition map let's go ahead and save that.

199
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.780
Make sure it was sort of set.

200
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.990
Now I'm going to open up my lobby and I'm going to do a little trick for testing this a bit quicker.

201
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:52.210
We're going to go to our play menu dropped down from the play menu select the number of players to be

202
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.030
three and launch it up like that.

203
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:02.080
Now we get three players join in and we should transition to the next map.

204
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.710
Funnily enough we are not.

205
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.100
I wonder what's going on here.

206
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.590
Let's go to our output logs see what's happening in the output log.

207
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.170
Hi.

208
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.120
Saying that seamless travel is not supported in a single process play out.

209
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.270
Okay fair enough.

210
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.840
We need to do it in our own game instances so let's launch up those game instances.

211
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.520
You know the routine by now one of them is going to be the host.

212
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.770
The other two are going to be clients so join from one.

213
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:42.070
Select the item hit join go and join in the other as well join wait for the menu to come up select our

214
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.030
server and then we are going to join and hopefully get a transition.

215
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.690
Okay the transition was very very quick.

216
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.160
Now if you're doing this over the network that transition or if your map is very large That would be

217
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:54.640
another thing.

218
00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.040
We had a very large map then that transition map would be showing but because it just happened so quickly

219
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.200
you barely had time to notice it.

220
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.420
Maybe you did let me know in the discussions for this lecture whether you saw the transition map and

221
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.430
whether you can make the transition map stay for longer.

222
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.010
I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to be making sure that no one else can join this

223
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.820
session after we've got we've actually started that session.
