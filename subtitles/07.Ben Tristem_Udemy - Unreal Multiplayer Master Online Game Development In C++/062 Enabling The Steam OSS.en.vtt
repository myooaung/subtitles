00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.930
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.100
We are going to be learning about how to enable the steam subsystem in unreal.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.170
You can see here from my logs that it's all about steam it's talking about the steam subsystem all over

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.280
the place which means that we have enabled it.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.070
I'm also going to be teaching you how to enable the most logging for certain categories so we can understand

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.610
more of what's going on under the hood in unreel.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.290
You can see here I got the log online category with very verbose talking about the very nitty gritty

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.410
details about the online logs.

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.790
Let's dive in and see how we can enable steam for the first time.

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.750
So in this lecture we are finally going to be using the steam subsystem rather than this nesle subsystem

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.670
we've been using for testing so far.

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.590
So we're going to figure out how to actually configure it because it's a little bit of an involved process

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.630
it's a three step process you're gonna have to enable the steam plug in comp. The steam module and configure

14
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.960
the default engine.

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.720
Anyhow the first two are quite straightforward.

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.770
But the third one is a bit more bold.

17
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.840
So let's start off with the steam plug in.

18
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.210
You may not have noticed it but in in unreal you have a plug in system.

19
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.830
If you go to the edit menu and go to plugins there are a few built in plugins here that you can enable

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.650
or disable.

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.020
And one of those if we search for it is steam an online subsystem steam there are a few different seams

22
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.310
plug ins.

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.420
So I've just search for scene and you can see there are a few steam VR Steam Controller plug steam audio.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.020
But the online subsystem seem is what we want.

25
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.370
If you check enable on that then you will see that it's asking you to restart the editor were not going

26
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.650
to do that just yet because we're gonna need to do it in a later step.

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.420
So next they're doing the steam plug in.

28
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.480
We need to enable a steam module.

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.030
Now this is if we go over in two Visual Studio and open up our plat a puzzle platform to build see us.

30
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.840
So our project named up Bill dotsie as you will find the public dependency module Names List.

31
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.830
And in this module name list we're going to have to add in one more module beyond our online subsystem

32
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.220
we're gonna have to add the online subsystem steam.

33
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.980
Let's do that online sub system steam and we are going to have to rebuild and as a result of having

34
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.050
included that subsystem.

35
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.760
Okay.

36
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.950
So with that rebuild going on.

37
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.480
We're going to set up the configuration of the default engine in it.

38
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.400
We go over to our diesel engine or any which is in the if we go to the root of our project we go into

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.540
config and open up diesel engines on any to text file which at the moment if we get to the bottom of

40
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.690
it you see that we've configured a different platform service as the no subsystem in our section called

41
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.680
Online subsystem.

42
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.570
These things are sections the ones with the square brackets around them.

43
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.440
So one thing we'll need to do is change that null over to being steam.

44
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.690
But we need to do more configuration besides the configure the module and the plug in the way we do

45
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.940
this is we look at the documentation which is linked against the your lecture for the online subsystem

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.350
steam is going to scroll on down to the bottom because there's a lot of instructions here that are actually

47
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.920
out of date that talk about having to include the SDK folder which is.

48
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.790
And the details which are no longer necessary.

49
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.980
They are all included in that plug in for you.

50
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.850
And here it is talking about what you need to include.

51
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.980
There's a few steps that it wants to add in to the engine.

52
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.960
And there's various reasons for it.

53
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.710
But if you scroll on down to the end there is the finished settings.

54
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.830
If you just copy all those finished settings and go into your engine any and actually replace the online

55
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.640
subsystem section because that is part of these finished settings and pasted in then what you're gonna

56
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.740
get is the following.

57
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.820
You can get a section called script forward slash engine game engine.

58
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.110
Now that is going to set up some definitions for something called a net driver.

59
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.810
More on that in a second.

60
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.880
Then we've got our online subsystem which is setting up the default subsystem to be steam.

61
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.870
Then we've got configuration for the online subsystem steam were basically saying enable it true and

62
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.300
set the dev app iita for 80 for 80 is actually the app differs for Spacewar.

63
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.770
It's the app the only app that you can use for free without having to be a developer who's paid 100

64
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.530
dollars if you pay a hundred dollars you get your own app.

65
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.590
And with that app you can basically use that instead of the public one you can set up things like achievements

66
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.770
and so on.

67
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.340
Now the script forward slash online subsystem steam stops steam net driver.

68
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.260
This is the net driver again it's talking about.

69
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.100
So in the top category we had defined some net driver stuff some useful net driver stuff.

70
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.150
And in the bottom category we are basically configuring steam to point at that net driver.

71
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.970
What is a net drive I hear you ask.

72
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.220
It's basically what allows us to not need a VPN.

73
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.900
Instead of making a direct IP connection it is going to connect via steam if necessary and then it will

74
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.000
do that with various clever steam servers in the way.

75
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.490
Now obviously that's quite technical and we don't have to worry about it too much because the magic

76
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.330
kind of goes on under the hood for us and will allow us to connect over the Internet so we're not going

77
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.430
to have to worry about it too much.

78
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.590
Basically that is the default engine configuration.

79
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.410
Let's go back to that plug in the menu that was asking us to restart and take the offer and get it to

80
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.860
restart.

81
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.180
Now this has as completely set up ready to be using steam in our game now to verify it.

82
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.790
We can't actually play across the network just yet.

83
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.090
We'll be able to do that in the next lecture because there's a few things we need to change about how

84
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.840
we create the sessions and query sessions but we can.

85
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.580
Check that we are using a steam properly from the locks now in order to run a game with steam.

86
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.420
You can't do it from within the editor it has to be outside of the end.

87
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.420
So if I try playing from within the editor you can see that the null subsystem is that subsystem that

88
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.960
gets found it needs to be outside of the editor.

89
00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:01.070
So we are going to open up our shell or terminal on Mac or command prompt if you prefer and we are going

90
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.460
to run game with logging messages enabled and you need to have steam running and logged in in order

91
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.600
for this to work.

92
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.100
Let's run the game.

93
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.890
Launch it up.

94
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.410
We've got our logs printing out here while the game is loading because there's a lot of logs I want

95
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.420
to draw your attention to the fact that all these logs have a category.

96
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.850
We always use log temp.

97
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.780
But the category here is things like logs stat logs slate style log memory log world et cetera.

98
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.540
Now you can see our log temp message with category warning has said it's found the subsystems seem so

99
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.050
great.

100
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.290
We have indeed got steam working here.

101
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.370
That is fantastic news.

102
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.800
Now I just want to show you that we can see a bit more of the details of how steam is working now on

103
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.160
a Mac.

104
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.290
This is going to be slightly different and I'm going to give you the instructions now.

105
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.630
Sadly for us folk on the Mac running the puzzle platforms here in steam is a little bit more tricky

106
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.510
You can't simply run a standalone binary on Mac and get it to run.

107
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.880
You probably tried that while I was doing it and you'll have noticed that it might crash now to run

108
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.160
something with the steam subsystem you need to run it from within steam as a foreign application so

109
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.590
you need to go to her but you add game and add a non steam game as we've done before this time.

110
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.780
What you going to have to do is actually build your game you're gonna have to package it entirely so

111
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.170
you can see here I've got a build that I've done earlier with the Mac.

112
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.600
No.

113
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.580
Ed and he.

114
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.560
We've got an app file for puzzle platforms that's what you're going to need to point steam to.

115
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.220
Remember that's going to add add non steam game.

116
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.850
You cannot wait for the Spinney's a little bit.

117
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.660
And then once the spinnies have gone it won't even open up.

118
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.170
So you got it.

119
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.570
Add game again and add a non steam game.

120
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.700
Sometimes this happens sadly.

121
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.640
Then you go to your browse and one little trick is that if you can open up a terminal which I'm going

122
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.220
to do.

123
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.900
Then you can take.

124
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.240
You can find in Finder the puzzle platforms app that has just been built.

125
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.520
You got a package for Mac on your in your editor.

126
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.790
We're going to copy that.

127
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.910
Man see and then go into terminal.

128
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.110
Man v. it in to copy the path and then you can take the path.

129
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.230
Copy that and you can paste it into ad game.

130
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.050
Now if you paste directly into ad game.

131
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:30.540
Just copy the name for puzzle platforms which isn't really what you want so we can go ahead and open

132
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.730
the app now and if you that will close down the menu sadly.

133
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.440
But if you go to add an on Steam game again then it will have a list of games with the top one selected

134
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.210
being puzzled platforms and you can go ahead and add selected program now as have already done.

135
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.610
I'm not going to do this.

136
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.690
Okay so what you can do now is you can hit play from within steam and that will launch up the puzzle

137
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:58.400
platforms app ready with steam in the background and you can check out the logs as I have done now to

138
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.160
check out the logs.

139
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.520
That's another little step that you're going to have to do.

140
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.040
Bear with me for this.

141
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.210
You need to go to open up the application called console.

142
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.530
Now this is where logs are located.

143
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:16.980
System wide on Mac and then he need to find the entry in the left side bar that says tilde library logs

144
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.380
were going to expand this out and under till did library logs.

145
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.600
You should have a puzzle platform directory and under that directory you should have a puzzle platforms

146
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.840
dont lock you go and click on Puzzle platforms log.

147
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:38.400
Then in there you will have the logs that the other folks are seeing in the in a separate window on

148
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.680
windows so you can do all the same things using this log and starting it from within steam.

149
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.890
Just the build process going to take likely look.

150
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.050
Okay so welcome back to the p.c folk as well now.

151
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:56.180
What were going to do here is enable some verbose logging at least for the online subsystem category

152
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.410
so that we can see more of what steam's doing and in the challenge I'm going to challenge you to look

153
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.870
at those logs and set it all up for yourself.

154
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.950
So here in our logs you can see that we have things called categories.

155
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.080
They are the thing that is like log audio log render.

156
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.810
They tend to be prefixed with log.

157
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.600
We always use log temp.

158
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.110
But there are categories there are many of.

159
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.160
And then we have a large log level where here you can see after the category is either warning or its

160
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.350
just the default.

161
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.030
Or it can be things like verbose and very verbose.

162
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:31.040
Now verbose isn't showing up is only showing things that are log info at the moment.

163
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.960
So to enable about logging.

164
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:42.970
We need to hit our tilde key or the key underneath escape and we need to go log log online.

165
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.550
My system has caught up with that.

166
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:56.810
Typing it slightly wrong it needs to be log typing wrong myself log log online which is the category

167
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.180
we want to enable make more verbose.

168
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.060
Make means that there's more going to be more log messages and you can either do verbose with a capital

169
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.920
V or very verbose which is what I'm going to go for.

170
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:15.010
And then what happens is as you do certain actions like house and joint you are going to get more log

171
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.940
messages here in the log.

172
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.420
So a very quick challenge both for Mac and p.c to make sure that you are comfortable with the logs and

173
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.990
that you are getting the right sort of stuff.

174
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:31.550
Here I just challenge you to host and join with verbose logging switched on and see what you get.

175
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.890
Pause a video and have a go.

176
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.620
Okay welcome back.

177
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.720
We're just going to do this very quickly I've got very verbose logging switched on my go to host and

178
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.230
have a look at my logs see what's happened.

179
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.390
Not very much coming out of on my log online to be honest.

180
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.070
I've got something coming out of both though it says listening on LAN beacon request for something and

181
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.690
it's also got here something about very Bobos getting billed unique idea.

182
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.330
Some interesting stuff like that but nothing particularly that I can make sense of that I understand

183
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.310
so I'm going to quit.

184
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:07.650
Out.

185
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.020
Back to the main menu.

186
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.340
As some can sometimes get frozen like this.

187
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.470
I'm not entirely sure why but if you go over to your logs I think it has something to do with having

188
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:25.420
scrolled around the logs so you can just hit Control see on the logs and that seems to unblock it.

189
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.620
Now if you go back to join and do add join menu.

190
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.900
That should trigger off a search for servers.

191
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:42.310
And here in there both very verbose and our warning we are getting lots of logs about what it has tried

192
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.970
to do.

193
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.940
It's got incompatible builds that it's finding that's because we've got steam war and it is trying to

194
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:55.210
remove the things that aren't our game from the list of lobbies and servers and so on and so we've got

195
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.270
lots of other log messages there too.

196
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.090
And some more of these get build unique I.D. and things like that so.

197
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:09.170
And also in a sink task is finished successfully which is probably the async task of finding sessions.

198
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.390
So that's just the skill a little bit of reading log messages it might take you a little bit longer

199
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.420
than me I've got my very trained into this.

200
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.920
Having read lots and lots of logged messages over the years but just go through and see what you understand

201
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.380
for now and I will be pointing out your eye.

202
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.450
Two things are important.

203
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.880
In later lectures.
