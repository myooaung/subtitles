Hey guys and welcome to section two.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,650
So firstly as the designer of this cause I wanted to explain why we're doing a whole section on you

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,410
why in a multiplayer court a couple of good reasons firstly we want to show you the very latest practices

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,410
for you why.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,200
And secondly it's really important to have a strong foundation in UI before you move into the next section

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,560
where you going to be trying to connect to people over the Internet where you may not have a Skype chat

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,700
or a live chat going with you.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:32,240
You need a lot of good quality real time feedback so you can be foundational to lobbying and connecting

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,130
in multiplayer games.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,700
That's why this section is all about you.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,140
So Sam what are we going to learn precisely so precisely you're going to be learning about how you can

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,770
create a C++ underpinning to your blueprint your eyes and how we can use C++ logic to drive things such

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:52,510
as submenus put text into your menus and trigger events from buttons and that's it.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,840
By the end of it you'll have some nice looking simple but very functional UI and a great foundation

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,560
to move forward with.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,240
So see you at the end of the section.
