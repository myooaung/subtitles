00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.580
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.680
We are going to be seeing how we can add more information to our server line at the moment it looks

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.130
really uneed because there's very little spacing.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.700
But we have got here up to this point and my cursor we've got the name of the server.

5
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.960
To this point and my cursor from here to here we've got the user name all the way up to here actually

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.200
and then we've got two of two which is telling us incorrectly.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.990
But it is telling us a number of connections vs. a total number of connections So let's dive in and

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.110
see how we can achieve this.

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.720
So the next thing I want is to be able to do is populate that server list with real data.

10
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.040
Now to do this first thing we need to do is actually have a look at how we are testing this because

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.830
currently we've got steam enabled but steam can be a bit of a pain in the backside when you are trying

12
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.420
to test things locally because you can't have multiple instances open on the same computer.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.420
The reason for that there's only one steam client running and they will only let you run one steam client.

14
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.210
So the way we can do this is fairly straightforward.

15
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.920
We need to go to power shell and we need to be launching it from the power shell and we're going to

16
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.650
do is we are going to be launching with this extra option called dasch no steam.

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.540
If you do that go ahead and launch the game then when it launches up you're going to see that we'll

18
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.400
be getting the noell subsystem instead of steam running.

19
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.680
This means that we can run multiple instances without steam which is useful for testing it out locally.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.000
So let's go and have a look at the law AGs for that paper go over to my logs you can see that the found

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.190
subsystem is steam.

22
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.780
Now I want to just test that we can make a connection using this no steam.

23
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.740
So let's launch up another instance and wait for it to fully launch to fruition.

24
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.320
And in the meantime I can go in to my first game and use it to host a session.

25
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.660
Which hole do you get them hosting a session.

26
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.290
My second incidence is spawning up right now.

27
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.440
And from there I can go to the join menu and let's have a look at whether we can find it or not.

28
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.750
Doesn't seem to be showing up anything other than our test servers so that reminds me that we need to

29
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.060
go into puzzle platforms go to our game is the key and remove said tests.

30
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.650
We don't need those anymore.

31
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.540
We were just using them for our testing the menu in the last lecture.

32
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.560
Now you will see that we cannot find the server in here.

33
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.240
So let's go ahead and close down these two games and we can have a look at why that is the case.

34
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.490
If we go up a little bit then we will see that the reason for this is that our land match is set to

35
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.690
false.

36
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.050
While we had steam because that makes sense we're not doing land mass as we were doing Internet matches.

37
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.230
Now obviously on the knoll system we can only do land matches so when we have land that set to false

38
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.780
things don't work.

39
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.790
So what we need to do is conditionally set land match to true when we're using the noll's subsystem

40
00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.650
that way we can easily switch between steam and not steam for testing just by adding that command line

41
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.730
argument.

42
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.660
Now you will recall that we kind of know how to do this because when we were getting our subsystem we

43
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.790
could get the name of that subsystem and that should do we should be able to check whether that name

44
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.210
is equal to.

45
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.700
So that is what I am going to do.

46
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.140
I'm going to go ahead and get a copy of the subsystem.

47
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.770
So let's do that.

48
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.160
It should not be null because we've got our session interface so we were able to get it in the past.

49
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.650
So I'm going to go ahead and get the subsystem.

50
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.300
I don't even need to store it in a pointer really because we're just using it to get that shared pointer.

51
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:49.500
Then we can dereference it and we can do a get things like name or see it go by platform chat interfaces

52
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.280
all these different interfaces that we can get.

53
00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.360
But there should be in here the name isn't a search for Name get instance name get named in interface

54
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.510
gets subsystem then that's the one we want and we want to check that that is equal to.

55
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.610
No.

56
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:15.360
Because if that is equal to now then we want to land match to be true so we can do it if equal now then

57
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.070
we are going to set the setting LAN match to be true.

58
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.050
And otherwise we are going to set it to false.

59
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.000
Like so I move my setting code in there.

60
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.140
And we are going to build that.

61
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.930
So that build has completed lets launch up to games with no steam and see whether they can see each

62
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.380
other.

63
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.050
Now that we also don't have those test servers so they've launched up on going to host with one of the

64
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.300
servers one of the games and the other one.

65
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.650
I'm going to go ahead and hit the join menu and hope for it to populate with something meaningful.

66
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.470
There we go.

67
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.570
We have got something meaningful I can't select it.

68
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.610
I can see selection dialogues working that's nice.

69
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.740
I'm going to hit join and I'm joining the local game should work out.

70
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.450
See if it does.

71
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.410
Okay it's not let's have a look at our logs and see what might be causing this.

72
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.070
So we see here that it's still trying to use the net driver for steam to basically do the online connection

73
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.930
and it's actually failing to do that.

74
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.550
Well that's okay for now because we're only testing the menu but we are going to have to work around

75
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.230
that problem in future.

76
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.670
So for now let's leave it as it is and we will move on to the next step which is creating a struct.

77
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.040
So what do I mean by that.

78
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:55.290
Currently in our server rhodos H We are just setting the server name so if we go and have a look at

79
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.030
where we're doing that we're doing that in our main menu key where currently Let's have a look.

80
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.740
We've got our set server list set server list is then going through and it's setting the text from a

81
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.490
list of server names.

82
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.280
Now what we want is more rich information than just a list of server names we want a list of structures

83
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:21.510
that can give us both the server name and the current number of players and maybe also give us the user

84
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.460
name of the hosting player as well.

85
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.650
That would be pretty handy pretty useful.

86
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.790
So let's have a look at how we can achieve that.

87
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.250
The first step is to define that struct somewhere where we're going to define this struct up in the

88
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.190
head a file maybe.

89
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.360
We're not going to bother with a separate file for this so I'm just going to declare struct before our

90
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.230
main class now doing this in C++ would just be using a struct keyword and then basically setting up

91
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.040
like a class so it would be something like F server.

92
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.730
Data.

93
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.130
And then you could create the body of that struct.

94
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.480
Notice that visual studio has automatically added the semicolon that's required after the curly braces

95
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.210
for me.

96
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.540
But with visuals with his studio with unreel we need to do one more thing which is to put a you struck

97
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.360
out.

98
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.280
Macro in front of that struct and inside we want to do a generate.

99
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.950
Underscore body.

100
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.790
Just like we do for classes.

101
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.510
And that's just going to help us out with a few things now.

102
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.940
Next up we can fill it with the actual parameters that we're going to want.

103
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.700
We're going to want an F string of type.

104
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.680
Let's see.

105
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.770
We want an F string or to just be called the name.

106
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.890
That's going to be the name of the server.

107
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:54.350
We are going to want the number of players so that can be a you in eight what are you in 16 maybe needs

108
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.910
to be a small number of current players.

109
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.660
And I am going to have also a.

110
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.360
Int.

111
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.190
16 of total players or max players.

112
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.220
And finally we're going to have another F string for the user name.

113
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.360
So host.

114
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.550
User name.

115
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:24.010
And that should be everything that we need for this structure we should be able to set it up with all

116
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:24.880
of these things.

117
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.000
Now if we try building it at the moment it's not going to work because we need generated body am typing

118
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.810
incorrectly.

119
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.360
We see the classic you will have spotted that I made that mistake and I'm going to go ahead and rebuild

120
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.850
that based on having changed that generated body.

121
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.450
And sure enough that has succeeded.

122
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.620
So what we're going to need to do now is populate that struct.

123
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:56.700
So first of all we need to make sure that our set function sets server list actually doesn't take an

124
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.570
F string but rather takes at F as an array of f server data instead.

125
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.370
And that's going to lead to a complaint over in our let's see a game instance s.p. where we're currently

126
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:15.210
doing our set server list which currently takes the f string an inch Instead it needs to take our f

127
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480
server data instead.

128
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:25.630
Take a ray of f server data which means that we're going to have to construct our server data right

129
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.160
here.

130
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.390
So I'm going to do this inside the loop going to create an F server data which as called it call this

131
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.640
property data.

132
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.970
And I'm going to pass that data in to our search result but not before having taken at what we currently

133
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.500
had as the string and put that as the source as the name.

134
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.860
So it's got to be data name equals.

135
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:55.180
This gets session idea string and then were going to pass the data into an ADD server name.

136
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.420
I forgot my semicolon which is why it's complaining at the moment and will build and see where that

137
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.010
works.

138
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.650
Obviously I have forgotten another semicolon here too much time programming in Python it seems.

139
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.420
I'm going to go ahead and build that.

140
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.140
But those of you don't know Python is language without semicolons it just uses the new lines to basically

141
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.870
infer that you meant a semicolon.

142
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:22.500
So I have a one more error here if I go to the topmost error you can see that my set server list is

143
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:30.240
currently taking the wrong type which should be taking a b f server data in it's t arrays so let's make

144
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.310
sure that's done as well and can just following the build errors here.

145
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.550
And we've got more build errors so let's see where they are going to go to the top most error which

146
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.990
is he.

147
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:49.080
And it is pointing to a high F string that you see hald how these types propagate around propagates

148
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:57.360
to our server name in the for loop and then this server name is going to be needing to be used correctly

149
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.340
which for now isn't being.

150
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.840
So we need the server name dot name I believe.

151
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.110
In fact this is just going to be called the server data.

152
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.160
So I go and call it server data dot name instead.

153
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.380
And that should do the trick hopefully.

154
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.140
So make sure that is rebuilt.

155
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.630
And it seems to be building successfully now.

156
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.920
Just double check that.

157
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.630
Yep sure enough successful build.

158
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.130
Don't know why the Squidward's are there.

159
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.190
It's saying that the survey data has no member name.

160
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.940
We know that to be a lie because there it is.

161
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.740
There's it's there it's name it just doesn't seem to like a struct and in Visual Studio.

162
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:42.530
But I'm sure a rebuild of the visual studio project file would probably fix those errors.

163
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.740
So we're going to want to go to our game instance now and populate the rest of the server data and in

164
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:55.200
actual fact I'm going to leave that as a little thing for you to fill out using the documentation of

165
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.450
f online sessions search result.

166
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.390
So here is the challenge and definition for you to update the UI in its entirety.

167
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:09.360
Fill out the rest of the data and bind the necessary components Egan need in the server rope and set

168
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.630
the components from the values of these struct.

169
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.690
Post video and have a go at this challenge.

170
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.560
Okay welcome back.

171
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.930
So let's start off with one thing at a time.

172
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:25.850
So the first thing we're going to set on data we've got the name we're going to set another thing so

173
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.830
data dot and we're gonna look for it.

174
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.660
What have we got.

175
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.210
Got current players.

176
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.770
Let's set the current players.

177
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.810
This will be from the search result.

178
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.750
Now there aren't many things in here we've got the actual session itself.

179
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.610
So we're going to go to the session and we can have a look at the.

180
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:49.660
Nope number of open public connections that's going to be at current players.

181
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.090
Next up we are going to go to Data dot max players.

182
00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.850
This one is a little bit harder to find it's still on the search result still under the session but

183
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.110
it is under the session settings the session settings being the settings that we set when we created

184
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:13.010
the session and you can see here we've got all those sessions eldo session settings including the number

185
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.050
of public connections which is going to be the total number of public connections.

186
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:23.550
Next up we've got data dot and we have the host user name.

187
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.630
This one is again in search result dot session.

188
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.650
DOT.

189
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:36.880
And then it should be sesshin owning user name which is an F string so that matches.

190
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.300
So everything is hunky dory we should be able to compile that.

191
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.370
And while that's compiling I'm going to go and update my server row so I'm going to open up my server

192
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:52.120
row BP where we are going to be updating its UI opens on another window for some reason.

193
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.000
And here we've got our text.

194
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.010
We've got a spacer.

195
00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:01.660
I dont want the space anymore or what I'm going to do is I'm going to use let the text itself be of

196
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.310
a certain proportion.

197
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:13.270
So I'm going to create a another text item in here by copying and pasting into the horizontal box and

198
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.510
whoops I seem to have crashed the server for some reason probably because I had to with the same name

199
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.430
which is not allowed.

200
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.500
So let's go ahead and restart that.

201
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.130
I'm going to pause while I restart you don't want to watch me restart an editor.

202
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.670
Okay so let's fire up that server again.

203
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.360
Hope is not going to crash this time hand.

204
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:38.470
I was opening up on my other window for some reason so I'm just going to avoid that by going to get

205
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:45.300
a text item and sticking it in a server row here then to remove the space.

206
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.680
I'm going to call this one the user name.

207
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.870
Or in fact let's call it what it is which is the host.

208
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.510
User.

209
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:03.330
So got a server name host user and the text block here which is going to be.

210
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:04.740
Let's see.

211
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.030
Well we're going to actually.

212
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:12.670
Probably do this as multiple text items so we can set them separately or we might not we might actually

213
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.970
have to construct this so I'm going to say this is.

214
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.750
The connection fraction.

215
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.410
Because it's the fraction for the number of connections.

216
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.030
So these are all text blocks.

217
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.440
What we're going to want to do is increase their size somewhat.

218
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.100
So I'm going to do this with let's see.

219
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:41.080
Do it by changing our Phil on most of these some going to do a fill for the server.

220
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.350
And I'm going to do a feel for the host use.

221
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.720
Now you notice they are taking up an equal amount of space.

222
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.310
I actually don't want this equal.

223
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:55.550
I want the server to take up twice as much space can change the number in filter too which means that

224
00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.920
now it does take up twice as much space and as you can see when I reach size as long as it's not too

225
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:07.980
small then the server name is not law nor the username is not going to be smaller than that server name.

226
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:15.380
So now we can go ahead and get the binding to work so I'm going to go over into the server row dot H

227
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:22.280
and I am going to bind the server name and I'm going to bind the both as public.

228
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:28.550
I think I'll do so I'm going to have the server names already bound so I don't need to worry about that.

229
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:34.340
The other thing Im going to bind is what we called the host user so I'm going to copy it to make sure

230
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.860
that the binding is going to work by copying it over into Visual Studio and the next thing that we're

231
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.520
going to do is that fraction the connection fraction.

232
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.410
So if I select the connection fraction I'm going to copy that as well and I'm going to go over and paste

233
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.280
that in Visual Studio.

234
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.600
I'm going to fix up my indentation a little bit.

235
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.150
And compile save and build.

236
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.350
So while we're doing that we can go over and start writing the code in main cvp that's going to populate

237
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.010
this.

238
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.650
So we've got currently we're setting the text on the server name that is still fine and valid.

239
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.340
I'm going to copy this line so that we are using it for.

240
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.380
Also the user name.

241
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.440
So let's find the username in the head of file against copy that go to the c p p.

242
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:30.140
Change the user name set text from string and we are going to from stringing the server data dot then

243
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.700
it should be.

244
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.390
Why is it not giving me the one that I want.

245
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.040
Oh because it doesn't like the strings so I'm going to copy it.

246
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.620
It's called The Host a user name and I'm going to paste that in there.

247
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:50.060
Next up we are going to do something similar for our fraction so I'm going to copy the connection fraction

248
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:58.700
go over to the C P P and I'm going to set text from strain and it's going to be this time we are going

249
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.340
to probably do something like a format string.

250
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.890
What do I mean by a format string.

251
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.260
Well if you haven't seen it before then you can use this f string print F which basically is used very

252
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:14.860
much like our logging to do formatting of things like integers into strings.

253
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.290
So I'm going to be using the f string print F and let's go over to visual studio.

254
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.700
Make use of it.

255
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.180
So we are going to do string print F of the text.

256
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.930
This is getting a bit long for a line so I think I'm gonna split it out and it's going to be a percent

257
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.400
de slash percent DB Because we've tried to create a textual fraction and then we are going to provide

258
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.570
it with the server data.

259
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:51.600
What current players and be server data dot Macs play.

260
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.640
Like so now that's almost right.

261
00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:03.260
Get the matching brackets in there and I'm going to actually cut out this string and say call this into

262
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.100
it f string variable called.

263
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.090
Fraction.

264
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:17.780
Text set are equal to this f print f result and I am going to pop that in to our set of the fraction

265
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:25.500
text which we are doing from string set text match up all my brackets and compile and see if this works.

266
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.610
So at the very least we've got a compilation that succeeded.

267
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.670
Let's see whether it has actually succeeded in creating a game that works.

268
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.450
Going to launch my two game instances in fact I'm going to launch three so that we can see that whether

269
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.430
the number is correct.

270
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.250
So here they all are ones going to be my host.

271
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.800
Then the other game I'm going to go to the join menu to try and join our host.

272
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.530
Let's see what shows up.

273
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.100
Okay not very pretty.

274
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.160
It looks like we may need to set up some minimums.

275
00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:01.730
So I'm going to go ahead and set up some minimums for add text block or the maximum size so it looks

276
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:09.290
like there isn't an option here so I'm just going to do this by adjusting the fill at the moment so

277
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.530
I'm going to make both of these auto for now.

278
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.550
That's not how we want it.

279
00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:20.370
We will correct this later down the line but we are going to make do with that for now.

280
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.020
So we're going to go ahead and launch up our three games again.

281
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.880
Again one is going to be the host and another one is going to join it.

282
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.580
Has the host I know I go and join the game.

283
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.810
Okay so we can see that here.

284
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.420
It is getting it be right.

285
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:44.100
Text we've got the I.D. we've got the user name but we've got the wrong numbers so we're going to have

286
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.630
to debug the numbers are going to do this in the next lecture at this stage because this lecturer is

287
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:54.780
running on a little bit long and we want to also fix the maximum size for usernames So this table can

288
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.030
look nice and neat.

289
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.300
So Pat yourselves on the back.

290
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.690
We've done great stuff here getting this menu to have the right text in there and in the next lecture

291
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.230
we'll see how we can meet up.
