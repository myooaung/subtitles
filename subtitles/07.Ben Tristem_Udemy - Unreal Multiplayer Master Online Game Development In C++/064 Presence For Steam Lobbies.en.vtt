00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.160
Welcome in this video.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.220
We are going to be getting and join to work and hosting to work over steam in the previous video.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.770
We just stopped a little bit short of that weren't quite able to join and host but now if I go to join

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.050
I've got a host already running on another machine.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.320
And what we see after a little bit of time spent can Bob elating by the joint game menu is that we've

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.030
actually got another house that we discovered via steam this is very exciting stuff.

7
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.080
The way that we're doing this is using the lobbying system just like we did in steam.

8
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.680
We're going to see how we can enable the lobbying system using the unreal open source online subsystem

9
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.540
That's what I mean.

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.750
And if we go ahead and join that I just want to prove to you that it really is actually working takes

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.640
a little bit longer to connect because this is happening over the Internet now and over steam system.

12
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.450
But there we are.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.590
There's me and there is the other me as well if I can move around.

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.330
There we go then that basically proves to you that this these are both connected the connected over

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.390
the Internet and you'll be able to do this with your testing buddy.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.590
So you can actually go ahead and contact your testing buddy right now if you want to make sure that

17
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.150
they're going to be available for this lecture.

18
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.250
Let's dive in and see how it's done.

19
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:21.260
So you may have tried at this point to get connected with your friends over the network and actually

20
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.630
struggled to do so.

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.750
Now the reason for that is because by default we are using steam servers when we are using the SS rather

22
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.980
than steam lobbies.

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.640
Now if you remember when we used steam work the steam works example with space what we note is that

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.120
only lobbies would work in that dedicated servers were not working for us.

25
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.500
So we need to find a way to enable lobby's instead of thurber's in unreel the way to do this is using

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960
a mechanism called presence in unreal.

27
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.100
It's a bit strange because presence is typically meant to mean stuff about whether your friends are

28
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.340
online currently but in the steam our SS layer it actually also means that you are going to be using

29
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.650
the lobby matchmaking system.

30
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.990
So there's two steps required to do this.

31
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.520
We need to enable it for the server and we need to enable it in the search which is slightly more complicated.

32
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.830
And then there is a third mystery step.

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.950
Are we going to be doing that through debugging.

34
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.330
I'm going to challenge you to figure out what that might be from the logs.

35
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.580
So first let's enable for the server.

36
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.450
So I'm going to go and open up my project and once we've got our project open we are going to go to

37
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.450
the puzzle platforms game instance dot ACP and we are going to be looking at our find sessions and we're

38
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.790
going to be looking at the server create session.

39
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.650
So first things first we are no longer a LAN match.

40
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.750
So we want to set LAN match to false.

41
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.600
That's the first thing that I want to do.

42
00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:00.350
And then the next thing is we look at our sessions settings for a setting called something like a B

43
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.810
and then something that presence.

44
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.520
So we've got a cloud join via present's that's not the one we need.

45
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.510
There is another one about presence which is a user's presence though B uses presence equals true.

46
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.960
That's what we're going to go for.

47
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.520
That basically has enabled it on the server.

48
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.200
And if you're interested in seeing how this works then you go to create session and look at where that's

49
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.400
implemented so I'm going to do an F 12 in Visual Studio.

50
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.040
Or you can just search for create session on X code and you'll notice there is an F online session steam

51
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.810
that's obviously where the steam SS interface is being implemented and if we look in here then we can

52
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.810
go down to a section where it says create Internet or land session and you'll notice there is an if

53
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.280
statement that says either create lobby session or create internet session and that is hinged upon the

54
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.260
session settings.

55
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.790
DOT uses presence setting.

56
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.130
So that's how I figured this out.

57
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.500
Unfortunately I had to literally step through this code and work it out because it wasn't documented

58
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.970
anywhere funnily enough.

59
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.480
And here we go so now we're using presence in create session.

60
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.360
Next up we need to do it in the search as well.

61
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.730
So on the search is slightly more confounding in our find setting find sessions.

62
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.150
We have got our session search item and we can set things up on there so we can do session search arrow.

63
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.450
But you'll notice there is nothing in here about presence.

64
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.040
Or presents even so there's nothing about presence but there is a query settings object the query setting

65
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.940
this object is for other settings that we might not have thought of basically.

66
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.180
So what we're going to do is we're going to look at find sessions going to go to its definition go to

67
00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.590
the definition in F my in session steam find sessions and in here we're going to look for a similar

68
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.740
if statement that might be used somewhere to do our searching.

69
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.580
Here is one about LAN query.

70
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.540
So if it's a LAN query then it'll do.

71
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.570
It's not a LAN query then it'll do internet session otherwise it will do a find land sessional we want

72
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.620
to have a look at how it's doing the internet session really.

73
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.240
So let's follow forward from there you can do a search for find internet session or an F 12.

74
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.490
I'm going to cancel that into a sense of breaking because I a feeling it already found the result it

75
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.820
was just double checking and looking out where it did find the result.

76
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.700
So is f online session steam find internet session probably in the same file so you could just do a

77
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:48.400
file search and in here we've got a similar if statement that is doing either a fine bobbi's or a fine

78
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.880
servers.

79
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:58.150
And what it is doing here is it's doing that query settings dot get with presence search and home and

80
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.080
getting out the value basically of present search from there.

81
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.890
Interesting.

82
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:10.960
So what this is doing is getting the result from some sort of dictionary type object in the query settings.

83
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.610
So if we go over to ad game instance DCP we can do query settings dot set.

84
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.240
Now if you want to know more about how this object works it's called an F online search settings object.

85
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:33.160
And as you can imagine it has this get and set the values and the setter How does the setter work.

86
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.600
Let's click on a map setter see what its what its parameters are.

87
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:46.690
One is an F name for the key name and another is the value type which is basically whatever the value

88
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.650
is it could be a ball it could be something else.

89
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.160
And then we've got this comparison type and going to show you how we use this comparison type.

90
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.120
Just the second in fact will open up the documentation page and show you the.

91
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.270
It's basically saying whether or not well we're basing building up a search query so we want to say

92
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.820
should it be equal to presence or should it be greater than two players or should it be less than two

93
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.390
players.

94
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.220
Things like that so we can create a comparison query within our search office the as is going to be

95
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.250
equals.

96
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:27.370
So let's go back into set and set this up what we want is if we follow back to the online session interface

97
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.600
steam we want this constant called Search presence.

98
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.730
So I'm going to just use search presence and hope that is there and hope that it's included and we'll

99
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.480
see where it is.

100
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:45.520
When I compile and then I want to set that to true and I want to have an E Online let's copy it from

101
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.040
the documentation that would be quicker.

102
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.090
E Online comparison op.

103
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.220
That's what I'm going to use online comparison.

104
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.630
OK.

105
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.350
Come on.

106
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.300
Hold on.

107
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.480
Equals.

108
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.640
And I need to move that extra.

109
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.060
Either I typed and put a semicolon on the end of the line.

110
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:08.760
And that should be sufficient for setting the setting which allows for search presence.

111
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.250
So once your build finishes we are going to be on to actually trying this out with other students.

112
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.720
You're going to find however that it won't work straight away.

113
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.880
You're going to have to use your verbose logging to see if you can figure out what settings you need

114
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:31.650
to change either in the create session or in the find session to make it so that you can see the other

115
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.140
person's session across the network.

116
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.490
So here comes a little challenge definition for you.

117
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.500
So you're going to be debugging with a POW.

118
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.130
In this lecture if you don't have a second computer of your own so go and request a testing buddy right

119
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.550
away go and create a post on the forum or go and see if your testing buddy from before is available.

120
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.180
You remember how to do the timezone stuff.

121
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.040
I don't have to remind you at this stage.

122
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.310
Now you are going to share your repo with your testing buddy.

123
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.340
Once you've got them so they can download it and they can compile it you're going to take it in turns

124
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.670
so you're going to share your repo they're going to share theirs and so on you're going to debug each

125
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.720
others and then you are going to investigate the logs.

126
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.620
Now if you are prepared to just tackle a charity like this go ahead.

127
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.010
If you want a little bit more information then I'm going to give you a hint in one two three okay.

128
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:27.750
The hint is that the issue is in finding the session so look really scrutinizingly at the logs for finding

129
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.200
the session and see if there's something strange going on there.

130
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.340
What do you think could be going on based on what you know about how steam works is working and the

131
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.600
development at finding it and so on and so forth.

132
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.100
It's a poser video and have a go at this challenge.

133
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.580
Okay welcome back.

134
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.750
Let's give this a shot.

135
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.110
So I'm going to dive in.

136
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.610
And first of all launch my game now on my Mac.

137
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.070
I've got my game running in hosting mode already.

138
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.910
So that's simulating you guys playing with each other over the network worry's hosting one who is joining

139
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.290
as I mentioned in the hint the issue is going to be on finding the session.

140
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.360
So that should narrow down where we need to investigate.

141
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.600
I'm going to open up the console and enable very verbose logging right off the bat and close the console

142
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.500
again.

143
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.540
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into join.

144
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.680
I open up fire up the join game menu and that should give it enough time to try and find the game.

145
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.070
Let's go over to the logs and see what's going on here.

146
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:38.420
So the first thing that I notice is we've basically will start looking at the logs from where we've

147
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.260
started finding a session because that's where it's going to tell us the interesting stuff that's where

148
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.810
we've told steam go.

149
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.440
Go find some internet games and you can see steam as saying started searching for Internet games.

150
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.950
Good sign.

151
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.790
Online.

152
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.670
Asing event steam the lobbies update.

153
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.820
That's good it's about lobbies rather than servers.

154
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.140
It's doing the find a single task steam find lobbies for find session was successful.

155
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.310
Number of results.

156
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.980
1.

157
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.190
Okay so we've got a number of results which is one.

158
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.870
Why is it not showing up in our game.

159
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:13.890
That's the kind of reasoning that I make So that's the kind of reasoning you could have made in the.

160
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.840
Don't worry if you didn't.

161
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.170
This is quite hard quite a tricky skill to look at logs and figure out what could be going on.

162
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:26.800
So if again got found lobbies one initialising the search search result zero lobby.

163
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.170
This is the lobby idea and name and so on and so forth.

164
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:36.860
In actual fact if you look at this lobby I.D. you can find when you're hosting a similar lobby is in

165
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.620
some of the information that is given when you hosting.

166
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.260
And you would actually be able to see that this lobby I.D. doesn't match with the hosting information.

167
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.070
But that's a site because you can actually work this out without having noticed that particular fact.

168
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:55.100
The other thing you'll notice here is that it's saying steam failed to pass settings and a few carry

169
00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:01.370
on down there's few past setting failures until eventually it says unable to pass search result for

170
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.870
lobby.

171
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.080
And then this lobby item which was mentioned at the top.

172
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:10.950
So we've got one result come back from our search and that result has basically been unable to pass

173
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.250
and then it's not displaying it.

174
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.090
Why would that be.

175
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.700
Why would it be failing to pass this particular session item.

176
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.840
Well the reason is we've got this shared app idea we're sharing it with everybody else.

177
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.640
So what's coming back is a lobby that is not from our game.

178
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.380
Why are we only getting a lobby that's not from our game.

179
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:36.170
Well for that you would have to go and investigate what options are available in our sessions search

180
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.610
and you would find that one of the options in session's search is actually a maximum number of results

181
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:49.100
so Mac's search results and the default for this I believe is just one search result or less perhaps

182
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:55.460
which means that you're not going to find your result you're not going to find instances of your game

183
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.440
you're going to find lots of other people's game.

184
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.480
None of your own.

185
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.830
So the best thing to do here is set it to a high number like 100 which means that it will get enough

186
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.380
results back to be able to then filter out all the games that aren't yours and present.

187
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.520
Present a list of games that are yours.

188
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.380
Obviously this issue wouldn't be an issue if we weren't sharing an app I.D. but we are.

189
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.700
So let's lump it and go along with that.

190
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.250
I'm going to go ahead and build and relaunch the game that's closed down the game while we're at it.

191
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.260
While it is building.

192
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.760
Going to close down the log and the game and wait for the bill to finish.

193
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.980
So once that has completed we can go over to ASH shell to launch the game again with logging as we did

194
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.690
before were going to have to re-enable out for both logging in the console once its launch.

195
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:49.790
So I'm going to hit the escape the key underneath escape and I'm going to re-enable the log online very

196
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:56.780
verbose scape here join just in case we need to get some more information for its joint at hasar we

197
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:03.260
have got ourselves the a instance of the game which is the one running on my other machine.

198
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.590
I can prove it by clicking hitting join and popping into that game.

199
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.590
Joining via steam you can see it's got a steam.

200
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:17.090
Interesting you are old that's not an IP address and boom I'm in the same game as the other chap and

201
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.770
I can prove it to you by running around as the other dude as well.

202
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.660
There you go.

203
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.160
So I'm definitely in control of both of these characters which means they were able to connect over

204
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.690
the Internet.

205
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.400
Now hopefully you were able to find that with your partner.

206
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.630
Don't worry if you were not.

207
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.730
You can always have watched on to the rest of the video and then complete the challenge making sure

208
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.460
that you are able to connect with your debugging partner.

209
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.120
Great stuff.

210
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.640
So we have achieved the crux of this section.

211
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.350
We're going to look at how we can polish it in the coming few lectures.
