00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.230
Okay welcome back.

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.460
Let's dive right in with this challenge.

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.530
So first things first I hate the layout so let's do something about that at the moment our vertical

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.210
box is just taking up all the space so I select my vertical box and go in to the details slot widget

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.640
switcher slot.

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.110
Then I can position this with alignment towards the centre.

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.230
Okay so that's already looking far better with centre alignment.

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.980
The other thing I notice is it's quite hard to read our host button at the moment because of the light

9
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.770
patch in the background.

10
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.860
So what I'm going to do there right click my vertical box go to wrap with overlay and I'm going to add

11
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.660
in an image background to this small section of the panel so lets go to the image component stick that

12
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.690
in the overlay then take an image component and its overlay slots.

13
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.570
We are going to feel the horizontal and vertical axes go to brush.

14
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.450
And not the brush but rather the colour and opacity and change the colour to black and the opacity to

15
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.070
something fairly dark like this.

16
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.130
Then what.

17
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.090
Okay so this needs to be at the back first of all so Im going to reorder the children of the overlay.

18
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.270
So the image is behind the vertical box.

19
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.600
MIKE So thats already much better.

20
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.110
And then youll notice that there isnt much spacing around these elements.

21
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.780
So to create the spacing what I'm going to do.

22
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.360
Is go in to my vertical box and to its padding where I am going to give a padding of 30.

23
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.970
Now gets given a little bit of space border around that.

24
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.720
Go to my widget switcher and set it's indexed to 1.

25
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.030
Then we can go ahead and preview this in the game.

26
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.490
Kate this is starting to look better.

27
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.790
Except I'm still a little bit unhappy about a few things like the space between the button and my text

28
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.780
field and also the fact that the text feels really ugly.

29
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.280
So let's go in and add some spacing we know how to add spacing by now with a size box.

30
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.210
So let's go and find a size box and drag it in to a vertical box just between the editable text and

31
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.080
the button.

32
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.070
Got a size box now and what I'm going to do is I'm going to set a height override and pull up that height

33
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.590
override until it's something that I'm happy with.

34
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.040
Go got some space now between the two.

35
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.140
Other thing that I noticed is when I hit play and I start typing in the box is that it shrinks it instantly

36
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.660
shrinks to fit the text and I don't like that I would like that it's basically got a minimum width to

37
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.050
do that.

38
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.990
We can select that board box.

39
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.250
Scroll on down and we can find in here somewhere a minimum desired width which I can just pull out and

40
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.030
make something sensible out of this.

41
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.380
So there seems about 800 seems to be about what I want.

42
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.040
Go ahead and hit play and try and type into this.

43
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.110
Then it doesn't shrink and that seems normal I can type in an IP address very easily.

44
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.430
If I go over it does still expand which is nice and that's I think probably the behaviour I want So

45
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.960
this is really starting to take shape.

46
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.550
Obviously the button has the wrong text so let's go and change the text from host to join.

47
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.070
Like so.

48
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.910
And then we want to do some styling on that text now.

49
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.190
Actually what you'll find is the style of the text is almost identical to styling the button except

50
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.930
that the image you can choose to be different.

51
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.560
So I'm actually going to be using the same image as the button as I found that out works quite nicely

52
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.310
so let's go ahead and find the button texture.

53
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.820
And this time I am going to stick with using the draw as box option because I've decided that I don't

54
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.160
mind the fact that the striping gets stretched out.

55
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.240
In this case actually isn't that noticeable and kind of looks okay in intended.

56
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.730
However what I'm going to have to do is change this but all three styles for all three with the background

57
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.510
image.

58
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.020
Let's have a look at what those names are background image.

59
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.020
Normal hovered and focussed.

60
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.270
I'm going to make sure all those styles are changed so hovered.

61
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:40.520
I am going to choose my button texture to be the highlighted one and for our background image focussed.

62
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.540
I am going to change the image to be be highlighted once so let's go ahead and play and see what that

63
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.170
looks like.

64
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:54.460
I hover over it it does very much same thing as the button but if I click on it then I can type in it

65
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.120
and it hovers and looks.

66
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.370
Looks about right okay.

67
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.220
I think I may have selected the wrong thing.

68
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.430
Yes but and highlighted.

69
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.600
That's right I wanted button clicked because I want it just to illuminate.

70
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.660
When I clicked on it they go so I can see what's going on against that background that looks fine.

71
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.920
Now I want to change the font because the font is too large for the fact that this border is now bigger.

72
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.680
So I'm going to decrease the size of the font ever so slightly.

73
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.980
What.

74
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.250
Try to.

75
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.740
But I notice that base that changes the size of the button which I don't want to do too much.

76
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.120
So let's leave the font size as it is and instead go ahead and change first of all the colour because

77
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.670
the colours really hard to read.

78
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.330
Let's copy the colour from the join text song and go to the join text.

79
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.060
Go to appearance colour opacity right click on colour opacity and hit copy go over to the editable text

80
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.260
box find its font and not actually its font.

81
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.550
I believe it's somewhere the foreground colour is what we want.

82
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.440
Let's paste half a kind of that we copied on to the foreground colour sure enough that changes the colour

83
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.060
of the font.

84
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.510
Now you can see it's slightly faded out when it's just the hint text.

85
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.390
But if I click on it and start typing you'll see it's exactly the same colour as my join button.

86
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:19.250
Now I just need to go ahead and add some padding to this text to do that.

87
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.270
We go to our.

88
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.290
Padding option under style and I'm going to add in.

89
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:33.300
Basically I think the left needs about 30 units the right needs about 30 units as well and the top and

90
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.460
bottom probably need something to read as.

91
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.230
Try 20 and 20.

92
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.680
See what that looks like.

93
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.680
Yeah that gives us plenty of space to work with.

94
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.970
Let's go ahead and hit play.

95
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.730
And now I can type into this box.

96
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.300
And it all seems to work very nicely.

97
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.980
So we got a nice entry field that says IP address where we can type Our IP address and then we can hit

98
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.270
join after we have typed our IP address.

99
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.530
So we've got a great working menu Let's see if we've done everything from the challenge we've said to

100
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.300
add a style of text box to improve the layout to ensure everything is legible Yes we've done all of

101
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.980
that.

102
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.940
We also wanted to add a headings so let's add a heading to know where we are to do that.

103
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.320
I'm going to copy the heading from our size box.

104
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.460
Main Menu.

105
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.260
Copy the main menu text.

106
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:28.170
And with that main many text Let's go over to our other overlay and this is very confusing they're very

107
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.190
confusingly named.

108
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.710
So let me rename them our size box is the main menu.

109
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:41.040
So I am going to f 2 and here call this main menu instead and the other one is not just overlay but

110
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.180
rather our join menu.

111
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.950
So now I can easily you know what is in our widgets which are.

112
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.380
So we got a join menu our main menu and we're going to go down to let's see.

113
00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.150
We're going to add some text undera vertical box say into slender vertical box hit paste ago May menus

114
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.420
be notes at the bottom obviously not what I intended.

115
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.910
Let's drag it up to the top of that menu.

116
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.060
And change the text.

117
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.990
To say.

118
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.440
Join a game.

119
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.470
Like so.

120
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.790
And now it seems pretty obvious what this menu does.

121
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.770
We type in an IP address that's going to be joining a game we had join and the game will be joined.

122
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.750
So that seems pretty clear to me.

123
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.440
I just want copy that size box because at the moment it is not entirely.

124
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.470
Not entirely working as I intended.

125
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.230
Let's remove.

126
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.700
I copied it in the wrong place copied it underneath the other sized books so let's copy and paste it

127
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.050
under the E.

128
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:55.470
Menu text so that we've got bit of even spacing between the join game IP address join.

129
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.210
So that's looking great.

130
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:02.790
One thing that I want to rectify now is that in our main menu we dont have this background so we had

131
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.790
to add lots of spacing for our host and join bus.

132
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.800
I dont like that.

133
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.580
So what I'm going to do is add an overlay to that menu as well.

134
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.240
So lets right click the main menu.

135
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.180
If I can.

136
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.330
I've moved it around by accident that's right click rap with overlay.

137
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:31.200
And then we are going to copy the image that we used as a background for the join menu click on the

138
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.620
overlay and paste it there and go how to reorder it so it's behind the main menu that's already looking

139
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.050
far far better.

140
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.240
Now the next thing is to change how it scales.

141
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.840
Currently we've got it scaling so that there is a size box inside our main menu.

142
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.360
We've got a vertical box then a size box.

143
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.490
It's all very confusing really if you think about it.

144
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.270
I believe we've got a size box anyway.

145
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.730
It's this size box.

146
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.530
Nope.

147
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.080
Got a vertical box and.

148
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.160
Oh yes at the roots.

149
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.670
We've got our size box so let's remove this size box entirely.

150
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.200
I'm going to right click the size box which is now being called Main Menu confusingly enough and I'm

151
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200
going to replace it with child.

152
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.190
Ago.

153
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.600
And now that's obviously scrunched everything up very small so Im going to add some sizes to that padding

154
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:30.700
sized boxes by checking the height override and increasing the height of that size box.

155
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.390
And then similarly the size boxes that go between the buttons in the horizontal box.

156
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.150
I'm going to increase the width of the middle one.

157
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.340
So we got bit more space between our.

158
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.340
And we don't need these other sized boxes now that are on the left and right of the buttons.

159
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.790
This is really simplified our design a bit.

160
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.650
And if we go and have a look at that now we've got the buttons laid out nicely.

161
00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.450
We have to add this padding that we had on our vertical box for the join menu to do exactly the same

162
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.900
thing to our overlay menu.

163
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:09.750
I'm going to add 30 units of padding around our menu go to our widgets which and preview this by changing

164
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.130
the active widget to zero.

165
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.790
Go ahead and hit play.

166
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.930
And sure enough I think we've got a better lay out there already with our main menu very legible because

167
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.550
of the background image but now it is being laid out in the middle rather than having to be artificially

168
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.580
spread out because of our background.

169
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.760
So now the names have changed because we've seen the fragile element that the top if we change the top

170
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.080
element name it's.

171
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.260
Everything else changes so let's wrap both of these in.

172
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.100
In some size boxes that don't do anything but just there for naming.

173
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:55.630
So I'm going to wrap first the top overlay which is actually our main menu in a size box and I'm going

174
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.780
to change the size box.

175
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.620
Name two main menu.

176
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:07.000
This way we've just got it they're not performing any function just for naming for grouping and now

177
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.390
and join menu which is actually an overlay.

178
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.520
Let's rename that back to overlay.

179
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.380
Like so and then right click the overlay go to wrap with find the size box.

180
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.490
And then rename the size box to join menu.

181
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.130
Okay.

182
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:31.380
So what we've done there is we just used some artificial size boxes to wrap our different menus so that

183
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.140
it's much easier to see what we're organizing.

184
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.330
And then I'm going to rename the widgets which are two menu switcher.

185
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.790
Just for a bit of organization in our hierarchy.

186
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.610
Okay.

187
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.870
Now I'm pretty happy with the resultant menu We've got obviously it's not functional from clicking the

188
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.270
join buttons perspective but that is what we are going to fix next so don't worry about that.

189
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.530
We're going to fix it all up and I'll see you in the next lecture.
