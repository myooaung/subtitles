1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,030
Welcome.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,210
In this lecture we are going to be looking at how we can add timeouts to our lobby so he can see or

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,550
increase my maximum number of players to five.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,090
And there is one active as we have been able to do in the last lecture.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,710
Well if I go into this lobby now you will notice that I am actually in the lobby with the other player.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,530
But after 10 seconds has elapsed then we all get transferred over into the game.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,740
So this allows a little bit of leeway in terms of how many players join in.

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,150
We could be up to five players if they're quick and if they all join in that 10 seconds or it could

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,910
just be the two players required to play the game and we're going to look at how to implement that session

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,150
timeout mechanic.

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,890
But we're also going to be looking at how we can make sure that once the session has started we aren't

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,300
going to get new players popping in late to the game.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,190
Let's dive in.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,450
So now that we have fixed the bug that was present in the last lecture we were able to get the number

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,650
of players that is required in our session.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,930
You'll find that there's no way of moving on from the lobby because no more than two people can be in

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,790
the lobby at the same time because you won't find the game when it's at maximum capacity.

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,070
So the first thing we want to do is update the maximum number of players in our game.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,780
This is very very easy to follow along with me.

20
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,970
Let's go to the puzzle platforms game instance and go and look for where we are creating our session.

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,100
So it's going to be here in create session.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,880
We can see that the number of public connections is two.

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,310
Now what I want to do is add some leeway for more people to join than just the three that are required

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,010
to move on from the lobby and that is going to just be done by having five public connections.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,880
And we will make it such that there is a time out when people hope for more than three people have joined

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,550
so three people have joined they can go on and play after five seconds but then we want to allow for

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,850
other people to be joining in that time span.

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,330
At the end of the timespan we want to close down the window for new people to join into the lobby and

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,530
everyone moves on who has who has joined the game already.

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,640
So that's the aim he says.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,550
We're going to create a we've increased the number of connections so I'm going to go ahead build that

32
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,060
and just check that we can get what we want which is that we can get more work and get three people

33
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,590
into the game and we can move on from the lobby.

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,350
Okay so the compile as successfully completed Let's go and launch up a few game instances and get them

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,480
to connect.

36
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:46,470
Specifically on going to launch up a one of em to launch up to and I'm going to launch up fabbri game

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,600
instances.

38
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:56,350
So in the first game instance let's be the host typing in any old name that we want and I will start

39
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,900
there I am.

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
I am in the lobby.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,680
OK.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,070
Now what about arse second and third game instance.

43
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm going to go ahead and hit join for both of those.

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,540
And here is the server.

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,310
Let's go ahead.

46
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,430
We can see that it's one of five players now because we've updated the number of players I'm going to

47
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,980
go and join in.

48
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,220
And I'm going to check that the other doods there yes he is sorry he's just hiding from me.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,380
And then with the third game instance let's go ahead and join that server too.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,090
It's now saying there's one of five players.

51
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,520
I think that's because I had not refreshed the menu if I go and hit join again.

52
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,410
Hopefully the menu will refresh.

53
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,110
Which it has done.

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,670
And now you can see that there are two of five players in the game which is perfect as the bug that

55
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,120
we solved.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,960
Let's go ahead and join that game.

57
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,500
And they'll go.

58
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,420
Everybody has joined in to the main third person Matt.

59
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,230
We want to be able to do is have a bit of a five or 10 second delay where a fourth person could join

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,960
in there as well.

61
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,060
So let's go ahead and shut down these instances.

62
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,560
All three.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,170
There we go.

64
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,490
They are all shut down.

65
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,830
That's my time tracking.

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,300
It's just a showing there in the background telling me that I am working on the right things.

67
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,190
Okay so let's carry on to actually getting that session time out working.

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,560
We can do this in C++ and it has to be in the game mode because that's what's currently starting our

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
third person session.

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,690
So let's go and find our lobby game mode which is game mode C++ at the root of vassie plus plus hierarchy.

71
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,540
And as you can see here we have got a we're doing a world server travel as you will probably remember

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,500
when we have more than three players.

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,780
What I want to do is that when we have more than three players we start a timer which will trigger the

74
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,940
world server travel.

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,830
Now if you haven't seen how this is done before let me just show you.

76
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:56,330
This piece of documentation on game play time is which is in your resources has everything you need

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,590
to manage your time as there is a class called F timer manager which you can get hold of with a global

78
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,280
call here which says Get world time a manager and then you can do things like set timers on it and it

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,700
takes in something call well an hour parameter here which is the timer handle which allows you to clear

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:24,020
the timer if you later need to and it takes in whether how long to wait and whether this is a repeating

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,400
timer.

82
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,710
So whether it should repeatedly call this function.

83
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,120
And the first delay and the subsequent intervals is basically what it's telling us but you can find

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,070
all that from the documentation for yourself and then it calls a delegate.

85
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,090
So that's all pretty straightforward you could easily set this up for yourself.

86
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,470
I'm going to ask you to do it as part of your choice.

87
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,360
Given that we're quite late on in the course this is going to be quite a sizable challenge.

88
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Not huge though not huge at all.

89
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,560
You going to start the game on time.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,320
The idea here is that you are going to use the time manager and try and figure out how you can use that.

91
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,720
It's fairly easy fairly well documented so you should have no problem whatsoever then wait for X players

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,350
to join X is totally up to you whether it's three in my case or two or four up to game play choice and

93
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,590
depends how many friends you have.

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,490
If you are very popular you might want 15 players who are less popular you might just want to and so

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,010
on.

96
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,530
Then get the games started after y second so again that depends how long you want to leave for other

97
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:28,280
people to join potentially and then you can go ahead and call start session on the session interface

98
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,670
which is going to have the side effect of making sure that others can't join.

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,840
Now you'll have to check that that is indeed the case that no one else can see your session any more

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,590
and can't be joined.

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,080
But that start session should do the trick so give it a shot.

102
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,310
Pause the video and have a go at this challenge.

103
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,270
Okay welcome back.

104
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,540
Let's dive in and see if we can figure out how to use these timer managers shall we.

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,820
So the first things first we need to call this get time manager.

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,370
So that's what I'm going to do over in my C++ in place of.

107
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,700
So where we'd previously been calling this world thing before that I'm going to do a get to time a manager

108
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,120
and then I go and do get time and a dot.

109
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,000
Nothing is coming out here.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,340
Now why is that.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,670
Because we have an incomplete type.

112
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,890
So you folks probably know how to deal with these incomplete types.

113
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,330
By now we are talking about the timer Manager API.

114
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,390
So there's even a link from this page to the EFT type of manager.

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,280
AP I am going to go ahead and scroll right down to the bottom where hopefully sure enough there is a

116
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,390
header file for me to include I'm going to include the bit after Publicly though the whole thing would

117
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,930
work too and I'm going to put it in underneath my include lobby game mode.

118
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:49,500
So it's going to be include and then I'm just to paste in that head a file that should remove an incomplete

119
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,070
type errors.

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,970
Now what would we be doing next.

121
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,130
Well we can have a look at the API for each time a manager can't we.

122
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,690
We should be setting a timer.

123
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:04,950
That's the thing I'm looking for as a few options for set time that we can take in with basically all

124
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:11,820
of them take an F timer handle this out parameter thing in our parameter and what do we do with it.

125
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,640
So we basically all of them seem to take in different types of delegates but the other arguments seem

126
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,150
to stay the same.

127
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:28,320
And I think the one we want is that takes in a user class and then takes in a function of some sort

128
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,620
so that we can just patin this and the function.

129
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,300
I think that's the top one we can have a look at.

130
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,410
Not this one back.

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,410
We want the very top one.

132
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,470
Which takes in a pointer to an object which in our case is going to be this and then it takes this type

133
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,990
name f timer.

134
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,860
Delegate method type.

135
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,470
Basically And we can see in the example code here how it works and what the.

136
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,630
That the time basically doesn't take any arguments at all which makes sense because if we're responsible

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,840
for setting up the timer here we have all the data that we need.

138
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,060
We don't need to attach any more data to this timer and we wouldn't be getting any data back from the

139
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,600
system because we've set off the timer ourselves.

140
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,600
OK so enough talking about it.

141
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:22,200
Let's go in and get it done so I'm going to go ahead and create a thing for us to call that will allow

142
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,340
us to start the game so I'm going to go over to the head of file with that control K control o in Visual

143
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,770
Studio and I'm going to create a private method because we're only calling it from within here and it's

144
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,810
going to return void and it going to call it start game.

145
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,750
Like so.

146
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,450
And then start a game.

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,400
And we are going to go over into the C++ and implement this I'm and do it after log out because logout

148
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,270
could happen before we start again.

149
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,150
And then I'm going to implement them.

150
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Body and the body were just going to take from.

151
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,940
Our post log in where we are getting hold of the world and then on the world we are doing a server travel

152
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,740
to the game.

153
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,980
So that's what we want to call.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,130
After a certain time out so we get our timer manager and we need to do set timer.

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,440
And then what are we going to be passing it.

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's go and have a look at the arguments.

157
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,290
The first thing is this timer handle which we know to be of.

158
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,970
Type f timer handle and it is a an out parameter so we kind of want this to live on the class because

159
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,250
it needs to exist between methods if we want to later try and cancel it.

160
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,840
Between.

161
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,750
Between it starting and finish we might want to cancel it when somebody logs out for example.

162
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,960
I'm not going to do that straight away but that is a possibility.

163
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,760
So we're going to want to implement this f timer handle.

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,550
As a member variable.

165
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,120
So let's go up to the head of file again in under privat and do it just above.

166
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,540
Start a game.

167
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,790
In fact on a dip below our game because we've got our other member variable in there but the number

168
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,450
of players and I think I'll do it even below that.

169
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,360
So it's going to be an F timer handle.

170
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,370
And we are going to just call this game start timer.

171
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,410
Like so.

172
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,230
And that means that I can just pass game start time as the first argument to my set timer.

173
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:30,960
Then I need to pass the pointer to this and then I need to pass the address of the start game function

174
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,960
to do with the address of operator.

175
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,160
And be fully qualified.

176
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:44,800
A start game then then we need to specify the first delay the amount of time in basically till the first

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,640
note first the in rate.

178
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,620
This is showing the wrong signature here in Visual Studio which can happen.

179
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,510
Let's try and find it.

180
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,710
Go for the one we want.

181
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,900
Is the in rate.

182
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,590
So we are going to pass.

183
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,760
How many seconds.

184
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,530
Basically until we execute this timer which in my case I'm going to go for 5 seconds and then whether

185
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,940
I want it to loop or not.

186
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,320
Well the default is false and there is a first delay already so I'm not going to pass any of those which

187
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,450
should automatically mean that after 5 seconds start game will be called from the call to this set.

188
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,000
Tyler I'm happy with that.

189
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,680
Let's go ahead and build it and see if it actually works.

190
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,840
Well least the build worked.

191
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,730
Let's go over and start up some instances.

192
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,850
In particular when I start up three instances so we can get three people joining in fact that reminds

193
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,390
me I actually want to change the number of people to not going to rebuild for this for this instance

194
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,210
but in future I want to have just two people so that I can test it out with fewer people and few instances

195
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,040
and less load on my system.

196
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,270
So here are the games.

197
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,150
Let's go ahead and host in and one of them and we're going to go over to the others and we are going

198
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,730
to join in those.

199
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:06,430
So first member who can see that there is one player currently there so let's join and or go over to

200
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,410
number two.

201
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,260
Jolene.

202
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,260
As you can see there are two players.

203
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,490
Here we are.

204
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
We've joined.

205
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,230
And he can actually see the lobby for a while hopefully for about five seconds and then boom we have

206
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,150
moved it on into the game which means that somebody else could have joined in that intervening time

207
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,580
does feel like a little bit of a short time for other people to join so I'm going to go ahead and close

208
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,160
this down and increase my timeout to about 10 seconds.

209
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,040
And I've got two players so we're going to be easier to test like that and the next thing we want to

210
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,230
do is actually start the session so that once the game is in progress no one else is going to be able

211
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,620
to see that there is a session there to join.

212
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,690
It's no longer available even though the maximum number of players was five.

213
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,260
If you've already started the session no more no more game for anybody else.

214
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,490
So the way we're going to do this is that the game instances where we're calling everything on the session

215
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,410
interface already.

216
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,050
So I'm going to expose a public method from the game instance and we are going to call it.

217
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,160
So let's get the game instance C++ file open and we're going to create a public method here which is

218
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,940
going to be something along the lines of start a session.

219
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,980
So I'm going to do this.

220
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,390
I've got hosed we've got join and then we can just have a void start.

221
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,730
Or start sessional star games start session.

222
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,690
I think I'll call it that need to take any arguments because we've only got one session that we could

223
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,980
possibly want to start.

224
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,730
It's copy that go back into the C++ file for the game instance and we find we've got create sesshin

225
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,690
we've got refresh server list.

226
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:52,200
I think I'm going to do it after all of this and probably just before load main menu.

227
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,420
So let's and a namespace to that.

228
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,030
And let's add a body to that method.

229
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,510
And a namespace wasn't quite a colon code on it was a bit bizarre.

230
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,190
So let's go ahead and add something into this body it should be fairly straightforward we just want

231
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,310
to do an if session interface.

232
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,600
Dot is valid.

233
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,850
Then we want to go ahead and we want to session interface arrow.

234
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:33,460
And you're found in the documentation for start session that it just takes the session name which is

235
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:39,490
handly in our constant at the top of the file so I'm going to copy it called session name and I am going

236
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,440
to paste that thing and it's really as simple as that that's all you need to do to go ahead and start

237
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,330
a session opes have started building.

238
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,960
I mean that's okay but it's not fully complete yet anyway.

239
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,350
So astarte session we are going to now try and call from the game instance.

240
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,310
So we need to get hold of it in our.

241
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,220
No sorry not the game instance in the game mode and the C++ So we need to get hold of it in here.

242
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,660
So once we've done our server travel or before we've done our server travel even we want to go ahead

243
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,300
and get hold of the current game instance and cast it to a puzzle platforms game instance and then call

244
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,560
the method on it.

245
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,200
So how do we do all of that.

246
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,190
Well fortunately the game mode actually has a method on it called Get game instance which is very easy

247
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,400
and convenient for us and that's going to get hold of a game instance of the generic game new game instance

248
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,450
type which is useful but not the best thing in the world.

249
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,000
Now the reason we've got these get game instance type is because our game mode actually inherits from

250
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,110
actor an actor has this get game is this type very convenient for us.

251
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,390
So what I'm going do is I'm going to include the head of file for our puzzle platforms game instance

252
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
dot H.

253
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,580
And that is going to allow us to use that type of puzzle platform game instance and also know what functions

254
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:00,970
are on there.

255
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,970
So it's not an incomplete type so that we can call things like We want to.

256
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,510
So now that we got a game instance what I want to do is cast that game instance which we've used before

257
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:17,610
to do something like to cast it to see see if I can get auto complete to do it for me.

258
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,010
So the main brackets I'm going to have the game instance in the angle brackets.

259
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm going to look for a puzzle platform.

260
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,890
Not the game mode but should be the game.

261
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,160
Instance should be in here somewhere.

262
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah you puzzle platform game instance is a type we're trying to cast to now remember I said that we

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,350
use auto when there is going to be a lot of repetition here.

264
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,950
That's at least what I like to do and I'm going to call this the game instance.

265
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:52,260
And if I hover over auto It should tell me what the inferred type is it says classic you puzzle platform

266
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,960
game instance I'm fairly sure that's going to be a pointer.

267
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,220
It will have inferred that it's a pointer because what we gain back from get game instance is a pointer.

268
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,540
So that means that we need to check if it is not only going to an IF game instance.

269
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,110
Let's see equals null pointer.

270
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,860
Then I'm just going to return from here.

271
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,260
Mike so.

272
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,520
And otherwise we can go ahead and start the session so we can say game instance arrow.

273
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,120
Start.

274
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,380
Session.

275
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,060
Fantastic So that's past the start session up to the game instance where it then called it on its session

276
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,820
in object and now we can go ahead and build and we want to fire up some game instances after it's built

277
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,860
to test it.

278
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,400
So build succeeded.

279
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:51,430
Let's go ahead and launch up a three game instances because I want to go ahead and add in Freeplay is

280
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,640
simultaneously into this game.

281
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,930
That's one more than the time out.

282
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,550
Then I want to show you if we launch up a fourth game instance that once they've moved across they will

283
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:06,100
no longer be visible some simultaneously showing you that it is visible even when you've got more than

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,870
the two required players.

285
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,670
But that is not visible once we've called Start session.

286
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:17,470
So let's go ahead and host in one I will go into the other two and load up the join menu so I can make

287
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,080
them join in quick succession.

288
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:26,410
So before the 10 second time out and then in the first one I'm going to go ahead and join in the second

289
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,730
one.

290
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,350
I'm going to go ahead and join switches before the timeout so we're all in here time should have started

291
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,610
on the second player and then we are going to move across after the 10 second timeout while they are

292
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,910
doing that are they go.

293
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,880
They've all moved across in one go.

294
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,510
While we are doing that we can go over and launch another game instance and I want to show you that

295
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,600
its join menu its fine menu is actually going to be empty.

296
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,860
So lets go ahead and hit join and look at what comes up.

297
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,570
Now no matter how long I wait that session is not going to come up anymore because it has been marked

298
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,520
as in progress and so is no longer joinable.

299
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,110
That's true.

300
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:13,420
The Null subsystem but it's also true of steam you can test that out for yourself by re-enable ing steam

301
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,700
and that's definitely something I recommend you do because at this point this section of steam connection

302
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,680
is done you are able to connect to steam.

303
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,540
Your able to do all the lobbying mechanics you are able to mark the session as in progress as the end

304
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,310
of dealing with sessions.

305
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:33,010
Now we can really deal with the meat in the next section so there might be a few more lectures of tidying

306
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,680
up that get added later but for now this is the main subject of what we wanted to do.

307
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,470
Congratulations pat ourselves on the back.

308
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,280
Steam is now working and I'll see you in the next lectures.
