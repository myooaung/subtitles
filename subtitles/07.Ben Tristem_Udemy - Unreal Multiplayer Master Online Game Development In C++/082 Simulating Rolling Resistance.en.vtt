00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.510
In this lecture we are going to be implementing rolling resistance so he can see I've got my car going

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.310
up at the limits of the air resistance and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my foot off the

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.960
accelerator and see how we slow down so slowing down slowly it's slowing down.

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.680
But we've now got the extra resistance of rolling resistance on top of our air resistance so the air

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.190
resistance was limiting our top speed and making it harder and harder to accelerate.

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.350
But the rolling resistance is kind of acting at the lower end when we're slowing down.

8
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.820
It's still applying force whereas the air resistance was not applying force which means that with the

9
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.310
rolling resistance we're going to eventually come to a total standstill like this very much like a real

10
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.510
car would.

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.860
So let's dive in and see what this rolling resistance thing is all about and how we can implement it.

12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.560
Unreal.

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.980
So rolling resistance may be familiar to some of you who are into motor sports or mountain biking because

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.680
we often try and minimize our rolling resistance on wheeled vehicles.

15
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.120
It is something that comes about because our wheels are usually squishy Rob and hard.

16
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.290
That's obviously desirable because our roads aren't perfectly flat so otherwise we end up with lots

17
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.350
of bumps.

18
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.100
But it does mean that we get a resistance to movement when we are rolling these tyres.

19
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.750
How does it work exactly.

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.550
Well there is a formula given and lots and lots of detail here in the Wikipedia article so I'm not going

21
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.730
to go over everything.

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.520
But we are going to pick up that part.

23
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.580
The formula that is given here the rolling resistance coefficient formula.

24
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.140
And as you can see it is well let's pick it apart shall we.

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.130
I've got a slide here.

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.640
So the rolling resistance is equal to the rolling resistance coefficient multiplied by something called

27
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.760
the normal force so you can see that basically it is related linearly to the normal force.

28
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.360
And I can tell you straight away that the normal force has nothing to do with the loss.

29
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.160
So essentially as far as velocity is concerned this is a constant force applying against us which is

30
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.600
why it can help us come to a stop.

31
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.060
Okay so let's investigate all the normal forces so far we've been looking at our portion.

32
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.460
We've had resistance going backwards.

33
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.200
We've had driving force going forwards more about going up and down while actually the normal force

34
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.910
is a force that pushes up.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.240
It's the ground pushing up on our car.

36
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.250
And why is it pushing up because you'd imagine if it were just pushing up there's nothing pushing down

37
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.910
it would fly off into the sky.

38
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.650
Well it's counteracting the force of gravity.

39
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.150
Otherwise we'd be plummeting through the ground.

40
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.080
The ground is applying a force to keep us there so that we don't go accelerating through the ground.

41
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.110
This force due to gravity by for some of the you are interested is equal to the mass of the object multiplied

42
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:58.240
by G which is the acceleration due to gravity and on earth G tends to be nine point eight one.

43
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.560
And on other planets such as the moon it will be lower because they are smaller planets and their gravity

44
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.310
is less strong.

45
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.770
And on some planets where the gravity is even stronger them on the earth such as the sun then G will

46
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.440
be a much much larger number.

47
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.210
But we aren't too interested in that we just want to figure out what G is in unreel So how do we figure

48
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.230
out what G is in and real.

49
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.230
Well let's go and have a look and see if we can find it.

50
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.500
It's actually a property of the world.

51
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.360
So what we're going to do.

52
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.160
And you can follow along with this is if we go into tick we can get hold of the property the gravity

53
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.640
property of the Earth or at least the world that we're on which is going to try and simulate the earth

54
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.100
so we can do a GET world and then we're going to need our head a file for the world because we vowed

55
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.110
to use the arrow operators so it's going to be include engine forward slash world.

56
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.090
H.

57
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.090
And then in batam we are going to do so.

58
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.660
Get world.

59
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.900
We are going to do an arrow and we're going to look for gravity.

60
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.540
You could obviously search in the documentation I'm not going to show you the documentation page.

61
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.580
Well we've done that many times already so we can do a get grouty Z.

62
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.280
Now what I want to do is go ahead and print that out so that you know what that looks like so I'm going

63
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.090
to do a ewy Log log a temp warning.

64
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.740
Text and the text is going to be gravity.

65
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:29.450
And I am going to print it out as the float because that's what it is and then we got our get gravity

66
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.180
which just check.

67
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.420
Yep it is a float.

68
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:40.370
And we can go ahead and build that three of semicha on the end of the line and I believe everything

69
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.100
we log under you.

70
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.750
E underscore log is what I needed to type.

71
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.500
Go build that and see what AB gravity comes back at.

72
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.880
Okay so the build was successful Let's go over into unreel and play.

73
00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.910
We should be able to stop straight away because we can see already in there that we've got negative.

74
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.030
Now that's interesting.

75
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.010
Nine hundred and eighty.

76
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.960
Why is that because it's using the unreel units of centimetres.

77
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.840
So it's going to be a hundred times larger than the standard units which are meters which is nine point

78
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.490
eight.

79
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.580
And obviously there's a negative sign in front of this as well that we didn't put there.

80
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.380
That negative sign is implying that it is in the z direction.

81
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.910
It is negative it's down towards the ground.

82
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.450
Okay so we're going to do a little bit of conversion to get g from this.

83
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.870
It's fairly straightforward it's going to be a float minus and then it's going to be this gravity thing.

84
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.890
And it's going to be divided by 100 to get rid of the unreal units.

85
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.230
And we could call that G or acceleration due to gravity but woese a capital A.

86
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.060
Because that's the real convention.

87
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.810
So acceleration due to gravity is equal to this whole thing.

88
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.310
So we can remove the log message now and we know how to find gravity and real so the next step is implementing

89
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.640
that rolling resistance.

90
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.830
And that's fairly straightforward so I'm going to leave it as a challenge to you now that you know what

91
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.610
the formula for rolling resistance is.

92
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.300
You can go ahead and implement it add rolling resistance try different coefficients Wikipedia has a

93
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.390
list of coefficients that are common.

94
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.980
How long does it take to stop.

95
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.830
Try it out and tweak your coefficient of rolling resistance to your satisfaction pulls the video and

96
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.530
have a go.

97
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.150
Okay welcome back.

98
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.310
So first things first we've got a get resistance function.

99
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.080
Now I don't like that this is called get resistance because actually get air resistance.

100
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.690
So let's call it that get air resistance.

101
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.360
And I am going to copy it from the head a file to where we use it in both where we declare it in the

102
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:56.440
key and where we use it in that take and then we're going to opportunistically create another one which

103
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.500
is going to be get rolling resistance.

104
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.940
And I am going to go ahead and declare that one in the head a file actually by copying the get air resistance.

105
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.860
Pasting it because I have exact same signature and copying and pasting the name get rolling resistance

106
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.950
as well.

107
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.520
They'll copy that all over in to our C++ file.

108
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.090
Where I'm going to add the namespace code on colon and I'm going to remove the semicolon at a body.

109
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.000
Okay simple stuff but has to be done.

110
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.290
So we're going to return the negative again and the direction is still going to be that gets safe normal

111
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.820
because we're going to be going against the velocity the rolling resistance is still a resistance so

112
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.160
it acts against the direction of motion.

113
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.120
So that's how we're going to get the direction in to our valley.

114
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.710
Next up we need to have a coefficient of rolling resistance so we can go ahead and copy add drag coefficient

115
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:58.340
comment and all and we are going to rename drag coefficient to rolling resistance.

116
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.100
Coefficient.

117
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.850
And I am going to take a value from the Wikipedia article.

118
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.360
Let's go n look at the table that they have there and you can see that they have a section that says

119
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:16.330
ordinary tyres on concrete as the description and it says it's between not point not one and not point

120
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.380
not one.

121
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.050
5 I'm going to pick the larger of the two.

122
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.280
Just because.

123
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.200
And I'm going to set that as a default value for our rolling resistance coefficient.

124
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.720
And I'm going to change the comment to a higher means more rolling resistance.

125
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.970
Okay fair enough.

126
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.370
So we're good.

127
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:44.930
That is our rolling resistance set at least an hour an hour go into the C plus plus And yes that's all

128
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.780
looking okay now we just need to actually implement that formula.

129
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:55.490
So we're going to have our rolling resistance coefficient as the first thing multiplied by.

130
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.020
And this is going to be an normal force that we don't have that defined yet.

131
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.780
So let's define that normal force that's going to be float normal force.

132
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.300
So it's not a force vector but just it's force magnitude.

133
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.520
But that's okay because we know that the direction is being got at from the get velocity.

134
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.130
And then we are going to create this.

135
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.780
And as I said the normal force is equal to but opposite to the gravitational force.

136
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:33.920
So we can go ahead and look at this gravitational forces M times g so m times g is mass times g and

137
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:39.380
g we have already calculated acceleration due to gravity tick can move in out of tick and move it into

138
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.510
our get rolling resistance instead.

139
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:46.190
So calculate the acceleration due to gravity it's mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity

140
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.200
gives us the normal force then there's normal forces multiplied by the rolling resistance which gives

141
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.610
us the rolling resistance force.

142
00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:03.790
Okay so that then gets added in to our force vector and hopefully we will get a decent rolling resistance.

143
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.050
Let's give it a shot shall we.

144
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.920
Okay so that finished building let's go and test the out plane.

145
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.100
And accelerating up.

146
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.300
Up up up up up.

147
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.290
Turn around a bend.

148
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:23.360
Still accelerating celebrating accelerating accelerating when I get round the bend I will release I

149
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:23.830
go.

150
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:29.200
I have released the accelerator and you can see I'm definitely slowing down better than I was with the

151
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.210
air resistance slowing down slowing down and the idea is that we should come to a complete stop.

152
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.700
Might take a little bit of time because the rolling resistance that we have chosen is actually pretty

153
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.980
low because cars he knew have actually quite efficient in terms of their rolling resistance at least

154
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.930
and we keep going but you can see that we're going to come to a stop slowly.

155
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.110
And there we go.

156
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:58.000
Complete standstill now and we can turn on the spot unfortunately but we're definitely definitely a

157
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.510
complete standstill which we couldn't really get to in a sensible amount of time with just the air resistance.

158
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.960
So I'm fairly happy with that.

159
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.920
It's quite light.

160
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:12.700
It does slow down pretty slowly so I might tweak it up but I'll choose to do that at a later time.

161
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.180
At the moment it feels like we got we've got a good feel.

162
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.330
Feels like a road car more or less and it accelerates well enough and we slow down well enough.

163
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.830
I'm pretty happy with that now.

164
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:31.650
There are a few the weedy things like the fact we can rotate on the spot when we stood completely still.

165
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.860
That's a bit odd isn't it.

166
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:41.590
But also another strange thing is that we when we reverse that go reverse thing we actually stay in

167
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.540
the opposite direction to what you'd expect.

168
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.850
You can't tell but try this for yourself.

169
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.230
If you try and steer using the arrow keys were going to steer in the opposite direction so it is going

170
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.040
to fix some of these oddities in the next lecture.

171
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.020
I'll see you there.
