00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,040
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,850
We aren't going to be looking at the essence of a client server model and why.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,670
And real users in the first place then we are going to learn how we can launch a server in unreal and

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,900
connect to it as clients and we're going to be doing this using the command prompt over here.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,980
As you can see I have launched up a bunch of things here.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,300
You probably don't know what that means yet but don't worry you will do by the end of this lecture.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,160
And you can see that I've got three other windows here too for the clients and one for the server.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,810
And I've got two visual windows for the clients.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,670
If that's all gobbledygook to you then you really need this lecture.

10
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,780
So dive right in.

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,960
And we'll find out what that all means.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,530
So I want to tell you a little bit about something called the client server model and why we use this

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,830
in unreel to do that.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:02,660
We're going to start off with a little bit of grounding in what being a multiplier and doing a multiplayer

15
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,300
is all about.

16
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,600
And the main two things that it's all about is input end state.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,250
Now let me explain what I mean by that state is basically everything in your world and its positions

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,060
it's velocity's anything that can basically affect what you see the state as what gets rendered by the

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,460
engine into the image you see on the screen.

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,390
So it's all the transforms are the actors the various variables in the components the various variables

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,920
in the actors and so on and so forth.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,130
So it's whether an explosion has just gone off it is where the actor is OK at certain position with

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,780
a certain velocity.

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,010
I'm repeating myself.

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,300
That's the idea of state and what happens with state.

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:54,920
Well we add to it some actions some inputs which are things like me pressing a button or holding down

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,800
a throttle or a joystick and all that sort of thing.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,290
Now what happens in an engine is that during the tick particularly called the Tick.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:14,390
And real you combine the current state with the current inputs or the current actions and result with

30
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,790
a second stage.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,120
The next step.

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,890
And then this state is the thing that gets rendered and showed to the user.

33
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,670
And so on and so forth.

34
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,920
The cycle repeats and repeats.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,520
Now clearly to have a good multiplayer game you've got to have the different players agree what the

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,540
State of the game is.

37
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,530
It's no use one player thinking oh I've won.

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,820
And the other play thinking oh no I won because that's obviously going to be a bit of a silly game.

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,810
It's really more of a single player game than a multiplayer game.

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,780
Someone's got to win.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,280
You've got to be able to call up your friend and say I just did this amazing headshot on you deny and

42
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,950
that friends got to go oh yeah you did.

43
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,990
So that's the idea we want to be able to agree on the state and we need to be able to incorporate the

44
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,560
actions from both players.

45
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,890
To do that otherwise it would be very straightforward it would be like lives streaming a twitch castino

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,600
one person's doing the actions everyone else is just watching his state.

47
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,000
So we need crucially to have actions from both players and for both players to agree what the state

48
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,410
is now saying both players obviously here it can be way more than just two.

49
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,660
So let's talk a little bit about one of the simple and kind of naÃ¯ve ways of implementing this kind

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,680
of thing.

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,860
It's called peer to peer because there is no server.

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,260
It's only about the players all communicating with each other.

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,790
So we've got four players here denoted by these four computer screens I don't really like people I like

54
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,270
computers so I'm only drawn the players as computers.

55
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:50,650
And what we're going to do is say that when I make a change to my inputs I'm going to broadcast it to

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,920
everybody as in I'm going to send a message to all the other players saying here's the input that I

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,160
have just made.

58
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,750
And what's going to happen is that all those players are going to update their state based on the inputs

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,580
they have received.

60
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,630
Now one crucial thing to note about this is that in order to correctly update my state I need to wait

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,990
to listen to everybody else's inputs before I update the state.

62
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,760
And before we can move on to the next frame before we can do the next tick and as the crucial problem

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,730
because it means we have to wait for the slowest person and I don't mean the slowest person in terms

64
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,170
of their trigger reactions.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,500
I mean the slowest person in terms of their network connection the time it takes for their message to

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
reach my computer.

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,140
So we have to take that into account and we have to wait for that before we can do the next take and

68
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,340
unfortunately this can lead to an incredibly incredibly slow game.

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,190
So this is one of the crucial downsides of a peer to peer architecture like this.

70
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,480
Another big problem with this architecture is the security.

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,780
You could easily have one of these players just cheating and sending out inputs that it doesn't know

72
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,550
to be true.

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,020
So it's not actually doing the right thing at all or am i be saying that I'm going really fast and you've

74
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,500
got no way of making sure that the states are staying in sync.

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,540
You hope that with the same inputs things are gonna stay the same but often with things like the physics

76
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,150
engines these can slightly differ and these differences can compound and become really massive.

77
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,980
So you don't end up agreeing on state at all.

78
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,340
Now there are ways of fixing this but one of the very easy ways of fixing is one of the simplest and

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,160
most intuitive ways of fixing this is that you take the same four computers that you had before and

80
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,450
instead of connecting them to each other you connect them to a central server this ominous looking obsidian

81
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,520
box here.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,670
Now what we do is when we have some input to talk about help we tell the server not all the other users.

83
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,730
Then that server will update its notion of the state.

84
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,250
Now its version of the state is authoritative.

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,610
That means that what the server says goes and then the server will say okay well I know what changed

86
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,350
in this state.

87
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,060
So I'm going tell everybody else what's changed so they can update their local versions their local

88
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,120
copies of the state and they can render that to their player.

89
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:25,050
So this is a very very simple model and this is one real uses which is why I am kind of finishing with

90
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,490
it because it's very useful for you to understand what's going on under the covers and we're going to

91
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,190
become Grebe covering the whole replication concept in much more detail later on.

92
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,420
But for now it's sufficient to understand that we need to connect to a server.

93
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,800
Everybody needs to connect to a server so that this kind of thing can go on so that we can send our

94
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,280
inputs and we can receive the changes to the state that we need to make in order to render.

95
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,280
Okay so let's have a look at how we can achieve this.

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,270
The first thing that we need to do is open up the command prompt or on Mac you're going to be opening

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,790
up the terminal because we want to do is be able to launch a game from the command line because it allows

98
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,160
us to launch it both as a game as a client or as a server or as a server turned client.

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,750
That's another thing that is not on this diagram but something to point out that the player can also

100
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,270
be the server they don't have to be two separate boxes.

101
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,310
They can be the same.

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,660
And I'm you probably familiar with this from playing online games itself.

103
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,510
So the first thing we need to do is find the unreal executable so Im going to go to my file browser

104
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:32,970
here.

105
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,860
And it has opened over on the other window.

106
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,250
But those of you on a Mac just bear with me for one minute while we do the windows instructions and

107
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,960
your instructions will be next.

108
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,670
Going to go to my program files so the seed cedar rectory.

109
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,590
I think its program files not the exe.

110
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,650
Eighty six and I'm looking for and real.

111
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,380
Four point seventeen which is down here.

112
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,710
And then we are going to go in to the engine folder.

113
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,930
And then two binaries.

114
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,850
Then in two wins 64.

115
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:12,890
And in here we should have an executable called you E4 Ed..

116
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,160
Here it is right here.

117
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,870
It's going to click on that and click copy path.

118
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,900
Now you can do that any way you like on Mac.

119
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,990
It's going to be slightly different.

120
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm going to paste that into my command prompt.

121
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,250
Then the second thing I need is the project.

122
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,290
Where do I find the project.

123
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,380
Well you obviously know where your own project is and we're looking particularly for the EU project

124
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,890
file.

125
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,480
And I'm going to copy the path of the you project file.

126
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,290
And I'm going to stick that in to command prompt again at and pace that they go.

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,580
So for those of you on a Mac the process is going to look ever so slightly different.

128
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,230
So go to the root of your device.

129
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,360
In my case it's a MacBook Air yours might be different then go to your Macintosh HD or whatever your

130
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,660
main hard drive is now you might expect to find an application in applications but you'd be wrong.

131
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,830
It's slightly different with unreel you've got to go into users and shared and there will be a shared

132
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,560
user there and then you go to big games.

133
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,070
I believe yes there are big games then the unrule version this one's a bit older on my Mac.

134
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,920
And then we go over to the engine.

135
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,970
Binary is very much the same now.

136
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,960
Go to a Mac this time rather than Windows.

137
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,910
And you've got the UNIFOR editor now you might be tempted to just take that as your binary but it's

138
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,040
not actually a binary it's an app.

139
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,890
So we have to do is you have to right click it go to show package contents and this land you inside

140
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:55,500
the app and you go to content Mac OS and then down here somewhere we have the actual binary which has

141
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,520
no extension at all which is ewy for Ed. And you can command see this binary and go ahead and paste

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,640
it in that you already in waiting terminal and then I'm sure you can do the rest yourself.

143
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,610
Now notice a couple of things.

144
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,370
There is a space between these two.

145
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,020
And if you've done it via copying and pasting like I've done you'll see that there are also quotes around

146
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,370
the two patterns.

147
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,550
Okay so that's going to be helpful.

148
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,830
Now if you launch it just like this is going to launch up an editor window.

149
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,100
So what we need to do to make sure it launches again is put a dash and game on the end.

150
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:40,750
If I do that then what I'm going to see hopefully will go is the puzzle platforms a dialogue loading

151
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,330
up which is telling me it's late in the game and then hopefully that will pop up in to a full screen

152
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:46,600
game.

153
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,240
Here we go.

154
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,600
See this happily.

155
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,730
Here I am in my third person environment jumping around moving around so that is a standalone game.

156
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,610
Now this can be very useful.

157
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,680
For example if you've got a bug that's crashing the editor consistently and you want to figure out what

158
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,710
it is because if you launch a game up like this it won't crash the editor it will only crash.

159
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,810
This one particular game.

160
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,230
To quit all we need to do is alter for with the window highlighted and that's command.

161
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,670
Q On the Mac.

162
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,830
Very useful.

163
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,490
You can also get more information out of your game by putting the dash log.

164
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,360
At the end again space dash look like so and that will give you more information.

165
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,380
They go giving you the whole log of what you would expect from the log for bozoum Log warn that you

166
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,050
using inside C++ etc..

167
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,360
So I'm going to close this down because we don't need it.

168
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,590
They can see all of the verbose logging going on in the game.

169
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,070
One more thing to note is that you can see in a particular map if your project has multiple maps.

170
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,860
You can tell it which one you would like to load in the game.

171
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,720
Now the way you do this is using a particular type of you are real.

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:13,100
It always starts with Slash capital G game like so slash and then it is the path from your content directory

173
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,120
down.

174
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,890
So if I'm wanting to look at my third person map I know it's under Content.

175
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,630
Third Person C P P maps.

176
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,540
Third Person example map.

177
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,120
So how does that translate.

178
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,570
We've got game.

179
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,320
Now then it would be third.

180
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,480
Person.

181
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,150
C. P. P. Because that's what comes after content we don't include content.

182
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,640
And you got maps then you've got a third.

183
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,160
Person example map.

184
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,400
And you don't have to put the dot you map on the end.

185
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,710
It will automatically do that for you.

186
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,580
So it needs to be exactly like this.

187
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,650
You hit enter.

188
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,980
It's obviously going to do the same thing because it was also an example map but you've got the option

189
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,130
of putting in there an IP address instead of the map.

190
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
Can we close this down.

191
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,190
So you can put an IP address instead of the map and that's going to connect you to a server.

192
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,770
So I'm going to challenge you now to give something a go.

193
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:24,760
And that is to launch a dedicated server so to create your own mini network.

194
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,220
The first thing you need to do is find your IP address.

195
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,720
Now there's lots of instructions on the web for how you can find your local IP address.

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,700
I should stress if you're struggling with that at all then take a look at the resources for this lecture

197
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,850
where I have instructions for Windows and for Mac.

198
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,640
Then I would like you to launch a server you like hang on Sam I don't know how to launch a server.

199
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,780
Well let me give you a hint.

200
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,920
Try swapping out the dash game for instead dasch a server and see what pans.

201
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,010
Then I'd like you to launch some clients.

202
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,360
Now you say Sam I don't know how to launch some clients.

203
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,850
Well remember I just told you that you can put an IP address instead of a map and that will connect

204
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,430
you to the server running at that IP address.

205
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,660
Give that a shot.

206
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,680
And then I'd like you to ensure that they're all connected by making sure you can play together.

207
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,820
Let's give that a shot now.

208
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,660
Just as a hint for those of you on a Mac especially you may need to open up multiple terminal windows

209
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,030
in order to do this.

210
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,850
Okay welcome back.

211
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,780
So let's give it a go.

212
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,230
I'm going to launch up a server by replacing the dash game with the dash server.

213
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,720
Like so.

214
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,980
And what we should see is that something launches.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,470
But there is no visual element to it.

216
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,950
That's the same as we had on our slides.

217
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,390
There's obsidian box with those screen.

218
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

219
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,770
So that's the server launched and triggered.

220
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,730
Now I'm going to connect a client to do this.

221
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,030
I'm going to instead of my map I'm going to put in an IP address.

222
00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:02,430
Now I know my IP address to be 1 9 2 1 6 8 dot one dot 90 this the local IP address they aren't going

223
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,250
to be able to hack me based on this.

224
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,360
And I need to replace server with Game.

225
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,210
Let's hit enter and see that connect up to the server in fact.

226
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,340
If you are very nerdy in what like reading through logs you can probably find a log in there somewhere

227
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,420
mentioning that it is connecting up to a server.

228
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,420
And.

229
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,740
Oh good joke.

230
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,260
They go.

231
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,750
We've got the server seems to have at the main player even though we don't have a way of controlling

232
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,120
that main player.

233
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,280
But that's okay.

234
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,010
We are running around.

235
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,040
And let me add in a second.

236
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,670
Clients just go over to my command prompt again and just launched that same command a second time.

237
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:49,940
Now when I get up a third instance of my puzzle platforms game and hopefully this will spawn into the

238
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,650
same world with the guy that we were just seeing.

239
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,130
Okay here I am.

240
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,900
And they go there are three people in this world and that one has moved.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,660
So I'm assuming he's the dude and there we go we've got three people from our first players perspective

242
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,670
as well.

243
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,910
So fantastic apart from the fact that we've got this phantom server dude.

244
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,810
Everything else is hunky dory we've connected.

245
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,250
We've spawned a server.

246
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,150
We've connected clients to it.

247
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,020
Congratulations Pat yourselves on the back and let's dive onwards.

248
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,880
Now if you're having trouble connecting and getting black screens or just not ending up in the same

249
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,620
room as the other character then there is a couple of things you might want to try.

250
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,120
First of all if you're on a four point seventeen point two or greater.

251
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,500
Just try adding a question mark.

252
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,000
Listen to the end of the map on your server and that should help you out.

253
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,530
If you're still having problems then the issue might be that the server is listening on a different

254
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,350
port than the one that unreal defaults to.

255
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,340
So let's go ahead and start up a server and I'll show you how you can find out which port.

256
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,170
Unreal is starting on and how you can connect a client specifically to that port.

257
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:11,710
Now just quickly a port is a way of identifying where an application is it can choose to listen on a

258
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:17,890
specific port on one machine that means that you can have more than one application running on a machine

259
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:25,240
and accepting network traffic because the IP address only specifies the application only specifies the

260
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,310
computer and not the application.

261
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,790
So to find the IP address of your server you're going to do a control F or a command F and look for

262
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,840
listening.

263
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,390
And if I spell it correctly.

264
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,370
And listening will bring up a logline here which is saying log game.

265
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,050
NET driver I pinette Drive a blob a block.

266
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,420
The important bit it says listening on port 7 7 7 7.

267
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,790
Now that is the default.

268
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,960
So for me it would automatically connect to that but I want to show you that if you had a different

269
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,200
port number here how you could connect a client up to it.

270
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,660
Now one quick thing to say is that because I've just done a search in here is actually paused the server

271
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,570
to unblock the server.

272
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,590
On Windows at least you have to do a control.

273
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,730
See that one block the server on Mac.

274
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,540
You don't have that issue.

275
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,580
Now we can go ahead and attach a game and the way you attach a deck game is super easy is just the same

276
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,660
as before with the IP address and game but you add to the IP address a colon without a space and the

277
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,090
port number.

278
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:36,210
So in this case 7 7 7 7 and that will go ahead and make sure that the client is going to speak to the

279
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,190
server at the correct port.

280
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:44,130
So if you go ahead and launch up a game like that we should be fine and should be able to connect in

281
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,010
with the server.

282
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,040
Let's see if it will do that though go load loaded in.

283
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,430
And I have loaded in along with the server.

284
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,590
So that's a quick little fix.

285
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,880
If you're having issues connecting just make sure that you can find the IP address in the server.

286
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,680
Make sure you unblock the server and then just add the IP address to the.

287
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,760
Add the port to the IP address and I will see in the next lecture.
