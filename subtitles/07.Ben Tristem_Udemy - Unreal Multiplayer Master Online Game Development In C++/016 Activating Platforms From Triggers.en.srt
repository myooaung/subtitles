00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,090
Welcome.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,460
What's this lecture all about.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,250
I hear you ask.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:15,200
Well it's about implementing the core of my project my puzzle logic which is this trigger the trigger

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,390
that when you step on it will activate.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,550
So let me show you the idea here is that I go and step on the platform and it moved.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,820
But as soon as I get on the platform off the pressure pad so I can't activate any more.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:34,610
However if I go over to my second player he can step on the pressure pad for me and watch me go across

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,340
to the new destination and then when I arrive over at the new destination.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,180
I'm going to step on that pressure pad like so.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,180
So that it can carry on being active for player number two player number two will be able to step on

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,010
it and go across as well.

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:00,070
So a collaborative puzzle solving element with our pressure pads they go I'm on the platform and I'm

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,150
going over to location number two.

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,730
Got to find these locations.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,460
A better name don't we.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:06,990
Okay.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,030
Let's dive in and see how we can implement the activation and deactivation of these trigger pads.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,420
So we've had little mention of what the desired behaviour for these triggers already is.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,810
But let me just recap.

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:28,060
The idea is if I go and swarm myself near the first trigger and I go and step on that trigger what I'm

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,920
expecting is that the platform starts to move.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,870
Now obviously the platform is moving in the first place so we need to have a way to make sure that platform

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,120
is disabled from moving until someone is standing on one or more of the triggers.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,150
That's the idea that standing on a trigger will activate the platform coming off the trigger will deactivate

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,130
the platform as long as both of you are off the trigger.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,030
That sounds like a counting set up to me.

28
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,460
Sounds like the platform needs to know how many active triggers there are and when it goes down to zero

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:05,080
it d activates and we can start off with a default of having one active and we can set up a platform

30
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,930
so that it has no active triggers by default so that it doesn't move by default without somebody standing

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,780
on the pressure pad.

32
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,910
That's the outline of the general behaviour that we're looking for.

33
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:23,410
So let's start off by creating an interface to our platform that the trigger can talk to to activate

34
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,420
and deactivate it.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,430
When we stand on it.

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,070
So there's going to be two parts we will need the trigger to point to a platform and we need to have

37
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,420
the platform keep track of how many active triggers it has got.

38
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:44,530
So let's hop on over in two visual studio and start off with just the platform portion of that puzzle.

39
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,410
So I am going into source possible platforms and it's the moving platform the sound is going to look

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,220
at implementing the interface first and I'm going leave the details to you as a challenge.

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:04,280
So first off I'm going to create a private variable that's going to store the activated platform.

42
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,300
This isn't technically part of the interface though of course.

43
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,600
So we are going to make it a new property.

44
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,710
Because I want to be able to change the default in the editor so it's going to have to be at it anywhere.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,320
And then it's going to be an integer because it's going to be a count of how many active platforms there

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,220
are.

47
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,250
And it's going to be active.

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:39,040
Platforms equals one by default which means that basically it is active.

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,390
No this is not active platforms are it's active triggers because we are platform.

50
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,540
So we've got one active triggers that makes sense.

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,360
That's why we are able to move.

52
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:58,030
By default if we set that answer zero then we will not be able to move then let's create a public interface

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,340
to this class.

54
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:07,780
It's going to have an active and active trigger and remove active trigger I think is the sensible thing

55
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,140
to do.

56
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,970
So let's do a void.

57
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,560
Add active trigger.

58
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,460
And voids remove active trigger like so.

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,920
And I think that's good enough.

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,120
They're public so we'll be able to call them from the other side of the trigger site.

61
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,590
So let's have a look at the next step.

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:39,030
It's going to be hooking up the platform the platform to the trigger or the trigger point at a platform

63
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,800
to do that.

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,630
We are going to use a T array.

65
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,760
So one the reason I'm using a T array rather than just a pointer to a platform is because I want to

66
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,390
give the game design a leeway to use one trigger to activate more than one platform at the same time.

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,600
So that's fairly straightforward or we've got to go and do is go over to our platell triggered on H

68
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,300
and then create a private variable.

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm going to put it above my on Begin overlaps.

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,150
And it's going to be a property again because we want to edit it and give access to it to add designer

71
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,080
edit anywhere.

72
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,930
Because you want to be able to edit it in a map for example.

73
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:28,120
And then what it's going to be a pointer to a moving platform but particularly is going to be a tier

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,800
race so let's go ahead and look for documentation on this.

75
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,720
Handly I have the window open in the background here.

76
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,920
Let's go ahead to the first one that TI array documentation.

77
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,930
And let's see let's have a look at how we are going to construct a T array.

78
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:57,820
So I seem to recall that arrays have their element types as part of the generics in the in the angle

79
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,560
brackets and then we've got lots of adding inserting and stuff which is going to be useful.

80
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,980
And the question is whether we're going to have to include anything in order to use a-t array.

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,560
I don't think so.

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,470
I think it's kind of included by default by some of the other headers so we can go ahead and try and

83
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,920
see where that auto completes is often a good way.

84
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,660
If you don't have auto complete such as on X code then you can go ahead and try it and then see if you

85
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,400
get a compile error instead.

86
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,620
But if we do get it a compile error then we just need this containers arraycom h included.

87
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,320
So it's going to be a t array and it's going to be a t array of type here.

88
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:47,390
The in element type and you can see that construct on the documentation page near the top.

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:54,320
There's quite a few constructors so I understand you might be a little bit confused but it's not actually

90
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,590
a constructor at all because here we're just defining a type using t array.

91
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,720
So if we go to the top of our page we can see that the type declaration here has a template so to read

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,380
this you say well basically it's looking for a type in first and the second argument you can often ignore

93
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:19,910
if it's something like an allocator you can often not pass that in and it will automatically be defined.

94
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,430
So it's going to be a t array and then the in element type.

95
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,280
So let me just show you.

96
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,300
This is revision obviously you've used ti arrays before.

97
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,930
Now we want it to be a class.

98
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,670
Moving a moving platform.

99
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,490
Now in actual fact I have mis typed here but that will be fixed later on in the video.

100
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,880
It does need to be a pointer not just a forward declaration of the type.

101
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,530
And then we are going to just call this the platforms to trigger.

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,190
And so on.

103
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,410
That should do it.

104
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:10,520
So we've got gone ahead and created the interface on both sides on the platform trigger and on the moving

105
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,320
platform.

106
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,790
Dot H.

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,900
So it's time to implement the logic and that is going to be your challenge.

108
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,670
So let's have a look at the definition of that challenge.

109
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,220
I'd like you to first off fill out the interface.

110
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,340
That's kind of the whole idea of this whole challenge.

111
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,360
Let's go into more detail activate from the call-backs So that is the call-backs we've already got for

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,090
overlap and end overlap.

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,850
You need to be using those to basically call the activating platforms to make sure that they activate

114
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:48,740
and deactivate conditionally activate the platforms so make it so that they don't move when the number

115
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,130
of activated triggers is not high enough and then go and test that out in the world.

116
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,820
So pause video and have a go at this challenge.

117
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,650
Okay welcome back.

118
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,270
Let's dive in to implementing this.

119
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:11,710
So first things first I'm going to go to my platform triggers dotsie P P in a visual studio that controls.

120
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,050
K. Oh I think moves over to the seapass plus file.

121
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,360
Yep that is right.

122
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,200
And the first thing I want to do is MY on overlap begin.

123
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,110
Instead of calling a log message what I want to do there is do a full loop over that t array.

124
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,560
Now you can have a little search for four loops over teh array.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,870
And see what the syntax looks like as it's often quite easy range based loops I think is what we're

126
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,500
looking for.

127
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:51,140
That's one way of doing it is first and so with an index is quite straightforward and easy but the easier

128
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,470
and nicer syntax is.

129
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:59,900
This one from the second answer which is for a actor star an actor Ray block a block.

130
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,510
So let's go ahead and do that version.

131
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,320
So for and it's a moving platform star.

132
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,230
And I'm just going to call that variable platform.

133
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,980
Because it's one platform of many of the.

134
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,700
And let's go to the head of file to see what I call that variable platforms to trigger.

135
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,490
So and then my curly braces on a new line for the body of the for loop.

136
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,340
Now why is it complaining about platforms to trigger.

137
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,910
Well apparently it's because it can't find a conversion from a moving platform to a moving platform

138
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,070
star.

139
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,520
Okay so it looks like I was wrong in defining my t irena.

140
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,800
Hopefully you found that out in the challenge because we do need to have class a moving platform star

141
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,830
because it is an array of pointers.

142
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,770
And I was wrong.

143
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,840
It doesn't take pointers by default because you could for example have a t array of integers and it

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,070
wouldn't be an array of integer pointers.

145
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,790
So let's go over to the C++ again and now it's not complaining about that a more thank goodness.

146
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,130
So what we can do is platform.

147
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Arrow and knows there's no members of our available reason for that is that I have not included the

148
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,150
head of file I've just done a forward declaration in my dot file.

149
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:27,910
So at the top we are going to go ahead and include that Im going to include local stuff underneath the

150
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,760
global stuff and leave a space between it so that we can clearly see what is being included from the

151
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,630
engine and what is being included from our own project.

152
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:43,760
So its going to be include and then it's just going to be the moving platform.

153
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,860
H.

154
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,340
Now hopefully that should mean that auto completes going to allow me to do the error operator to get

155
00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:02,300
hold of the public methods to add active trigger Perfect's I've added the active trigger on Begin overlap

156
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,500
and I've got to do a very similar thing on end overlap I need to remove the active trigger song and

157
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:16,890
copy and paste the code from bit over overlap begin to overlap end and remove active trigger instead.

158
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,080
Okay.

159
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,330
That's looking hunky dory.

160
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,770
Now let's go and implement over in moving platform to h again.

161
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,950
I'm going to control k o in X code that short cut is a control command.

162
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,280
Up and down I believe.

163
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,570
Tell me whether you have any luck with that.

164
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,150
Okay so the thing we are going to do here is implement what was in the head of files.

165
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm going to have a copy signatures from there.

166
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,690
Let's go ahead and copy both lines and we can do the various manipulations we need to do going to stick

167
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,800
them at the bomb at the file for now and copy the moving platform.

168
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,060
How long calon from take and add it to the beginning of both of these methods.

169
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,820
Remove the semicolon and add curly braces instead.

170
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,690
And that should be enough to convert them in two.

171
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,360
Declarations declarations the word I'm using.

172
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,080
I always get confused between declarations and definitions.

173
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,800
I think in this case we are defining them.

174
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,050
Yes because we.

175
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,490
A declaration is saying that I'm going to make it.

176
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,970
I declare that I will make this thing and a definition is here.

177
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,600
This is how it is made.

178
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,940
So that's how I like to remember the difference between declaration and definition.

179
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,930
In case you were asking you probably weren't asking.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,550
So I'm going to move on now.

181
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,280
We're going to implement the add active trigger so this is basically just going to be incrementing that

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,610
variable that we created in the head of file.

183
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,160
Let me move the moving platform closer to its C++ file in my tab pane.

184
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,920
So we've got active triggers equal to one moment but it might be equal to something else if the designer

185
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,450
decides to change it in the property so we can simply use it's going to be a very easy one to implement

186
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,990
it's to be active triggers plus plus.

187
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,840
Simple.

188
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,860
Now removing active triggers is going to be slightly harder because we don't want to go negative.

189
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,640
In this case so we might say for example if active triggers.

190
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,040
Is Greater Than Zero.

191
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,810
Then will do.

192
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,330
Active triggers minus minus.

193
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,900
So we'll basically never go below zero which makes sense.

194
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,730
We have an absorbing barrier at the bottom is what you might be able to say.

195
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:36,130
If you are like me and like to use silly fancy words to describe things which are very simple like the

196
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,860
fact that it doesn't go below zero.

197
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,440
Okay so next up we have implemented that.

198
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:50,240
The only thing that's missing is making sure that the platform doesn't move when it is below zero.

199
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,940
That's fairly simple because all that logic goes on in tick and basically all of this logic we want

200
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,150
to activate.

201
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:05,520
So all I'm going to do is after we've called super tech I'm going to just deactivate this logic.

202
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,280
I'm just going to return early out of the tech.

203
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,680
So we're going to say if.

204
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,130
Actually.

205
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,400
Um had a second thought because we might add further things into tic and it would be really confusing

206
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,700
if we wanted to only deactivate this part of the logic and not some other part of the logic.

207
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,610
So I'm actually going to embed it all in the if statement so I'm going to say if active triggers is

208
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,810
greater than zero.

209
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,450
That's when we know that it is indeed active.

210
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,540
Then on a new line.

211
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,890
Stick my curly braces and I'm going to move everything including this has authority.

212
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,520
If statement inside that if statement.

213
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,350
So this will mean that only if we have active triggers.

214
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,540
Do we move.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,030
Okay it's the moment of truth.

216
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,090
The final countdown.

217
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,910
Time to build and see whether the behaviour we want is the one that we are getting out in the game world.

218
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,480
And this is the perfect moment to sip your coffee.

219
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm just having a nice aero press espresso that I made myself very velvety smooth.

220
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,060
K time for the moment of truth the build has finished.

221
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,050
Let's go ahead and see whether these platforms are still moving.

222
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,080
They are still moving.

223
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,750
That is at least one good sign.

224
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,260
Let's see if we can go and deactivate a platform by changing its default number of active platforms

225
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,700
of click on one of the platforms.

226
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,800
In fact this last platform that goes between the two high up locations.

227
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,020
That's the one that I don't want to be active by default so I'm going to go to its details pane and

228
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,800
find its active triggers and set its active triggers down to zero.

229
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,830
Now let's go ahead and hit play.

230
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,170
Sure enough that platform is no longer moving.

231
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,720
Which is exactly the behaviour I would expect.

232
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,780
So next up let's hook up the triggers to said platform and see one at a time whether they will make

233
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,000
it move first trigger.

234
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:04,750
Let's go ahead select the nearest one the first one that the characters are going to encounter and go

235
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,560
through his details pane looking for the relevant you property.

236
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,720
Here we go we've got a t array.

237
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:18,730
I can add to my T array and I can use the pick actor from scene button it's the one that looks like

238
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,310
a colour picker if you ever use colour.

239
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:27,340
Picking and editing programs they use this colour picone you can pick the platform from the scene it's

240
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,310
moving platform 6.

241
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,800
That's when it's going to activate.

242
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,320
So it's go ahead and play it from here near to the trigger.

243
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,130
It's not moving.

244
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,220
If I stand on the platform it starts moving.

245
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:44,170
I step off the platform it stops moving on off on off on off.

246
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,430
Now my mother would say I'm going to break that light switch if I keep stepping on and off it so I'm

247
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,370
going to stop.

248
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,840
Okay now let's try out the other trigga.

249
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,320
At present it should not work so I'm going to go and play from here from the other side.

250
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,460
Step on my platform and nothing happens.

251
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,980
Exactly what I would expect.

252
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,100
Let's click on that trigger.

253
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,390
Go to the details.

254
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,040
Pain.

255
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,550
Add a platform to trigger elements.

256
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,350
Select from scene and select that platform.

257
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,900
Go ahead and hit play.

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,180
I actually want to play from near that trigger.

259
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,780
Otherwise I'm gonna have a hard time getting that play from here.

260
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,510
Step on my trigger asar it's working.

261
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,200
It definitely working now.

262
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,770
Okay an on off on off seems to be working too.

263
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,110
Let's just check this.

264
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,940
Two things active.

265
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:42,030
Hypothesis of mine that I wanted to make sure that the trigger could activate multiple things.

266
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,530
Let's go over to the first trigger I set up and add another element.

267
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:59,210
And a pic from the scene and I'm going to pick just the second platform this time move platform 5 for

268
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,580
whatever reason I'm not sure why they're numbered like that.

269
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,290
Then I'm going to play from here.

270
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,070
That's active by default so it's not we're not going to see the results that's click on the platform

271
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:18,980
platform 5 for me and go to its details and try and find the property related to active triggers.

272
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,680
Zero.

273
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,540
Play.

274
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,470
Play from the right place near the trigger.

275
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,500
And neither of them are active.

276
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,830
I step on and they both activate on off on off on off.

277
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,740
Excellent.

278
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,490
So we've got Ad trigger working exactly as we'd like.

279
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,840
I just want to stick a platform fight back because that kind of breaks my puzzle at the moment.

280
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:52,950
So I'm going to go and set his default number of active triggers tell one and go to my trigger my pressure

281
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,010
pad and remove him from the T a race platform five.

282
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:05,100
I can remove the way I can do this is I think it's this dropped down here and it says delete next to

283
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,000
the platform five in the platform platform to trigger a.

284
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,180
Delete.

285
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,170
Let's go ahead and see whether this is actually playable.

286
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,430
Give it a little short.

287
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,350
Playtest and hopefully you've got somebody waiting to play Test with you soon so you can show them your

288
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,940
cool behaving triggers.

289
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,380
And the interesting puzzles that you can do with your triggers.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:34,030
Okay so I'm now my second platform are coming over to the unseen area I hop across.

291
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,030
And I think ah ha I step on my pressure pad is moving.

292
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,710
It's moving on so I get on the block and I can't move anymore which is why you're going to need a second

293
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,870
player to play test this level with to get on with getting to your goal.

294
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,220
That's the whole idea here.

295
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,940
Now obviously I can play test this with increasing the number of players to go ahead and hit play.

296
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,230
Now there's two of us.

297
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:06,660
We can go ahead and get on our moving platforms both get up to that space which is what we try and do

298
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,080
with play a number to go and get on that moving platform again.

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,080
Will there be room for the two of us in a room in this world for the two of us.

300
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,280
K so plan number one it's going to go and try and get on to the second platform now.

301
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,840
Okay.

302
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,250
He's on the second platform making room for player number two who is here and is going to try and hop

303
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,000
onto the second platform and he's made it.

304
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,310
And now he's going to hop on to the other unseen area number one and unseen.

305
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,540
And both of them are now they're fantastic.

306
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,520
Now let's get on that platform gets on the platform.

307
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:53,500
But number two quickly quickly drives the jump and or just fell off.

308
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,970
But you can see how this is going to work.

309
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,220
It's moving player.

310
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,610
No one will get on the platform he's going to get on over to the other side and then get on the trigger.

311
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,580
So player number two can get across as well.

312
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,330
Okay.

313
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,830
That's the gist of the puzzle.

314
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,560
We've implemented the logic to make it happen.

315
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,760
Pat yourselves on the back.

316
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
Really well done.

317
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,390
And it's really time to make sure you have got someone to play test this with.

318
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,410
Go to your post spruce it up a little bit boast about it on discord and say yes I really have got a

319
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,970
cool level now got triggers.

320
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:32,030
You really want to come and play with me and hop on and play with other people get their feedback tweak

321
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,630
the level make it really cool.

322
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,350
That's the whole point of multiplayer.

323
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,430
It's collaborative experience and I'll see you in the next lecture where we're going to be talking about

324
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,270
making this more ready to share with your friends and family.

325
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,330
I will see you there.
