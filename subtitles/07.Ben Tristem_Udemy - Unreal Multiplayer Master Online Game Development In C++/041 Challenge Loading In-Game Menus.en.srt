00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,530
We are going to be creating an in game menu in fact you're going to be creating an engagement.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,800
Let's see what it looks like.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,130
That's what it looks like.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,360
And you are going to be responsible entirely for creating this because you have all the tools you need

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,450
already in your noggin.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,080
So I'm going to be challenging you to do this.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,180
So the whole purpose of this lecture isn't going to focus around our main menu but rather our game and

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,640
we're going to be looking at how we can create a menu in the game itself.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:41,130
Perhaps when we hit the escape key that rather than taking us just out of the game entirely will allow

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,170
us to go back to the main menu for example of running in a standalone game and allow us to quit the

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,570
game rather than having to hit alter for which not one might know about.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,970
So how we're going to do that.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,930
Well actually in this lecture it's going to be all in the form of one massive challenge.

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,850
You're actually entirely capable of achieving this for yourself with all the knowledge from the previous.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,250
17 odd lectures.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,350
So I would like you to go ahead and apply that knowledge and actually see if you can do it.

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,530
So let's see.

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,090
We are going to create an in game menu.

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,110
The components of this to create a separate widget.

21
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,880
So like many widget unthinking create a lay overlay widget that we will be able to put in our world

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,300
and then a C++ parent class because were going to want that we should be doing some actual stuff so

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:39,290
will want to do that in C++ and add some cancell and Main Menu button so cancel to make them and you

24
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,500
go away again.

25
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,360
Main Menu to take you back to the main menu level and leave the current game.

26
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,340
And then I'd like you to load the menu on scaped he pressed in the level not obviously over the top

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,710
of the main menu because that would make absolutely no sense.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,860
Only in the level itself.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,840
Okay so that's a fairly vague challenge I don't want you to do anything with the cancel the main menu

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,870
buttons just yet.

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,430
I would like you just to make them so.

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,170
Pause a video and have a go at putting this menu together from scratch for yourself.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
Okay welcome back.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,460
Now it is my turn to have a go at the big challenge.

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,260
So let's start off by creating a new widget.

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:30,240
So I am going to create a let's see ad new then we're going to look for user interface widget blueprint

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:39,320
and I'm going to quote WB P underscore and then we're going to call it in the game menu.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
Like so.

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,830
And then I can create out straight away a C++ based class.

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,310
But that's I'm going to add new new C++ class and I am not going to find it in here.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,470
So I'm going to go to show all classes.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,260
Look for the user widget.

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,910
Which is he'll go to next.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,720
And then choosing a folder wisely in a you II menu system folder.

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:17,520
We are going to go ahead and create a main menu not a main menu an in-game menu class.

46
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,440
So.

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,210
Go ahead and create that.

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,510
Okay with that finished compiling we can go ahead and use that as a base class for our widget blueprint.

49
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:41,120
So let's go back up to the top level and go down into our menu system open up our widget blueprint in

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,030
game menu then.

51
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,550
From there we're going to go to the graph remember to go to find our class settings and in our class

52
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:57,020
settings that we are going to go to the parent class and change that out for the in game menu as the

53
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,700
parent class.

54
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,390
Okay.

55
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,080
So we can save compile and close that widget back down and had it in need to close it down because the

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,270
next step is to create the layout.

57
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,360
Now I don't want to be creating that whole lay out from scratch again so I'm going to open up my main

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,200
menu widget and hope that we can copy some of it across.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,900
So what I'm hoping to copy across is this whole main menu chunk because I think that our in-game menus

60
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,790
going to look very very similar.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,950
So I'm going to select all that hit copy go into my in-game menu and hit paste in here.

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,870
Sure enough we've got a menu of sorts in here something isn't quite right with it entirely.

63
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,900
I'm sure we'll find out in a second but what I want to do is I notice I've got a Cambers panel in here

64
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,830
so I'm going to right click my Cambers panel and go to replace with and replace with the child so that

65
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,120
we don't have that Cambers panel there any more.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,760
Excellent that's a great start.

67
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Now our main menu is the right size again so it must be something to do with the canvas.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,800
But it is floating up in the top left.

69
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,660
Ah we can fix that quite easily we know how to do this by now.

70
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,580
So we go to our size box.

71
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,850
Now is this store actually in anything so we need to wrap it with something.

72
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,930
I'm going to right click and go and wrap it with a let's see a vertical box perhaps vertical box will

73
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,040
do.

74
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:24,040
And this vertical box we are then going to go onto the main menu and we can.

75
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,330
Horizontally align it to the centre in both dimensions and let's see.

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,460
I want to go to my vertical box and check that its full size which it is.

77
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,230
So how do we make sure that it is in the middle.

78
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,770
Yes we need to hit fill.

79
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:47,290
So now that is floating smack bang in the middle and the only thing is want to change its name from

80
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,040
Main Menu to something a bit more meaningful like in-game menu.

81
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,660
Mike so we can change the text.

82
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,470
To.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,890
Pause menu or something like that.

84
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,750
Or no we're not actually pausing the game when we do this so let's call this something more meaningful

85
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,890
maybe just menu at this stage.

86
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,900
And we want to give the button some good names so House is going to be cancel.

87
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,850
And join is going to be main menu.

88
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,460
Like so now and counting issue with our button.

89
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,900
So let's just call this quit instead.

90
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,950
That makes more sense.

91
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,740
It fits on a button.

92
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,670
Sometimes you have to do that just adapt the text to your images rather than the other way round.

93
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,870
And I'm going to rename our buttons just for clarity to cancel button and quit button on the actual

94
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,550
buttons themselves because we're going to want to hook them up to stuff in a subsequent lecture.

95
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,200
So there we go.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,180
We've got quick but uncancel button.

97
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,810
It's starting to all take shape.

98
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,290
I'm happy with this.

99
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,330
Okay.

100
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,680
So next up we want to actually be able to launch this on the escape key.

101
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:16,560
Now the way that I want to do this is from launch in the game instance but call the game instance from

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,210
the level blueprint so we're doing as little blueprint work as possible how that is possible to call

103
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,110
it from C++.

104
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,670
But I think in this case it's just going to be easier to cheat a little bit in inverted commas and use

105
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,380
and blueprints.

106
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,900
I'm going to go to the game insistency plus plus and we are going to first of all need to get hold of

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,580
our menu class.

108
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,030
So let's go to the game instance.

109
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,210
Dot H.

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,310
And with the game instance dot H I am going to create a T subclass of.

111
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
That's going to be a t suit subclass of use a widget called in-game menu class.

112
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm going to call it.

113
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,000
So and then we are going to see.

114
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:14,690
Go into the constructor for our game instance using our class finder a racer get a copy and paste all

115
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,460
this code.

116
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,100
And use it to help us find the in-game.

117
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,560
Menu BP.

118
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,500
I can just basically copy that in-game portion because that's what we're going to put in front everything

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,460
else.

120
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,690
Which I just done.

121
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,160
And we can change also the WP in game menu.

122
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,530
So we've got that should all hook up.

123
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:53,020
I'll start the compellation process and then what we were going to want to do is we're going to want

124
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,390
to provide a blueprint callable function that can be called from our level.

125
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,200
So let's do that.

126
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,740
Go to the game instance got some blueprint callable load menu in here.

127
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,640
Actually that might be useful.

128
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,460
We could have already got a load menu we're using it in the other blueprints so we can just do something

129
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,720
very similar.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,420
Were going to do just copy and paste that load menu function that's blueprint callable and we're going

131
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,900
to make it in-game.

132
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Load menu.

133
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,060
And it's how this all gets easier as you got more and more code you can basically start to plagiarize

134
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,710
from yourself and start to see patterns and repeat those patterns.

135
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,060
Very very easy.

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,450
OK so we've got a load menu.

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,080
And under the load menu we are going to implement our in-game load menu.

138
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,050
And we're going to add the name space.

139
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,960
And we're basically going to be doing very much the same thing as our load menu.

140
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,350
Except this time the menu is going to be different.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,730
We aren't going to store it in the private variable but rather just in a local variable here called

142
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,630
A You use a widget.

143
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,080
It's going to be of type you use a widget as is the create widget.

144
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,960
It's going to be a type you use a widget.

145
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,890
Like so.

146
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,490
And it's going to be storing into to you.

147
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,300
You use a widget star and the class is going to be an in-game menu class not just the menu class.

148
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,660
And so let's copy and paste that.

149
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,500
Okay.

150
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,070
So just a few things to point out we haven't got a set up here and we don't have a set menu interface

151
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,780
here because the menu that we are using is of type.

152
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,370
You use a widget.

153
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,230
Now I'm beginning to see a bit of a repetitive pattern here.

154
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,790
This set up is needed both for our.

155
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,620
Main Menu and for our you use a widget which is actually a in-game menu.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,890
So the set up is actually going to be identical as it is at the menu interface so maybe we want to be

157
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,720
abstracting this out into a base class and that's what we're going to do next.

158
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,760
We are going to go ahead and create a new menu widget.

159
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,920
Okay so let's go ahead in to the engine.

160
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,280
First of all and create this C++ file that we need.

161
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,820
So add new.

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,390
New C plus plus class showreel classes and search for user widget.

163
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,990
Go to next.

164
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,440
Select the correct folder.

165
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,690
Which will be the menu system and call our menu widget.

166
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,140
Create that class and wait for the compilation to take place.

167
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,020
So I've got a compilation error here.

168
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,920
I'm not too worried about it because I think that it's probably related to some of the in progress stuff

169
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,590
we've got going in Visual Studio.

170
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,380
So what I can do now is instead of including.

171
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,540
Our main menu.

172
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,250
H or as well as including main menu.

173
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,650
H I think we should go ahead and include our menu widget.

174
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,770
H.

175
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,920
Which should allow us to use a new menu widget.

176
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,180
Instead in our in-game menu I'm going to go ahead and do that.

177
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:41,510
And I want to take those functions that were the set up and set menu interface and bring them up to

178
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,550
that new level that we've created.

179
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,580
So let's open up our menu which it does H and also open up our main menu.

180
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,490
H.

181
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,010
Let's see if we can get these side by side Super got enough room for that.

182
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,000
Drag the tab out and try and put it on the right hand side.

183
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,920
See if that's going to work.

184
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,240
Yes I think that I'll just about work just got about enough space.

185
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,000
So what do we want to bring up there I want to set up and tear down.

186
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,320
So that's going to go up to the menu widget.

187
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:26,530
We also want the set menu interface to go up so basically all of that public interface is going up to

188
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,820
the menu widget.

189
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,480
So we can remove the public section entirely from the main menu.

190
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,110
Next up let's scroll down to perhaps have a look.

191
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes we need to have that private variable the menu interface because that implementation of set menu

192
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,210
interface relies on that.

193
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,600
So put that in a private section of the menu widget.

194
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,600
Okay now we've got that interface the interface.

195
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm going to actually include.

196
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,310
I need to include the menu interface in my header.

197
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,840
So let's go ahead and do that.

198
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,950
Above the generated dot H remember.

199
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:21,190
And as I'm doing this remember I am cutting and pasting all of these because I don't want them in my

200
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,260
main menu as well because my main menu is now going to in let's make sure this happens.

201
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:33,220
It's going to inherit not from you use a widget but instead from the menu widget.

202
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,490
So let's go ahead and include that.

203
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,930
So instead of including use a widget I'm going to include a menu widget or h.

204
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,130
And I'm going to inherit from it you menu widget.

205
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,830
And now we can go to the C++ for my main menu.

206
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:05,130
I open that up and put it in the other side of the split as well as the C++ for the.

207
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,580
Menu widget menu widgets dotsie P P I put that on the left hand side of the split.

208
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,340
So obviously looking very empty.

209
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,880
But let's go ahead and take our set up and tear down first of all.

210
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,630
That's what we did.

211
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,900
That's the order we did them in.

212
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,750
Not the order matters particularly.

213
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,790
It's not wanting to scroll.

214
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,580
So I am going to do them one at a time.

215
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,020
Set up first.

216
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,610
Tear Down second.

217
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,370
Then the set menu interface.

218
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,580
And that should be about it because that was everything in our public.

219
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,410
Declaration.

220
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,610
And hopefully that should do the trick.

221
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,390
Let's go ahead and build it and see whether we've got any errors.

222
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,990
Okay so I do have an error.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,100
And the first error I'm noticing is that it's saying you may menu is not a class or namespace in the

224
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,870
menu widget DCP.

225
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:12,320
Sure enough I haven't updated it to use the you menu widget namespace instead of for the new class.

226
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,380
So let's make sure we do that and copy it into set up tear down and set menu interface.

227
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,640
Now let's try building again and see whether it's STILL doesn't work.

228
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,140
Okay we got a little bit further this time but now is saying that we cannot access the private member

229
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,100
of menu interface from our main menu.

230
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,110
That's true because it is private.

231
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,550
If we make it protected however go over to Main Menu and change private protected and then that means

232
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,520
that everything that inherits from the new menu widget has access to it.

233
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,000
So that would be fine.

234
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,690
We don't mind that at inheriting classes have access.

235
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,410
Okay finally build succeeded.

236
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:03,560
Now a few more tweaks that I want to put in place such as the fact that we know our you main menu widget

237
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:09,930
and menu widget is not the parent of our in-game menus.

238
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,980
So in our ingame many do h we want to make sure that we change that over to be the new menu widget and

239
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,920
that we include the menu widget dot age as well.

240
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,710
So that should help immensely with making sure that we are getting the right thing.

241
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,380
It's a damn included menu menu rather than menu widget.

242
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,810
That would help if I included the right thing wouldn't it.

243
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:41,080
So now our in-game menu inherits from the menu widget as well which means that it has a set up and tear

244
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,940
down function which means that in our puzzle platform game instance dot c p p We are now able to with

245
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:56,290
a clear conscience call set up and tear down on this create widget of type you menu widget and we know

246
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,830
that it is indeed of that type because that in-game menu class points to the end game menu which inherits

247
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,000
from our in-game menu.

248
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,880
Are you in game menu which in turn inherits from our you menu which is so so a few steps to get there

249
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,440
but we've removed a little bit of duplication and made things I think a little bit clearer.

250
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,370
Maybe not on first pass but on second path I think it's a bit clearer.

251
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:30,190
So let's head back into unreel with our build succeeded and see if we can now launch our game as we

252
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,230
wanted it to in the first place.

253
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:39,940
So let's go ahead and open up our level which is under I think still the third person cbp Maps and the

254
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,600
third person example map.

255
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,070
And I'm going to go to my blueprints.

256
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,000
And I'm going to go to open level blueprint.

257
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm going to right click in here and we're going to try and create an event around the escape key.

258
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,410
Sure enough there is a keyboard event called Escape this is very easy from this node we can drag the

259
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,110
pressed key and we're going to look for the game instance.

260
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:22,270
We can cast to game instance a puzzle platform go instance and casting from the puzzle platform game

261
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,680
instance we can use that game instance object that was cast to call.

262
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,670
What do I call we want to call load.

263
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,010
In Game load menu.

264
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,730
Okay.

265
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,980
That's what we do.

266
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,400
And I forgot that we need to pass an object into this cast obviously which is just going to be the game

267
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,140
instance.

268
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,430
Get game instance very simple Kate so that's fairly straightforward thing to be doing there in the level

269
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,430
blueprint.

270
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,060
Let's go ahead and play that and see if a scape now does what we intend.

271
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,530
No.

272
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:04,900
Now the reason for that is probably because the escape has a double meaning when you do escape inside

273
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,770
the editor it quits your game.

274
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,690
So let's just go ahead and add another key there as well.

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:18,880
And I want to go for the keyboard M for menu just say it's got a mnemonic that I can easily remember

276
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,050
to skip through a few things that get keyboard.

277
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:34,210
Em searching for that will also if I bring this Prest key to also go in to cast then what we've got

278
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,500
is that either escape or M will trigger an in game menu to load.

279
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,150
So let's go ahead and hit play.

280
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,610
And see whether we can use the key to load a menu.

281
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes we can has it doesn't do anything but we successfully loaded it.

282
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,570
So we're going to figure out how to cancel it and quit it in the next lecture.

283
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,140
Congratulations if you manage to get all the way through that challenge on your own.

284
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,030
Now obviously I wasn't expecting you to do the last bit that little refractor into the menu widget but

285
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,670
hopefully even if you had to duplicate code you managed to get to the end of the challenge so pat yourself

286
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,350
on the back for having gone through such a big challenge even if you didn't get to the end of it for

287
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,520
having attempted it.

288
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,300
And if you didn't attempt it then shame on you you should be attempting more challenges.

289
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,820
It's the only way to learn.

290
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,070
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
