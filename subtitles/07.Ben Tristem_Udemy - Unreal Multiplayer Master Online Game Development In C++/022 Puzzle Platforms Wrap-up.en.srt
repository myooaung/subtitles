Hey guys congratulations on getting to the end of the first section.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,160
Great momentum and we hope you keep it up.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,620
So what can they do with this first section now.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,750
They've completed it.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,240
Well one thing you need to bear in mind is that you've been using the unreal third person character

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,540
and that's got a whole load of magic in there that's doing things that you're going to learn about in

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,290
section 4 and beyond for you.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,100
But what you could do in the bigger picture if you want a real revision of this game you have this material

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,470
other you create a whole new game.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,920
I'd suggest using the third person and controller but you gain from scratch.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,410
That's one possibility and go in show off to the community.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,440
If you're going to make a game from scratch and you want to do a little bit of extra work well what

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,980
could they do.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,660
Yeah a great way to just cement all this knowledge is to create some extensions to the game and we've

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,470
got students who are already doing that.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,670
You can find the link in the resources to the student showcase over on the forum.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,100
Go and have a look at that and see what other students are doing see if that inspires you to do something

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,300
new or to copy anything that they're doing.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,650
It's no shame in copying.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,240
Absolutely.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,670
So basically it's up to you if you feel really comfortable with what you've learned.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,840
Crack on to the next section if you want some revision you've got a couple of options modify the existing

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,900
game and make a whole new game but probably stick with the third person characters.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,090
Otherwise you might come unstuck.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,770
Exactly.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,420
So great work well done for getting this far.

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,340
And I look forward to seeing you in the next section.
