00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,220
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,500
We are going to be learning how to reliably quit our games from right within our game.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,090
So we're going to able to do this both in standalone games and in the ED without crashing the editor.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,650
So you can see here I've got a new button and my top right.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,400
You see I've even added a little tooltip to it and it's a nice little icon denotes exit.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,210
So if I go and click that exit button boom the game's gone.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,620
So that allows us to complete that cycle of being able to get all the way from within the game back

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,770
out of the main menu and back exiting out of the game entirely.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,260
So let's dive in and see how that's accomplished.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:47,440
So with the game as it currently stands we can go into our main menu we can host the game we can go

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,850
to our in-game menu and cancel it.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,660
We can go into our in game menu again and quit back to the main menu but what we can't do is exit the

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:55,980
game.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,370
Any of these points.

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,310
Now what I want to show you is that actually it's really easy to exit the game from any of these points.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,590
But we have to do it using a console command and that's very very straightforward.

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,900
You just go ahead and hit your console key which the one under escape in case you've forgotten.

18
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,360
And then you just quit.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,400
And that's it.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,990
That will both quit in the editor and do it in a sensible way.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,500
There are some commands in C++ that do in a very non sensible way that actually bring the whole editor

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,890
crashing while not crashing but stops the whole editor or you can do it using this quick man which just

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,580
exists.

24
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:37,150
The play in Ed set up if you do it in a standalone game like fact let's go ahead and do it in a standalone

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,370
game.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,690
It's not just talk about it get a launch up a standalone game and doing it in the console here in the

27
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,140
standalone game will also work just as well.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,050
So let's try it out.

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,180
Here's the game loading up.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,260
And here we are at the main menu.

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,980
And if I open up my console and type in wit.

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,320
Then close by request it's done it's gone ahead and closed it down so that's what we want to be able

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,040
to achieve.

34
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,020
But from our C++ so that we can do it on and pressing a button in the main menu we don't want to have

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,980
our users have to open up a console just in order to quit the game.

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,390
That's a little bit too much maybe a little bit too aggressive with your game saying that you will not

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,640
leave this game until you've learned how to use the console is not in the best way to treat your users.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,210
At least I don't think so.

39
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:28,450
So let's figure out how we can run this from C++ console commitments or how can we run console commands

40
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,610
from within C++.

41
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,340
Now that might sound like a bit of a hack to you might be thinking Well can't we do this through a actual

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,680
C++ method.

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,640
Well yes you can but sometimes it's actually easier to do it this way.

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,010
And the console command is one example where it's easier to run the console command from within C++.

45
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,860
That's why it's just probably legacy.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,340
Obviously you can ask why.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm just saying that you might not find a very satisfactory answer.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,970
So here we have the documentation for the player controller.

49
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,730
And I want to show you that the player controller has a command for or hell's a function for running

50
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,600
commands.

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,680
So he was going to search for Command.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,470
And sure enough they find it.

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,560
We've got console command as one such example.

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,300
So I'm going to leave the rest to you basically in trying to create that quick button.

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,250
So the instructions are fairly straightforward to quit the game you need to add a menu button to the

56
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,880
main menu bind that button and somehow implement quits.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,200
Now you get to choose whether you want to do then the main menu you want to do it in the game instance

58
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,640
tiley up to you where that happens.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
But the main thing is to quit.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,170
So pause a video and have a go.

61
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,120
Okay.

62
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,550
Let's dive right into this so I am going to go ahead and open up the blueprint first of all so the WP

63
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,700
main menu blueprint and we are going to be adding in a new button now because our menu looks quite nice

64
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,420
as it is.

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't want to go sticking another button at the same level as host unjoin I'd like to take it off

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,110
somewhere to the side I'm going to stick it down here in the bottom right corner for me now the way

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,030
that fat may be at the top right corner is where exits usually go.

68
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and in a menu switch we've got our main menu and under

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,820
the main menu we've got an overlay.

70
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,460
And if I want something to be here on the main menu to be here I am going to have to do this with a

71
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,150
canvas.

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,570
So I'm going to right click my overlay and I'm going to go to wrap with canvas where the canvas panel.

73
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,920
There we go.

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,980
Now obviously it's messed up a few things so let's go to our overlay first and foremost and use size

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,700
to content on there so that we are not squishing down our size based on the canvas.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,770
Next up I want my alignment to be point five and point five.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,200
And I want my anchors to be at the Centre for the menu and reset the X and the y position so that it's

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,610
basically back where it was.

79
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:12,300
But now we can get a button from our palette and stick it under that canvas panel and hopefully that

80
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,680
button should now be positionable to wherever we want it.

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,540
Except we've got a slight issue here.

82
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,890
Let's have a look at our canvas panel.

83
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes sure enough our canvas panel is a bit small.

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,270
Now why is it a bit small.

85
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,460
Let's get up and have a look at our main menu.

86
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,580
Our main menu seemed okay a menu switcher seems okay so why is our main menu acting all small.

87
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,550
Maybe we need to stretch it to fill horizontally and vertically.

88
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,990
Okay so that's helped them a canvas takes up the whole space and now button can be positioned.

89
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,740
I'm going to select the anchor to be the top right corner and I'm going to move my button somewhere

90
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,390
somewhat over in that direction and resize a little bit and it's looking a bit ugly.

91
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,480
So we're going to need some images so I'm going to do a google image search for eggs it icon.

92
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,350
And we're going to do a tools and usage rights and label for reuse.

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,650
Now is a nice one to hear from pics obey my second icon I think I'll be using that one has an exit hi

94
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,320
can and let's save that and say image.

95
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,280
Save it in there.

96
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,290
And then this icon I can go ahead and bring into my content browser.

97
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,210
Let's bring up the content browser.

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:40,320
Navigate to our images folder and then I can go ahead and drag my image in to.

99
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,170
Content browser.

100
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,460
Least I should be able to.

101
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,620
There we go.

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,620
Let's rename it to something sensible like exact icon and squat icon.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,370
And let's open it up because it's black on a black background that's not going to be very helpful.

104
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,850
I just want to show you a quick little trick that you can do with these images.

105
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,700
Obviously not something that's necessarily I expected to do by yourself but if you go to the adjustments

106
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,800
in the details pane once you've got the image open you can go to the curve and brightness and set the

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:19,060
curve brightness to minus 1 and you'll see that what that does is it makes it white on basically a transparent

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,260
background and that means that now with my button I can go in two or back in the main menu and select

109
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,220
a button again and we go to a parents open up style.

110
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,520
Go to normal open up normal.

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
Change the image to be the exact icon and looks a bit weird.

112
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,090
The reason it looks weird is because we're drawing as a box by draw it as an image instead and rescale

113
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,530
it to the right sort of scale for that images ratio.

114
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,830
Then there we go.

115
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,170
We've got ourselves a nice tool or exit icon that can position it to look just right relative to that

116
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,120
corner.

117
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,180
Let's go ahead and play and see how it looks.

118
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,820
Looks good.

119
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,480
Obviously when a hover over it something goes wrong because it's using a different button for the background

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,840
but it looks like an exit button I'm happy with that.

121
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:12,970
Now one trick we can use is when that button selected I can copy right click on normal and copy and

122
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,390
right click on hovered and paste right click on Prest and paste.

123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,900
And that means that now when I hover over it it's still the exact icon.

124
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,070
I do want to have a hover effect on going click on the hover effect and the effect I'm going to go for

125
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,310
is changing the tint to red just a kind of warning sign that if you click this you are exiting.

126
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,950
So if I now play and hover over it you can see its wishes to read.

127
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,040
I click it it goes white and finally I just want to make it absolutely crystal clear what's going to

128
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,080
happen if you click that button and for that I'm going to add in a tooltip so you can go down to behaviour.

129
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,610
There's a tooltip text and I'm going to put in quits the game.

130
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,470
As my tooltip doesn't need capitalization.

131
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,360
And let's go ahead and play that.

132
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,130
So if I hover over it says quit the game so if I am in any doubt what that bunn's supposed to do.

133
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
The tooltip isn't going to tell me.

134
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,750
OK so I'm happy with that.

135
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,230
Let's go ahead and make sure that's bound.

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,100
So first things first I'm going to rename the button to quit button.

137
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,310
Like.

138
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,820
Oh.

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,990
I didn't read it properly.

140
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,330
Select the button again and rename and we'll go and call it quit button.

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,250
Okay quit but button it is.

142
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,390
Let's go over into visual studio.

143
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,540
Here it is.

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:45,120
And in visual studio we're going to go to our main menu dot H and create a new button binding.

145
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,250
It's going to be near the host button and join button.

146
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,550
I'm going to put one underneath that called Quick button.

147
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,070
And we're going to have to have a quote function.

148
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,040
As well.

149
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,480
So how do you function.

150
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,700
Void.

151
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,300
Pressed.

152
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,100
And we are going to implement that over in the C plus plus.

153
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:24,750
Go to our C plus plus create our quit quick press function had the namespace and the body.

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,510
And let's bind it so it will go and copy the join button binding code in it and we will rename that

155
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,730
to join to quit.

156
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:45,310
So it's quick button and quick button and we're going to bind to our quick pressed function instead

157
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,550
of join open join menu.

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,250
Great.

159
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,150
So that is going to more or less work.

160
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,730
The only thing we need to do now is actually go ahead and quit.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,060
So the thing to do here is to get hold of our player controller in order to quit.

162
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,100
Now we've done this before from within a menu we've done this in now our parent class which is the menu

163
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,380
interface DCP.

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,530
So it's open.

165
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,450
No not the menu interface cbp the menu widget cbp That's what I meant.

166
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,820
We have got the tear down which gets a hold of our player controller from the world so let's get that

167
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:29,270
whole world ensure player and sure player control the Ensure and bring that in to our main menu key.

168
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,100
Now the reason I'm doing it here rather than setting up an interface is because the way that you quit

169
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,470
is not going to change very much depending on the game.

170
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,900
Obviously if we want to do that later on and has some weird quitting behaviour that is game specific

171
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,730
then you might want to put it through an interface but I don't predict that being a problem.

172
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,140
So I'm going to be doing it right here in the main menu key.

173
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,780
So let's get hold of our player controller which we've got here or copy that and with the player controller

174
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,330
we are going to arrow to that console.

175
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,070
Command.

176
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,980
Which is what we want to run.

177
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,540
And we can give it a string which we know is going to be quit.

178
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,530
And then that should pretty much do the trick.

179
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,480
We've got a play controller we have executed the console command.

180
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,480
We've done that from button which we have found.

181
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,950
Let's go ahead and build this and see if it works.

182
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,630
Okay that build successfully completed Let's go back in to visual studio visual studio.

183
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,950
I mean unreal.

184
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,000
And let's go on and hit play and see we've got our exit menu exit button if I hit that.

185
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,290
Sure enough it exists.

186
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,090
That's fantastic.

187
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,430
Let's go over in to our file system and try it in the standalone game.

188
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,960
So right click on the project launch game and let's see when that loads up what happens.

189
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,420
Okay the game has launched up if I hit my quick button.

190
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,530
It closes down of perfect that's working exactly as we want it to.

191
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,920
So pat yourselves on the back for pretty much implementing that yourselves.

192
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,810
All you needed to know was that the console quit command worked and how to call it so excellent work

193
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,020
and I will see you in the next lecture.
