00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.600
We are going to be focussing on this getting the steam works example project up and running so this

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.580
is the steelworks example project as you can see in a little space ship I can shoot and I don't want

4
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.270
to get sucked in to this planet or I get destroyed are straightforward.

5
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.040
And this is actually a multiplayer game will be seen that in future elections.

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.880
But for now we're going to be concentrating on getting it built in Visual Studio.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.760
So let's dive in and find out.

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.360
So before we begin I'd better make it clear that this is about Visual Studio.

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.860
So anybody on Mac will want to look at the next lecture.

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.070
We'll be showing you how to build the space war example project in X code instead.

11
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.170
So bye bye.

12
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.220
If you're on a Mac and I'll see you in the next lecture.

13
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.540
If you're on Windows then I'm looking forward to showing you how this is done.

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.180
Okay.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.950
So introducing these steam works example is going to be the first thing we do.

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.730
It's called Spacewar And that's what we're going to be building.

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.300
Next up we're going to be updating the projected vision studio 2017 then downloading the direct extra

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.270
direct x stk which is a requirement for space war project and we are going to fix any build errors that

19
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.790
occur in Visual Studio.

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.680
So let's go right into the steam works example project.

21
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.430
Firstly let's go and have a look.

22
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.320
It's in my hand in my repo and I've got the stk here and in the stk we can see there is a folder called

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.770
steam works example.

24
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.990
You open that up then you will see lots of files in here one of which is called steam work eggs steam

25
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630
works example.

26
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.030
S d s l n.

27
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
The solution project for Visual Studio.

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.720
Let's go ahead and fire that one up.

29
00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.190
I will launch this visual studio project and what we should see is a request to upgrade the project.

30
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.480
That's what we're going to do update the project first and foremost actually be fine I've got it under

31
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.120
version control so I can always roll back and we haven't changed anything from the zip that we downloaded

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.360
so we can always unzip it again if anything goes wrong.

33
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.740
Now next up you'll see a security warning.

34
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.950
This is just saying you've got this from a third party.

35
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.570
Are you sure you want to be running third party code.

36
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.940
Because obviously it could be a virus.

37
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.520
Well it's not.

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.590
That's from Steve.

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.550
We download from Steve.

40
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.840
I'm fairly sure that it's not a virus.

41
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.580
Okay.

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.000
So we have now got ourselves a visual studio project that say an X code project there.

43
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.240
And in a tab that's opened up on the other screen we have got this migration report which is just telling

44
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.760
us some warnings that happened during the migration.

45
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.420
Nothing serious.

46
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.060
No errors.

47
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.300
We can happily ignore that.

48
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.600
So let's go ahead and see whether it builds let's go into bruel studio and really get the build menu

49
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.750
and build solution and see what happens.

50
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.980
So I'm building a solution.

51
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.220
I can already see that isn't going to work.

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.580
We've got some fatal errors here saying that it cannot open the include file D3 d x 9 dot H.

53
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.060
Okay so it can't find that for some reason or other.

54
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.860
Now what we're going to have to do is look at the instructions given to him with the stk in the documentation.

55
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600
So that will be on your portal you've got a link for that in the resources.

56
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.470
And I'm just opening that link now and this is what it looks like it's the erstein works API example

57
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.620
application you can get there by going to the documentation and going under the steam works stk section

58
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.770
seemed works A.

59
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.300
And then from the steelworks stk section you can see that there is the link in the main section.

60
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.040
So the steam works API example application space where you click that that gets you through exactly

61
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560
the same place as well.

62
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.660
Okay so it tells you all about Spacewar is what the features it's using are.

63
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.260
And these are all features that you could use in your own application using steam work.

64
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.150
And then we've got the important bit which is some common build abra's now you can see that one of the

65
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.620
common build areas is the one we are getting.

66
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.850
You cannot open the include file D3 D 9.

67
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.660
It's a little bit different because different versions but it is pretty much the same thing.

68
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.250
Now what it's saying is that this is a problem with that include path.

69
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.200
It's saying that you haven't got direct x or you haven't told direct x where it should look for these

70
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.930
includes.

71
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.540
Sorry you haven't told visual studio where it look should look for the direct x includes.

72
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.500
And similarly the second error is saying a similar thing about linking which is when you take be compiled

73
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.360
binary of your project and smoosh it together with the compiled binary of direct x and basically make

74
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.240
it so that your code can call in to that compiled binary.

75
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.880
And so there are two parts that we're interested in the path to the direct x include files and their

76
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.300
power to the different hex library files.

77
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.230
And both of those Visual Studio needs to know about.

78
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.050
But before we dig any deeper into that you are going to need to make sure you've got yourself a copy

79
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.520
of direct X. Now you can follow the link here and the documentation to the Microsoft download centre

80
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.550
or the one that is in your resources.

81
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.830
Either one will do.

82
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.680
Here you can go ahead and download and start the install process.

83
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.580
I'm not going to be doing that.

84
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.240
I've already got it installed and you should be able to figure it out just go through the options and

85
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.460
accept the defaults.

86
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.460
So these include parts there are funny old business.

87
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.840
Let's try and figure out what they are.

88
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.860
By looking at the example of them over in a visual studio.

89
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.800
So here we are at this visual studio now to set up include path's in Visual Studio C++ project.

90
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.960
You need to go to the project menu and go down to the bottom where it says properties and in the properties

91
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.140
menu it may also say steamboat's example properties by the way in the properties menu we have got a

92
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.340
configurations.

93
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.130
Properties in that left panel and under there you've got a v c plus plus directories.

94
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.190
If you go and click on that then in the middle pane you've got a bunch of options that we can change

95
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.650
that are the properties of this project.

96
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.080
Now the ones that we are interested in are the include directories and the library directories.

97
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.090
Now let me just explain this a little bit.

98
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.110
So here we've got some really strange syntax but we are going to break it down for you if you've never

99
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.470
seen one.

100
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:37.120
These include pack type things before now the semicolon here is the list separator So really this is

101
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.010
a list of directories that we are the visual studio is going to search through to find the dot files

102
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.050
that you're including.

103
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.090
So if you have a dot h file then it will look for that dot h file in each of these directories and it

104
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.100
will only return error when it hasn't found it in any of them.

105
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.150
Okay and now what are these directories.

106
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.910
They're pretty weird they've got this dollar sign in front of them they're in brackets.

107
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.890
Well these are simply called variables.

108
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:13.030
They are system variables and they basically or environment variables actually I should say and they

109
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.430
are defined somewhere.

110
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.070
Don't have to worry about it on Windows.

111
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.250
Actually if you look for.

112
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.640
Environment.

113
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.850
Then you.

114
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.860
In your windows menu then you can go to edit the system environment variables and you can see here we've

115
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:34.010
got environment variables button at the bottom right of this system properties panel and then here you've

116
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:40.280
got a big long list of your user environment variables as well as your system environment variables

117
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.630
and presumably there are some environment variables in visual studio as well.

118
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.710
So we don't have to worry about that too much.

119
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:55.160
Basically these are default parts and we don't want to go messing with those because they are what Steam

120
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.390
works decided was okays and what visual studio decide was okay so we don't want to change those.

121
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.760
We only want to add to that list.

122
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.940
We want to add another place for it to look so you could do that at the beginning or you could do that

123
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.960
at the end.

124
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.910
It just depends on the order it is going to go searching through them and you can basically just add

125
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.870
something like I know put a user Sam.

126
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.220
Includes if I had some include in that folder like so and I would finish it off.

127
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.810
No actually I don't need to finish off with a semicolon unlike its not lines of a C++ file this is just

128
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.920
a comma essentially to separate this list so that would mean that first it would look in the folder

129
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.020
pointed to by v.c. Include path then it would look at the windows stk Include path and then it would

130
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.230
look at use the Sam includes.

131
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.020
Okay.

132
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.700
That's basically how we want to edit this to add something on the end.

133
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.430
Now it's going to be your task to figure out what we add on the end.

134
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.140
However.

135
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.000
To fix those build errors.

136
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.910
So let's have the challenge definition to get it running.

137
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.180
Now you're going to get it running by making sure you got the direct x stk installed.

138
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.510
You're going to find the Include and library path's.

139
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:19.890
Now you've got a link in your resources to the documentation about where to find the stk PAP's in on

140
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.340
Windows.

141
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.040
So go ahead and scour that documentation see if you can find it include and library parts and then add

142
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.670
them to visual studio and build and run.

143
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:35.730
If you find that after you've fixed the first set of errors a new set of errors comes up don't be disheartened.

144
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.280
That's okay have a go at fixing them.

145
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.410
If you can't fix an then just watch the solution where I will show you how they are fixed and if you

146
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:50.970
are getting any build errors to do with not being able to find the right version of direct x check out

147
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:57.660
the resources where we have a link about the Q and A question by Mark who has gone through the pain

148
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.520
for you and you can use his instructions to help you out.

149
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.720
So pause a video and have a go at this.

150
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.160
Okay welcome back.

151
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.520
So let's go scouring for those stk patterns.

152
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.140
I'm going to go and open up the documentation.

153
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.230
It's called Where is the direct x stk in your resources.

154
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.060
And this is the page you'll end up on.

155
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.770
So I'm going to go ahead and look for include.

156
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.800
In here there's a few places that it is.

157
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:32.530
But this is the one I'm looking for where it says modify the V C plus plus directories.

158
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.640
That's what we have just been doing.

159
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.690
Now I want to show you that there are two directories here that were interested in the include one and

160
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.690
the library one.

161
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:49.120
And it looks a bit interesting here you've got this include path and library path and then you've got

162
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.230
so it's two elements in this list that include path.

163
00:10:51.250 --> 00:11:02.590
And then the d x stk variable followed by Include and the d x stk variable followed by lib X 86 so we

164
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:03.210
can do that.

165
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:12.310
And obviously if we are on an x 86 platform we want to do the x 86 the 64 bit version which is down

166
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.090
here.

167
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:21.130
In fact it says we need to do apply and choose the 64 bit platform so let's go over to visual studio

168
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.890
and see what that can mean.

169
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.810
I see what it meant about the platform.

170
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.330
So we've got the platform here in the dropdown at the top the active platform is win 32.

171
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.720
But if we were compiling thought 64 bit then we could use that one as well.

172
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.340
I'm going to stick with Win32 and not bother with the instructions for 64 bit.

173
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.940
You can choose to try this 64 bit instructions as well if you like.

174
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:51.390
Now I'm just going to actually include the second part of this list although I can try including both

175
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.220
and remove the second part.

176
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.090
The first part.

177
00:11:54.090 --> 00:12:00.720
If it's not needed so let's go over to Visual Studio and in and include at the end.

178
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.430
We're going to add the semicolon because we're adding some new items to the list and then paste in those

179
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.080
new items which are they include path and the Direct X SD kadeer Include.

180
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:16.040
Now next up we're going to the library directory so will copy the library directory.

181
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:24.390
Go over to the include directories link them library directory variable and at the end we're going to

182
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:30.930
add a semicolon and paste that in and we're going to go ahead and apply and hit okay and have a go.

183
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.770
A building now with those directories that we have got.

184
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:44.260
Okay so we are getting some errors about the version of X audio to not being available or being available

185
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.140
only on Windows 8 or later.

186
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.780
So that's a little bit strange.

187
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.000
So if you got this far but couldn't solve this error Don't worry it's actually quite a complicated little

188
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.600
reason.

189
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.490
So let's go ahead.

190
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.560
It's complicated to find but once you found it it can seem quite obvious.

191
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:08.340
So let's open up the properties again and have a look at our include directories and our library directories.

192
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:16.540
So the thing that we've got here we could try removing our include path bit which I'm going to do but

193
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.850
that wouldn't alone be enough.

194
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:25.990
The reason for this is that this header that it's complaining about the X audio to header is actually

195
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:33.940
already in some of these header include pads it at the beginning of the list so it finds that header

196
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.310
and then it gives up.

197
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:42.490
But the thing is the X audio that we're looking for is actually in the direct x stk that's the one we

198
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.470
want to go for.

199
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.370
So the problem is when we include direct x lastic picks up the wrong one.

200
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:55.990
So we actually to include it first so I'm going to take just this bit the variable Plus the Include

201
00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.580
and stick it at the beginning of the list in remembering to put the semicolon to separate and removing

202
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.730
the one at the end.

203
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.110
And I'm going to do the same thing with the library rectory because we dont want it to go and pick up

204
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.470
the right head a file then get the wrong library.

205
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.070
That would just be silly.

206
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.360
So we're going to go ahead and stick the library bit at the beginning as well.

207
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:21.910
And as I guessed we'd actually dont need the first bit of this these two bits in the include directory

208
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.030
we dont need the include path that is just superfluous to requirements.

209
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:33.160
So if we go back to visual studio we're going to apply those changes and hit okay and try building now.

210
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.270
Okay.

211
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.560
Ah good good stuff.

212
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.610
We've not got any warnings.

213
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.920
It's compiling the plus plus which means it's got past checking all the head of files which I'm very

214
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.810
happy about.

215
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.400
There we go a compiled successfully.

216
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:52.700
And that means we can go ahead and run it so I'm going to go to the debug menu and start without debugging

217
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.310
and it's going to pop up here.

218
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.010
Now you going to need to have steam running and steam logged in otherwise you'll get some specific errors

219
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.230
about steam in there and we can see that it's attach the seams.

220
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.740
The full steam overlay and we have a game.

221
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.300
So I'm going to go ahead and just start a new server to show you what the game actually is it's going

222
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.960
to ask me for network access which I'm going to allow.

223
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.880
And it is going to create me a server and here you go.

224
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.610
It's a very retro little shooter game little spaceship shooter game and it's actually multi player.

225
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:33.870
So if you create a lobby then which is what we're going to be doing in the next lecture or at least

226
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.520
the next lecture for you the one after the X code lecture.

227
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.800
It will allow you to join in with somebody else on your LAN or on the Internet and play against them

228
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:49.290
and shoot them and not get sucked into this central thing which will destroy you if you do get sucked

229
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.670
in.

230
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.040
So I'm just to try and show you what it looks like when I do get sucked in.

231
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.220
I'm orbiting it at the moment but they get you blow up and a new round begins.

232
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.130
So that's where were going to be doing in the next lecture.

233
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:03.210
Congratulations on getting through this one with all the build areas and all the include lots of new

234
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.270
concepts there.

235
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.440
So I will see you in the next lecture.
