00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.360
Welcome in this lecture we are diving back into C++ to implement sub menu switching.

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.810
So now when we click add join button it opens up and join menu and simultaneously.

3
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.450
We've implemented a cancel button on an join menu which when we hit the cancel button guess what goes

4
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.960
back to the main menu and I can switch between these all day.

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.500
Let's figure out how to implement this in seapass plus in this lecture.

6
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.070
So we've got multiple menus at this stage and at the moment we can move between them and I dont really

7
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.840
want to do the same blueprint because its heavy logic I'd like to prefer to do.

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.940
My logic in C++ where I'm more comfortable and it's going to be more performance although that's kind

9
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.980
of a secondary reason at this point.

10
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.420
So the first thing we want to do is get hold of our widget switcher in C++.

11
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.750
Now we know the mechanism for doing this is binding So let's go over to visual studio project and have

12
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.400
a go at binding our widget switcher.

13
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.830
So if we go to our head of file in the main menu dot H then we can create a new york property.

14
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.240
I'm going to copy the join you property and use that as a base.

15
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.670
Now what's the class going to be is the first question that might pop into your head which is we've

16
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.630
been doing it where you button up till now.

17
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.120
Well to find out it's fairly straightforward we have to do is go and hover over our widgets which are

18
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.590
menu switcher which is actually called the widgets which are.

19
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.480
And see that it is indeed called a widget switcher.

20
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.070
So probably I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark here.

21
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.800
But I think it might be just as simple as being a you widgets which is let's try that you widget switcher.

22
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.320
That's obviously not going to tell me here in the head of file because I'm doing a forward declaration

23
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.780
any way and it could well be that I've just you know just defined a completely new class that didn't

24
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.820
exist before.

25
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.040
But what is going to help us if we go into the C++ file at the top of the C++ file we're including the

26
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.160
button in order to have the details and what functions we can call on that button and we can try and

27
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.800
do the same thing with the widgets which I'm going to copy that include and change the included file

28
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.490
from button to widgets which are.

29
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.370
And we'll see if that is going to be happy enough to compile.

30
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.550
So I can go ahead and hit build a control shift be to hit build and see whether it's happy in that file

31
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.710
if it's happing clean that file.

32
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
I'm fairly sure what we've got on our hands is a new widget switcher.

33
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.650
So the obvious areas errors it's giving me here are that I've declared joined twice obviously don't

34
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.880
want to declare join twice.

35
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.170
I want to create a property and I call it widgets.

36
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.200
Let's see menu switcher because that's actually what we've called it already in our blueprint so it's

37
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.660
automatically going to bind by name because we've called the property menu switcher we've called the

38
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.580
actual widget in the hierarchy many switch that will bring them together.

39
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.540
So let's try and build it again and see whether this time everything is going to be happy.

40
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.490
Sure enough we have got a successful build here.

41
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.790
So we're definitely dealing with the new widget switcher.

42
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.210
So let's have a look at its API actually a fairly simple one here if we go and scroll down the page

43
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.340
you'll see that there is a few variables.

44
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.410
The active widget index which is what we've been using to change things around.

45
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.640
But furthermore we've got some helpful functions in here such as it get you can get the number of widgets

46
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.240
that we can switch between we can get the widget at a certain index so we can actually get the you widget

47
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.570
back.

48
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.780
That that's an index we can set the ADD div widget by passing in a widget pointer or we can set an active

49
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.790
widget by passing in an index.

50
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.410
Lots of options there for us to choose from.

51
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.900
So of those which are we going to go for.

52
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.980
Well we are clicking the join button remember and we're wanting to show up the join menu.

53
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.860
Now the join menu is the fact that is is a join menu not the fact that it is widget one or widgets zero

54
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.810
if I added in more widgets that index would change.

55
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.230
So I would rather not use a set active widget index I'd rather set by the widget itself and connect

56
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.050
it up by name and do some binding to make sure I've got the right widget there.

57
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.230
So let's go ahead and switch those menus around do a little menu switcheroo.

58
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.690
The way I'm going to do this is first of all bind something to an join button so we've got our join

59
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.760
button here and I'm sick of these buttons actually being called host unjoin that's kind of a bit deceptive

60
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.640
that they're not.

61
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.850
They're not functions that host or join.

62
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.760
They are buttons so let's go ahead and rename those I've got host.

63
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.640
They're going to rename to host button I've got join which I'm going to rename to join button.

64
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.180
Now I just got to go into the C++ and find any instances where I've referred to host.

65
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.690
I don't.

66
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.610
There's a couple of places I referred to house this is referring to a house method so it's actually

67
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.410
a different thing at the top.

68
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.630
We've got HOST So I can change that to host button.

69
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.430
And I can do the same in the B.

70
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.530
Call to bind it's on.

71
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.350
Click.

72
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.480
And we have done anything with joined button yet but we're going to we're going do very much the same

73
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.000
thing as we've done with our host buttons and just going to copy that over and change the name from

74
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.600
host to join in both.

75
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.230
The if statement and the binding and then what we're going to bind too well for that we need to create

76
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.830
ourselves a new.

77
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.450
Functions I'm going to copy the host server.

78
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.210
That's not going to be just join server because we know that it's going to take us to a joined menu.

79
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.310
So I'm going to call this open join menu.

80
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.210
Okay.

81
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.250
And then we're going to bind to open join menu.

82
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.810
But first I'm going to actually declare the body of this.

83
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.050
And I put that under right the bottom under host server add the namespace for the class.

84
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.160
And a body which is going to be empty for now.

85
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.150
And then we are going to bind to that.

86
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.070
Let's copy its name open join menu.

87
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.330
I'm going to go over at the top of the file and where we are binding for our joined button I'm going

88
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.980
to join by to join menu.

89
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.180
Okay.

90
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.500
Let's go ahead and build and make sure all that's working.

91
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.880
That's not going to do very much because at the moment we're just doing an Open menu call.

92
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:34.940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this opportunity to make use of our menu switcher.

93
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.940
So we're going to go to the menu switcher and then use the arrow operator and then we're going to do

94
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.490
a set active widget which is going to take a widget which we currently don't have.

95
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.670
So I'm going to pass in now for now and let's not forget to change that.

96
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.910
And I also want to ensure that our menu switch is not no it shouldn't be necessary but just in case

97
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.730
I am super paranoid about dereferencing null pointers and our engine coming crashing down around our

98
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.400
ears.

99
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.500
So let's make sure that we have just checked the menu switch it is indeed not a null pointer.

100
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.560
Okay so now we want to actually have this widget.

101
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.470
And as I alluded to already we want to do that via a binding.

102
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:28.320
So I'm going to copy our binding for the new widgets which are in the head file and make a copy of that

103
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:35.990
and we're going to be binding basically any you widget so we can change the pointer to you with it.

104
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.710
Now if you weren't sure that all these things are you widgets the you button the you widgets which you

105
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.910
can always look and documentation.

106
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.960
Have a look at the class hierarchy and see that at the top of it all is the widget.

107
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.220
Now the reason I'm doing this is because sometimes we want to change the usage at the moment it's a

108
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.890
size box for the root of am joined menu but it might well be a vertical box or something else it doesn't

109
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.660
really matter what type of widget is it just needs to be at the root of that widget hierarchy.

110
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.670
Okay so the name is important we want to call it the join menu like so.

111
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.050
So it's a you widget join menu automatically bound to the thing called join menu and then what I can

112
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:19.850
do is over in my main key again probably doing an Ensure beforehand to make sure that our.

113
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.920
Join menus not know.

114
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:30.180
I'm going to do a null return and I'm going to make this in to join menu like so and then I can use

115
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.040
the join menu pointer in a set active widget.

116
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.770
Fantastic.

117
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.050
So I think that's ready to build.

118
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.800
Let's go ahead and build it and see if we're going to basically have our widget compile and see whether

119
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.590
the widget is actually functional.

120
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.790
It looks like the compile was a success.

121
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.780
So let's go over in to unreel and just check whether it compiles.

122
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.770
Nope something is not compiling what it is not compiling the host button and joined button which will

123
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.570
change the name.

124
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.800
So let's go ahead and change the name in the hierarchy as well.

125
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.300
Mind first the host button which I'm going to change to from called host to host button and the join

126
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.800
button which I'm also going to rename from join to join button like so.

127
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.740
And then we can compile and see that there are no errors so we can go ahead and play.

128
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.470
And now if I hit my join button sure enough the join menu pops up Huzza fantastic.

129
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.200
So what do we want to do now.

130
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.030
What am I unsure about at this point.

131
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.530
Well I think that we need a back button because if someone click the Join many and then the light on

132
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.400
oh I don't actually know anybody's IP address I need to host a game then they cant get back without

133
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.650
actually quitting which is a bit rubbish.

134
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.550
So let's figure out how to do that.

135
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.030
This is actually going to be a challenge for you to create the back button.

136
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.030
We are going to start off the first thing you want to do is put it in a sensible place and a sensible

137
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:59.270
look and sensible style then bind it in using widget binding and create a call-back and bind the call

138
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:05.420
back to a function use C++ and then switch to the main menu when it is clicked so pause the video and

139
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.640
have a go at testing out your knowledge about binding as well as the widgets which are by doing this

140
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.400
challenge.

141
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.110
Okay welcome back.

142
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.920
I'm going to have a go now myself.

143
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.480
So first things first let's dive right in with our creating a back button.

144
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.930
So I'm going to get my join many that is the obvious place to put back.

145
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:31.420
But in actual fact I think what I'm going to do here is take the team button and I want to put it next

146
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.950
to my join button so have a join and cancel button next to each other.

147
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.670
And what I'm going to do to do that is basically copy from our main menu where we've already got a horizontal

148
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.950
box so going to copy that horizontal box that is already well laid out for having two buttons next to

149
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.540
each other.

150
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.110
And I'm going to put it underneath the in the vertical box.

151
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.340
They go we've got host and join now.

152
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.000
I can remove that join button at the top there.

153
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:07.270
And it's looking more or less right except host should no longer say host it should now say something

154
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:12.080
else like cancell back then I'm going to go with cancel.

155
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.850
Like so we can cancel it or we can join if we go ahead and play that to preview.

156
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.220
Go to join menu read a cancel button that currently does nothing and join button that does nothing.

157
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.170
Let's make our cancel button for starters actually do something.

158
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.540
So we're going to give that button a handy name such as cancell rather than button one.

159
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:38.220
So going to call this the canso fact let's call it the cancell join menu button.

160
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:45.110
Because if we had other cancel buttons in other subs dialogues such as an options dialogue then we might

161
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.430
want that to be named differently so cancell join menu button.

162
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.220
Very simple let's go over back to visual studio.

163
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.460
And in visual studio we're going to have to do our binding as I said.

164
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.190
So I'm going to just paste in a button name for now.

165
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.860
Going to take my join button and duplicate it.

166
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.340
And I'm going to put my button name in place of that second button.

167
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:19.630
So we've got two buttons now or three buttons a join button a button and a cancel join menu button.

168
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.070
Now we want to do the binding to do that.

169
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:30.570
I first need a function to bind to so I am going to copy my open join menu to be a C load main menu

170
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.620
is basically what we want to do or open main menu.

171
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.480
So.

172
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.260
So we got open join menu open main menu and let's go back over to assy plus plus then do the binding

173
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.970
of the button itself.

174
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.710
I'm going to copy the binding for the join button.

175
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.790
It is all pretty.

176
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.670
Copy and paste exercise really.

177
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:57.230
Let's go to the council join menu button and use that just copied and paste the cancelled join many

178
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.570
button text to replace it in our initialise method.

179
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:08.720
And then we want to bind that to the method called Open main menu so I go back to their had a file copy

180
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.540
the name of the function.

181
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.330
I paste it in to.

182
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.860
Our binding call for a cancelled join menu button and now all I've got to do is actually implement that.

183
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.570
So I'm going to do that by copying and pasting the implementation again of the open join menu.

184
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.760
Like so I'm going to copy and paste the name.

185
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.220
Open main menu.

186
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.250
Because I don't trust myself to type everything correctly.

187
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.200
I tend to copy and paste.

188
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.730
Okay so we've got our menu switcher we've got ADD join menu and it's actually at the moment going to

189
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.790
set the active widget as the join menu so that's not correct.

190
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:52.040
We need to bind to the not the join many but the main menu so let's copy our bind widget for the U widget

191
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.950
join menu that should be the bottom one for me.

192
00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:02.960
Then I copy that one out and fix up the indentation which just got messed up and I'm going to call that.

193
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.900
Let's see.

194
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.000
My wants to call it the same thing as it's currently called a hierarchy which I believe is just main

195
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.320
menu.

196
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.200
Indeed it is.

197
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.240
So let's go back into visual studio.

198
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.010
And just call it the main menu.

199
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.450
So we've got a new widget main menu you widget join menu.

200
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.270
And we can switch between them using our widgets which are all of which all these important properties

201
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.040
have been bound here into the C plus plus So we have access to them in C++.

202
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.390
How handy is that.

203
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.600
So we're going to go to main menu.

204
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:38.770
So when we do open main menu we set the active widget as the main menu so let's go ahead and save that

205
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.810
compile that and see whether we're getting the right back button behaviour.

206
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:51.460
Okay the compellation has succeeded Let's go in to unreal and see our main menu working.

207
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.770
Let's go ahead and play to preview this.

208
00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:00.270
Then go hit join and hit cancel join cancel join cancel.

209
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.020
Yay it works we can go backwards and forwards in our menu.

210
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.870
I'm going to submenus and go back to the top level main menu again.

211
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.900
I'm very happy.

212
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.450
Here's a very cool thing which I didn't even have in my prototype for this project so we've just gone

213
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.170
and done something a little bit beyond the prototype and I'll see you in the next lecture where we're

214
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.110
going to make this join dialogue actually functional.

215
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.540
Looking forward to seeing you there.
