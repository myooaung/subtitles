00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,240
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,650
We are going to be doing some stuff with the many that makes it look nicer.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,670
As you can see here we've added some darkness to the background which just makes a lot little bit easier

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,960
to read in a centre.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,400
The buttons a bit but beyond this beyond adding some styling hints what we've done is actually add in

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,720
something called a menu switcher which is going to allow us to switch between a main menu this one house

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,490
and join buttons and this join game menu which when clicking the join button will allow you to enter

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,730
an IP address and then join a game which will basically allow us to do this second command that we had

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,790
implemented in the last section of joining a remote IP address game.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,770
So let's dive in and see how we can do this.

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,870
So the next part the stop on our journey of the quest of the main menu isn't to get and join.

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,340
Ben button working now and join button isn't good and easy like the host button because it actually

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,430
required a parameter.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,900
Remember that join requires the address that we want to actually be joining.

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,240
So to actually achieve that we need a more menu we need a sub menu here.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,220
Now to do this we could create a whole new widget and pull it out and replace it from the game instance

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,210
that would be quite heavy weight however and would mean that then the game instance is too involved

18
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,330
in the UI.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,710
We want to remember keep this all inside our UI module and one way that we can easily do this is with

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,460
a clever little widget called a widget switcher.

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,730
Now lets have a look at what widgets which is are and how they work.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,150
You can go and look for a widgets which are in your pallet so it will be called widget switches so you

23
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,210
can just look for.

24
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,990
Things i already puts it up as the first element in there anyway.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:03,810
And what we can do is we can use it to wrap any of the things in our hierarchy and replace them with

26
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,060
another widget So lets have a look at our hierarchy.

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,340
I personally would want to keep my background and I wont wont probably want to keep my vertical box

28
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,630
so the vertical box and the size box I want that to be specifier ball in my submenus for example.

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,990
So one cannot do them going to right click on my top level vertical box underneath the overlay and right

30
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,490
click and go to replace with an Im going to replace it with a widget switcher.

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,230
And there we go.

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,750
Weve got the widgets which are set up obviously at the moment it is taking up all the space in the overlay.

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,530
But the and rather the size boxes.

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,870
But if I click on my size box and stick it to be horizontally aligned to the centre and vertically aligned

35
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,650
to the centre then we're back where we started with our widgets whicher.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,450
And the size box actually that has kind of replaced out the vertical box.

37
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,620
That's okay as well.

38
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,210
Okay.

39
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:11,110
So we've got our size box and our widgets which are out now let's illustrate how these actually work

40
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,530
by trying to replace our main menu with some text.

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,130
So I'm going to look in the palette for a text item the text widget.

42
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm going to bring the text widget in and dump it on the widget switcher.

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,380
Now what you'll notice is if I select the text block then the size box and everything underneath it.

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,940
The main menu disappear by select the size box then vice versa happens.

45
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,020
But that's not very helpful because if I go and hit play then we're still going to be seeing our main

46
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,760
menu at least.

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,830
We will be if I am in the right map so let's make sure I open up the right main menu map.

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,190
There's many maps.

49
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,700
Now if I go and play.

50
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,400
And then let's have a look.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
Let's open this up in a separate window.

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Then we still got our main menu as the central components.

53
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,210
So it hasn't changed anything so what's actually going on.

54
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,300
Well if you go ahead and select the widgets which you'll notice that in the details there is a property

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,500
under switcher called active widget index.

56
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,290
And if I change this from zero to 1 then it's going to select my text block instead as the active widget.

57
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,740
And if we go ahead and hit play then indeed the only thing visible is the text block so we can use this

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,860
to create ourselves a special join menu.

59
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,560
And let's go ahead and do that right now.

60
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,770
Let's go ahead and create a join menu so I can remove my text block as a starting point.

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,750
And how do I want my Join menu to work.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,780
Well I am going to have a text field and I'm going to have a join button so I'm going to need at least

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,660
a vertical box to hold all that in.

64
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,280
So let's start off with that vertical box.

65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,880
I like building things from the bottom up rather than from the top down.

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
So we've got a vertical box in my vertical box.

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,050
I am going to throw a text box which is the text input thing.

68
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,140
The editable text box that goes in my vertical box.

69
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,500
Then what else goes my vertical box.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,170
I'm going to have a button now for buttons.

71
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:13,620
I'm going to go ahead and copy the buttons from our main menu to keep that whole thing consistent.

72
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,200
So let's grab that.

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,870
Copy it and go in to my vertical box and paste it in there.

74
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,510
Now obviously this is looking super ugly.

75
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,010
So let's start off with our button.

76
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:31,700
We want the button to not be trying to fill the horizontal line but rather be using its own width for

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,640
that.

78
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,310
So that helps.

79
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,190
Next up we want add a civil text box to whom.

80
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:46,820
Maybe use feel size no auto size was just fine but we do want it to have some height of its own.

81
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,690
I'll try to add in some hint text see if that helps.

82
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,310
So I want to say IP address.

83
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:02,270
For the hint text of the editable text box and I'm going to go ahead and increase the font size that

84
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,290
might be the other issue.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,380
So you go to style and then font and then size and we can scroll the font up.

86
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,850
Yep sure enough it was the font size that was causing as an issue.

87
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,280
Now go ahead and play.

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,600
We can see that we've got our IP address we've got our host button and it's all looking fabulously ugly

89
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:26,960
at the moment but it is sort of functional and we're going to make it pretty and that's going to be

90
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,200
the challenge to make it pretty.

91
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,160
But the important thing is that this has now is entirely controlled.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,320
Which one is active by the widgets which I change the index in the widgets which are I can switch over

93
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,470
to my Join menu even though it's not very obvious that the join menu just yet.

94
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,730
So I'm going go and be really lazy and leave the whole job of styling up to you.

95
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,020
Well I'm not being lazy because I'm going to be doing it myself in the chosen solution.

96
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,250
So here is your challenge outline the menus with style.

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,950
We are going to style the text box that is one ugly looking text box at the moment if we go back to

98
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:10,520
our vertical box for that menu and you can see that the IP address menu looks absolutely awful.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,760
So you're going to do something about that then you are going to improve the layouts again.

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:23,690
The got very awful boring lay out at the moment ensure everything is legible and I would like to add

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,230
a heading so that we know where we are when we're inside a menu now because the solution again requires

102
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,240
quite a lot clicking.

103
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,240
It's about 10 minutes long so I'm going to be putting that in the next video.

104
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,380
So when you're done with the challenge go ahead and watch the solution video.

105
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,670
Coming up next.
