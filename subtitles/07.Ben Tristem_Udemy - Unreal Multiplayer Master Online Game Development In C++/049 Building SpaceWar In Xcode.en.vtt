00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.900
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.910
I am going to be showing you how we can build this.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.920
The example project called Spacewar which has a cool little spaceship game.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.370
And the thing that we are going to be doing this with is called X code which you foresee before and

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.330
we are going to be basically using the esco project included in the S.T. case example project.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.440
We're going to be applying a few settings changes are required in order to build it correctly.

7
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.470
And we are also going to add it in to your steam library like so that you can play from within steam

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.670
and it behaves well with the steam integration.

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.840
So let's dive in and see how all of that is done.

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.110
Okay.

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.050
So in this video we are going to be covering what the Visual Studio folk covered in the last video so

12
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.640
I'm going to be taking you through the steam works example project.

13
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.810
What are these and how will we use it.

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.330
We're going to open up an x code apply the recommended settings and have that fixed and then we are

15
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.220
going to run it in steam.

16
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.990
Okay.

17
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.080
So we are going to figure out how to make the project run and how to make it run without crashing which

18
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.860
might be the problem.

19
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.850
So thats going to be a follow a long lecture or a do it at the end once he watched it lecture.

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.870
Because there wont be a specific challenge here.

21
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.640
Okay so let's begin with the first step which is introducing the steam works example project.

22
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.190
So this is it here.

23
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.920
This is my at least my version control route under the encrypted directories I have the stk that we

24
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.770
extracted in the last lecture you took.

25
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.770
And in this stk we have a steam works example project.

26
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.660
This is the thing that we are interested in it's the thing that we are looking at.

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.690
Okay so here in the steelworks example project we have a few things but the most important one perhaps

28
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.230
is the ex code project down here it's called let me see if I can expand it out so we can get the full

29
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.090
name.

30
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.880
It's called the Steam works example.

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.070
Ex code proj.

32
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.650
Okay.

33
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.750
So they were going to go ahead and open up the steelwork example or esco proj and it will fire up your

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.390
ex code.

35
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.140
MIKE So and what we're going to do is going to try and build it so I am going to do a command be to

36
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.810
build and you'll notice that we have got to build failures.

37
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.530
Now the build failures are up here in the middle bar and we've got this little red icon we click on

38
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.440
it we'll see that it's got some dependency analysis error.

39
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.310
How strange.

40
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.990
But we've also got a warning and the warning says that we can update the recommended settings.

41
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.800
So let's have a go at updating those settings before we resign this to being broken.

42
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.440
Okay so if I double click it then you see it comes up with this list of things that we want to apply

43
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.910
that it wants to apply for US recommended changes to our project let's perform those changes.

44
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.870
I'm going to keep them all checked.

45
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.380
Uncommitted changes here that's okay let's continue.

46
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.950
Let's close that and let's see if it'll build now with a command B.

47
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.150
Has are we have got a build a success so let's have a go at running the project now so this you guys

48
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.990
have had it a lot easier than the visual studio folk they've had to deal with all sorts of include parts.

49
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.420
And here you are just doing it very simply with basically working rate.

50
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.130
So let's go ahead and build it run it should be at least trying to run now that see if it's it's not

51
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.810
running as an error message you might have to pull up from the bottom to see the error messages down

52
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.500
here in the bottom.

53
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Right now it is saying that the steam API in it failed steam must be running Okay.

54
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.060
That's easy to fix.

55
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.960
Just set up steam open up steam log in with your account.

56
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.890
I'm using one of my three test accounts here to show you.

57
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.830
And we are going to try and run it again.

58
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.040
This time success we are in the game.

59
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.610
We could go and create a server and we can play.

60
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.020
So do have a go at playing the game and see what it's like here's what it's like I can shoot I can move.

61
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.260
And all is good in the world but there is a problem.

62
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.330
If I go back to the main menu and I find a lobby and I go to any one of these lobbies and try and join

63
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.310
in the lobby.

64
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.680
Crash.

65
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.470
Oh no.

66
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.110
How do we get past this.

67
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.450
How do we get past crashing when we enter a lobby.

68
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.720
Well actually it's a little bit funky.

69
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.980
The idea here is that you need to actually be running this within steam.

70
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.430
Steam needs to know about the application in order for it to work.

71
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.700
So the way we do this is we go to steam open up steam and we go to our games menu and go to add a non

72
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.780
steam game to my library which is what our game is obviously now is going to spin a beach ball for a

73
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.590
while here.

74
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.750
Don't panic.

75
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.820
Nothing has gone wrong is just for some reason.

76
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.320
When you do this the first time it wants to spin the beach ball.

77
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.020
And once that peach wheels finish spinning you're going to get a dialogue pop up so that can take a

78
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.890
little bit of time.

79
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.620
But here is my dialogue.

80
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.270
Now this is a bit of a strange dialogue it's basically showing you all the currently running applications

81
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.080
and it is asking you for all the applications that it could find and it's asking you which one you would

82
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.270
like to add.

83
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.840
Now we can try running our game and see whether it shows up in that list.

84
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.300
So let's try that off first.

85
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.860
So I'm going to switch back over to steam and see whether it shows up but it doesn't.

86
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.850
I don't see the game in here anywhere let's sir let's just scheck arrouse space wars area.

87
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.810
Nope.

88
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.400
So we're going to have to add this ourselves in.

89
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.280
And we know it's not in the applications Directorate.

90
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.620
So where is it.

91
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.720
Let's go and browse and I'll tell you where we're going.

92
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.370
So first off it's going to pop you in the applications directory so you going to have to go up a level

93
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.620
from there to the root of your file system.

94
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.450
Now the root of your file system you're going to find the users directory.

95
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.070
Go to that select your user.

96
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.930
So you're now in your home directory on the Mac.

97
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.260
And then we're going to look for a directory called library open up library.

98
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.860
It's often hidden so you may not have seen it before may not have thought that you had a library directory

99
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.790
and then under library you're going to look for a folder called a developer and developer were going

100
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.450
to look for a folder called X code then derived data and then here you can see we've got a couple of

101
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.440
things in derived data.

102
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.760
One of them should start with steam works example and then some long random string.

103
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.090
So open that one.

104
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.610
The steam works example.

105
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:12.740
And then build one went one level too far I'm going to back up build then products.

106
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.130
Not intermediate products is because it is the application we're looking for it's a product of the build

107
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.490
and then debug because we built it as a debug application.

108
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.620
And finally at the end of all that were in the steam works example dot app.

109
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:38.510
So that to recap if I can expand out my window the full path for that is users your user library developer

110
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.490
X code.

111
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.820
Derived data.

112
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:49.040
Then the name of the project which is that steam works example and then some random string builder products

113
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:56.110
debug and then finally you've got the steam work example app you can click open on that and that look

114
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.230
Landers in this ad game menu with that one checked.

115
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.870
We can go and add selected programs.

116
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.300
Make sure you've seen the screen.

117
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.780
Sometimes it goes away without you having seen it and you'll have to go and add again and make sure

118
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:15.860
you've seen the screen because what we want is for the steam works example app to show up in your library

119
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.080
like so which means that you can hit play and it will run the app.

120
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.830
This time it was running so I'm going to make sure it's quit first set quit.

121
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.000
Steam works example.

122
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.660
In fact I might have to do a couple of times.

123
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.480
No I need to do it from within the game.

124
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.140
Is it the game.

125
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:30.840
There we go.

126
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:37.530
And I'm going to go ahead and hit play and make sure it launches find a lobby and just check that we

127
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.570
can indeed.

128
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.560
Boom.

129
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.460
We're now in a lobby and you can see that we can do things like set ourselves as ready and play with

130
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.250
other people.

131
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.500
We're going to be doing that in the next lecture.

132
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.230
So I will see you there.
