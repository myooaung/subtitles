00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
But if we physically remove that key from the file itself.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.250
So how should we just comments out in coming out

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.650
properties using the hash symbol by the way.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.200
So now if we run it, we'll get an error.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.530
And that's because spring is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.985
now trying to dereference this property and it can't find them.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.890
So it cannot resolve placeholder because this is

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.715
a place holder expression to resolve property names to their values.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:26.355
So to get around this, we can actually provide a default.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:28.620
So how defaults work are you basically put

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.200
a colon and then put the default value afterwards.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.415
So for example, here, we can have green parrot instead.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.470
And now when we run, we should see

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.275
the default values picked up because that key was missing.

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:44.280
And we can see here we've got released Nim wind power instead.
