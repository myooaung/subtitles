00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Well, we're at the end of the course now.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.500
And by now you should have a good understanding of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.795
how you can create spring boots applications,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.030
the basics of how you can build and run them.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.880
Understand how a typical LED application in spring bill will

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.940
look code wise and be able to find your way around and understand

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.280
the nuts and bolts of how dependencies are pulled into

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.995
Spring Boot apps have the components within those dependencies are configured,

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.555
how you can configure and use your own components,

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:26.780
and how springboards hooks into the spring runtime to effectively give you

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.455
a regular spring burst environments in which to code your application.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:32.720
We've come a long way and cubital lots of grounds.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.340
So you should be proud of yourself making it this

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.055
far and be able to see just how far you've come.

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:39.470
Now if you want more of a deep dive into spring itself,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.140
you might want to check out our other course, which goes into that.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.780
So in fact, this course and that one makes a great

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.155
pairing together to really get a handle on spring and spring Boot together.

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.845
But for now, all that remains to say as it's been great having you in this course,

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.800
good luck with your Spring Boot journey from here and have a great day.
