00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Okay, so we've had a bit of a look round.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.730
We've seen the controllers,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.280
the repositories, and the pond XML file.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.890
The hearts of the application where everything starts

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.995
from is from this peck clinic application here.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.290
So all spring will applications start like

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.685
any other job application with a public static void main method.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.950
And inside that method,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.050
we use the spring application.rb.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.950
I'm passing the class reference to this class with any arguments as past and

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.204
crucially annotates it with Spring Boot application

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.770
was sprinkled application does behind the scenes is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.440
it's actually a combination of three different annotations.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.210
If we command click into this,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.575
we'll see that includes

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:45.275
Spring boot configuration and enable auto configuration and components scan.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.775
And so in a nutshell,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.945
what that does is sets of components scanning under the root package,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.335
which is this one here where the men spring Bu application class is found,

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:57.260
enables properties to be passed in and to be absorbed

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.050
from the environment and made available to the application.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.450
And enables this auto configuration mechanism,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.370
which is really where all the magic happens.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.140
And we'll look at that in the next videos.
