00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
The final piece of the puzzle for spring

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.655
whose applications is knowing how all spring boots application startup.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.190
In other words, what the sequence of events are which happened

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.875
from start to finish when we first run the app.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:14.670
So in this section, we'll get to know exactly how Spring Boot itself hooks into

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.040
the Spring framework to be able to be effectively

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.309
be once it's up and running a regular spring application.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.130
At this point, you can then harnessed the existing spring knowledge.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.540
You have to be able to develop

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.480
applications just as you would with any irregular spring app.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.040
So let's dive in now and see

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.060
exactly how Spring Boot applications startup and hook into the spring runtime.
