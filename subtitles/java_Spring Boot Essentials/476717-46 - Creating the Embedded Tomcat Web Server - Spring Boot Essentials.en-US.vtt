00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.805
The message source initializing is not too interesting.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.425
Initializing the atlas has to do with

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.725
its nationalization in its application event multicast.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:13.395
That's fine. Now we didn't own refresh.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.539
And then when we do on refresh,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.590
we can see here it's actually creating the web server.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.830
So this is what's creating the embedded Tomcat web server.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.115
You can see here is if we open that up,

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:37.440
you can see here service connectors that connect to establish ridges on port 8080.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.950
And if we shift it out from there,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.895
It's going to register listeners.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.105
Again, it will emit any events which it needs to emit.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.910
But it's going to instantiate any more Singletons,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.440
Which employee need most of those,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.270
Laura, they've been done in the home, refreshed by the way.
