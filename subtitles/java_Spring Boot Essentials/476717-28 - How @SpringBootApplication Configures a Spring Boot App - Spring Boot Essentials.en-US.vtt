00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
So if we jump back out to the demo application,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.385
you can see we've got this Spring Boot application,

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:09.180
which are spring Boot application class is annotated with a demo application.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.850
And if we go into here, you'll see that it's actually

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.855
a shorthand for annotations which switch on components scanning,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:21.285
handle configuration, which again is also a configuration being class.

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.735
And the key part is that we have this enable auto configuration.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.720
And this is really the thing that creates all of the Spring Boot magic.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.970
Now you'll see here in enabling also configuration,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.190
we've got this extra thing which it imports,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.590
which is auto configuration impulse vector.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.300
And if I click into there,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.610
we see the implementation for the Spring Boot class,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.285
which is responsible for loading in all of the auto configuration classes.

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.040
So if I scroll down,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.735
you'll see this method here, load factor nims.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:52.790
And if I go into that,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.040
we'll see load spring factories.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.740
And the key point is it's going to load this in here,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.455
which is meta INFP, spring dot factories.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:03.230
So let's RNF spring dot factories.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.090
If you do command shift though,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.955
to look for Spring Dock factories,

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:11.960
will see that each specific technology area which are started

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.740
dependencies abroad in they also include the spring door factories file.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.630
So the main one is spring boots.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.600
If I double-click this and you can take a look at this now,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.020
this is basically configuring all of the components which are

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.725
going to be dynamically brought into scope by the spin boots framework.

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:31.040
So for example, we've got application context listeners.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.780
These are classes which are going to listen for

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.745
lifecycle events and the application context.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:37.010
So in other words, when the application context is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.740
created started when it's refreshed, that kind of thing.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.360
We've got application listeners,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.675
which again are event listeners on the application itself.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:48.530
You've got post-process for the environment and a few other bits and pieces.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.885
So what we're looking at here basically

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:54.350
is a set of very low-level components in Spring Boot itself,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.680
to be able to do the bare minimum required of the framework itself.
