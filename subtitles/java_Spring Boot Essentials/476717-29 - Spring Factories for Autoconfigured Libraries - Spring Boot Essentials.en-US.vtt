00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Now, if we search again for spring factories,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.070
and actually before we do that,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.180
if we just look at what we brought in,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.575
so in the pond XML file,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.525
I didn't explain this in beginning, sorry.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.350
In this particular projects are brought in Spring Boot Starter web,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.510
Spring Boot starter data GPA,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.130
which will bring effectively spring

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.890
NBC's technology stack and spring data and the Java persistence API technology stack.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.000
And also a hedge to database as well so we can get the PhD driver.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.745
And if we look inside the Maven tab here,

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.565
we will see that in bringing in Spring Boot Starter web,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.560
it's brought in these dependencies as well.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.070
So other Spring Boot dependencies to do with auto configuration.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.260
And also the Spring Boot started for Tom cap,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.070
so we can have Tomcat as embedded.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.560
And it's also brought in the standard Spring framework,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.345
spring and VC stuff as well.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.610
And then we can see h two at the bottom.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.980
So those the actual dependencies that it's brought in.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.155
Now each one of those Jar files

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.845
will appear then inside this classpath in external libraries,

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.470
just a complete set of flattened jars.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.090
And four.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.340
If we go back to the file again for some of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
those Jar files for the Spring Boot starter libraries that are brought

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.290
in other technology areas of those Which abroad when we'll have the spin dot factories.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.640
So for example in here,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.325
a spring data GPA, we double-click that.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.925
We can see we've got some extra things that JPL is bringing in.

00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:26.045
If we go back out and we'll look into auto configure, which is more interesting.

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:29.660
This is basically the full configuration for the auto configuration framework.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660
And this really is what we're talking about in this particular lesson.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.040
So inside here, inside Spring Boot auto configure spring factories.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.005
We can see we have under this enable auto configuration for the qualified className here,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.980
the complete set of configuration classes which are gonna be brought

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.990
in whenever we have this enable auto configuration annotation on our Spring Boot class.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.389
So the gym workout here demo application has spring with application as an invitation.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.660
And it also has this enable auto configuration here as well.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.170
So because we have this enable auto configuration protein,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.940
because we have spin Bu application there, because we have that.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.750
Then basically these springs or factories inside this jar file.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.305
Because it's inside the jar file there because it ends with a JAR file name.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:19.490
That's gonna exclamation mark,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.810
which means it's inside the jar file.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.420
If we double-click that, these configuration classes

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.600
here have the potential to exist in our Spring container.
