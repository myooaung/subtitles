The foundational parts of Spring Boot,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.490
which gives it its ability to pull in the text stacks and libraries that it needs,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.455

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.010
This is done by the starter dependencies available in Spring boot.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
So to understand how Spring Boot projects can pull in all this cool,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
shiny technology, we need to get a handle on how that works.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.620
