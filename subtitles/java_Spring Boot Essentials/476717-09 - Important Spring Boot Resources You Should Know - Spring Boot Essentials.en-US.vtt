00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
In this video, we're gonna talk through a few key resources that are really

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.420
useful to know about when you're starting to learn about Spring boot.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.040
So let's jump into crumb.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.415
I'm first off the main spring website where everything is located at Spring de ir.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.950
So this is the main website for all the spin projects.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.555
So not just spun boom,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.225
but all the other projects to Silver Spring framework itself.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.700
Other projects which deal with different technology areas,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.250
for example, spring integrations,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.820
spring batch, and that kind of thing.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.340
So it's a really good place to look at because it's the home of spring.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.590
So you can always find whatever documentation hereafter,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.675
pretty much by starting at Spring the iron.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:42.325
Anyway, if you jump into projects, you'll see.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:43.640
And we have Spring Boot.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.020
Yeah, so just click on there.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.195
And then this takes you to spin boots home.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.400
So this is the main website for Spring boot.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.050
And you can see here you've got three tabs.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.240
You've got overview, learn and samples.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.500
So the overview is nice specific about just taken a few small steps to get started.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.345
So it was a quick start guide here,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.550
more general guide about how to build an application with

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.100
spring and spring boots and a son talks and videos,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.530
which will also useful if that's useful to start off with,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.080
to get some background context of that kind of thing.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.720
If you're more involved, are getting more involved.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.295
If you go into the Learn tab,

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.820
then I recommend you basically bookmark to links in here.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.710
So you can see here we have all the different versions of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.620
spring boots or 231 is the current one.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.215
So whenever you see currency means the latest version,

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.540
and whenever you see Ga means generally accepted,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.555
which basically means the most stable version that you can use.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.310
So it doesn't have experimental features,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.095
is not bleeding edge nightly build.

00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.555
It's just basically the general release if you like.

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.280
So the generally accepted version.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.480
Anyway, there are two links here.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.980
There's reference Docker, API docs.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.130
So if I just hit command while clicking to open them up in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.535
a new tab for the reference doc and also for the API doc.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:48.275
And then we can have a look at those as well.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.810
So go into the reference documentation.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.600
I do recommend you create a bookmark for this so you can keep going

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.390
back to it and referring to it as you learn more about springboard.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.085
So as you get more into the technologies,

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.700
you can see here the men sections for me and the men such as don't recommend,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.410
we'll be getting started first of all,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.980
so you can have a look at that, but then actually using spring bumps.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.580
So then we're looking at build systems,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.830
how to structure the code configuration and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.510
how Spring works under the hood with beans

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.490
and dependency injection, those kind of things.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.355
Spring Boot features which cover, as it says,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:19.460
things like profiles, logging, security and caching.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.580
So basically the main enterprise development features if you will,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.710
and also some useful how-to guides there as well.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.975
And then jumping back up to here,

00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:29.450
this is basically the Java doc or Spring boot.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.880
So if you ever need to get into the code itself and have a look

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.120
through the individual components that Rotter configured, that kind of stuff.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.525
Then you'll find all of those classes in this particular section.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.385
So you've got all the packages of Spring boot,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.155
the classes there as well.

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.480
And if you click on a particular class, for example,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.610
then you can see here underneath you'd have the methods which detail

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.730
the input parameters and the return types which are passed yet,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.425
but it's always useful to have as well.

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.290
Oh, it's more advanced use of Spring Boot if you're going

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.900
into the actual code level because most of them it's just auto configured anyway.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.615
You don't really have to dip down into those kind of areas,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.565
but it's useful to see how it works under the hood.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:06.980
Going back to the first tab to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.950
the men's Spring Boot homepage and going down to the third tablet.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.495
Something interesting behind here,

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:14.720
because basically spring initializer, which we've seen before,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.960
which enables you to create Spring Boot projects from scratch and then

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.965
download them that initialize a website located at start dot spring the IR.

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.065
So I'll just show you that here.

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:25.115
Start that spindle here,

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:26.255
just to refresh your memory.

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:30.620
This website which we've used before to be able to create spring with applications

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.180
with different dependencies on

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.985
different bill technologies using different languages, that kind of thing.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:38.690
This website actually powered by Spring Boot,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.290
and it's available down here in the initializer project.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.730
So you can actually physically check out

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.475
this project and run it as a spring grew application

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:51.245
and step through the code to see how this particular web app is designed,

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:53.285
developed, and see how it runs,

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:54.800
as useful as multiple lookup.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.945
So the main points always make sure the minimum,

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.245
you've got this dual spring boots documentation homepage

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.095
in your bookmarks and feel free to book might be the ones as well,

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:05.195
and to reference those materials as you go on

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:08.760
learning more about spring and spring boot and you Spring Boot journey.
