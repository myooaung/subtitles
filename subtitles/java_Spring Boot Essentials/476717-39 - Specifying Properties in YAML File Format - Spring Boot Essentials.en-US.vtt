00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
The other thing to mention is that you have two ways of being able to specify properties.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.600
You can specify them as property files like this,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.835
or you can also specify them as YAML files.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:13.020
So if I rename this YML,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.395
the YAML file, then the syntax then is like this.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.490
There's basically a property key colon and then the value.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.775
So if I take minus D switch out now,

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.730
because we demonstrated the overriding, we don't need that anymore.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.235
Okay.

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:41.195
And then re-run. You'll see we have Golden Eagle again.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:45.320
But with yaml, you don't have to give flattened property names like

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.385
this where you have a BBB,

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:51.305
CCC kind of thing.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:53.075
You can actually nest them as well.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.280
So it's common in most YAML configuration is you'll

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.025
have a top-level Qi, for example, of my app.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.875
And then underneath we'd have nested keys.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:04.430
So this line here released dash m with this value,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.910
it's actually defining a property of myapp dot released on them.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.730
So just to prove that if we run that again,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.245
we should see that it resolves to the same thing.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.905
And you can arbitrarily nest however many levels deep you want it to go.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.180
So we can put extra things on here.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.770
For example, we could say and released on manager,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.650
maybe there's a person who gave the release.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.810
Let's see, speak.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.470
Maybe we have another plug for release cycle which maybe

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.120
has sprint number three, for example.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.030
Programming Grumman too, if you're doing scrum or whatever, it doesn't matter.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.060
Whatever these minima and these irrelevant for the purposes of this demo.
