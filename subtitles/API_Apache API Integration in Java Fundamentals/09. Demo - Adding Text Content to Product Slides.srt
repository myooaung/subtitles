1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,310
In this demo,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,090
let's add text content to the product slides by displaying the product name,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,640
its features, and the price.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,240
Go to the addProductSlide method once again.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,210
Below this code, create a TextBox on the slide.

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,540
To place text in it, first,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,940
add a new paragraph line calling the method addNewTextParagraph.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,540
Let's call it namePara.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,680
Then to it add a NewTextRun.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,240
Then on the run call setText method to set the product name.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,900
Next, add a line break on the paragraph by calling the addLineBreak method.

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,250
This is to create a gap between the name and the feature

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,440
list that's going to be displayed below it.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,640
The feature list should be displayed as a bulleted list.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,140
So how can you do that?

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,340
Let's look through the feature list like this.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:19,510
Then inside the for loop add a new text paragraph like this.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:25,810
To display it as a bulleted list, you should set indentation on the paragraph.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,140
Indentation can be set to different levels starting from 0.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,540
Let's call the setIndentLevel method passing in 1.

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,840
If you want to create sub‑bullets under this,

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,210
you can set further indentation levels up to a maximum of 4.

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,340
Zero is the default, which means not indented.

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,180
Then you can call the setBullet method passing in true to indicate

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,540
that we want them to be displayed as bullet points.

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:10,540
Create a NewTextRun on the paragraph and set the text to be displayed,

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,040
followed by a LineBreak.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Next, you should position the text box on the right‑hand side of the image.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:29,740
To do that, call the setAnchor method passing in 350 for x,

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,240
100 for y, then 400 as the text box width,

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,840
and 400 as the text box height.

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,940
Now Save and Run.

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,290
You can see that the product name and the list of its

34
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,600
features displayed as a bulleted list like this.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,840
Now go back to the same method.

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,590
Create another text box on the slide.

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:07,040
In the same way, add a new text paragraph followed by a text run on this.

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,540
Display the product price.

39
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,230
The price should be formatted using a number format.

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:25,340
For that, simply create this format and apply it to the price when displayed.

41
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,040
Now to position it at the bottom left of the image,

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,740
call the setAnchor method,

43
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,540
now passing in the coordinates like this, and the

44
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,140
text box width and height as 200.

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,740
Now, if you save this and run,

46
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:55,000
you can see the price displaying like this below the image on the left‑hand side.
