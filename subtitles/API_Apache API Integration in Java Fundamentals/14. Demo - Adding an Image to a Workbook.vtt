00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.640
Next,

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.130
we are going to add an image to the quotation. The image that we

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.240
are going to add is the company logo image.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.040
So in the addCompanyDetails method, let's add this code.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.880
First,

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.410
read the image file data into a byte array. Next,

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.400
add the picture to the workbook.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.070
The addMethod call is going to return the 0‑based

9
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.840
index of the picture in the workbook.

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.840
Next, create the drawing patriarch,

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.200
which is the top‑level or parent container for all shapes in a sheet. Then

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.540
create a client anchor with the help of a creation helper.

13
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.400
This is to add the picture shape inside, which you will place the picture.

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.860
Then in the anchor, you should specify the starting column where the picture

15
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.540
will start drawing its cell, and the starting row as well,

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.140
which means the top‑left corner position of the picture.

17
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.140
We'll give 10 and 2, respectively.

18
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.480
Then create the picture by passing in the anchor and the

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.340
picture index that you got before.

20
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.940
Finally, call this to auto‑resize the picture relative to its top‑left corner.

21
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:50.000
Now you're done. Save and run. You can see the local image added to the sheet like this.
