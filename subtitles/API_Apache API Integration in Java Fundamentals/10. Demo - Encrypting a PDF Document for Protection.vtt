00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's password protect the product catalog PDF,

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.920
specifying the access permissions using the AccessPermission

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.640
class and the StandardProtectionPolicy class.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.040
Here is a method already written with the basic logic

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.240
to load the product catalog PDF.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.640
So let's create an AccessPermission object, permission.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.700
Let's restrict access to this document by not allowing it to be

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:42.240
printed by calling the setCanPrint method on the permission object,

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.520
passing a value of false, and also prevent from adding any

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.370
annotations to the document by calling the setCanModifyAnnotations

11
00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.640
method, passing false to it. Next,

12
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.840
create a StandardProtectionPolicy object policy.

13
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.440
Using this, it is possible to specify an owner password and a user password.

14
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:23.210
So let's give the owner password as 1234 and user password as your

15
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.220
name, for example, and then passing the AccessPermission object

16
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.890
permission that you set above. Now simply call the protect method

17
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.090
on the catalog document, passing in the policy object. And finally,

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.240
save the document.

19
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.130
Now, the PDF document will be saved as a protected document,

20
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.740
and a password needs to be provided to open it.

21
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.340
Let's test this.

22
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.040
I've called the encryptPDF method in the main class and run the application.

23
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.840
Now when you try to open the document, it's asking for a password.

24
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.250
If you give the owner password,

25
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.830
which is 1234, it comes with full permission, where there will

26
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490
be no restrictions for printing or editing,

27
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.340
for example, like annotating.

28
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.440
However, if you open it with the user password,

29
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.920
you can see that the annotation buttons and the Print option are

30
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.170
disabled, as we restricted them by specifying access permissions back in

31
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:55.000
the code. So, simply you can do other restrictions as required by setting them in the AccessPermission object.
