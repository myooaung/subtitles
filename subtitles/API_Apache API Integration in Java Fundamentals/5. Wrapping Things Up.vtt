Before we end this module, let's look at some key takeaways.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.160
Be sure to close the PDF document after you load and modify it either by

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.900
calling the close method on the document or by surrounding your document

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.040
loading logic in try‑with‑resources, as you saw in the demos.

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.940
The second thing is,

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.800
remember to save the document after doing any modification to it,

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.940
like adding or removing pages or any content to the PDF document.

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.820
To wrap things up, you saw the PDFBox API features for loading a PDF document,

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.640
extracting content from it, and removing pages from a PDF document.

10
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
You worked with them yourself by applying these API features in the

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.000
product catalog PDF document from the furniture store scenario. Remember not to forget the key takeaways.
