00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.430
To get you quickly started with this course, let's look

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.540
at the basic setup that's required.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.400
First,

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.340
you will clone the GitHub repo that I've created to get you started quickly.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.240
Once you get it down, you can open it up on IntelliJ.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.740
You can use any other IDE of your choice, and that would be fine too.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.940
Here's the GitHub repo that I created for you.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.840
You can find this URL in the exercise files of this module.

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.360
Just go ahead and clone it or download it as a ZIP file,

10
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.470
which is fine too. I chose to clone it, so I'll go ahead and

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.200
clone it. Now that the code is on your machine,

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:02.640
let's open it up on IntelliJ. Open IntelliJ, click on Open or Import here,

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.540
browse to the location where you cloned or downloaded the project.

14
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:24.000
Here it is. Now click OK, and the project should open like this on your IDE. Now you have the basic setup to get going.
