00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.590
To display product details, you'll need to add a table, add rows and

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.610
cells to place details like the quantity, description,

3
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.820
price, line total, and etc. And also, add some formatting to the cell content.

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.000
Back in the code, go to the addProductDetails method. Add this

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.340
line of code to create a table on the document.

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.400
Now this will create an empty table with one row and

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.240
one column added to it by default.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.340
Then to access that row, call the getRow method on the table

9
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.040
like this, passing in 0 as the row index.

10
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.310
After that,

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.420
you can access the default added cell in that row by calling

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.440
getCell method on the row, passing in index 0.

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.110
You can call the setText method and set the content

14
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.540
to be displayed inside the cell.

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.190
Let's continue to add the rest of the rows and cells as well.

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.030
To add another cell in the first row, write this line of code,

17
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.510
calling addNewTableCell method.

18
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.540
This code adds more cells to the row.

19
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.830
We need to add four columns to the table.

20
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.630
Next,

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.390
we need to create the productDetails rows. For that, look through

22
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.680
the QuoteItems list that's passed into the method. Inside the for

23
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.800
loop, for each QuoteItem, create a new row in the table now by

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.640
calling the createRow method.

25
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.890
Remember,

26
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.420
the createRow method creates a new row with as many cells as the

27
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.150
already defined number of columns, which, in this case, is 4. Then

28
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.660
get the first cell in the row like this and set text to it. Do the

29
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.450
same for the rest of the columns.

30
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.140
In the third column, we display the price.

31
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.680
The price will need to be formatted using a number format, so you

32
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.540
can simply create a number format like this,

33
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.440
passing the Locale as en US as we need to show the dollar symbol.

34
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.210
Then, in the fourth column,

35
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.680
lineTotals will be calculated and displayed, applying the same number

36
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:44.740
format. Then outside the loop, create more rows using the createRow method

37
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.120
to display the Sub Total, Tax, and Total. Access those cells by calling the

38
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.040
getCell method and set values to them.

39
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.340
Notice that we are displaying the value in the fourth

40
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.700
column in the table and the label Sub Total, Tax, and Total

41
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.260
in the third column in the table.

42
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.860
The subTotal value should be calculated inside the for

43
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.820
loop. And using the number format, format the value and display it in the cell.

44
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.010
Apply the number format to taxValCell as well.

45
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.320
Compute the total, and apply the number format to it as

46
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.740
well when displaying it in the cell.

47
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.270
Now, at this point,

48
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.530
if you want to see how the document looks like, call the

49
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.240
addProductDetails method inside the generateQuotation method.

50
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.040
Save and run.

51
00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:04.000
You should now see a table added to the document like this; however, the table and its cell content isn't fully formatted.
