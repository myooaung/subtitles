1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,740
Once again, we've come to an end of another module,

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,040
so it's worth noting some key takeaways.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,330
Remember to use the addTab method of XWPFRun class to add tab

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,930
space inside a text run or a range of text.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,440
Then use the addBreak method of the same class to add an explicit

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
line break in the text run whenever you want.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,540
When you call the createTable method on the document,

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:40,140
it creates an empty table with one row and one column added to it by default.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,170
CreateRow method adds a new row to a table with as many cells

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,940
as the number of existing columns in it.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,860
Also keep in mind that the setWidth method of XWPFTable and

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,060
XWPFTableCell accepts width as 20ths of a point,

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,080
so you need to pass in a value that complies with the fact that

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,240
one typographical point is equal to 1440 inches.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,020
Retrieve and use the default paragraph in the table cell using the

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,510
getParagraphArray method when you want to format cell content.

17
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,710
To wrap things up in this module,

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,390
you learned how to work with an MS Word document using the

19
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,760
Apache POI API by creating a blank document and adding

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,340
paragraphs of content to it, adding formatting to paragraph content,

21
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,870
adding an image, a table, and formatting table cell content,

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,770
and last but not least, extract text, table data,

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,440
and image content from a Word document.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,220
As always, don't forget to pay attention to the key takeaways.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,010
We've almost reached the end of the journey with the Apache POI API by

26
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:14,000
creating and modifying an MS Word document in this module, and we have the final module of the course next.
