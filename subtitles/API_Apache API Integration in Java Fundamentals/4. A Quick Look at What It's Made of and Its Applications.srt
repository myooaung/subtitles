1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,080
Now let's take a quick look at the main components and some applications of.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,120
PDFBox.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,400
The library has four main components.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:21,510
PDFBox, FontBox, XmpBox, and Preflight. PDFBox is a library that contains

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,640
classes and interfaces related to content creation,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,240
extraction, and manipulation.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,340
FontBox consists of classes and interfaces that handle fonts.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,450
XmpBox has the required classes and interfaces for handling document

9
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,420
metadata using the Extensible Metadata Platform, or XMP,

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,340
which is an ISO standard for working with metadata in digital documents.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,660
Preflight is the part of the API that has classes and

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,810
interfaces to verify a PDF file to see if it complies with

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,040
the ISO 19005 PDF/A‑1 standard.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,800
What are the applications of Apache PDFBox? There are two

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,940
Apache projects that use the PDFBox library.

16
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,240
One is Apache Tika.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,380
It is a generic library that has been developed to detect document

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,190
types and to extract content from various file formats.

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:35,010
The Tika project in fact uses both Apache PDFBox and POI libraries.

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,840
The next one is a Apache Nutch.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,000
This is an open‑source web search or crawl application written in Java that uses Apache PDFBox.
