1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,740
Let's go ahead and create hyperlinks for the web and email addresses.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,030
First, add the last slide to the presentation. Then, add hyperlinks

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,940
for web address and the email address.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:24,360
Back in the code, go to the generateProductPresentation method, and here, go

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,640
ahead and create another slide using the same titleLayout.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,540
This is going to be the last slide in the presentation.

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,540
This slide will have two text boxes.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:46,900
Let's get the first one, and set the text, THANK YOU! on it.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,340
Then, get hold of the next text box,

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,080
set the company name like this on it, and below it, to display the

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,740
contact number, add a new paragraph and a text run.

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:19,640
Let's set the font size to be 14, and set the text like this.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,740
Add another paragraph and a text run on it,

14
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:34,840
set its font size also to be 14, and set this text.

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,420
Now to make the email a hyperlink,

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:46,440
create a hyperlink on the run by calling createHyperlink method.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,520
It will return a XSLF hyperlink object. Set the link address

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,500
by calling the setAddress on the hyperlink object, passing in

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,640
the mailto address, like this.

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Next,

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,940
follow the same steps to make the web address a hyperlink. Create the paragraph,

22
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,340
create the run,

23
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,250
set the font size to be 14, set the text, create the

24
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,980
hyperlink, and finally, set the address.

25
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,240
That's all it takes to create hyperlinks on a slide.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:46,260
Now save and run. You can see the last slide added to the presentation with the

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:57,000
content that was created in it, and notice that the email and web addresses are formatted as hyperlinks, and they are clickable.
