00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,510
You know, every journey is backed by some story.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,440
Now here's the story for this learning journey.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,540
Here you are, newly recruited as a software developer in a software firm.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,330
You're assigned to work on a project of a new client who's a

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,840
reputed furniture and appliance store in town.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,740
They need an ERP system, and in a few modules,

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,890
there's a requirement to generate some documents.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:38,840
In the e‑commerce module, it should generate a product catalog as a PDF document.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,740
The sales module needs a quotation generator,

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,640
as both Microsoft Excel and Word documents as required.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,120
The marketing module should generate Microsoft PowerPoint slides for

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,940
product presentations for managers to be used at meetings.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,370
Now, your task is to generate these documents using Apache APIs.

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:11,740
The head of technology has decided to use Apache PDFBox and POI libraries.

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,040
You've worked on many Java projects before,

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,760
but the problem is you have no prior experience using

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,540
these libraries in a Java project.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,720
So you're wondering how to get hands‑on quickly with these APIs and be able

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,250
to show your colors as a new recruit. To get hands‑on with Apache PDFBox and

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,140
POI libraries, you need these as prerequisites.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,140
You will need to know fundamentals of the Java language,

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,010
basic knowledge of Apache Maven, and the ability to work with an IDE. I'd

23
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,500
recommend you have these tools in place too, so that you can easily follow

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,120
along with this course, Java Standard Edition 11, or it could be a higher

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,540
version than that, Apache Maven 3.6.3,

26
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:24,000
which is the latest at the time of recording this course, and IntelliJ IDEA Community edition, preferably Version 2020.1.
