00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.440
Next is to hide a row in the quotation document.

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.250
We are going to add an extra piece of information, delivery

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.450
information, but we want to display it only for domestic

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.040
quotations, and hide it for nonâ€‘domestic quotations.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.660
You can do this by calling the setZeroHeight method on the

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.200
required row, passing in a value of true.

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.740
The delivery information will be displayed on row 17, like this,

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.970
but when it's hidden, it will look like this. Back in the code, copy

9
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.540
and paste the addInfo method from exercise files.

10
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.900
This will add the delivery information to the quotation.

11
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.540
Now depending on the value of isDomestic flag,

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.940
you can call the setZeroHeight method on the infoRo like this,

13
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.680
and pass in false or true, as required to show or hide the row. Call the

14
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.630
method inside generate quotation method, and as you can see, we have

15
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
passed false to isDomestic in the main class.

16
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.740
So when you run this, you can see that the delivery details row is hidden,

17
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640
which is row 17.

18
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.000
You can change the method parameter in the main class to true, and see what happens as well.
