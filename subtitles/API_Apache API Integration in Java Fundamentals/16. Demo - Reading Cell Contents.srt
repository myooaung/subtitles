00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,540
In this final demo of the module,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,440
we are going to see how to read the data in a few

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,340
cells of the quotation document.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,040
You will retrieve the quotation date, extract the logo image,

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,640
and read the web link.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,340
Let's take a quick look at what it takes to read cell data.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,040
Open InputStream to Excel file, create a workbook,

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,550
get the sheet that you want to extract data from,

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,850
get the required row object, get the required cell object,

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,500
and finally,

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,180
you can read the cell values. To read image data, the

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,440
first two steps would be the same.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,590
Then get all the pictures in the workbook. Then retrieve the

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,800
picture from the list of pictures, if it's just one picture. In

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,140
case of multiple pictures in the workbook,

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:12,140
you will need to traverse through the list of pictures and get the required one.

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,560
Next, read picture data into a byte array, and finally,

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,240
write the data to the OutputStream.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,340
Reading hyperlinks is easy.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,830
Simply follow the first five steps that you saw earlier used to

21
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,860
read data from any cell, and then, read the hyperlink of the cell

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,840
by calling cell.getHyperlink method.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,110
Now to demonstrate this, back in the code, add this method,

24
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,740
readQuoteDate. As the first step, open a file InputStream on the

25
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:04,060
Excel file, like this. Then create the workbook by calling

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:13,940
WorkbookFactory.create, passing in the InputStream.

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,440
Get the first sheet of the workbook.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:27,500
The quotation date is in row index 6, and cell index 10.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,620
Then you can retrieve the cell value as a date

30
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,440
value or string value, as required.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,740
Let's get it as a date value and print it to the console.

32
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:51,710
Run the application, you should see the date printed like this. Now to

33
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:58,540
read the logo image, add this method, readLogoImage.

34
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,140
The first two steps are the same.

35
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,940
Then get all pictures in the workbook.

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,040
It will be returned as a list.

37
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Since the list has exactly one element, you can simply get it like this.

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,100
Read the picture data into a byte array. Finally, create an

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,630
OutputStream to write it into the file system, and write

40
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,740
the image data to the stream.

41
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,240
In case if there are multiple images in the workbook,

42
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
the list will have multiple elements,

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,450
in which case, you will have to traverse through them, and

44
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,640
retrieve the image that you are looking for.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,740
You can filter them by the file extension, mime type, or the picture type.

46
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,540
Now save and run.

47
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,360
You can see under resources, images folder, the logo

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,840
image with the given file name, created.

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,140
This is the image that was extracted from the quotation Excel document.

50
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,280
Finally,

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,240
to read the web address hyperlink, add this method. Then inside,

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,160
add the code for the basic steps, and then read the hyperlink of

53
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,340
the cell by calling getHyperlink method.

54
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,760
A hyperlink object will be returned, and you can print out its address like

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:15,000
this to the console by calling the getAddress method. When you run it, you can see the web address printed in the console, like this.
