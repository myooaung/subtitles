1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,100
Now using the API classes and methods that you just saw, let's set the

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,740
layout of the title slide of the product presentation.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,960
You'll use the SlideLayout.TITLE enum constant to retrieve the layout

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,930
that we want. And then set the title and subtitle text to the slide.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,870
Back in the code, in the generateProductPresentation method, call the

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:34,050
getSlideMasters method on the PowerPoint presentation and retrieve the

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,540
first element of the list,

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,530
which is the default slide master. It will return a XSLFSlideMaster object

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:52,930
like this. Now for the default slide master, call the getLayout method,

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:00,500
passing in the enum constant, $lideLayout.TITLE.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,540
This is going to return the title layout for you. In the

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,150
SlideLayout enum, you can find a number of different slide layouts

13
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,360
that can be used when creating your slides as required. But here,

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,740
we are using the title $lideLayout.

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,900
The next step is to create the slide, passing in that layout.

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,140
It creates a slide that has a titleLayout.

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,840
Now this slide will have a title and a subtitle in it.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,530
So to access the title, call the getPlaceholder method on the

19
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:46,140
slide object, firstSlide, passing in idx: 0.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,240
This returns a XSLFTextShape object, which represents the title.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,640
Then you can call it setText method like this and set the title text.

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,060
Similarly, you can call the getPlaceholder method once again on this slide,

23
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,000
passing in idx: 1 to retrieve the subtitle. And then set

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,340
the subtitle text to be displayed on it.

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,500
Now save and run the application once again. You can see

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:35,000
that the first slide now has the title layout with the title and a subtitle set to it.
