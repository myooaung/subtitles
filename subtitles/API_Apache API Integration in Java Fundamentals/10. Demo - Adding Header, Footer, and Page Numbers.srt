1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,730
Next up is adding a header, footer, and page numbers to the quotation,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,340
using the Header, Footer, and HeaderFooter classes.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,980
It should be noted that the header and footer will

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,940
appear in the Print view like this, and when the document is printed.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,570
To add a header and footer to the quotation,

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,500
in the generateQuotation method, create a header object like this.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:41,140
You can set what needs to be displayed on the left‑hand side of the header,

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,200
and the right‑hand side of the header.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,240
Similarly, create a quota object.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,800
Set text to be displayed in the center this time,

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,040
and let's display the page numbers on the right‑hand side.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:11,240
As you can see, we use the Header/Footer class to retrieve the current page,

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,140
and the number of pages.

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:23,100
Now, if you run, open the quotation Excel sheet,

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:34,000
and go to the Print view, you can see the header, footer, and page numbers applied.
