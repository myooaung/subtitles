Hello.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.640
You have reached the end of the course, Apache API Integration in Java.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.340
In this last module,

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.160
you're going to see how to work with the Microsoft PowerPoint document using

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.990
the Apache POI API. If you take a quick look at the journey you've come so far,

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.240
if you've followed this course from the beginning,

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.070
you've completed the path to learning Apache PDFBox API integration

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.870
Java, and completed all the steps, but the last in the path to learning

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.930
Apache POI API integration in Java. Let me take you through what you

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.740
will be covering in this module.

11
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.530
You will see how to create a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation using the Apache

12
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.340
POI API in your Java application, and add some slides to it.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.410
Then go ahead and use different slide layouts as

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.440
appropriate for the presentation.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.820
Start adding some basic content to the slides like texts and images.

16
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.740
Add some basic formatting to the slide content,

17
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580
like setting font type, color,

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.640
size, and style, and drawing outlines around images.

19
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.800
Add hyperlinks on a slide, and finally, to read and do modifications to

20
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.390
the already created presentation by reordering and deleting slides. In the

21
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.640
application that we have been building for the furniture store scenario

22
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.330
throughout this course, to create different types of documents, now we

23
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.220
need to generate a product presentation to be used by the marketing module

24
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.840
of the ERP system.

25
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.500
Here are a few slides from the presentation that you will

26
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.340
have created by the end of this module.

27
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.930
A title slide that looks like this, section header slide that looks like

28
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:20.000
this, there'll be many of them, and product slides. Once again, many slides like this, and finally, an ending slide.
