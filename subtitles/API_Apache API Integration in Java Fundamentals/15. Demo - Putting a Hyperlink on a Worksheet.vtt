00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.240
Now let's create a few hyperlinks on the quotation document.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.100
Let's format the web and email addresses to be hyperlinks.

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.860
To create hyperlinks,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.640
you can use the hyperlink class. To obtain a hyperlink object,

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.440
call the CreationHelper's createHyperlink method.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.400
You should pass in a HyperlinkType to obtain the required type of hyperlink.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.840
Then you can set the address, create a style for the hyperlink,

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.240
then add the CellStyle and the hyperlink to the required cells.

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.490
Let's make the company web address and email addresses hyperlinks. So in the

10
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.940
addCompanyDetails method, let's create a cells tile for this hyperlink.

11
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.990
There are new font for the hyperlinks, set the fonts underline style and

12
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.640
color, and then set the font to the style.

13
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.940
Now you can use this style to format your hyperlink cells.

14
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.440
You can then get the web address cell, like this.

15
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:34.640
Create a hyperlink object. We want it to be a URL type link,

16
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
then set the address.

17
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.140
Let's just link it to the Apache POI website.

18
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.780
Then apply the hyperlink to the cell, and style the cell

19
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.750
with the hLink_style that you created. This code formats

20
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.540
the email cell as a hyperlink.

21
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.750
So notice the hyperlink type.

22
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.640
It's email and the link address is set to a mailto value, like this.

23
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.370
The hyperlink is set to the cell, and the same hLink_ style can be applied

24
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.140
to this cell as well. Run the application once again,

25
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:34.000
you can see the hyperlinks created on the two cells. When you click on them, they should work accordingly.
