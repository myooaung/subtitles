1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,590
In this demo, you'll remove the last slide of the product

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,310
presentation. For that, first, load the existing presentation,

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,880
and then remove the last slide of it, and finally,

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,270
save the changes. Back in the code, once again,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,740
go to the removeLastSlide method.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,840
Follow the steps that you just saw.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,350
First,

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:35,740
create a FileInpuStream to the product presentation file.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,640
Then create a new XMSSlideShow object, passing it as usual.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Then call the removeSlide method on the ppt.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,390
Now, since we want to remove the last slide of the presentation,

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,640
let's say ppt.getSlides,

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,940
which gives the list of slides. Then call size to get the number of slides

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:15,340
and â€‘1 to compute the slide index of the last slide.

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,170
Open a FileOutputStream to the file. Write the changes made to the

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,230
PowerPoint to the OutputStream for it to be saved. Now, call this method

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:46,000
in the main class, save and run the application. You can see that the last slide of the presentation is now not there.
