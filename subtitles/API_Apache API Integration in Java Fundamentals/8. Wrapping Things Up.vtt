00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.390
As we've come to an end of another module, let's look back at the key takeaways.

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.210
The main API features for creating and adding basic content

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.780
to a PDF document are located in org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.300
package in the PDFBox API.

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.940
The key classes are PDDocument, PDPage, and PDPageContentStream.

6
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.170
When adding content to your PDF document,

7
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.440
you should have a clear understanding of the PDF coordinate system.

8
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.370
Whenever you want to add new text to the content stream,

9
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.670
you should position it correctly using the newLlineAtOffset

10
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.740
method giving the precise X and Y coordinates.

11
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.140
And remember,

12
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.880
you should set AppendMode to append in the content stream if

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.240
you're adding text to your document continuously.

14
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.840
If not, text added later overrides what was there before.

15
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.040
Finally about coloring,

16
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.880
set the stroking color if you want to specify the outline color and

17
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.770
nonâ€‘stroking color if you want to specify the fill color.

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340
In this module,

19
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.980
you learned about the basic API features to get started with creating

20
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.700
and adding content to a PDF document in PDFBox.

21
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.250
In addition, you learned about the PDF coordinate system,

22
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.300
which is important when it comes to adding content in the PDF document.

23
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.970
You put all of them to practice by building the product catalog

24
00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:02.000
PDF document for the furniture store ERP system. And don't forget the key takeaways.
