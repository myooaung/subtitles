1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,080
Let's get started. You are going to create the product

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,840
presentation as a Microsoft PowerPoint document.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,750
First,

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,170
by creating just a blank presentation and then

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,840
adding the very first slide to it.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,140
You can follow along coding as you did in the previous modules.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,970
I've opened up the Maven Java project that we've been

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,240
working on throughout this course.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,000
You can get the project from the exercise files of this module

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,240
and set it up in your development environment.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
When you open it up, on the ID,

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,370
you will find this class, ProductPresentation, already

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,310
created with some unimplemented methods, which we'll be

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,440
implementing along this module.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,230
So as the first step, to create a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation,

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:07,930
instantiate the XMLSlideShow class like this. This class resides in

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:16,920
the org.apache.poi.xslf package. That consists of all the API features

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,430
required for working with .pptx PowerPoint files. Then open up

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,670
FileOutputStream, passing in the path where the files should be saved

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,340
in the file system.

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,690
Ensure that the FileOutputStream is closed after use by

22
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,540
surrounding it in try with resources.

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,560
Now you can go ahead and add a slide to it by calling the

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,000
createSlide method on the PowerPoint presentation object, ppt.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,240
It will return a XSLFSlide type object.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,840
This represents a slide in the PowerPoint presentation.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,910
Finally,

28
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,800
you can write the PowerPoint presentation to the output stream

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,210
like this for it to be saved in the file system. Then in the

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,440
main class, add these lines of code.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,590
This line of code is to load product data that should be passed

32
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:33,780
to the generateProductPresentation method here. You'll be using

33
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,340
that data in the upcoming clips.

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,240
So here, as you can see,

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,970
the generateProductPresentation method is called. Now save and run

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:53,380
the application. And you can see that a file with the .pptx extension

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,240
is created under the resources folder.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:12,000
If you open the file, you can see that it has one blank slide added to it. In the next clip, you will see how to set the slide with a title layout.
