00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.350
Now we are going to look at how to remove an extra blank page

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.210
that was added to the product catalog PDF.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.720
For this,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.450
you will be using the removePage method of the

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.040
PDDocument class. Back to the code editor.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.140
I've already added a method with the code to load the PDF document here.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
So if we look at the product catalog PDF,

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.740
you can see that there are two pages in it.

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.240
And the last page is a blank page.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.040
Now, if we want to get rid of this, how can we do that?

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.120
You can simply call the removePage method on the

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.930
document catalog. And to this method,

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.040
you should pass in the page number that you want removed.

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.930
Once again, the numbers are 0â€‘based,

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.140
meaning the first page will have a number of 0.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.990
In our case,

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.080
we need to pass in 1, which will remove the second page. Print out that the

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.840
page removal was successful, and save the document once again.

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.310
Now,

20
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.300
if you call this method and run the application and inspect the product catalog,

21
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.340
you can see that the blank page is now gone. Excellent.

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.340
You can see how simple it is to remove a page from a PDF document.

23
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.140
But wait, did something go wrong?

24
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.280
Did you forget to save the document after loading and

25
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.250
adding a new page to it and after loading and removing a

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.540
page? Let's go back to the code.

27
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.160
What if you didn't call the save method here after

28
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.840
loading and adding a new page?

29
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.340
Well, that new page will never get added.

30
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.530
So let's try commenting the save and run it.

31
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.940
As you can see, the page that we added is not there.

32
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.910
Also,

33
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.700
when removing a page, if you forgot to call save what

34
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.840
would happen? Let's see what happens.

35
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340
You can see that the PDF currently has two pages in it.

36
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.350
If you do not call save and run the application, now you can see

37
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.240
that still the blank page at the end is there.

38
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.340
The reason is that you simply forgot to save after

39
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:47.000
removing the page. So make sure you save the PDF document after doing any modification to it.
