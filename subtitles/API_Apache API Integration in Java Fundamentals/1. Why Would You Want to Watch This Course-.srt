00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,740
Hello, I'm Buddhini Samarakkody,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,540
and I'll be your guide for this course on Apache API

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,940
Integration in Java Fundamentals.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,840
Generating documents from your Java application can be really interesting,

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,130
but of course,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:25,140
if you know what APIs are there to help you and how to work with them.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,340
Welcome, and thanks for choosing to take this course,

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,450
where you'll learn how to use Apache APIs to generate PDF and

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,840
Microsoft documents in a Java application.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,200
First things first,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,220
let's take a glance at what you're about to experience in

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,120
this module and the course as a whole.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,040
Pause for a moment.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,440
I know what's on your mind right now.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,940
You're probably thinking,

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,340
why would I want to watch this course? What's in it for me?

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,840
I get it.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,540
You need the motivation to go ahead with this course,

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,840
and this module will do just that.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Then what can you expect in this course?

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,340
You'll soon see what the agenda of this course looks like.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,940
Then the next question, how will you learn them?

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,040
Well, I'll tell you the story on which this course is based upon,

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,480
the prerequisites,

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,510
and about the software tools you'll need to have in place

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,790
to follow this course successfully.

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,580
Last but not least,

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,040
I'll show you how to get yourself started without wasting much time.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,140
Generating documents is a pretty common requirement in any Java application.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,100
You've probably come across that requirement right now,

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,110
and that could be the reason why you're here watching

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,940
this course in the first place.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,420
The common document formats you'll need to generate from

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,430
your application are PDFs and the Microsoft Office

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,920
documents like Excel spreadsheets, Word documents,

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,230
and PowerPoint slides.

37
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,760
In a Java application,

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,240
we are specifically talking about standalone and web applications here.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,000
PDFs can be generated using the iText library or the PDFBox library.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,410
Microsoft Office documents can be created using the POI library.

41
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,180
PDFBox and POI are PO Java,

42
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,140
and open source APIs from the Apache Software Foundation.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,940
Both APIs are extremely popular among Java developers

44
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:59,000
are used in enterprise applications. I'd say this is exactly why you should be learning how to work with these APIs.
