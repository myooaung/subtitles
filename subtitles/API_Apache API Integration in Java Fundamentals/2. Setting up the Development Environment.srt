00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,310
First, looking at the dependencies of the Apache POI API.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,590
As you saw in the module outlining the essentials of Apache POI library,

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,740
it is made up of many components.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,350
So what are the components?

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,970
POIFS is the fundamental component, and there are a set of components like HSSF,

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:37,370
HWPF, and HSLF used for working with OLE file format‑compliant Excel,

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,150
Word, and PowerPoint documents, and components like XSSF,

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:54,160
XWPF, and XSLF used for working with OOXML file format‑compliant Excel,

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,340
Word, and PowerPoint documents.

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,680
Talking about the dependency JARs pertaining to these components,

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,140
POIFS and HSSF components come with the POI JAR.

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,140
You will need to get the latest version of it available to your project.

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,100
Having these two components will enable you to work with Microsoft

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,770
Excel documents compliant with the OLE file format,

15
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,520
in other words, files with the extension XLS.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,240
If you want to work with Word and PowerPoint,

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,740
you need the HWPF and HSLF components, respectively,

18
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,930
and they come with the poi‑scratchpad.jar file.

19
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,440
To work with OOXML file format‑compliant Office documents,

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,780
you need the XSSF, XWPF,

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:02,020
and XSLF components that come along with the POI OOXML dependency JAR file.

22
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,410
On an additional note, along with the POI OOXML JAR file,

23
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:16,740
there will be the poi‑ooxml‑schemas JAR and the XMLBeans JAR available.

24
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,960
They are required when working with OOXML‑based

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,290
Office documents with extensions XLSX, DOCX,

26
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,120
and PPTX.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,050
As additional JARs that come along with the POI JAR and poi‑ooxml JAR,

28
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,230
you will get the commons‑loggins, commons‑codec,

29
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,640
commons‑collections, commons‑math, and the SparseBitSet.jar.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,230
If you download Apache POI, you will get them along with the package.

31
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,840
And if you use Maven, you'll get them as transitive dependencies.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,940
There are two ways in which you can set up Apache

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,840
POI with your Java application.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,210
One way is to set up the JARs manually by downloading and setting

35
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,260
them up as external libraries to your Java project.

36
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,140
The other way is to use the pom.xml.

37
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,800
If you are using Maven,

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,740
you can specify Maven dependencies in the pom.xml of your Maven Java project.

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,360
So if you are manually setting up your JARs by downloading them,

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,140
you will need to include these JARs, POI JAR,

41
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:43,540
poi‑ooxml JAR, poi‑ooxml‑schemas JAR, and the XMLBeans JAR.

42
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:51,960
This will enable you to work with both OLE and OOXML‑compliant MS Office files.

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,690
If you are using Maven and if you want to work with older

44
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,670
file formats of Microsoft Office like XLS,

45
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,800
DOC, and PPT, you can simply include the POI dependency in the pom.xml,

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,430
like this, and it will provide the components POIFS and HSSF,

47
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,540
along with the other basic components required.

48
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,940
If you want to work with Word and PowerPoint,

49
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,100
you'll also need to include the poi‑scratchpad dependency,

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,140
along with this dependency.

51
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,050
If you include the poi‑ooxml dependency,

52
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,510
it will provide all the XML‑compliant components like XSSF,

53
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:48,840
XWPF, and XSLF, and all the other basic components that come with the POI JAR.

54
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:59,000
So simply, if you include this dependency in your pom.xml, you will be able to work with any file format.
