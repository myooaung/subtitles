1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,300
Here's the roadmap to your learning journey.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,410
In the first part of this course,

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,980
you'll learn how to integrate the Apache PDFBox API to your Java application.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,790
As the first step, you'll configure the API in a Java project.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:23,240
Then go ahead and create your very first PDF document.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,040
Go a few more steps ahead and modify the PDF document that you created.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,340
And finally, you'll spend some time looking at some advanced features of the API.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,370
Hope the journey's quite interesting so far.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,740
The second half of the course is dedicated to the Apache POI API.

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,700
Your starting point will be to configure the API,

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,130
and thereafter you'll go straight ahead to work with Microsoft

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,970
Office documents by creating and modifying Excel,

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,240
Word, and PowerPoint documents.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,220
By the end of this course,

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:10,640
you'll have mastered Apache PDFBox and POI API integrations in Java.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,540
Now, let's take a look at the agenda of the first part of the course.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,040
First up is Apache PDFBox.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,700
You will outline the essentials of the Apache PDFBox library in

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,440
terms of what it offers you, its components, and common

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,750
applications. Configure the development environment to be able

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,240
to use it in a Java application.

22
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,390
Thereafter,

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,140
you will create your very first PDF document and start adding content to it.

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,360
Then you'll see how to modify and already create a PDF by loading,

25
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,340
extracting content, and removing pages from it.

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,590
Finally, you will get to explore some advanced features of PDFBox,

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,840
like using metadata properties, using different points in your documents,

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,840
splitting and merging PDFs and protecting a PDF by encrypting it.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,870
Next up in the agenda is the Apache POI. As usual,

30
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,980
first outline the essentials of the library, and then you'll go

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,800
ahead and configure the development environment by using the

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,740
library in your Java application.

33
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Next,

34
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,350
you will work with a Microsoft Excel document and a Microsoft

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:47,000
Word document and a PowerPoint document, respectively, by creating, adding formatting to them, and modifying them.
