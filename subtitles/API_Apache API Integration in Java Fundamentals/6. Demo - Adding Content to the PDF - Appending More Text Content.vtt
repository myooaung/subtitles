00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.240
Now it's time to add the product name and the product features.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
First, the product name.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.840
We need to begin a new block of content in the content stream.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.810
So let's add content.beginText and endText, and

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.940
within it, start adding the content.

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.230
But there is something that we need to do before that. We are going

7
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.840
to append more content to the content stream.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
So we should set the AppendMode in the content stream.

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.300
Go back to where you created the content stream and pass

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:54.140
PDPageContentStream.AppendMode.APPEND and false for compress,

11
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.240
as we do not want to compress the page content.

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.070
Then we want the font of the product name to be of size 14, but let's keep the

13
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:17.140
font type the same. So give PDType1Font.HELVETICA and 14.

14
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.840
Now we need to set the font color of the product name to blue.

15
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.140
So how can we do that?

16
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.700
The way to do that is to set the non‑stroking color

17
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.940
of the content stream to blue.

18
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.740
So let's call content.setNonStrokingColor and pass in

19
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.540
Color.BLUE. Then we need to position the product name.

20
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.840
The name should appear somewhere here.

21
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.940
That would be around 300 PDF units along the X‑axis,

22
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.140
which would be 50 units from the origin to the starting point of the image,

23
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.950
plus the image with 144 units and a few more units. And 725 units along the

24
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.040
Y‑axis, that is 525 units from the origin to the starting point of the image

25
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.840
plus image height of 144 units and a few more units.

26
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.540
This would be the approximate location where we'd be writing the product name.

27
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.130
So back in our code,

28
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:41.830
let's give 300 for X and 725 for Y. Set the product name to the content stream

29
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.540
by calling content.showText and then give the product name.

30
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.640
Now you should repeat these for the rest of the products.

31
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.940
So can you guess what should be done in terms of positioning,

32
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.340
precisely the Y coordinate? Well, as before,

33
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.340
it should reduce itself moving down the page.

34
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.540
So let's make the Y coordinate a variable named nameY and change it here

35
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:27.440
and also reduce its value as nameY = nameY ‑ prodImage.getHeight. Below

36
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.740
the product name, we should show its features.

37
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.340
So call the newLine method.

38
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.240
This moves to the start of the next line of text.

39
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.340
Now the color of the text should be black.

40
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.210
So once again, set the non‑stroking color of the content stream to

41
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.530
Color.BLACK. The product features are in a list, so let's iterate

42
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.840
through them and display them line by line,

43
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.940
one below the other.

44
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.240
So we need to set content.setLeading up here.

45
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.810
This specifies how much to move down to the next new line.

46
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:22.940
Let's give 14.5. Write this for loop, and inside

47
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.240
content.showText(feature) and move to the start of the next line.

48
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:44.000
The endText here will mark the end of the content. Now save and run, and you'll see the result, like this.
