00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.610
Now, it's time to configure your development environment to be able

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:12.340
to use Apache POI with your Java application. Looking back at the

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.470
journey you've come so far in this course and where you are now, in

4
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.440
the first part of the course,

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.200
you learned how to integrate the Apache PDFBox API with the Java application.

6
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.870
The next stop of the journey is for learning the Apache POI API. What are

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.260
the dependencies required for using the Apache POI API in your Java

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.700
application. Well, you will see what they are in this module, and also,

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.740
the two ways in which you can configure Apache POI in a Java application,

10
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.330
which is downloading and setting up the JAR files and configuring using

11
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.240
the Maven pom.xml.

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.060
You will see it in action in the configuration demo, and I'd

13
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:16.000
request you to follow along by downloading and working on the sample project in exercise files of the module.
