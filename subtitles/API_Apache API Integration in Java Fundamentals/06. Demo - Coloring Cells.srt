1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,240
Now it's time to see how to color the cells.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,590
Talking about coloring the cell background,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,940
there are two methods: setFillForegroundColor,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,340
and setFillBackgroundColor.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,910
It should be noted that both these methods are used to

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,140
fill the cell background with a color, despite their names.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,150
To these methods,

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,720
you need to pass in the XSSFColor object or an indexed color value,

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,340
as short.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,680
Remember that you also need to call the setFillPattern method,

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,940
passing in the FillPatternType to it in order for this to work.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,740
Let's color the tax cell in the quotation.

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,840
You can fill the cell with a pattern, or do a solid fill.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,940
However, it is important to note that if you need to do a solid fill,

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,100
you must call the setFiillForegroundColor method, and set

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,940
the fill pattern as solid foreground.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,200
Go ahead and create a new style object, and call the

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,640
setFillForegroundColor method on it.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,690
Let's pass in the IndexedColors. So for that, you should use the

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,670
IndexedColors enum. In it, you can see the available color

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:35,940
constants. So you can see IndexedColors, and select the color

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,540
you want, and get its index.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,770
After that,

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,670
you will need to specify the fill pattern, so call the

25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:52,180
setFillPattern method, and this method accepts a

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,540
FillPatternType, which once again, is an enum.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,440
We need to pass in the constant, SOLID_FOREGROUND,

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,540
since we want a solid fill here,

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,640
and that's all it takes to color a cell using a different color.

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,670
You can pass in different pattern types as required. That can be found in the

31
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,390
FillPatternType enum, and also, you can use the setFillBackgroundColor method

32
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,440
instead of the setFillForegroundColor method as well.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,540
But if you want a solid fill, be sure to call the setFillForegroundColor method.

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,540
Now you might find this a bit awkward,

35
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,740
but that's how the API works at the time of recording the course.

36
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,740
Things could, however, change with future releases of the API.

37
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,840
You can play around with other patterns and colors as you wish.

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,140
Oh, and before you run it,

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,540
set the data format of this cell also to the same numeric

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:19,000
format that we used before. Now run it, and you can see that the tax cell is now colored in aqua.
