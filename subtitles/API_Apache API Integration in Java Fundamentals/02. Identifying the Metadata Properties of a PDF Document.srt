00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,340
First, let's have a look at metadata properties of a PDF document.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,180
What is metadata? Metadata is data that describes other

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,300
data. In document management, maintaining metadata on

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,140
documents is an important thing.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,360
Metadata describes certain facts about a document. For a PDF document,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,980
metadata like title, author, created date, modified date, producer,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,430
subject, and a set of keywords can be maintained, and those are

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,970
contained in the document as properties. To handle metadata of a PDF

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,240
document in PDFBox, there are a few mechanisms like using the

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:57,450
XMPMetadata class, using an XML file to store the XMP metadata. It

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,700
should be stated that XMP, which stands for Extensible Metadata Platform,

12
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,880
is an ISO standard for creating,

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,940
processing, and interchanging of metadata for digital documents.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,890
PDF files used this standard for storing metadata.

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,280
Then, using the PDDocumentInformation class is another convenient

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,240
way to work with metadata in PDF documents.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,300
Talking about using these API features in an application, to use the

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,140
XMPMetadata class, the xmpbox dependency is required,

19
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,440
meaning you should include the XmpBox JAR file in your project.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,540
However,

21
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,450
to use the PDDocumentInformation class, you do not need any additional

22
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,540
dependency, and it is available with the pdfbox dependency itself.

23
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,660
PDDocumentInformation class makes things simple by providing property

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,640
getters and setters to work with the metadata properties.

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,440
When setting metadata properties using the XMPMetadata class,

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,310
they have to be set to different schemas, because these

27
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,440
properties are available in different schemas.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
For example,

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,010
you can set properties like Create date and Modify date to the

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:33,000
XMPBasicSchema, but the property keywords isn't available in the

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,700
BasicSchema, but is available in the AdobePDFSchema.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,940
Similarly,

33
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,330
the properties Title and Creator, or in other words Producer, and

34
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:52,080
Description are available in a schema named DublinCoreSchema, and not in

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,540
other schemas like the BasicSchema or the AdobePDFSchema.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,000
Therefore, you will need to set these different properties using those different schemas.
