00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:07,840
Next, we are going to look at how to merge a few cells in the quotation document.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,640
Later in this module,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,810
you will place the logo image in this merged cell. In the quotation

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,860
Excel, if you want to merge the cells that belong to the 11th column,

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,540
across rows 2 to 5, so how can you do that?

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,620
You need to specify the cell range to be merged. In the sheet,

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,540
that's the method, addMergedRegion, and to this,

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,200
you need to pass the cell range address, specifying the

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,850
first row index as 2, last row index as 4, then, the first

10
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,240
and last column indexes as 10.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, if you save and run this, you will see the cells in those rows merged like this.
