00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.740
You can also set document metadata using the PDDocumentInformation class.

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.170
I've added this setDocumentInformation method and loaded the

3
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.520
product catalog document in it. Now it's just a matter of

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.220
getting the DocumentInformation object from it by calling the

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.840
getDocumentInformation method.

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.830
Now you can set the properties one by one, calling the setter

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:42.090
methods, Author, Title, Subject, and Keywords, and to set the

8
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.190
create and modified date, create a Calendar object, passing it

9
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.140
setCreationDate and the ModificationDate.

10
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.540
Let's also set some custom metadata values this time. For these,

11
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.500
there's the setCustomMetadataValue method to which you can pass in the

12
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:17.340
fieldName. Let's say we want to say the Website with a value like this

13
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.520
and Email with a value like this. Now, save the document and call the

14
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.040
method in the main class.

15
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.850
Note that I'm going to comment out the call to setXMPMetadata method that we

16
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.720
wrote earlier so that I can be sure it is the setDocumentInformation method

17
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.840
that's adding the metadata to the document this time.

18
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.310
Now run it, and you can see the properties set in the document like

19
00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.350
this. You can see the custom metadata values that you set if you check

20
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:12.000
the Custom tab here. So that's how you can work with document metadata of a PDF document in PDFBox.
