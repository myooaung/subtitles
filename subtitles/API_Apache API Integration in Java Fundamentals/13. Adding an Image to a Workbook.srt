00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,810
To add an image to an Excel workbook,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:11,000
you need to follow these steps. Provided that you already have a workbook and

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,070
a sheet added to it, first, open up an input stream to the image file, and

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,440
read the desired image data into a byte array.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
For this,

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,070
you can use the helper method, toByteArray, available in

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,740
org.apache.poi.util.IOUtils class.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,140
After that,

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,120
you should add the image to the workbook by calling the

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,660
addPicture method on the workbook,

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,080
passing in the image by data, and the type of image, for

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,710
example, Workbook.PICTURE_TYPE_JPEG.

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,640
The addPicture method returns an integer,

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,240
which is the 0‑based index of the picture, with respect to the entire workbook.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,340
This is required later for you to position the image

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,540
in the worksheet of your choice.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,640
Next, you need to create the drawing canvas that will hold the image.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,040
This is called as the Drawing Patriarch,

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,940
which is like the parent container that holds all shapes in a worksheet.

20
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,920
In this case,

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,550
the shape is the picture. To do that, call the

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:44,410
createDrawingPatriarch method on the worksheet. Thereafter, an

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,840
anchor point should be defined for the picture.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Anchor point is nothing but the row and column for the top‑left position of

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,950
the picture. You create the anchor point, or in other words,

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,480
the client anchor, with the help of a creation helper. Using the

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,050
anchor, specify the starting column where the picture is going to start

28
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,140
drawing its cell, and also the starting row,

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,640
which is the top‑left corner position of the picture.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,760
Now you can call the createPicture method on the drawing canvas, or the

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,360
patriarch, passing in the anchor point and the picture index that you

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,940
got before, when adding it to the workbook.

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,940
It returns a picture object.

34
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,560
Finally,

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,140
you can call the resize method on the picture. This authorizes the picture

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,920
relative to the top‑left position specified earlier, to adjust its size to

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:58,000
feed the available space in that area of the worksheet, so that it can correctly render on the workbook.
