Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,240
My name is Buddhini Samarakkody, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,680
Apache API Integration in Java Fundamentals.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,030
I'm a software developer, a teacher, and an independent consultant,

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,740
and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:31,470
PDFBox and POI are Apache's leading open source Java APIs for working with PDF

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,740
documents and Microsoft documents. This course is great if you are a beginner

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:46,000
who's looking to learn how to integrate Apache PDFBox and POI APIs in your Java

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,400
applications, and you'll only need to be familiar with the Java language

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,900
fundamentals. Some of the major topics that we will cover include essentials of

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,910
PDFBox and POI APIs, configure the development environment, create and modify

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:12,890
PDF and Microsoft documents, extract content from documents, and a few advanced

13
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,740
usages.

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,310
By the end of this course,

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,980
you will have the skills and knowledge of integrating Apache PDFBox and POI

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,820
APIs that are needed to work with PDF and Microsoft documents in a Java

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,720
application of any scale. Before beginning the course,

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,740
you should be familiar with Java basics.

19
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,400
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Apache PDFBox

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:57,000
and POI APIs with the Apache API Integration in Java Fundamentals course, at Pluralsight.
