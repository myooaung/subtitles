00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.900
Next up is to add images on product slides.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.840
Let's have a look at the steps involved.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.240
You will have the PowerPoint presentation created already.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.760
Add a new slide to it, open an InputStream to the required image file,

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.170
read the image data into a byte array, passing in the InputStream using

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:35.360
the toByteArray method of the IOUtils class of org.apache.poi.util

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.720
package. Then the picture byte data can be added to the PowerPoint

8
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.160
presentation by calling the addPicture method, passing in the byte data

9
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.140
and the required PictureType.

10
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.570
Next,

11
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.680
you must create the actual picture shape using the picture data

12
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.540
inside, which the picture will be displayed.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.650
Finally,

14
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.180
position the picture shape on the slide at the desired

15
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.190
location by calling the setAnchor method,

16
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.640
specifying the x and y coordinates, along with the width and the height.

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.540
Your slide should look like this when the image is added to it.

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.100
Here's what you will do. Add the product image to the slide,

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.000
position it at the desired location on the slide, draw an outline around the image to make it stand out.
