1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,640
[Autogenerated] in order to develop an AWS, we first need to create an account.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,600
If you have an existing account,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,740
just follow along to make sure all steps have been completed

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,310
navigating your browser to the console,

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,140
login page at console dot aWS dot amazon dot com.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,140
After creating your account, this is where you will also log in,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,540
click the, create a new AWS account button in the next screen.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,740
You'll enter the email address you want associated with the account,

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,240
a password and a name for the account.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,870
The following screen will be for contact information,

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,240
which will be a physical address that AWS can have on file

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,470
for you after that is the payment information where you'll

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,340
need to enter a credit card number.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,620
Most of the activities in this course will be covered under

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,050
the free tier and you can view the details of what's covered

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,040
with that by following this link.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,200
Next amazon will want to confirm your identity by sending you an sMS

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,080
with a code and to your phone number fell out the capture and then

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,540
enter the code you receive in the next screen.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,360
Then you'll need to select a support plan.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,840
So just select the free one.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,040
Once the account creation is completed, you'll be given the option to log in,

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,240
log in here with the credentials you just created.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,110
The next step to initializing your AWS account is to configure the AWS cli,

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,340
we need to first generate an access key.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,750
This will enable our AWS cli and SDK to correctly access our

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,710
account in the top right of the screen.

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,420
You should see the name that you created the AWS account with click on

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,840
this which opens a menu and select security credentials,

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,440
click on the access keys, menu option to expand that section,

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,700
it should currently be empty as this is a new account with no access keys.

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,780
So click the create new access key button which will pop

33
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,790
up the confirmation box from here.

34
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,240
You can either view the key and secret to copy or download a CSV version.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,600
This key can only be viewed or downloaded once.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
So you may want to just download the C.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,560
S.

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,770
V.

39
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,040
File.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,950
However, it's easy enough to delete a key and create a new one.

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,400
So don't feel too conflicted.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,440
If you just copy it here.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,270
Either way make sure to preserve both the key and secret so that we can

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,900
use it to configure our cli And once you're done here,

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,950
click the close button now we'll configure the AWS Cli go back

46
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,180
to your command line and enter the command.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,870
AWS configure the first prompt is for the AWS access key.

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,940
IDE This is the first string that we copied from the access key window,

49
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,440
paste or type it here.

50
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,940
Hit enter and then we'll be prompted for the AWS secret access key.

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,540
This is the second string so paste it here.

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,540
The next prompt is for your default region.

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,230
This is entirely up to you.

54
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,740
If you want to enter anything here.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,980
Next is the default output format.

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,940
You can enter something like Jason or text here.

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,240
This is how the output from AWS Cli commands will appear in your command line.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,900
Now we're all set and everything is configured

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,750
correctly for the AWS Cli and the AWS SDK.

60
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,930
We can test out a command to see if everything is wired

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,930
up correctly in the same command line, execute the command,

62
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,460
a W S E C to describe dash instances and this is going to tell you what ec,

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,140
two instances you have in your account.

64
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,360
Well, we shouldn't have any yet.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,040
So the output will be a JSON object with an empty reservations property.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
As long as you see something similar to this output,

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,540
it means that everything is configured correctly for future development.

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,170
I want to add a note here about the AWS demo resources

69
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,830
will be creating in this course.

70
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,200
AWS offers a free tier that allows you to use some resources

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,220
for a certain period of time for free, for the 1st 12 months of your account.

72
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,390
This free tier changes regularly what's offered.

73
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,780
So it's important that you take a look at the

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,750
documentation before creating resources,

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,650
if you're concerned about cost.

76
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,570
I've designed this course so that everything should be in the free tier,

77
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,990
but because you're charged based on how long you are using a resource,

78
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,420
you need to be aware of how long you're leaving those

79
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,040
demo resources running in your account.

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,850
If you left,

81
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,040
all the demo resources will create in this course running for an entire month.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,360
He would exhaust the free tier limits and incur charges to help with this.

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,480
I've added a video at the end of this course that goes through all the

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,820
resources you need to tear down from the course.

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,690
Also, if you're taking a break between watching parts of the course,

86
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:22,070
be aware that any resources that you leave running could end

87
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,720
up charging you because of the nature of A.

88
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,000
W.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,180
S.

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,370
And cloud services.

91
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,640
I can't make any guarantees about charges if you

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,000
follow the exercises in this course, but with that being said, let's get cloudy.
