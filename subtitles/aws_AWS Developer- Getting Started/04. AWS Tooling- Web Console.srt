00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,490
[Autogenerated] there are a few different ways to access AWS and in

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,540
this course we're going to work with all three.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,260
The first we'll look at is the web console.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,700
If you've already created an account with a W S,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,340
then you've already seen this console,

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,550
it's the first screen you're introduced to after logging

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,130
in and it can be a little intimidating.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,220
Although AWS has made great strides over the years to

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,070
improve the experience in their console.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,170
If you don't know what you're looking for,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,440
then you're likely to get more than a little lost.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,330
The best way to find a service to get started with

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,450
is to use the search bar here.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,660
You can also view all the services available by clicking here or here

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,870
At a current total of 174 available services in Aws.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,880
I'd suggest just sticking to the search bar.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,940
The console is where you're going to spend a lot of time

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,540
configuring and creating resources.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,040
It's a good tool and doesn't get in the way of working with a WS.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Each service has its own dashboard and configuration options.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
We won't be able to cover all of them in this course,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,830
but there is a consistent taxonomy and logic that all

23
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,640
the console dashboards follows.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,180
So moving between them and learning a new one isn't that difficult in this

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,990
course will likely be spending about half our time in the web console since

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,720
the visual representation and structure of most of the service

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,830
configuration options are best in the console.

28
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,440
I feel it's one of the best places to get your feet wet with each service.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,990
Oh, and one last thing.

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,040
Make sure you're using a modern browser to get the best

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,000
performance out of the Web console. In this course, I'll be using Firefox.
