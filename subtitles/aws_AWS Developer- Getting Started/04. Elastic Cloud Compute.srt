1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,350
[Autogenerated] elastic compute cloud or EC two is one of the longest

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:11,140
running services on AWS and it powers many of the other service innovations

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,240
that amazon has created an EC two instance is just a virtual machine

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,320
provisioned with a certain amount of CPU cores,

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,940
gigabytes of memory, storage, space and network performance.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,740
Because of this,

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,630
you can install essentially any type of operating

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,640
system or software on it that you want.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,000
Typical options are Linux or Windows keeping in mind that any operating

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,870
system that requires a license will cost more per hour.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,450
Amazon's own flavor of Linux is definitely the cheapest and

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,440
is well maintained and updated regularly.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,830
The operating system and software that is installed on an EC two instance is

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:56,020
also called an amazon machine image or am I The easiest AM eyes to install

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,830
are just Linux or Windows operating systems.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,220
But beyond that,

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,880
AMS can also be customized by you with your own software installed

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,840
or you can use images from the AWS marketplace,

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,030
some of the types of images on the AWS marketplace.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,250
Our security appliance like firewalls and anti virus software

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,280
or business intelligence applications that would consume and

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,740
analyzed data from RDS or dynamo DB.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,010
Each ec two instance has a certain group of technical specifications

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,540
and Amazon charges you based on what type of instance you're running

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,220
instances that have more CPUS or memory will cost more than those

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,350
with less if you're running an application that needs more memory

27
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,000
like a web application.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,140
For instance,

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,430
there is a family of instances called memory optimized that have a

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,640
certain ratio of CPU to memory that favors more memory.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,950
On the other hand,

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,640
the compute optimized instances have a ratio more

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,580
favorable to CPU units with these options.

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,780
You should decide what your application needs when creating

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,740
your instance and provisions accordingly.

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,840
EC two instances also require some storage for things like the

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,240
operating system and any application code you expect to upload

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,620
storage for ec two instances uses another AWS service called

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,160
elastic block store or E B S.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,570
E B S allows the storage of your EC two instance to live

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,840
independently of the instance itself.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
This means that if configured correctly,

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,960
your ebs storage volumes can be transferred between

44
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,660
different sized Ec two instances or continue to exist even

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,240
after an instance has been terminated.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,140
Now let's take a quick look at the pieces of the ec two dashboard.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,140
This section gives you a snapshot of your resources that you've

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,810
created instances are the ec two instances that you have volumes

49
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,650
are the elastic block store volumes.

50
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,030
The launch instance button is the quickest route to launching a new eC.

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,520
Two instance on the left side is the menu of ec two features and

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,500
there are even more than you can see here.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,040
So you'll need to scroll down but you can at least see the instant section.

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,630
Am I.

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,480
S for your custom amazon machine images and the elastic

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,250
block store volumes in the next clip.

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,000
We're going to start using most of the options in this dashboard, so let's get to it.
