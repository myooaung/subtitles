00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.120
[Autogenerated] now that you understand everything about dynamodb.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.250
Let's give it a try by setting up a couple of tables

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.850
to store our toppings and users, we want to make a new table.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.130
So click on the tables menu option and then click the

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.750
create table button for this first table.

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.600
We want to store the toppings that are used to make pizzas.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.340
Let's just call the table name toppings.

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.260
Now we need to define the partition key for each item.

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.350
This is sort of like a primary key in a relational database.

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.010
We'll call it I.

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.940
D.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.570
And in the drop down for the data type,

13
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.200
just leave strings selected in the table settings option.

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.240
You'll notice it lets you use defaults to create your table.

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.950
These defaults are just fine for our table and since

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.940
we can change all of these later, just leave the box checked.

17
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.140
Now click create table creating this table can take a few seconds.

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.470
So while it's creating let's go ahead and create another table for our users,

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.340
click the create table button again,

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.790
Let's name the table users and for the partition key let's name it.

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.840
username with the same data type as string.

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.940
Now you can go ahead and click create table.

23
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.000
The users table will be created now as well.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.290
And so the toppings table should be done by now so go

25
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.850
ahead and click on that and I'll show you around the

26
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.310
property section in the overview tab.

27
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.010
The general information section.

28
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.440
Just gives you some brief details about the table.

29
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.080
The items summary gives you an overview of how many

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.100
items you have in your table, like showing that we have zero items here.

31
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.500
If you click the view items button,

32
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.560
it will actually take you to a full item query tool that will

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.330
not only show you your items but also allow you to try out some

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.190
scans and queries on your tables.

35
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.640
It's pretty cool.

36
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.100
There's obviously nothing here yet but once we connect this should be

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.720
filled with toppings items Now head back to the table.

38
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.540
Unfortunately there's not a quick back button here and switch to the monitor.

39
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.600
Tab dynamodb does use CloudWatch to monitor if the throughput exceeds a

40
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.700
provision capacity sometimes to use the auto scaling rules and other times to

41
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.150
potentially throttle requests and this area will show you the usage of your

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.540
table and if there were any recent throttles,

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.630
the additional settings tab will show your current provisions

44
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.250
throughput capacity and let you modify it including the mode and

45
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.440
the auto scaling rules as you want to.

46
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.780
And there's a lot more tabs here obviously but that's

47
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.000
about it for our table configuration. In the next clip we're going to connect to these tables with our application
