Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.090
My name is Ryan Lewis, and welcome to my course AWS Developer: Getting Started.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.720
I'm a web engineer at Expedia, and I work with AWS every day.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.070
Amazon Web Services is the largest cloud provider in the

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.340
world and is estimated to generate more revenue than its

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.310
three biggest competitors combined.

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.610
With customers like Netflix, Dropbox, and Expedia,

8
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.520
this should come as no surprise.

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.750
In this course,

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.350
we are going to learn the fundamentals of developing and

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.540
deploying web applications to AWS.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.000
Some of the major topics that we will cover include deploying

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.190
scalable applications using EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk,

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.340
storing static content in S3 and edging it with CloudFront,

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.530
creating reproducible infrastructure with CloudFormation templates,

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.300
and using managed databases with RDS and DynamoDB.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.780
By the end of this course,

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.990
you'll feel comfortable developing your own applications with

19
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.740
AWS. Before beginning this course, you should be familiar

20
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.940
with how web applications work,

21
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.640
and it may help to have some experience with Node.js.

22
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:23.000
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Amazon Web Services with the AWS Developer: Getting Started course at Pluralsight.
