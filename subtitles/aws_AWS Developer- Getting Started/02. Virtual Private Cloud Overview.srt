00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,550
[Autogenerated] virtual private cloud allows developers to create a virtual

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,810
network where they can launch resources and have them logically isolated from

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,690
other V P C s and the outside world with a VPc.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,380
Your resources have private iP addresses with which

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,740
they can communicate with each other.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,960
You can control access to all of the resources inside a VPc

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,740
and route outgoing traffic as you'd like.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,970
VPC is also a free service in AWS,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,880
although you can only have a maximum of five iPcs on one account.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,010
The only charges are if you need a special VPN connection,

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,840
which we won't be doing in this course,

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,880
there are several key structures used in VPc s to configure access.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,990
So let's take a look at them.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,310
The most important and widely used tool that VPC s

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,040
introduce our security groups.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,210
A security group defines a collection of pipes that are allowed to connect to

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,340
your instance and IPs that instance is allowed to connect to.

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,850
Security groups are attached at the instance level and

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,940
can be shared among many instances.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,030
You can even set security group rules to allow access from other

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,450
security groups instead of by IP We are going to be using security

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,140
groups a lot as we start creating instances.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,240
So we'll talk more about them in the coming modules.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,170
Bp CSU's routing tables to configure routing

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,740
destinations for traffic coming out of the VPC.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,770
Each VPC has one routing table which declares attempted

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,540
destination IPs and where they should be routed to.

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,020
For instance, if you want to run all outgoing traffic through a proxy.

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,750
You can set a routing table rule to automatically send traffic to that IP This

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,650
can be a powerful tool for security as you can inspect outgoing traffic and

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,040
only white lists safe destinations for traffic.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,910
Another tool the VPC is used for networking control is

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,740
the network access control list.

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,120
Each VPC has one access control list and this acts as an IP

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,390
filtering table saying which pipes are allowed through the VPc

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,640
for both incoming and outgoing traffic.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,980
Access control lists are kind of like super powered security

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,140
groups that apply rules for the entire VPc.

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,720
I don't typically mess with network access control lists as I

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,340
much prefer the flexibility of security groups,

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,940
but they are an important aspect of a VPc configuration.

42
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,610
A VPC defines a private, logically isolated area,

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,230
for instance,

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,440
is but a sub net is where things really get interesting

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,960
instances cannot be launched into just a VPc.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,440
They must also be launched into a sub Net that is inside a VPc.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,820
A sub net is an additional isolated area that has its own cider

48
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,740
block routing table and access control list.

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,120
Sub nets enable you to create different behavior in the same VPc,

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,040
for instance,

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,870
creating a public subnets that can be accessed and have access to

52
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,940
the public internet and a private sub net that is not accessible

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,700
from the internet and must go through a nat gateway to access to

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:25,000
the outside world with sub nets. You can achieve very secure infrastructure for your instances
