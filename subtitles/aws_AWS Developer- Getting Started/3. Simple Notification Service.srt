[Autogenerated] amazon Simple notification service,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,810
also called SN S is an integral companion to CloudWatch allowing

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,700
you to easily push alerts to a group of notification endpoints The

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,140
main structure in S and S is the topic.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,150
A topic is used to create a unique amazon resource name that

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,240
can then have notifications sent to it.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,840
Once you subscribe to a topic with an email or sms number,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,710
any notification sent to that sNS topic will then be communicated to your

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,010
subscribed endpoint In this way you can easily organize notifications in a

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,450
simple and extensible way before we create our first alarm,

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,170
we should set up a notification topic and subscribe to it with the

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,580
notification type for this example will set S and s up to send us

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,950
an email topics are region specific and can only be notified by

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,930
alarms in the same region.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,500
We will be creating a billing alarm and since those are only

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,940
available in the north Virginia region,

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,100
we should switch into that region before we create our

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,910
topic in the top right of the console, click the region.

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,860
Drop down and select U.

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,200
S.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,340
East in Virginia.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,530
Once the console has refreshed,

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,840
click into the Universal search bar type SN s and then hit

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,950
enter once the results have come back with the simple

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,640
notification service option at the top,

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,140
we can use this wizard to create our topic.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,540
Since this is going to be sent to your email, let's name the topic.

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,100
Admin underscore email now click next step you can enter something for

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,140
the display name if you like but it's not required.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,140
The rest of the page are different optional configurations.

31
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,180
We don't need to change any of these.

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,720

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,200

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,810
be able to manage in points.
