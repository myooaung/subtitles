00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.260
[Autogenerated] What would A getting started?

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.450
Class B without getting your hands dirty in some code.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.700
Right, well for this course,

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.450
you'll be getting your hands dirty with code and pizza sauce metaphorically,

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.440
of course,

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.950
I've created a demo application that runs completely local in the process

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.010
of going through this course and learning AWS services.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.870
We will be deploying and extending this demo application into the cloud.

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.760
So let's get familiar with what will be working on this is Pizza Lovers,

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.140
the best social network for people who love pizza.

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.520
Users can create and share their pizza creations with

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.970
each other using this web application,

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.660
let's walk through some of the functionality to better

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.740
understand what services we want to use.

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.540
First we've got the basic serving of the application.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.740
We will get this set up with Ec two initially.

17
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.080
Next you can see that there are plenty of images in

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.740
static assets being served as well.

19
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.640
We will store and serve these from S3 amazon's object storage service.

20
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.910
Users can create new accounts as well as login.

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.330
The users will need to be stored in a database of some kind for that

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.780
purpose will use Dynamo DB once the user has logged in,

23
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.930
will want to store that session in a cash such as Alaska cash.

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.840
To avoid wasting application memory.

25
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
A user can create a new pizza and their browser by selecting toppings.

26
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.940
These toppings will also be stored in dynamo DB for

27
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.030
flexibility when the user saves a pizza,

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.390
the new.

29
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.260
Pizza data will be stored in a database using the relational database

30
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.430
service RDS and the image will be created and stored in S three and that is

31
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.080
all of the major interactions in our application.

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.130
Here's a diagram to recap the services will be using in

33
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.840
conjunction with our main application,

34
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.940
this isn't all of the services will be using but this should hopefully give

35
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.270
you a good idea of what our application will look like.

36
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.670
Once we're done developing it by utilizing this application

37
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.120
which is currently fully functioning locally,

38
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.340
you'll be able to learn the ins and outs of the major services in AWS.

39
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.950
There may be a bit of a learning curve if you've never worked in javascript

40
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.180
before but there will be plenty of pure AWS configuration so don't be afraid

41
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.270
to dive right in if you want to find out more information about the

42
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.940
technology is being used in this demo project.

43
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.710
I've created a couple of other Pluralsight courses that cover these.

44
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.710
Happy is the no Js framework that Pizza Lovers is built with in my course,

45
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.850
building web applications with Happy,

46
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.160
you can learn how Happy works by building an

47
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.450
application from scratch on the UI side.

48
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.440
I've built the front end for Pizza Lovers with handlebars and in my

49
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.280
course JavaScript template ng with handlebars,

50
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:03.000
you'll learn the ins and outs of this powerful template in language. Both of these courses are available with your subscription to Pluralsight
