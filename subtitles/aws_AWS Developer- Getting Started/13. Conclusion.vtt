00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.910
[Autogenerated] VPC and easy to are powerful tools that

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.290
you can do really amazing things with.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.950
We really only scratched the surface with what we were

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.730
able to accomplish in this module.

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.910
But even so, we were able to launch a scalable application structure,

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.940
complete with load balancing and scaling rules.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.340
Let's recap what we learned in this module.

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300
We started with an overview of virtual private cloud,

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.440
explaining how it's used to isolate and secure any instances created inside it.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.240
Then we tried it out and built our own, which hopefully wasn't too painful.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.150
Then we moved on to ec two and created our first instance and

12
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.970
deployed the demo application from there.

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.630
We added a load balancer,

14
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.870
auto scaling groups and finally tried the scaling out by

15
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.160
putting our application under some load.

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.140
I think we covered a ton in this module and it's just the start of

17
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.750
developing our wrap with a W S in the next module,

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.240
we're going to learn all about amazon's object storage service,

19
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.340
S3 or simple storage service.

20
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.420
It's become ubiquitous across the industry for storage

21
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960
needs and by learning how simple it is,

22
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.380
you'll definitely understand why in the next module will start modifying

23
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.740
our application code to store and serve content directly from S3 greatly

24
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.000
reducing the load on our application servers. See you in the next module
