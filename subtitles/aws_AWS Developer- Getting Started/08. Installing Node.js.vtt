00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.940
[Autogenerated] the first thing we'll install for this

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.190
course is no Js No Js is a JavaScript platform that runs

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.740
locally instead of in a browser.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.150
The demo application is created using no Js So I want to

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.050
make sure that you can run it locally since we'll be

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.490
modifying code to connect to a Ws.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.240
services no Js is installed differently depending on your platform.

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.940
The best place to get started installing node is at the website No Js dot org.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.450
Front and center here are the versions listed to download,

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.910
download this version of node.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.450
Although the note, API is fairly stable between versions,

12
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.770
it will be best to install this version for the best compatibility with the

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.240
packages that we're gonna be using with the demo application.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.990
Both Windows and Mac will download installers which you should

15
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.940
open and follow the directions to install node.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.080
We will be using node from the command line.

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.040
So it's important that the install location is added to your path.

18
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.930
This may be done automatically or it may need to be

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.440
configured after the installation.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.090
Once the installation of note is complete,

21
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.470
open a command line to test it out at the prompt type in no

22
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.110
dash V and you should see the version of node that was

23
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.540
installed output in the next line.

24
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.210
If you don't see a version,

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.540
go back through the install steps to ensure everything was done correctly.

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.040
Now let's make sure the node package manager is installed as well.

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.050
This should have installed with your node installation type.

28
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:54.000
npm dash V and you should see a similar version output. If both versions output correctly, then you are good to go.
