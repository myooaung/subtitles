1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,420
[Autogenerated] we've learned some of the concepts of RDS.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,250
So let's move on to the AWS management console to

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,320
make our own database instance.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,710
Here's the RDS dashboard over on the left side of it is the dashboard menu.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,050
You can see options for things like databases,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,940
snapshots, submit groups and many many other things.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,980
Let's make our Postgres database now.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,740
So click the create database button.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,330
There are two main methods to use when creating a

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,540
database instance Standard create and Easy,

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,080
create the Easy create method,

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,240
removes many options when you're creating the database.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,190
Makes a little easier but it actually makes it

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,090
where you can't do certain things.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,500
I honestly don't use Easy create much because I usually actually need

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,580
the options that it removes for simpler setups.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,040
You know, it could probably work but I don't really recommend using it.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,240
So leave standard creates selected here.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,100
Next we'll choose our database engine.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,800
For this course.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,150
We're going to use PostGres.

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,070
SQL a popular open source relational database engine, click the Postgres option.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,400
You can then choose the version of the database engine because we want to

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,900
stay in the free tier for this course as much as possible,

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,260
choose one of the 12.

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,240
versions.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,200
The T two micro instance type we want to use isn't actually

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
available for any higher versions than that.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,410
The template section will automatically set some

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,750
recommended configuration options for you.

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,600
You will be able to change them later.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,880
Unlike with the Easy create method but it will at least reduce

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,030
the number of options that you have to choose.

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,540
So select the free tier option here.

35
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,920
Now we'll start configuring the database many of these options are

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,630
already pre defined in the demo code so just make sure that you're

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,230
following along with the values that I'm entering.

38
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,710
So the code works first we'll give the database instance a name,

39
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,140
enter pizza dash DB here,

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,450
then create a master user name and password that

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,500
you use to log into the database.

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,140
Instance,

43
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,570
use postgres for the user name and password all lowercase for the password.

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,510
I know very secure.

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,140
Now for the instance, type or instance class as they're calling it here,

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,860
it should already be configured with T two dot micro

47
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,540
because of our free tier template selection.

48
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,710
Next is storage storage.

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,250
Doesn't really matter for a demo.

50
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,930
We're not going to be using more than 20 gigabytes.

51
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,680
So just leave it as it is.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,970
And then you can skip down to the connectivity section.

53
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,200
We do need the database instance to be in our Pizza VPc.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,210
So select that from the VPc.

55
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,010
drop-down then select the radio button for Yes, in the public access option.

56
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,140
This gives a database instance,

57
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,810
resolvable DNS to the outside internet It basically makes it so we

58
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,230
can connect from somewhere other than the VPc Now in a production

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,010
setting you'd want this to actually be No,

60
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,450
because you want it to be more secure but for the purposes of this demo project,

61
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,910
we want to get access from our local development

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,430
environment at least in the beginning.

63
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,880
So um once you've got everything running in AWS you

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,410
could probably change this to a no next.

65
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,820
We want to make a new security group for the database instance.

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,560
This will make it easier to configure specific rules for the database instance.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,530
And for our application instances choose to create new option under

68
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,830
VPC security group then named the security group.

69
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,180
Pizza Dash R.

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,380
D.

71
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,850
S.

72
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,760
Dash S.

73
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,740
G.

74
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,730
When this security group is set up,

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,250
it's going to create a single rule for the database,

76
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,700
giving access to your current IP address on the database port.

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,370
It looks it up with the browser.

78
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,170
This will make it really easy and convenient for us

79
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,340
to connect in the following video.

80
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,840
Now scroll down to the larger additional configuration section and expand it.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,290
We will want to have an initial database set up for us by a W.

82
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,540
S.

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,990
So enter Pizza underscore Lovers into this field and

84
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,250
that's all the options we need to select.

85
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,040
So scroll all the way down and click create database.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,290
This database creation can take some time but you can view the

87
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,470
instance in this list as it's being created just to kind of check

88
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,000
up on the progress Now in the next clip we're going to connect to this database instance
