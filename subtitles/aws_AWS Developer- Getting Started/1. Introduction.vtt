[Autogenerated] Welcome back to the final module in

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.590
AWS developer getting started,

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm Ryan Lewis And in this module we're going to utilize a couple of AWS

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.640
services to speed up the performance of our web application cloud front and

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.920
elastic cache both make data and resources available quicker,

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.670
meaning there's less time spent retrieving data from

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.840
databases or assets from a file store.

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.770
Both of these services require few changes to our actual application code,

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.320
making it super easy to add these optimizations.

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.240
Let's take a look at what we'll be covering this module.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.450
I'll start by introducing cloudfront and explain how you

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.440
can use it to fight geographic latency.

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.580
Then we'll position are at behind a cloud front distribution and look at

14
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.870
some data around the behavior of the distribution so you can determine

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220
whether you're caching is operating as expected next we'll learn about

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.340
Alaska cash and the different engines you can use to easily and quickly

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.940
cache data for your application.

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.860
Then we'll set up our first cluster and modify our code to use

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.000
readiness instead of local memory for our user sessions. Let's get started
