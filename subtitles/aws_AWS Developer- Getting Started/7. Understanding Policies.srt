00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,420
[Autogenerated] policies are the fundamental building blocks of I am

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,660
permissions policies have one or more statements that declare whether a

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,510
user is allowed to do something or not by default,

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,140
users have no permission.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,540
So you'll almost always want to apply at least one policy to user

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,490
policies can be applied to individual users or two groups,

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,140
which users will then be added to.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,240
A policy statement has three properties that give or restrict access.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,240
The first is the simplest and effect.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,230
This will be either allow or deny and controls how the policy

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,340
will respond when a user requests access.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,120
All AWS permissions are denied by default.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,340
So this will typically be allowed.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,740
Second is the action that the user can perform.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,750
Each service has a set list of actions that can be performed on it.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,740
And this property says what the user is able to perform.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,550
The last property is a resource.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,860
User can request to perform the action on the

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,850
resource property should have the A.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,370
R, N or amazon resource name entered for the given resource.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,440
Alternately you can use an asterisk for this property to

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,240
give the user access to any resource.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,210
There are plenty of pre created policies that AWS has

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,330
available and most of the permissions you'll want to apply

25
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,490
already have policies created for them.

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,620
However, if required, you can create your own policies.

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,990
If you want to give a user access to a specific resource only,

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,840
you will need to create a custom policy.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,530
An example of this as if you want to allow user to upload files to a specific S3

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,200
bucket but don't want them to have access to anything else.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Let's take a look at a policy in your AWS management console,

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,330
go to the I AM dashboard in the left hand menu,

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,440
click the policies option.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,120
The policies list shows all available policies and

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,050
sends here working in a new account.

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,420
All of the policies will be a Ws managed policies.

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,180
Let's take a look at the Administrator access policy type

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,740
Administrator into the search box and hit enter,

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,740
then find the administrator access policy in the list and click on the name.

40
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,440
This will open up a window to show the policies details.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,860
The permissions tab is the important part of this policy.

42
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,740
It will show you the permissions that an attached entity will receive.

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,240
If you click on the JSON button, you'll see the policy document.

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,060
The part we care about in this policy document is a property named statements,

45
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,160
which is basically it's just an array of access objects.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,790
The administrator access policy gives access to

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,380
perform any action to any service.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,220
So the action and resource fields are both assigned an asterisk.

49
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,900
Now, let's take a look at another policy, One that has more refined permissions.

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,840
Click on the policies linked towards the top of the screen

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,240
In the filter and put field type EC two and then hit enter

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,810
Once the list is filtered, click on the Amazon.

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,500
Ec two.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,140
Full access policy.

55
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,300
This policy document is just a little bit more complex and

56
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,000
you can see that there are several statements being

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,440
declared in the statements property.

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,180
The first shows the action as E C two colon asterisk,

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,220
which gives the permission to perform any action on Ec.

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,240
Two.

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,640
The next few statements are for ancillary services that interact with EC.

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,600
Two, such as elastic load balancing,

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,610
CloudWatch and auto scaling attaching this policy to a user

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,870
will give them full access to create,

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,940
modify or destroy EC two instances load balancers or auto scaling groups

66
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,140
policies are incredibly deep ways to give users permissions.

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,890
Amazon provides plenty for you to easily apply to get started,

68
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,240
but also gives you the flexibility to design your own with I AM.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:27,000
And policies you can achieve fine grain control over all your services and resources.
