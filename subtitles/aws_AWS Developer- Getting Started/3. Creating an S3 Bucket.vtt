00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.330
[Autogenerated] let's go ahead and set up our S three buckets so we

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.540
can upload objects and store the Pizza images,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.670
just like ec two, we're probably going to be accessing S3 a lot.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.100
So click on the services menu and then click the

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.060
star next to S3 Once that's done,

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.370
go ahead and click on S3 in the favorite section we want to create

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.290
a new bucket to hold all of our pizza things so click on the

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.230
create bucket button in the bucket name field will need to enter a

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.010
unique name for our bucket.

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.890
All name mine Pizza lovers with a unique string on the end.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.940
Yours will need to be different since they must be unique.

12
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.810
Next is the region where the bucket will be located.

13
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.030
You'll notice that the region menu option at the top of the

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.310
screen is now listing global in S3 you will be able to view all

15
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.840
buckets from any region simultaneously,

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.020
which is a little different than most other services.

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.340
That's why you see this region drop-down instead of it just

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.360
automatically being launched in the region you're currently in now we

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.040
have settings for the privacy of your bucket.

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.070
Aws is setting this bucket to be private by default but for our purposes this

21
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.620
bucket will be serving up assets to users through our web app so we need it to

22
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.380
be public uncheck this box next to block all public access so that we can add

23
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.140
public access to the bucket later,

24
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.300
then click this check box saying that you acknowledge the objects in the bucket.

25
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.840
Might be public now scroll to the bottom and click create bucket.

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.100
Now you'll see the S three bucket in the bucket list.

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.070
Once the bucket is created like this,

28
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.680
you can start uploading objects to it immediately but before we do that

29
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.940
I want us to configure permissions for the bucket,

30
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.340
click into the bucket and then click on the permissions tab.

31
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.640
These are bucket permissions which give access to view

32
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.510
the bucket's contents and make changes.

33
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.740
Each object also has its own permissions which give you more fine grain control.

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.240
However,

35
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.920
we will be allowing this bucket to be completely public so we want to

36
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.770
apply a single permissions policy to give anyone access to view every

37
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
object in this S3 bucket by doing this,

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.060
we won't have to give individual object permissions to every object.

39
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.340
We upload.

40
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.640
AWS already provides a really good tool to build policies.

41
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.050
Policies as you saw in the I am module are just Jason and they

42
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.040
can be a little tedious to create my hand.

43
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.470
That's why the AWS policy generator is so great.

44
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.380
Let's use the policy generator tool to give anyone

45
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.090
permissions to view objects in the bucket.

46
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.760
We just created under bucket policy,

47
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.640
click edit and then click the button for policy generator.

48
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.110
There are many different types of policies that this tool can generate,

49
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.840
so you may want to use it any time you need to generate a policy

50
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.720
Select S three bucket policy from the drop-down Now we can add

51
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.040
one or more statements to this policy but we'll only need to make

52
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.340
one for our purposes here.

53
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.240
The principal field is who should be able to access it.

54
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.510
If you wanted to give access to another AWS account you would enter the amazon

55
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.400
resource name for that account here we want to give access to everyone so enter

56
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.700
an asterisk here The next drop-down which is for services pre selected due to

57
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.880
the first drop-down we selected next we need to pick the action which is what

58
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.700
the principal can do in s3 select get object from the drop down since we want

59
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.420
them to be able to download and view images and assets and their browser for

60
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.790
the A R N.

61
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.540
We will have to build this ourselves.

62
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.180
There's an example below showing the format so following that my

63
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.980
A R N would be A RN colon AWS colon S3 colon colon colon pizza

64
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.240
dash lovers dash Ryan slash asterisk.

65
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.710
The ending slash asterisk is important because this

66
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.040
should apply to any object in my bucket,

67
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.410
the A.

68
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.620
R.

69
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.740
N.

70
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.940
That you should enter should have your bucket that you created.

71
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.220
We're done with this statement so click add statement now you can

72
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.680
add more statements but we're pretty much done.

73
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.380
So click generate policy and copy the JSON in the window that pops up,

74
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.840
we're going to use this with our bucket so go back to the S three bucket tab,

75
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.380
paste the policy JSON into the policy box then click save

76
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.110
changes With this public bucket policy in place,

77
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.040
I want to draw your attention to this public access alert from AWS.

78
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.450
There have been some recent high profile stories of data being leaked from

79
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.510
customers accounts because they mistakenly had an S.

80
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.940
three bucket configured to be public.

81
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.420
AWS made these changes to make it brutally obvious whenever a bucket is public.

82
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.680
Now, with this policy in place,

83
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.000
every object in this bucket will be publicly accessible, which is exactly what we want.
