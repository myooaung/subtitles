1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,590
[Autogenerated] an AWS account can be a dangerous thing.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,940
If you think about it.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,750
If it's your personal account then you've got your credit card attached to it,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,140
a vulnerable position to be in.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,480
If it's a company account then there are likely resources

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,100
that could cost the company a lot of money if administered

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,820
incorrectly anyway you look at it.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,250
An AWS account needs to be secure and maintained

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,700
correctly at the base of your AWS account.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,540
Is the root account.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,970
If you just made a new account or open the account yourself

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,540
your account is likely the root account.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,320
This means that all services are available to you to modify billing

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,140
information is visible and users can be managed.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,100
Obviously this is a very powerful place to be and you should keep this in

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,150
mind when you're logged in as Root because of this.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,380
There are some amazon suggested best practices that we will

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,940
set up over the course of this module.

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,840
Multi factor authentication shortened to M.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:00:59,950
F.

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,450
A.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,300
Has long been the industry standard for secure

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,840
authentication of online accounts.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,800
Multi factor means that there is more than one way you will authenticate the M.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:10,990
F.

26
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,130
A.

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,690
Provided by AWS ensures the user knows a specific

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,800
password and also has a specific device.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,330
When M.

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,410
F.

31
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:20,640
A.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
Has been activated,

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,620
you'll need to enter your password as well as an

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,320
authentication code from your M.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,410
F.

36
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,740
A device.

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,910
This authentication code refreshes every 60 seconds which is what

38
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,740
makes the second form of authentication very secure.

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,210
The password part you have already taken care of for the device AWS allows

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,740
you to either use a hardware device or a virtual one.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,680
I won't assume you have a hardware M.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:47,750
F.

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,330
A device lying around but it's likely that you do have a smartphone.

44
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,020
There are plenty of multi factor authentication apps available in the

45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,160
app store or google play So find and download an M.

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,250
F.

47
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,640
A application of your choosing.

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,330
I personally use Duo mobile and it works great with AWS.

49
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's walk through setting up M.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,090
F.

51
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,390
A.

52
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,490
On your account from the AWS console,

53
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,660
click on your name in the upper right hand corner and

54
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,240
then select security credentials.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,020
Now expand the multi factor authentication section and click the activate M.

56
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,110
F.

57
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,540
A button.

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,430
Select the type of MFA device.

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,640
You'll be using select virtual if you're using a smartphone

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,220
in the next screen you'll see a large Q.

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,590
R code and here's where it gets a little tricky for me to guide you.

62
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,640
Since every MF A app has a different flow for adding a new account.

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,480
But basically you want to scan the QR code with your F A.

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,150
app and then you'll enter to authentication codes

65
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,460
from the account created in that M.

66
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,550
F.

67
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,810
A app This may take some time since you'll likely have to wait for

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,820
the new code to refresh and once both codes have been entered MFA

69
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,640
will now be enabled on your root account.

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,940
Let's try it out.

71
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,340
Sign out of your account via the menu and the top right of the console,

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,270
then click the sign in to the console button here,

73
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,440
enter your usual email and password.

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,110
Now you're presented with a new screen and this is where you'll

75
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,450
enter the authentication code from your M.

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,750
F A app, get the code from your app,

77
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,030
but make sure it is the most recent code Some apps

78
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,340
automatically refresh the codes, but some require a manual refresh,

79
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,040
enter your code and you should be allowed into your account.

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,240
Now the MFA has been enabled, your root account is much more secure than before.

81
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,480
In the next few clips,

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,000
we will do a few more things to make your usage of AWS more secure for you and your users.
