1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,680
[Autogenerated] with CloudFormation you can automate the creation

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,440
of infrastructure but with elastic beanstalk you can automate the

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,840
deployment of your application.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,380
Elastic beanstalk will handle scaling monitoring and any other resource

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,830
provisioning required to get your app to run efficiently in a W S.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,660
All you need to do is upload your application code to elastic

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,210
beanstalk and it will take care of having the correct os and

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,600
platform installed for your application.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,280
It differs from CloudFormation in that CloudFormation will

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,270
provision new resources but doesn't necessarily care what

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,540
is running on those resources.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
Elastic beanstalk is purely dedicated to running your application.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,440
Elastic beanstalk has a few key structures that it uses to organize itself.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,740
The first is an application,

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,000
think of an application as a parent container for a

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,440
logical application like Pizza Lovers.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,110
Each application must select a platform to deploy on such as Java no Js or

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,540
python An application has references to many different application versions

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,140
which are basically different versions of your code.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,330
These versions are stored in S3 and can be used to deploy new versions

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,900
of your application or roll back in case of an emergency inside of an

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,790
application are one or more environments.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,270
An environment has independent configuration values for the am I an use

24
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,960
instant size auto scaling configuration and more an environment will have an

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,240
application version deployed and running on it.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,650
You can have multiple environments and an application with

27
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,940
different application versions deployed to each.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,950
The best use case that I know for having multiple different

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,790
environments is if you want to have a production environment

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,840
and a development environment.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,740
both are logically running the same application, just different versions of it.

32
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,670
You can easily deploy an application version to the

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,300
production environment after testing and validating that

34
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,940
code and the development environment.

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,490
Through the process of creating an application and an environment,

36
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,960
we'll see a lot of the options that you're able to

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,000
configure an elastic beanstalk. So let's go do that.
