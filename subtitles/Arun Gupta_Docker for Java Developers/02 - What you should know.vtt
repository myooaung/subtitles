00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] To get the most out of this course,

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.090
you should be fairly comfortable with the command line.

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.020
We will be typing commands, we will be typing options,

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.020
so you should be really comfortable with this.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.090
You should be able to copy/paste,

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.050
and then put them into the command line,

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.070
and run the commands.

8
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.010
Now other aspects that would be important to understand is:

9
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.060
This course is targeted towards Java developers.

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.030
So a basic knowledge of Java would be very useful.

11
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.020
Particularly Enterprise Java.

12
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.030
Now, yes, this course is targeted toward Java developers,

13
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.040
but you can certainly apply those concepts towards your own

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010
programing language as well.

15
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.050
So, let's say I'm using a Wildfly image,

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.030
which is a Java application software,

17
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.070
but you want to use a Node.js server,

18
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.090
you are welcome to replace it

19
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.070
with your own programing language in that sense.

20
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.080
Let's take a look at the hardware

21
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.020
and software requirements.

22
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.060
The most common operating systems are supported.

23
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.050
So if you're using a Mac OS X then we're looking at

24
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.040
at least, 2010 plus onwards model.

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.030
And in terms of the operating system,

26
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080
OS x El Capitan 10.11+ will be used.

27
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.070
When I'm doing this course,

28
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.080
I'm using an OS X here.

29
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.030
and I am using El Capitan,

30
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030
so that works very well over there.

31
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.060
And that's where Docker for Mac is supported.

32
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.000
So you need to be a little bit careful,

33
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.030
if you chose older version, then you may have to use

34
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.030
Docker Machine, or Docker Tool Box,

35
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.030
and we explain those differences

36
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.080
down in the course as well.

37
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.020
For Windows, you're looking at a 64-bit, Windows 10 Pro.

38
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.070
If you have a different version, then again, you have to

39
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.030
go with a Docker Machine approach.

40
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.090
So some of the things in the course,

41
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.080
you may have to tweak it to adapt to this lesson.

42
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.010
Linux, most of the common flavors work,

43
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.020
and I would recommend looking at Docs.doc or .com,

44
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.090
for all of your references and what versions are supported.

45
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.010
On each of these machine, you will need admin privileges,

46
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.040
because essentially when you are running doc or commands,

47
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.010
you need the administrative privilege.

48
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.010
Certain part of the course we are also using

49
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.050
Amazon Web Services,

50
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.090
so you need an Amazon Web Services account.

51
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020
And what kind of privileges are required,

52
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020
are then explained in detail in the course as well.

53
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.090
But if you have a fairly admin privilege AWS account,

54
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.060
you should be good to go.

55
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.070
You can use your favorite IDE.

56
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.000
In my case, I'm using, Sublime Text and Net Beans.
