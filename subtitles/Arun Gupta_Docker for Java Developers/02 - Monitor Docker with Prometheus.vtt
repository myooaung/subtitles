00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.050
- [Instructor] In the previous section

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.030
we looked at what monitoring tools

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.020
are available as part of Docker CLI.

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.080
We looked at Docker stats, we looked at Docker remote API,

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000
we looked at Docker system events,

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.060
and this one we're going to look at two additional tools

7
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.080
that are available to you.

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.090
Well, first is Prometheus

9
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.030
which is built into Docker 113,

10
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.080
and then we'll also look at C Advisor

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.040
on what capabilities does it offer for us

12
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.050
to monitor Docker containers.

13
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.090
Let's get hands-on.

14
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.060
Let's clean up our screen here.

15
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.080
Let's take a look at the container

16
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.020
that are running right now.

17
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.090
Well, there is one container running,

18
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.050
and once again, we can clean it up,

19
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.060
just to make sure nothing is running here,

20
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.070
and we are good to go.

21
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.090
Okay, so for this particular exercise

22
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.010
I will be referring to my exercise notes,

23
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000
which you'll have access to anyway.

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.070
Let me copy this JSON fragment here.

25
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.020
Now, the support for Prometheus endpoint

26
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.090
is available as per of Docker 113 as an experimental build.

27
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.030
Now, I'm running Docker for Mac,

28
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.020
so let's see how we can enable that support here.

29
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.070
Here is my Docker icon up on the status bar.

30
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.080
Go to Preferences.

31
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080
Now we are in the Advanced tab,

32
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.020
and I'm going to change this setting here.

33
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.070
All I'm specifying is

34
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.030
there is a metrics address endpointers,

35
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.010
all network interfaces on this host at port 1337,

36
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.060
and experimental true is important

37
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090
because this is only an experimental support

38
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.010
at this point of time.

39
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.050
So, let's restart the Docker engine.

40
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.040
And you can see how the containers are dancing around here.

41
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.050
It takes a few seconds for the Docker engine

42
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.010
to get up and running,

43
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
and this is indicated by Docker is running over here.

44
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.070
So, let's go back to our terminal.

45
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.080
See what we can do over there now.

46
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.040
First thing we're going to do here is

47
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.090
let's do a curl,

48
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.060
and we're going to do a curl on http://localhost:1337.

49
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.000
This is the same port that we defined

50
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.080
where our metrics endpoint is going to be available.

51
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.040
And the metrics endpoint is /metrics.

52
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.080
As you would expect, very intuitive.

53
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.050
There are lots of metrics that are available to you

54
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.080
by default that are pushed by this Prometheus endpoint.

55
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.020
I can call it again and grab for engine.

56
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.000
So, these are different engine endpoints

57
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.060
that are available to you as well.

58
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.040
So, that's the first thing that you want to understand

59
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.070
over here that there are several metrics

60
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.020
that are available to you.

61
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.070
Now, let's run a node exporter,

62
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.050
which will scrape those metrics,

63
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.050
and show this to me in a nice graph.

64
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.020
So, we are in the couchbase directory.

65
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.080
We're going to go a level up.

66
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.000
We going to make a new directory by the name prom,

67
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.010
short for Prometheus basically.

68
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.090
And here first of all I'm going to go to the directory.

69
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.090
I'm going to create a file by the name prometheus.yml,

70
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.020
and the content for these

71
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.020
are going to come from my exercise notes.

72
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.080
We'll copy this here,

73
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.040
and insert the content in here and paste it here.

74
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.030
Well, what we're doing over here is

75
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.090
we are defining the scrape config,

76
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.020
saying scrape itself every five seconds.

77
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.030
The job name is Prometheus, scrape interval is five seconds,

78
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.070
and in terms of the target,

79
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.010
this is localhost:9090.

80
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.070
9090 is because that's where we will run

81
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.050
the Prometheus container.

82
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.090
So, let's get out of it here,

83
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.000
and now what I want to do is I want to run

84
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.010
my Prometheus container.

85
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.050
So, docker container run in a detached mode,

86
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.040
give this container a name, call it metrics,

87
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.030
and do the port forwarding,

88
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.080
and then we're going to do a volume mapping in this case,

89
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.020
and in our case, we just going to say pwd,

90
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.060
and we know where it picks it up from.

91
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, pwd/prometheus.yml,

92
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.040
and then we're going to map it

93
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.010
to etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml.

94
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.080
So, that's the configuration file

95
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.090
that the Prometheus container is looking for.

96
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.090
And finally, the image name.

97
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.070
Okay?

98
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.020
So, this will start up the Prometheus container for us.

99
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.090
Let's give it a shot.

100
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.050
It cannot find the Prometheus image,

101
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.030
so it's going to download it.

102
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.020
Okay.

103
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.020
This is ready now, so let's go to our browser,

104
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.020
and in my browser, I can look at my Prometheus dashboard

105
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.020
at localhost:9090.

106
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.080
Here is my Prometheus dashboard.

107
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.070
Let's take a look at the metrics that are available to me.

108
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.010
Everything that was available to me on the command line

109
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.010
is now available here as well.

110
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.030
So, you can go through the entire set of metrics over here.

111
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.010
The one that we're going to particularly look at it is

112
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.050
http_request_duration_microseconds.

113
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.090
So, if I take a look at this one here,

114
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.070
it says there is no data here.

115
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.090
Let's look at some other metric here.

116
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.090
We can look at microseconds count,

117
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.070
or we can look at microsecond sum.

118
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.060
Well, you got to be running a container,

119
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.020
and then it'll start monitoring those containers

120
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.080
and it'll start running some data over here.

121
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.060
So remember, the important part to understand is

122
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.000
this is still in a very, very early phase,

123
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.040
but the fact that you have these metrics available

124
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.070
you can start playing around with them.

125
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.000
If the metrics were available

126
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.010
and the values were legitimate,

127
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.000
then you can start showing these values in a graph as well.

128
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.070
And as you can see here,

129
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.080
it's a very nice colorful legend that is available to you.

130
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.030
And if I can turn down the window

131
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.020
in which the metrics need to be displayed,

132
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.080
so there are some real numbers

133
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.030
that are being displayed over here,

134
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.010
and what's the real legend over here?

135
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.060
That legend is explained over here.

136
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.090
So, a basic support for container metrics, engine metrics

137
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.000
that is available as part of Prometheus

138
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.050
as a future version of Docker is released

139
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.090
this metrics will be a lot more comprehensive,

140
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.060
so stay tuned on that.

141
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.000
Now, that's what is available in Prometheus today.

142
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.090
Let's take a look at what happens with C Advisor.

143
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.030
Well, C Advisor is open source project by Google.

144
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.040
C Advisor means Container Advisor

145
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.080
and it gives you some metrics on container.

146
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.020
So, let's rend that container next

147
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.090
and show what kind of dashboard that provides us.

148
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.060
We'll go here.

149
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.040
We will remove our container

150
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.090
for Prometheus here,

151
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.020
so that removes the metrics container.

152
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.000
That's it.
