00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] In this video, I will show you

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.090
how to install Docker Toolbox on a Windows machine.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.080
Now, if you're using Windows, it could be on a laptop

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.090
or it could be on a virtual machine.

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.020
For virtual machines, two common options

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.030
are VirtualBox and VMware Fusion.

7
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, VirtualBox will not work in our case,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.040
because VirtualBox does not support nested virtualization.

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.090
This will be required when you're running Docker Toolbox,

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.090
and we'll talk about that in a second.

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.010
So, in our case, we're going to use a Windows 7

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.000
virtual machine running on VMware Fusion.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.010
Let's take a look at that.

14
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.050
Here is my VMware Fusion player.

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.040
You can see the Windows 7 VM is configured over here.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.030
Before we jump into the VM

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.080
and download Docker Toolbox and install it,

18
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.060
let's take a look at an important part of the Settings.

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.010
I'm going to click on Processors & Memory here.

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.050
Look at the Advanced options here.

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.080
Make sure to check this box which says,

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.090
"Enable hypervisor applications in this virtual machine."

23
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.010
This is required because, essentially,

24
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010
when you're running Docker Toolbox,

25
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.040
it is going to provision a VirtualBox VM

26
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.050
to set up Docker Machine on your Windows machine.

27
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.000
So, essentially, that's what the

28
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
nested virtualization concept is.

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.040
So you're going to make sure this

30
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
checkbox is explicitly checked,

31
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.050
because, without that, the Docker Toolbox will not work.

32
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.030
Now this is how I have installed this virtual machine,

33
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.040
so we are good to go.

34
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.030
So let's switch to our virtual machine,

35
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030
and install Docker Toolbox,

36
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.050
and see how we can get started with that.

37
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.010
Now, I'm in my Windows VM.

38
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.020
I can go to the link shown over here,

39
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.050
docker.com/products/docker-toolbox.

40
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.080
Now, the best way for you would be to search the link,

41
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.020
say "Docker Toolbox" on a search engine,

42
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.090
and it'll automatically bring you back to the right page.

43
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.050
The links may change in the future,

44
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.000
so make sure you search for the latest link.

45
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.030
You can download a Mac or a Windows version.

46
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.090
Well, we are on a Windows machine,

47
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.060
so we will download the Windows link.

48
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.050
So we click on this,

49
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.020
and it downloads the Docker Toolbox for us.

50
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.090
All right, once the Docker Toolbox is downloaded,

51
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.080
we click on the link over here,

52
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.070
and it's going to ask us to run the application.

53
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.030
It just makes sure that we do want to run the program.

54
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.010
And, now, it's going to guide us through the

55
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.020
installation wizard to install Docker Toolbox.

56
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.090
Take the defaults here.

57
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030
It's giving you the directory in which

58
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.000
Docker Toolbox is going to install.

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.050
Let's take the default here, as well.

60
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.020
As you can see, Docker Client, Docker Machine,

61
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.000
Docker Compose, VirtualBox, Kitematic, and Git for Windows,

62
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.050
all these tools are installed all together.

63
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.040
Click on Next.

64
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.000
Take all the defaults over here.

65
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.040
These are just convenience defaults,

66
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.090
which will actually allow us to start

67
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.010
a Docker Quickstart Terminal very easily.

68
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.080
And it shows all the selected options.

69
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.030
You can look at them once again,

70
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.000
and then, finally, click on Install.

71
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.080
This is going to begin a rather simple install process.

72
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.090
During the installation,

73
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.070
it would like to install VirtualBox,

74
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.080
and it wants to make sure that you do want to install this.

75
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.090
So let's say we select the box here,

76
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.070
"Always trust software from 'Oracle Corporation'"

77
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.000
and click on Install.

78
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.030
And that completes our installation of Docker Toolbox.

79
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.040
We're going to see the shortcuts in File Explorer,

80
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.030
so we'll keep this box checked on,

81
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.000
click on Finish,

82
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.020
and it shows us links for running

83
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.020
our Docker Quickstart Terminal.

84
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.060
Let's click on that link here,

85
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.090
and start our Quickstart Terminal.

86
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030
One of the first things it does is

87
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.050
it tries to download the latest boot2docker.iso from GitHub

88
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.070
to make sure it has the latest VM for you.

89
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.040
Then it tries to create a VirtualBox VM,

90
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.080
creates the SSH key,

91
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.030
which will allow you to SSH into the VM itself.

92
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.050
Certain times, you may get an error

93
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.050
as shown on the screen over here,

94
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.030
so the easiest way to go past this error is

95
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.010
click on any key to continue.

96
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.010
The command prompt disappears,

97
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.080
and now you click on the Docker Quickstart Terminal again.

98
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.000
And let me resize the window a little bit here.

99
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.010
So I can click on Properties,

100
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.070
Layout,

101
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.080
change the Width to 200,

102
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:39.010
and change the Height to little bit more as well,

103
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.000
and that gives us a better view.

104
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.090
Now, there is a window at the bottom

105
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.020
where is VirtualBox is looking for permission,

106
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.090
so accept that.

107
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.070
Once again, it prompts to seek a permission on your machine,

108
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.030
and it gives a prompt to show that.

109
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.090
So let's select the box here and agree to the permission.

110
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.060
Now it is waiting for an IP address to be assigned

111
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.050
to the Docker Machine.

112
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.060
The machine is provisioned,

113
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.000
it copies all the keys,

114
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.010
and now Docker is live for us.

115
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.060
And, just for convenience,

116
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.030
making sure everything does work for us,

117
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.090
I can say

118
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.050
docker image ls

119
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.050
and it'll rightly show that no images are available

120
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.090
because this is a fresh install of Docker.

121
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.060
Now, one of the things that you might see here

122
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.040
is an info message over here that

123
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.060
it's not able to use a system certificate pool,

124
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.080
which is okay, for now.

125
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.020
Now, another command that you may want to run here is

126
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.000
docker container ls

127
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.080
and that shows us a listing of containers.

128
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.050
So, as expected, our Docker Machine is up

129
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.050
and running in my Windows virtual machine now,

130
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.010
and our basic commands are working as well.

131
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.060
One of the key things to understand is,

132
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.070
when you're using Docker Toolbox,

133
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.030
when your containers are running,

134
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.020
they are not accessible on localhost,

135
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.030
as you will see throughout rest of the videos as well.

136
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.030
In our case, if you're using Docker Toolbox,

137
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.010
the IP address that is assigned to the machine

138
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.030
is the one that you'll be using for accessing the container.

139
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.030
So let's say we start (mumbles) container here,

140
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.070
the container will not be accessible to us on localhost.

141
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.030
Instead, wherever localhost is used in rest of the video,

142
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.080
if you're using Docker Machine,

143
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.060
then you will have to use this particular IP address.

144
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.000
In our case, it's 192.168.99.100.

145
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.030
If it differs in your case,

146
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.050
so make sure you use that IP address.

147
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.010
And sometimes you may wonder,

148
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.050
what is the IP address that is assigned to me?

149
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.090
So, in that case, you can look at

150
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.010
the Docker environment variables,

151
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.030
and, here, it gives you the Docker host,

152
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.010
and this is exact IP address

153
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.090
that is assigned to your machine.

154
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.020
So make sure, any time you see localhost,

155
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.070
if you're not using Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows,

156
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.020
and you're using Docker Machine, use this IP address.

157
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.020
In this video we saw how to install Docker Toolbox

158
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.030
on a Windows virtual machine.

159
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.050
Make sure to use VMware Fusion

160
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.000
instead of VirtualBox to have success.
