00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.010
- [Instructor] Now that we have installed DockerCLI

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.070
using Docker for Mac, or Docker for Windows,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.010
or you're using AppGet or YUM install on Linux,

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.020
let's get familiar with it.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.050
Let's understand how we can use it,

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.020
what commands are available,

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.060
what can we do with it?

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.030
Now I'm in terminal here.

9
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.000
Now that we are in chapter two.

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.090
Let's make sure we are in the chapter two

11
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.090
directory of the exercise files as well.

12
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.070
But first thing I want you to notice is,

13
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.050
if you look at the top here,

14
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.050
this says Docker is running.

15
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.050
You can look at About Docker

16
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.060
and it'll tell you the version of Docker

17
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.090
that we are running over here.

18
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.090
And notice this is from the experimental channel,

19
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.090
or the beta channel.

20
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.050
So you can see that logo right up front.

21
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.080
I can look at if there are any updates available.

22
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.040
I can look at the preferences.

23
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.020
I can open the Kitematic,

24
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.080
the user interface that we talked about earlier,

25
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.040
or we can quit Docker, or we can restart it as well, okay?

26
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.020
All right, let's take a look

27
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.000
at what can we do with Docker now.

28
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.050
So first thing that we do here is,

29
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.020
we say Docker show me the version.

30
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.000
So it's 1.13.1.

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.080
Then I'm going to say,

32
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.070
Docker give me more information about you.

33
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.050
Okay.

34
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.070
Well, let's see what it shows us here.

35
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.090
When I see Docker info, it says 0 containers are there,

36
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.070
no running, no pause, no stop, rightly so,

37
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.010
because we haven't done anything.

38
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.040
It talks about, no images are there.

39
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.020
It talks about certain storage drivers.

40
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.090
It talks about plugins and we'll talk

41
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.060
about them a little bit later.

42
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.090
It talks about swarm.

43
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.040
Now, we haven't talked about swarm yet

44
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.030
but essentially it gives you multi-node Docker cluster.

45
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.010
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

46
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.060
It talks about the run times,

47
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.020
and out runC's before run time baked into Docker itself.

48
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.090
It talks about other options.

49
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.030
It talks about certain kernel version, operating system.

50
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.090
It talked about the OS type, the architecture,

51
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.060
a whole lot more description that is available to you.

52
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.090
Now we saw the Docker info here,

53
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.000
but I want to see what client version

54
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.010
and the server version I'm using.

55
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.030
So for that, I'm going to say, Docker version.

56
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.090
Now, here they're saying, the client

57
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.000
is using version 1.13.1.

58
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.090
As we talked about in the Docker work flow,

59
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.000
the client makes a request to the server,

60
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.090
but underlying it's a REST API.

61
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.040
So it even gives a REST API version here.

62
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.070
And it gives you some other detail about client.

63
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.070
And similarly, it gives you the server version,

64
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.080
and the server API version as well.

65
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.030
So you know at least, you can get some

66
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.020
basic commands available to you

67
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.040
on what you can do with Docker,

68
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.050
just to verify what version of Docker

69
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.080
are you using, okay?

70
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.010
Now, one of the golden nuggets that I would

71
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.090
love to share with you, which I have found

72
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.090
very, very helpful is, the command or the option

73
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.070
rather, --help.

74
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.000
So I am doing Docker, and I'm saying --help.

75
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.070
That shows me the complete list of commands

76
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.000
that are available to me, and that I can easily play with.

77
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.020
So I think that is fundamentally important.

78
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.070
Wherever you are, if you are lost somewhere,

79
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.090
just do --help, and it will give you the full

80
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.060
context, and as much help as possible.

81
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.030
Well that's a lot of commands here,

82
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.040
but if I scroll to the top here,

83
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.070
first of all, these are all the options

84
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.010
that are available, and all the options

85
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.090
are pretty self-explanatory.

86
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.040
You can look at them, and it tells you

87
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.010
what it means to do, and we will cover some of them.

88
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.030
The important part is, starting with Docker 1.13,

89
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.070
they have added these new management commands.

90
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.060
The commands at the bottom are more legacy commands.

91
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.080
But those were not very nicely organized.

92
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.030
The management commands essentially

93
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.010
gives you the ability where the commands

94
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.090
are very nicely organized, and they're

95
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.030
a lot more similar in nature as well.

96
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.040
So for example, let's see I don't want to see

97
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.090
the legacy commands here.

98
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.070
So what I can do in that case, is go

99
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.090
to the bottom first of all, and I can say

100
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.040
DOCKER_HIDE_LEGACY_COMMANDS=true.

101
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040
That means don't show me the legacy commands,

102
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.010
only show me the new commands.

103
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.090
And then I can say docker --help.

104
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.000
Now in this case, all those legacy commands are gone,

105
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.010
and it's showing me only the new commands.

106
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.080
So that's convenient mode, where you want to operate with.

107
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.030
While today, this is an optional switch

108
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.040
that you're specifying.

109
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.020
Who knows, maybe in a future version,

110
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.080
they will only show the management commands essentially.

111
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.070
So it's very important to get used to this.

112
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.040
So, let's take a look at, what can I do with these commands?

113
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.050
So, my first one is, say image.

114
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.090
So I can say, Docker image, and once again

115
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.050
as we said, --help, and it shows me

116
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.070
all the image sub-commands now.

117
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.050
The first commands typically that you may

118
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.060
want to do is, you want to say docker image ls.

119
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.090
It'll show you the list of images on your Docker host.

120
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.090
Remember, client is stateless,

121
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.030
the images are on the host.

122
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.050
But in our case, because we are using Docker for Mac,

123
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.060
they're both co-located on the same host.

124
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.030
Now, what can I do with container?

125
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.090
Well I can do the same thing with container.

126
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.030
I can say Docker container ls, show me

127
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.020
the list of containers that are available.

128
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.060
And when we start running containers,

129
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.090
when we start building images,

130
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.010
these commands would make a lot more sense.

131
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.030
Now, let's do our command again,

132
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.050
and see what others are available.

133
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.070
So you can see, I can start looking at

134
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.060
what networks have been created by docker.

135
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.060
When I'm creating a multi-host docker,

136
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.040
then I can look at it, show me the list

137
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.000
of nodes that are available.

138
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Docker has this available by which you can

139
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.030
install multiple plugins.

140
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.010
By then, you can start managing

141
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.000
multiple plugins, or Docker's secrets,

142
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.060
you know, as you're assigning secrets to your services.

143
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.060
We'll talk about the concept of services

144
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.070
a little bit later, and that way

145
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.050
you can manage your services as well.

146
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.010
We'll talk about stack, swarm, a lot of other

147
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.070
commands that are available to you.

148
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.080
But as we move along in this chapter

149
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.020
and future chapters, you will learn more

150
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.010
about these commands in detail,

151
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.000
and how can we be more effective and productive with them.
