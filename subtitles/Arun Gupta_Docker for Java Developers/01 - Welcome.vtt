00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.030
- Docker is sweeping the software industry

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.080
and changing how applications are deployed

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.020
by simplifying the overall application delivery experience.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.020
It increases your ability to deliver software

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.020
more rapidly, and provides a common platform

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.070
for dev and ops to collaborate.

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.030
It also maximizes efficiency by integrating seamlessly

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.010
with existing tool chains.

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.000
Hi, there.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.010
I'm Arun Gupta.

11
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.090
I'm a Docker captain and a Java champion

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.030
and have been a software engineer for over two decades now.

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.070
In this course, you'll learn how to get started with Docker.

14
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.040
You'll learn how to run your very first container,

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.090
build your very first image

16
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.060
and most commonly-used options around them.

17
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.060
You'll also learn how to deploy

18
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.050
multi-container applications on multiple hosts

19
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.060
and take them from development to production.

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.010
You'll also learn how to learn staple containers

21
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.020
and strategies on how to persist

22
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.040
the state of such containers.

23
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.060
Finally, you'll learn about

24
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.080
monitoring Docker containers as well.

25
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.000
That's a lot to cover, so let's get started.
