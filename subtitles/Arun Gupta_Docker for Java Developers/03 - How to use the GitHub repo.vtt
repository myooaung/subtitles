00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] For this course, I have created a GitHub repo

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.060
where all the content is available.

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.030
The location for the GitHub repo

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.060
is arun-gupta/docker-for-java.

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.050
As you can see,

6
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.050
all the content is nicely organized in different chapters.

7
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.000
You can easily clone this repo,

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or download a ZIP file on your local desktop.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.040
Once you download it,

10
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.010
the ZIP file can be expanded and it gives you a folder.

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.040
In the folder, we have all the scripts

12
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.080
that are available for you to use.

13
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.040
You can use your favorite IDE.

14
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.070
In my case, I'm using Sublime Text.

15
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.040
Let's take a look at that.

16
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.090
Here is the unzipped folder

17
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090
that is available in my Sublime Text.

18
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's take a look at Chapter4, for example.

19
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
If I look at this, I have my readme.adoc.

20
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.070
It has all the commands that are available for you.

21
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.090
You can copy, paste them into your terminal

22
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.000
and just follow along the course.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.050
Even the Shell scripts that are used are available to you

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.000
as a referral as well.
