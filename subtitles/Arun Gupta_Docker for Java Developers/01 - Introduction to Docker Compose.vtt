00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] So far we have seen

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.090
how to build a Docker image, how to run a container.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.090
But those are all single images, single containers.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.030
But typically when you're building your application,

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.060
that application would consist of a web server,

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.050
a database server, an application server,

7
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.080
a caching, a messaging server, multiple set components.

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.010
So essentially, your application consists

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.080
of multiple containers.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.010
Well, that's the purpose of Docker Compose.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.060
Docker Compose allows you to run

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.020
a multicontainer application very easily.

13
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.010
Let's take a look at what does it offer,

14
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.030
what are the capabilities,

15
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020
and then we will look into some code as well.

16
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.080
So what is Docker Compose?

17
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.020
As we said, Docker Compose allows us to define

18
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.050
and run multicontainer applications very easily.

19
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.080
Where are these container applications defined,

20
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.000
how are these defined,

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
what are the commands that are available to me,

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.070
are going to be explained in this section.

23
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.080
Well, the configuration is defined in one or more files.

24
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.010
By default, the file configuration name

25
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.020
is docker-compose.yml.

26
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.030
That's the default name.

27
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.090
You can certainly choose a different name,

28
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.040
and there are options to do that.

29
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.080
In addition, there is also a file that could be available

30
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.080
in your directory by the name docker-compose.override.yml.

31
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.030
And if that file exists,

32
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.050
that file overrides the definitions

33
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.040
that are available in docker-compose.yml.

34
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060
What gets overridden, what is not allowed to be overridden,

35
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.020
is going to be explained in a later section as well.

36
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.030
But if these two files exist, they are merged together

37
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.050
to create single Docker Compose definition.

38
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.030
If you want to specify multiple files,

39
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.060
that can be done using -f switch,

40
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080
and we'll take a look at this in a later section as well.

41
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.020
A single command, which is docker-compose,

42
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.070
is used to manage all the services.

43
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.060
To bring up all the services, to build all the images,

44
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.020
to shut down all the services, that is very convenient.

45
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.000
It is very good for development, staging, and CI phases,

46
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and it also helps you reduce impedance mismatch

47
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.010
between all of these different stages

48
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.090
because a single file is being used,

49
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.060
and then you can override certain parts and pieces of it.

50
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.070
So let's take a look at how do we get started with it.

51
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.050
I'm in my terminal here.

52
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.080
Now that we are in chapter three, let's go to

53
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
the chapter three directory of our exercise files.

54
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.040
And in my terminal,

55
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.010
let's take a look at docker-compose CLI,

56
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.040
and I'm going to say -version.

57
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.030
Docker Compose CLI comes bundled as part of

58
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.090
the Docker Community Edition or Docker Toolbox,

59
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.050
and that is very convenient.

60
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.060
Let's take a look at what else Docker Compose can do for us.

61
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.050
And if you remember,

62
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.040
our magic command for that is going to be --help.

63
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.000
If I do --help,

64
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060
there are a lots of commands that are available here.

65
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.040
Well first of all, there are several options

66
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.010
that can be specified.

67
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.060
As we say, -f or --file can be used

68
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.010
to specify an alternate Compose file.

69
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.030
We'll take a look at how we can specific different projects.

70
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.010
We looked at version.

71
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.010
We can also connect to a specific Docker host,

72
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.060
and then there are some other options as well.

73
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.070
These are the list of commands here.

74
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.050
This allows me to build or rebuild all the services.

75
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.090
And I'm going to only walk you through

76
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.010
some of the major commands here that we'll be using later.

77
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.040
This will allow you to create the services.

78
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
If we go down here for a second,

79
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.010
this up command will allow you

80
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.060
to create and start all the containers.

81
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.090
Go up here again.

82
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.080
This will allow you to stop and remove the containers.

83
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.090
That is very helpful.

84
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.050
This allows you to kill all the containers.

85
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.010
Logs allow you to view output from all the containers,

86
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.040
ps allows you to list all the containers.

87
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.070
That is a very UNIX-like command.

88
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.090
You can restart the services.

89
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.000
You can start the services.

90
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.070
So this way there are lots of commands that are available,

91
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.080
and if you want for their help about a particular command,

92
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.010
let's say I want help more about the up command.

93
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.020
I can say up --help,

94
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.090
and now up-specific options are shown to me,

95
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.030
and it gives me more details on how I can build,

96
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.000
create, start, and attach containers for a service.
