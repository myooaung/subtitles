00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:07,690
Find will come back in this with you we're going to be looking at returning values from a method.

2

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:09,410
Let's look at our program right now.

3

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:11,800
I think we've got quite a nice program here.

4

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:15,390
We've got two methods one that asks the user for the number.

5

00:00:15,460  -->  00:00:17,770
The other one that runs the program a number of times.

6

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:21,810
And then we've got something that asks the user how many times they want to run the program.

7

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:27,630
And finally a line that runs it just in order to make things a bit nicer.

8

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:35,700
I'm going to copy that and put it up here of the top and either some whitespace there that just makes

9

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:36,920
it just a bit nicer.

10

00:00:36,990  -->  00:00:42,630
But it does not affect the running of the program at all.

11

00:00:42,630  -->  00:00:46,670
The next thing I want to do is look up the name of this method.

12

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:50,010
This method is called Ask user and check number.

13

00:00:50,150  -->  00:00:55,110
But there's nothing in that method that really tells me that this method is going to communicate with

14

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:59,010
a user it's going to tell them whether the number was right or not.

15

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:03,920
It just tells me I'm going to ask the user or something and then I'm going to check whether the numbers

16

00:01:03,920  -->  00:01:05,400
are right or not.

17

00:01:05,400  -->  00:01:08,370
It doesn't say and I'm going to tell the user about it.

18

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:17,560
So we have two options either rename the method or make it do less instead of printing out.

19

00:01:17,590  -->  00:01:20,570
We're going to make it just do a bit less.

20

00:01:20,650  -->  00:01:28,060
So I would remove the printing and instead we're going to replace this my return statements.

21

00:01:28,460  -->  00:01:28,770
OK.

22

00:01:28,770  -->  00:01:34,700
So let's look at what a return statement is when the method runs.

23

00:01:34,920  -->  00:01:40,800
It is now going to ask the user something and then he's going to check whether the user number is in

24

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:43,110
the magic number is valuable or not.

25

00:01:43,110  -->  00:01:48,050
If it is it's going to return the string here.

26

00:01:48,300  -->  00:02:00,090
That means that this method essentially will be either this string here or the string here which means

27

00:02:00,090  -->  00:02:08,420
we can assign this method to something we can assign this output to a variable which I'm going to call

28

00:02:08,430  -->  00:02:09,460
message.

29

00:02:09,510  -->  00:02:14,070
So now message is going to be equal to the return value of this method.

30

00:02:14,070  -->  00:02:17,640
Remember this method gets now replaced by whatever it returns.

31

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:19,740
That's how all methods work.

32

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:24,280
They do something when they return something and then they get replaced by whatever they return.

33

00:02:24,280  -->  00:02:28,420
So in this case message is going to be one of these two strings appear.

34

00:02:29,220  -->  00:02:33,100
So finally we can print the message out.

35

00:02:34,470  -->  00:02:34,860
OK.

36

00:02:34,920  -->  00:02:37,150
So let's press save and play.

37

00:02:37,380  -->  00:02:43,920
And what will happen is exactly the same as before we now get to enter the number of attempts and then

38

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:49,230
we get to enter them and that's it.

39

00:02:49,230  -->  00:02:55,170
We can simplify this slightly however instead of printing the message and assigning the method to a

40

00:02:55,170  -->  00:02:56,320
variable called message.

41

00:02:56,400  -->  00:03:01,290
We can just print the methods output straight away.

42

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:05,730
So if we run that we get exactly the same.

43

00:03:08,220  -->  00:03:09,600
OK.

44

00:03:10,230  -->  00:03:18,590
So what do you think will happen if we enter a letter here instead of a number.

45

00:03:18,630  -->  00:03:21,560
When it asks us for the number of attempts.

46

00:03:21,660  -->  00:03:26,870
So basically what is going to happen if I enter the letter A in there.

47

00:03:28,290  -->  00:03:34,600
And the answer is probably something you would expect by now we get an error.

48

00:03:34,930  -->  00:03:39,150
We are calling the input method on a letter.

49

00:03:39,150  -->  00:03:44,160
Notice how we're calling the method here on the input the input is the letter A.

50

00:03:44,400  -->  00:03:50,070
And Python doesn't like that because the method cannot convert a letter to a number.

51

00:03:50,070  -->  00:03:53,400
It needs to be the string of a number.

52

00:03:54,120  -->  00:04:00,930
So this is exactly how you would return something from a method we've looked at what a lot of things

53

00:04:00,930  -->  00:04:06,720
in this section we've looked at and lists we've looked at random numbers defining method defining methods

54

00:04:06,720  -->  00:04:10,200
passing parameters returning things from methods and.

55

00:04:10,230  -->  00:04:20,550
And essentially we've got everything we need now to really kick start our Python programming career

56

00:04:20,580  -->  00:04:20,630
.

57

00:04:20,630  -->  00:04:23,010
Essential if you want to think about it like that.

58

00:04:23,310  -->  00:04:31,260
We've got all of the foundations now to actually start developing larger or more complex python applications

59

00:04:32,310  -->  00:04:36,420
and eventually in this course we're also going to be getting into interacting with our data base as

60

00:04:36,450  -->  00:04:37,180
well.

61

00:04:37,200  -->  00:04:41,130
So I'm pretty excited to guide you through this learning.

62

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:42,700
So if you wish.

63

00:04:42,750  -->  00:04:48,870
Join me in the next section where we're going to be diving further into more advanced Python topics

64

00:04:48,870  -->  00:04:49,490
.

65

00:04:49,490  -->  00:04:52,000
I'll see you there.
