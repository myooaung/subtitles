<v Jose>Hi, and welcome back to the course.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,200  -->  00:00:04,640
In this video, we're going to be setting up PyCharm
3

3

00:00:04,640  -->  00:00:05,720
on our Mac.
4

4

00:00:05,720  -->  00:00:08,170
It's going to be a really straightforward process.
5

5

00:00:08,170  -->  00:00:10,930
Just open up PyCharm Community Edition,
6

6

00:00:10,930  -->  00:00:13,440
and it'll look very similar to what I've got here,
7

7

00:00:13,440  -->  00:00:15,670
but of course on the left I have a number of projects
8

8

00:00:15,670  -->  00:00:18,310
that I've already started for other things.
9

9

00:00:18,310  -->  00:00:19,830
And you don't have to worry about that.
10

10

00:00:19,830  -->  00:00:22,270
If yours is empty, that's totally fine.
11

11

00:00:22,270  -->  00:00:23,890
Nothing to worry about.
12

12

00:00:23,890  -->  00:00:26,860
Go ahead and click on create new project,
13

13

00:00:26,860  -->  00:00:29,160
and then make sure that in the location
14

14

00:00:29,160  -->  00:00:33,370
you enter the folder that you want your code to be in.
15

15

00:00:33,370  -->  00:00:35,450
And in my case, I'm just gonna go into documents,
16

16

00:00:35,450  -->  00:00:37,433
programming, python-postgres/students,
17

17

00:00:38,350  -->  00:00:40,440
because we're gonna be building a student project
18

18

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:41,890
in this section.
19

19

00:00:41,890  -->  00:00:44,890
Then, open up this project interpreter drop down
20

20

00:00:44,890  -->  00:00:46,330
if it's not open already,
21

21

00:00:46,330  -->  00:00:48,770
and select existing interpreter.
22

22

00:00:48,770  -->  00:00:50,780
We're going to look at this other stuff
23

23

00:00:50,780  -->  00:00:52,010
later on in the course,
24

24

00:00:52,010  -->  00:00:54,330
but for now, select existing interpreter
25

25

00:00:54,330  -->  00:00:55,963
and then from the drop down,
26

26

00:00:56,810  -->  00:01:00,280
find the version of Python that you've recently installed
27

27

00:01:00,280  -->  00:01:04,183
whether that's 3.5, 3.6 or even 3.7.
28

28

00:01:05,380  -->  00:01:07,950
If you see many options, like for example,
29

29

00:01:07,950  -->  00:01:12,380
these that say Python 3.7 virtualenv at blah, blah, blah,
30

30

00:01:12,380  -->  00:01:13,700
don't select any of those,
31

31

00:01:13,700  -->  00:01:16,870
just go ahead and select the ones that are in your library.
32

32

00:01:16,870  -->  00:01:20,620
See, here /library/frameworks, select that one,
33

33

00:01:20,620  -->  00:01:21,453
and again it doesn't really matter
34

34

00:01:21,453  -->  00:01:24,050
if you go 3.5, six or seven,
35

35

00:01:24,050  -->  00:01:27,380
but just for keeping in with the latest standards,
36

36

00:01:27,380  -->  00:01:29,580
I'm gonna go with 3.7.
37

37

00:01:29,580  -->  00:01:32,820
And go ahead and click create, and that's you.
38

38

00:01:32,820  -->  00:01:35,250
Then your project will appear,
39

39

00:01:35,250  -->  00:01:37,200
and you'll have your students folder.
40

40

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:41,050
And in here we can create all our code files.
41

41

00:01:41,050  -->  00:01:42,250
So that's it for this video.
42

42

00:01:42,250  -->  00:01:43,630
In the next one we're going to look at
43

43

00:01:43,630  -->  00:01:44,880
setting this up on Windows,
44

44

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:46,470
it's pretty much the same thing.
45

45

00:01:46,470  -->  00:01:47,910
And so if you're using Mac,
46

46

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:49,750
you can totally skip the next video,
47

47

00:01:49,750  -->  00:01:52,130
and just move on to the one after that.
48

48

00:01:52,130  -->  00:01:54,573
So with that said, I'll see you in the next one.
