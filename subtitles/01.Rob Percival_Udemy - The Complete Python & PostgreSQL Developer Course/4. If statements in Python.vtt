00:00:00.560  -->  00:00:05.470
Hi come back in this video we're going to look at if statements.

2

00:00:05.550  -->  00:00:12.660
The objective of this video is to print out all the numbers that are greater than 5 remember not print

3

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:15.570
out false or true but print out the number itself.

4

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:23.170
If it is greater than 5 so you can take a stab at it if you want.

5

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:25.710
Remember what we're looking at is if statements.

6

00:00:25.770  -->  00:00:33.310
So if you want to try and just draw the for loop and try and print that out you can do.

7

00:00:33.520  -->  00:00:41.400
But instead of diving right into the for loop Let's backtrack a bit and exit the for loop and just look

8

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:47.040
at the if statement by itself and that will give you a hint as to how you can do the for loop.

9

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:50.880
Show 5 is greater than 3 is true.

10

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:52.620
And we know this.

11

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:55.170
So true has a special meaning.

12

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:56.460
True with a capital T.

13

00:00:56.460  -->  00:01:00.130
Notice how it's not a string has a special meaning.

14

00:01:00.170  -->  00:01:06.990
And three years and five has false which is a capital F that also has special meaning in Python.

15

00:01:06.990  -->  00:01:14.670
True means that something is true is right is OK and false means that something is not OK or not true

16

00:01:14.680  -->  00:01:15.280
.

17

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:19.200
So normally we want to do things in our program.

18

00:01:19.200  -->  00:01:27.410
When something becomes true for example say you've got a game and the player is earning money.

19

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:32.780
And eventually if the money is greater than 100 you want to tell them they've won.

20

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:36.640
So your program might check the money every second.

21

00:01:36.990  -->  00:01:41.600
And if the money is greater than 100 then it will tell the player that they've won.

22

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:44.130
And if not it won't do anything.

23

00:01:44.610  -->  00:01:46.470
So that could be modeled.

24

00:01:46.470  -->  00:01:53.310
For example with an if statement we would simply say if players money greater than one hundred percent

25

00:01:53.460  -->  00:01:54.480
you've won.

26

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:01.920
So that's exactly how we're going to create our IF statements take a stab at creating an if statement

27

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:02.060
.

28

00:02:02.190  -->  00:02:08.270
Knowing that the key word is IF and we've looked up for loops.

29

00:02:08.400  -->  00:02:15.700
If this is actually really similar in the way that it's structured.

30

00:02:18.570  -->  00:02:19.130
OK.

31

00:02:19.380  -->  00:02:23.260
So the statement is similar to the for loop in the way that is structured.

32

00:02:23.310  -->  00:02:31.710
It also ends with a semi-colon Zari with a colon and it has the five greater than 3 there.

33

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:36.660
And then we've got the call on at the end we press enter and Python lets us now do something.

34

00:02:37.060  -->  00:02:38.670
So we're going to print here.

35

00:02:38.970  -->  00:02:43.760
Five is greater than three.

36

00:02:44.680  -->  00:02:52.380
And we press enter twice and then we get five it gets them three knowledge do the opposite and try something

37

00:02:52.380  -->  00:02:53.510
that is not true.

38

00:02:53.670  -->  00:03:01.140
If three is greater than 5 percent this should not happen.

39

00:03:03.450  -->  00:03:11.310
So what do you think is going to happen when I press enter twice and what we are hoping is that nothing

40

00:03:11.310  -->  00:03:12.570
will happen.

41

00:03:13.010  -->  00:03:13.960
Indeed that's the case.

42

00:03:14.100  -->  00:03:15.070
So fantastic.

43

00:03:15.090  -->  00:03:16.390
Piven is still working.

44

00:03:16.800  -->  00:03:24.960
If the expression inside the if statement is false the if statement does not execute if it is true then

45

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:26.490
it does execute.

46

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:28.410
So in this case 5 is better than 3.

47

00:03:28.410  -->  00:03:29.360
That is true.

48

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:34.030
So the print statement executes and if 3 is greater than 5 that is not true.

49

00:03:34.030  -->  00:03:36.830
So the print does not execute Okay.

50

00:03:37.080  -->  00:03:47.400
So now knowing this printout the numbers greater than 5 from our numbers list.

51

00:03:47.790  -->  00:03:54.960
So here you're going to have to use a for loop and an if statement inside it.

52

00:03:54.960  -->  00:03:58.560
So let's look at that for number in numbers.

53

00:03:59.170  -->  00:04:01.840
That's going to iterate over our list.

54

00:04:02.220  -->  00:04:06.720
And then remember number is going to be each of the numbers from 0 to 9.

55

00:04:06.900  -->  00:04:08.430
Every time the for loop runs.

56

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:14.820
So at first it's going to be 0 and then it's going to be once more and he would say if number is greater

57

00:04:14.820  -->  00:04:25.050
than 5 percent number and there we have it the numbers greater than 5 6 7 8 and 9.

58

00:04:25.910  -->  00:04:26.670
Okay.

59

00:04:26.730  -->  00:04:34.380
So now we know how to create if statements with simple boolean expressions inside them and we are able

60

00:04:34.380  -->  00:04:41.700
to printout only specific parts of the list that interest us in the next video we're going to be looking

61

00:04:41.850  -->  00:04:49.140
at this in a bit more detail and looking at another keyword in Python that we've already seen but not

62

00:04:49.140  -->  00:04:51.390
really used very much.

63

00:04:51.390  -->  00:04:52.460
So I see in the next video
