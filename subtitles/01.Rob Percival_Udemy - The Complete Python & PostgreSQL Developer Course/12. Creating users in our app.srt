1

00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:03,810
Hyde will come back and there's really we're going to be creating the users.

2

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:06,190
I recommended that you try that on your own first.

3

00:00:06,230  -->  00:00:08,010
In the last video so please do.

4

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:14,010
If you haven't already made sure that you are able to do that or at least attempt so you can enhance

5

00:00:14,010  -->  00:00:16,280
your learning that way.

6

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:24,580
Now we're going to be going into the sequel creating the new table and then saving our users here.

7

00:00:24,960  -->  00:00:26,910
Let's go into P.G. admin three

8

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:32,450
and then connected in here.

9

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:39,870
And it's going to be fairly simple just open up the learning database and here would be drop table users

10

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:39,970
.

11

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:41,000
I've already dropped it.

12

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:43,090
So it's not going to be there but.

13

00:00:43,250  -->  00:00:48,690
And you should do that just to drop the table and then create table users.

14

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:54,840
And we're going to be doing is making sure that we have an idea which is going to be a real primary

15

00:00:54,840  -->  00:00:55,650
key.

16

00:00:55,770  -->  00:00:58,510
We have an e-mail which is going to be text.

17

00:00:58,890  -->  00:01:00,970
We have a first name which is going to be text.

18

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:04,360
You can always use character varying there as well if you prefer.

19

00:01:04,860  -->  00:01:06,410
And last name which would be text.

20

00:01:06,400  -->  00:01:15,690
They're all they're both the same auth token and auth token secret to thing when you do anything else

21

00:01:15,690  -->  00:01:16,690
.

22

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:19,560
First and last name that's it.

23

00:01:19,770  -->  00:01:22,930
Later on we may add in a password there as well boss.

24

00:01:22,980  -->  00:01:24,060
Now we've got that.

25

00:01:24,090  -->  00:01:27,630
So we've got our table now so these queries should work.

26

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:33,990
And that's everything we have to do really in Pascola sequel so we can close that down and then come

27

00:01:33,990  -->  00:01:39,300
back to work in the loggin dopy why file.

28

00:01:39,300  -->  00:01:42,330
We managed to ask the user to log in.

29

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:47,670
They gave us the pin We called the access token and they we made the request.

30

00:01:47,670  -->  00:01:52,710
We were able to get data out of Twitter which means that the access token was valid.

31

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:59,250
So now all we have to do is once we have the access token save the user to the database.

32

00:01:59,370  -->  00:02:00,050
OK.

33

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:04,280
So let's do that we've got the access token here.

34

00:02:04,290  -->  00:02:08,840
We're going to print it out and then we're going to create our new user in here.

35

00:02:08,940  -->  00:02:14,500
So we're going to see user and we're going to have to import that.

36

00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:19,250
I'm just importing from user import user.

37

00:02:19,490  -->  00:02:25,770
We're going to make sure that that's not and that the comment is a bit confusing and we go from using

38

00:02:25,770  -->  00:02:30,540
import user We're just importing the user class from our user Doppie file.

39

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:32,350
That's all we're doing.

40

00:02:32,550  -->  00:02:35,970
And now we have to put in here email and so on.

41

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:37,920
So let's ask the user for their email

42

00:02:42,190  -->  00:02:46,440
list as they use it for the first name.

43

00:02:48,330  -->  00:02:51,760
Let's ask the user for the last name.

44

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:58,270
Make sure that is equal sign there and that's it.

45

00:02:58,290  -->  00:03:02,410
I think e-mail first and last name and then these two things we have.

46

00:03:02,640  -->  00:03:04,760
And the ID is automatically generated.

47

00:03:04,770  -->  00:03:06,060
So that's all we need.

48

00:03:06,090  -->  00:03:17,040
And here in the User we can say email first name last name and here we can put an access token auth

49

00:03:17,100  -->  00:03:25,700
token access token auth token secret and none for the ID.

50

00:03:25,740  -->  00:03:28,690
The ID gets generated automatically.

51

00:03:28,710  -->  00:03:34,680
So now we have our object going to say user equals that user don't safe to DBI.

52

00:03:35,080  -->  00:03:40,840
OK let's press play and see if that goes in the database or not.

53

00:03:41,490  -->  00:03:46,790
We might need Peachi admonitory again when I authorize the app.

54

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:49,480
Copy that button and.

55

00:03:51,000  -->  00:04:01,490
We're going to enter or e-mail a first name last name none type object has no match up you'd get corn

56

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:01,940
.

57

00:04:02,250  -->  00:04:08,500
We found this before and I'm sure you know how to fix that.

58

00:04:08,520  -->  00:04:09,740
That is something we really couldn't.

59

00:04:09,840  -->  00:04:11,850
But in all honesty I forgot.

60

00:04:11,910  -->  00:04:19,650
And it's totally acceptable to forget to do this just as long as you know that the era means something

61

00:04:19,650  -->  00:04:20,190
.

62

00:04:20,280  -->  00:04:21,770
It's not something wrong with our code.

63

00:04:21,810  -->  00:04:22,870
Well it is.

64

00:04:22,870  -->  00:04:24,810
It's just we forgot to do something.

65

00:04:25,140  -->  00:04:28,470
And if you know what that is I would encourage you to go and do that.

66

00:04:28,470  -->  00:04:30,330
Solve this problem.

67

00:04:30,360  -->  00:04:35,580
And if you don't just wait for a couple of moments and we'll do that here.

68

00:04:37,810  -->  00:04:38,870
OK.

69

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:39,960
I'm sure you got it.

70

00:04:39,970  -->  00:04:42,030
But just in case you didn't.

71

00:04:42,050  -->  00:04:43,440
Let's go over it here.

72

00:04:43,470  -->  00:04:48,330
What we forgot to do was initialize our database so we have to do that.

73

00:04:48,360  -->  00:04:57,940
So let's go and import from the database import database and then database not initialize.

74

00:04:58,020  -->  00:04:59,900
And what we have to pass in here.

75

00:05:00,000  -->  00:05:05,110
If you remember correctly are the properties that we need for that connection.

76

00:05:05,130  -->  00:05:12,420
So for logging in to our database and if I remember correctly where we need our user which is postscripts

77

00:05:14,700  -->  00:05:19,620
password which is 1 2 3 4 host which is local host

78

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:27,890
database which is learning.

79

00:05:28,920  -->  00:05:30,150
I can't recall if there's anything else.

80

00:05:30,150  -->  00:05:33,330
Let's try and run that.

81

00:05:33,330  -->  00:05:36,360
See that's it.

82

00:05:36,420  -->  00:05:39,570
Another option will be to check the code from the last section

83

00:05:50,620  -->  00:05:52,780
but it seems that was all that was necessary.

84

00:05:52,950  -->  00:05:56,030
So now we have our tweets.

85

00:05:56,040  -->  00:06:00,080
Again we haven't stopped printing them so they're still coming out down here.

86

00:06:00,150  -->  00:06:05,580
We're still requesting the computer images tweets and we're still printing them out.

87

00:06:05,730  -->  00:06:10,650
But now we would expect them to be a user in our database at least one road.

88

00:06:10,680  -->  00:06:12,540
So let's launch BGM entry again.

89

00:06:12,540  -->  00:06:15,780
Maybe it should have closed it in the beginning.

90

00:06:15,780  -->  00:06:23,160
Connect to that and now launch the learning database.

91

00:06:23,160  -->  00:06:26,850
And there we indeed do have it.

92

00:06:27,210  -->  00:06:34,940
This auth token and or in secret as well as the email the first name and the last name.

93

00:06:35,970  -->  00:06:38,550
So now there is actually a lot we can do.

94

00:06:38,550  -->  00:06:45,090
And I would encourage you to do stuff with this code now that you know a bit more about Python you know

95

00:06:45,090  -->  00:06:50,690
how to retrieve things from a database and you have your off token saved there.

96

00:06:50,730  -->  00:06:56,430
What I would encourage you to do is ask the user for their e-mail when they start up the application

97

00:06:57,210  -->  00:06:59,370
see if they have an e-mail in here.

98

00:06:59,970  -->  00:07:05,400
Retrieve the ortho can and Ortho-K and secret create the token and make a Twitter request.

99

00:07:05,400  -->  00:07:09,930
With that we're going to be doing that in the next few videos.

100

00:07:10,080  -->  00:07:13,460
But I would really encourage you to try that on your own.

101

00:07:13,950  -->  00:07:17,490
Well we have now is the data saved to the database.

102

00:07:17,490  -->  00:07:20,640
Now we need to be able to retrieve it and use it.

103

00:07:20,640  -->  00:07:27,120
So as I said we're going to be asking the user for their e-mail and then we're going to be just skipping

104

00:07:27,150  -->  00:07:30,350
all of this stuff if we have an e-mail already.

105

00:07:31,050  -->  00:07:34,680
But we're not going to do that in this video because once again it is a bit long so I'll be seeing you

106

00:07:34,680  -->  00:07:36,000
in the very next one.

107

00:07:36,000  -->  00:07:37,160
Well we're going to be doing just that.

108

00:07:37,170  -->  00:07:40,710
But again try that on your own first if you can.

109

00:07:40,710  -->  00:07:42,830
It's a lot better for learning.

110

00:07:43,320  -->  00:07:43,780
OK.

111

00:07:43,780  -->  00:07:45,830
I'll see you in the next video.
