00:00:01,230  -->  00:00:07,140
Find Welcome Back in this video we're looking at moving around and using the terminal.

2

00:00:07,140  -->  00:00:11,790
The terminal is just an interface to your operating system.

3

00:00:11,790  -->  00:00:16,760
What I've got here is the finder which in Mac is just like the Windows Explorer.

4

00:00:16,820  -->  00:00:22,710
It shows me the files that are available in one of my folders and we all know how this kind of works

5

00:00:22,710  -->  00:00:23,310
.

6

00:00:23,310  -->  00:00:28,020
And as you can see here I've got two files which start with a full stop.

7

00:00:28,020  -->  00:00:34,560
And for those that were full stop or period they are hidden files and they are created by the operating

8

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:36,600
system so don't worry about these two files.

9

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:40,660
I know that they are there but they don't really mean anything.

10

00:00:40,910  -->  00:00:49,230
Well we're going to do in this video I'm going to show you why and how the terminal behaves when compared

11

00:00:49,230  -->  00:00:54,800
to the sort of normal way of interacting with the system.

12

00:00:55,440  -->  00:01:01,290
The first command that I want to show you in the terminal is going to be the command clear and the clear

13

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:07,650
command just clears the terminal and if you have a lot of stuff written down then it just kind of goes

14

00:01:07,650  -->  00:01:11,960
up and at it puts a bunch of whitespace above the after the command.

15

00:01:12,000  -->  00:01:17,100
So let's you clear your workspace a bit of that sort on ice because the terminal can get a bit messy

16

00:01:17,140  -->  00:01:17,280
.

17

00:01:17,500  -->  00:01:24,300
If you write a lot of stuff OK but command doesn't really do anything except modify the terminal and

18

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:26,090
it may not work in some systems.

19

00:01:26,080  -->  00:01:30,510
So that's just something if you're using a Mac or a terminal that supports it that's something you can

20

00:01:31,550  -->  00:01:39,930
then ask them on that I wanted to show you is a command called PWT the P.W. the command stands for present

21

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:46,110
working directory and basically that tells you which folder you're currently in.

22

00:01:46,110  -->  00:01:55,200
So if I type enter it shows as being slash uses slash JSL VTR slash desktop and I'm going to go over

23

00:01:55,200  -->  00:02:00,290
to my desktop folder which is here when I move it down a wee bit so you can see.

24

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:06,170
And as you can see the path that is shown here by right clicking on the finer.

25

00:02:06,180  -->  00:02:13,900
I'm going to show you the path is in Macintosh HD which is my hard drive and I know that is in my laptop

26

00:02:14,020  -->  00:02:17,130
but this is not showing the path to a Macintosh.

27

00:02:17,140  -->  00:02:25,590
HD is the hard drive them in and it you save the users JSL with the desktop fold and package the is

28

00:02:25,590  -->  00:02:33,270
the hard drive and that is represented by the initial forward slash the initial four was like is the

29

00:02:33,300  -->  00:02:34,690
current hard drive.

30

00:02:34,860  -->  00:02:41,040
And if you're in Windows and you type this using the Get shell then you may see something like this

31

00:02:41,040  -->  00:02:41,290
.

32

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:44,940
See slash and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

33

00:02:45,120  -->  00:02:47,290
Which is essentially the same thing.

34

00:02:48,120  -->  00:02:50,760
So C is the hard drive or the partition that you're in.

35

00:02:50,760  -->  00:02:54,420
And then each of the sub folders is the subfolder that you're in.

36

00:02:54,420  -->  00:02:59,880
So in this case I mean desktop which is McIndoe HD they the user's folder that JSL Salvati folder and

37

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:01,900
inside that there's a desktop for it.

38

00:03:02,250  -->  00:03:06,880
And indeed if I go to jail cell of Batya you can see somewhere in here there's a best of four.

39

00:03:07,230  -->  00:03:12,410
And if I go in it then I'm going to Best up which is where the terminal is currently at.

40

00:03:12,430  -->  00:03:22,050
You can find out where you're at by typing PWT the folder I'm currently in is here shown as desktop

41

00:03:23,010  -->  00:03:28,320
and if I go to a different folder then this thing here will change to show the folders name that I'm

42

00:03:28,320  -->  00:03:35,240
currently in but to get the full path you need to type PWT.

43

00:03:35,310  -->  00:03:37,310
So how do we go to a different folder.

44

00:03:37,650  -->  00:03:40,730
Well that's done with the cd command.

45

00:03:40,790  -->  00:03:44,690
It stands for change directory.

46

00:03:45,210  -->  00:03:51,180
We can for example go to the JSL VTR folder which is the parent folder the parent folder just means

47

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:53,740
that it contains the Desktop folder.

48

00:03:53,850  -->  00:03:57,700
So the Desktop folder is inside the JSL VITTIA folder.

49

00:03:57,810  -->  00:04:02,850
And if I want to go up a level if I want to go to the parent folder the only thing I have to do is type

50

00:04:02,910  -->  00:04:03,630
CD.

51

00:04:03,930  -->  00:04:13,710
And then two periods and then as you can see I'm in now in the U.S. slash JSL VTR folder.

52

00:04:13,890  -->  00:04:20,940
This is a special folder because the JSL VTR user which is the user which I use to log in to this computer

53

00:04:21,960  -->  00:04:24,680
is the user that I'm currently logged in as.

54

00:04:25,050  -->  00:04:33,960
So the current user is JSL Batya that's me and the users slash JSL which folder is this user's home

55

00:04:33,990  -->  00:04:34,610
folder.

56

00:04:34,840  -->  00:04:38,080
Essentially the folder that belongs to this user.

57

00:04:38,580  -->  00:04:43,390
And that's also a special folder and it's as shown as this small Tildy.

58

00:04:44,330  -->  00:04:48,980
So that really just means and slash user slash genocide.

59

00:04:49,740  -->  00:04:56,570
Or if you're using your own user then it could be slash users slash your user name.

60

00:04:56,580  -->  00:05:02,780
Let's go once again into the Desktop folder by typing CD desktop.

61

00:05:02,970  -->  00:05:10,680
And now let's go onto the next command which is to create a directory in these terminals that's known

62

00:05:10,680  -->  00:05:19,050
as make a directory and the command is M-K there for make directory and then here after we can a space

63

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:24,210
and then type in the directory name that we want the terminal does not allow us.

64

00:05:24,360  -->  00:05:31,260
Not easily to type spaces in directory names because this base is used to tell the terminal that this

65

00:05:31,260  -->  00:05:33,810
is a different command or something like that.

66

00:05:34,050  -->  00:05:38,900
So if you want to use spaces you need to use quotation marks to type your directory name.

67

00:05:39,060  -->  00:05:41,390
And if not you can just type it without quotation marks.

68

00:05:41,460  -->  00:05:44,380
So I'm going to create a directory cast and that's what they do that.

69

00:05:44,490  -->  00:05:48,580
You'll see it appear here on the Desktop folder.

70

00:05:48,600  -->  00:05:49,440
There you go.

71

00:05:49,800  -->  00:05:56,710
So that is the folder and I'm going to go into the folder by doing CD test.

72

00:05:56,820  -->  00:06:02,260
So now this terminal is inside the test folder.

73

00:06:03,150  -->  00:06:08,480
So let's create another directory and then go in and see if that has worked.

74

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:15,710
I'm going to create a directory once again with empty dirt and it's going to be work and always and

75

00:06:15,750  -->  00:06:18,210
it doesn't appear because we are not inside that folder.

76

00:06:18,360  -->  00:06:23,170
But if I go in it the work directory is there.

77

00:06:23,580  -->  00:06:30,880
Now let's delete that directory because it is a test directory to delete something just to r m for remove

78

00:06:30,890  -->  00:06:31,320
.

79

00:06:31,980  -->  00:06:38,830
And if it is a directory if it is a folder we need to also type Dasch are.

80

00:06:39,060  -->  00:06:43,130
And then we can type in the directory or we want to remove.

81

00:06:43,290  -->  00:06:45,000
And that is now disappeared.

82

00:06:45,480  -->  00:06:50,790
Notice that this dot D.S. store file has appeared and Mac puts that in there automatically whenever

83

00:06:50,790  -->  00:06:56,030
we access a folder using the Finder which I am doing.

84

00:06:56,640  -->  00:06:58,660
So we are in the Test folder.

85

00:06:59,160  -->  00:07:02,330
Now let's go back up to the Desktop folder.

86

00:07:02,850  -->  00:07:05,170
And surely you remember how to do that.

87

00:07:05,640  -->  00:07:07,490
And it is CD.

88

00:07:07,680  -->  00:07:12,050
And then the parent folder is always two periods.

89

00:07:12,150  -->  00:07:15,130
So now I am once again in a desktop folder.

90

00:07:16,350  -->  00:07:17,000
OK.

91

00:07:17,430  -->  00:07:18,390
That's everything for this video.

92

00:07:18,420  -->  00:07:23,010
We've learned how to get the current directory how to change directory and how to make Burek trees.

93

00:07:23,010  -->  00:07:28,770
And we've also looked at what the Tildy is which is the user's home directory.

94

00:07:28,980  -->  00:07:32,820
The purpose of this video was just to show you a bit about how the terminal works because we're going

95

00:07:32,820  -->  00:07:38,280
to be needing just a tiny bit of knowledge so we can interact with Gates a bit more easily.

96

00:07:38,280  -->  00:07:41,550
So without further ado I'll see you in the next video.
