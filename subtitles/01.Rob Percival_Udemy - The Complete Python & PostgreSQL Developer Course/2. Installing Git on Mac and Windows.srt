1

00:00:00,170  -->  00:00:04,760
I will come back in this video let's download it and install it.

2

00:00:04,830  -->  00:00:14,040
The first thing to do is if you are on Mac or Linux go to get bashed CM dot com then go to the download

3

00:00:14,040  -->  00:00:21,740
section and here you can download the package for Mac which will install get on your Mac.

4

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:29,700
If you are on Linux then you can install it using your package manager and simply execute these in your

5

00:00:29,700  -->  00:00:32,060
console in your terminal if you're in Linux.

6

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:34,470
And depending on which distribution you're using.

7

00:00:34,470  -->  00:00:40,710
So if you're using Ubuntu which is probably the most popular then just open up your console and run

8

00:00:40,800  -->  00:00:45,200
apt get install get your windows.

9

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:49,140
Then there's some special instructions for you that is going to make your life a lot easier.

10

00:00:49,150  -->  00:00:54,810
Let's switch over to Windows and I'll show you exactly what I mean.

11

00:00:54,810  -->  00:01:01,700
Normally in Windows when you open up the CMB command prompt you get something like this.

12

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:07,300
And to be honest the Windows Command Prompt just isn't very good.

13

00:01:07,860  -->  00:01:09,320
So we don't want to use that.

14

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,670
It doesn't really support it very well.

15

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:17,370
So what to do instead is we're going to install another command prompt that is meant to emulate that

16

00:01:17,370  -->  00:01:19,650
of Linux and Mac.

17

00:01:19,650  -->  00:01:24,350
And it also includes it and it comes under the name of get for Windows.

18

00:01:24,480  -->  00:01:35,130
Just go to get dash for Dash windows doc get hub doc I O and then download it and once that's downloaded

19

00:01:35,400  -->  00:01:40,320
you can run that and I'm going to speed up through this bit and then continue once it's finished

20

00:01:40,320  -->  00:01:46,590
.

21

00:01:46,590  -->  00:01:47,010
OK.

22

00:01:47,100  -->  00:01:48,220
Now that's downloaded.

23

00:01:48,270  -->  00:01:52,580
Let's just go and open it up.

24

00:01:55,500  -->  00:02:01,430
You can tell I don't use Windows very often because I've still got that user access control.

25

00:02:01,560  -->  00:02:02,470
So just press.

26

00:02:02,480  -->  00:02:05,240
Next this is the license you can read it if you want.

27

00:02:05,490  -->  00:02:06,750
And then wait to install it.

28

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:10,830
I'm going to leave it at the default and I recommend you do the same unless you have a specific reason

29

00:02:10,830  -->  00:02:11,730
not to.

30

00:02:12,120  -->  00:02:15,860
And then here is what is important.

31

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:21,800
I would take both of these checkboxes and get Basheer get gooey here.

32

00:02:22,050  -->  00:02:26,750
These are just going to make your life a bit easier when it comes to integrating with Windows Explorer

33

00:02:26,760  -->  00:02:34,860
is going to let you right click on a folder and open a get graphical interface or a get to bash which

34

00:02:34,860  -->  00:02:37,770
is a shell like a console in that folder.

35

00:02:37,770  -->  00:02:38,800
That's quite nice.

36

00:02:38,890  -->  00:02:43,450
You can put an icon on the desktop if you want and leave these checked.

37

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:53,130
This is quite important especially associate dot s h files to be run with bash and bash is a sort of

38

00:02:53,130  -->  00:03:00,940
language slash thing used in Unix console's the Linux on the Mac terminals the console.

39

00:03:01,650  -->  00:03:10,830
And what you get for Windows does it installs and lets you run bash at least some of it in the program

40

00:03:10,830  -->  00:03:11,520
that it installs.

41

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:16,380
So it's important that you associate doc S.H. files to be run with bash because that's the only thing

42

00:03:16,380  -->  00:03:18,780
that can be run with really.

43

00:03:18,800  -->  00:03:23,370
And finally you don't get config files with a default text editor that's something you can do if you

44

00:03:23,370  -->  00:03:29,790
want but you can leave the unchecked if you prefer to use a different text editor than the default.

45

00:03:30,730  -->  00:03:38,580
OK you can also create a start menu and then this is also important.

46

00:03:38,580  -->  00:03:44,130
You can use get from get bash which is the program that this is installing.

47

00:03:44,130  -->  00:03:49,130
You can use get from the windows command prompt which is the program that we saw earlier.

48

00:03:49,740  -->  00:03:59,810
And this allows you to use some get commands in the windows console and that can sometimes and overwrite

49

00:04:00,000  -->  00:04:02,210
some of the things that are already there.

50

00:04:02,760  -->  00:04:08,070
And finally you'd get an optional Unix tools from the windows command prompt.

51

00:04:08,070  -->  00:04:14,880
So what this does is it allows you to do more things that are available for Mac and Linux users from

52

00:04:14,910  -->  00:04:19,980
the windows command prompt but it overrides some other things that are already there as well.

53

00:04:20,250  -->  00:04:25,200
So up to you which when you want to do and what I'm going to do is I'm going to use get to from get

54

00:04:25,200  -->  00:04:28,900
back only because I like console better.

55

00:04:28,980  -->  00:04:30,660
And I would encourage you to do the same.

56

00:04:30,660  -->  00:04:34,910
You can open up this program when you want to use it.

57

00:04:35,220  -->  00:04:42,390
And if you want to use the Windows command prompt then you can use that for other things.

58

00:04:42,390  -->  00:04:44,210
And this is also important.

59

00:04:44,580  -->  00:04:47,960
Check out windows style commit unique style line endings.

60

00:04:48,270  -->  00:04:55,110
Leave this checked and that's just because a Windows adds a special character at the end of every line

61

00:04:55,130  -->  00:04:55,400
.

62

00:04:55,740  -->  00:04:57,350
And Unix doesn't.

63

00:04:57,360  -->  00:04:58,910
Or rather it adds a different character.

64

00:04:59,040  -->  00:05:04,860
And if you commit Unix style it means that people are using a Mac or Linux are going to be able to download

65

00:05:04,920  -->  00:05:07,560
your code and look at it and run it.

66

00:05:07,950  -->  00:05:15,150
Whereas if you commit as is then I am the one who tells you that choosing this option is not recommended

67

00:05:15,150  -->  00:05:21,180
for Krotz but from projects if your users or rather other developers are going to be using Mac or Linux

68

00:05:21,240  -->  00:05:22,820
then they're going to have problems.

69

00:05:22,860  -->  00:05:26,210
So leave this one checked like that.

70

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:29,140
And finally you've got a couple of things here.

71

00:05:29,280  -->  00:05:33,550
You've got Mindy D-y or the windows the FULDE console window mentees.

72

00:05:33,630  -->  00:05:41,510
Why is just an emulator so emulates a console in Linux or a Mac.

73

00:05:41,730  -->  00:05:44,380
And I would leave that checked.

74

00:05:44,490  -->  00:05:48,720
And finally these things I'll just leave them checked they are just for convenience.

75

00:05:49,110  -->  00:05:50,150
And there you go.

76

00:05:50,310  -->  00:05:53,220
Once that's done you can proceed.

77

00:05:53,250  -->  00:05:57,780
And as you can tell or just left everything as a default and this instance that the defaults are good

78

00:05:57,780  -->  00:05:59,540
options.

79

00:05:59,540  -->  00:06:00,450
And that's not done.

80

00:06:00,450  -->  00:06:05,440
So we're going to just launch it so I can show you what it is and what it's like.

81

00:06:05,910  -->  00:06:07,840
And that is what it looks like.

82

00:06:07,860  -->  00:06:14,010
This is the Minniti y emulator that we installed and it's essentially the get shell.

83

00:06:14,520  -->  00:06:20,270
Now when I'm recording I'm going to be recording on the Mac because that's my operating system.

84

00:06:20,280  -->  00:06:22,420
I'm running Windows in a virtual machine.

85

00:06:22,740  -->  00:06:24,910
So it's just easier for me to to record on the Mac.

86

00:06:24,970  -->  00:06:32,580
So when running on the Mac but if you use this console here that's when interest and then you're going

87

00:06:32,580  -->  00:06:34,510
to be able to do everything I'm doing on the Mac.

88

00:06:35,040  -->  00:06:38,850
If you use the Windows command prompt the CMB

89

00:06:41,520  -->  00:06:43,910
then you will not be able to do everything.

90

00:06:44,070  -->  00:06:48,510
So for example in here I can do VI and that launches a text editor.

91

00:06:48,720  -->  00:06:52,850
And here I can do VI because it doesn't exist in Windows.

92

00:06:52,940  -->  00:07:00,860
So use this control that in work use this console when you want to go along.

93

00:07:00,860  -->  00:07:05,940
What I'm doing in the course and you can use the Windows command prompt for Windows things if you know

94

00:07:06,030  -->  00:07:09,600
about it and just don't use it if you don't have a reason to.

95

00:07:09,660  -->  00:07:12,850
So again stick to this console and you'll be fine.

96

00:07:12,960  -->  00:07:13,770
And also you can watch video
