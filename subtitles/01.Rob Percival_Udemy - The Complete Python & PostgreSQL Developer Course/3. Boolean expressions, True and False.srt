00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:06,280
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to look at boolean expressions Boullion.

2

00:00:06,360  -->  00:00:14,280
The word comes from a guy called George Boole who is a mathematician from the UK and he was the pioneer

3

00:00:14,430  -->  00:00:18,440
of this boolean logic and essentially boolean logic.

4

00:00:18,450  -->  00:00:26,850
All it is is a set of operators that allow us to decide whether something is true or false.

5

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:31,360
Some of these we already know for example 5 is greater than 3.

6

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:36,450
That is a boolean expression and evaluates to true.

7

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:42,710
So how could you in Python represent that.

8

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:50,980
Let's create a variable called greater than 3 and then make it equal to something.

9

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:54,420
And this is going to be five is greater than 3.

10

00:00:54,420  -->  00:01:00,170
Take a guess as to how you could represent this five greater than three.

11

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:00,960
In Python

12

00:01:05,520  -->  00:01:10,190
The answer is using the mathematical operator for greater than.

13

00:01:10,200  -->  00:01:13,470
Which is the crocodile clip looking to the right.

14

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:18,300
So five greater than three returns a boolean value.

15

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:26,100
So let's say greater than 3 and that will give us the value of a variable which we know contains the

16

00:01:26,370  -->  00:01:33,830
result of this expression which is true not is true comes with a capital T.

17

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:37,470
And that's important in Python.

18

00:01:37,470  -->  00:01:44,310
So now we've got the ability to evaluate whether something is greater than or less than or equal to

19

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:45,620
.

20

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:49,600
How would you evaluate whether something is equal to 5.

21

00:01:49,620  -->  00:01:52,770
So let's create a variable equal to 5.

22

00:01:53,940  -->  00:01:59,310
And now remember one equals sign is used to assign a value.

23

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:01,140
So for example equal to 5.

24

00:02:01,410  -->  00:02:06,180
In this case 5 would be coming in and be assigned to a variable.

25

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:13,590
So how would you compare five with five to verify that it is equal to 5.

26

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:23,850
So what we want here is say equal to 5 it's true if this number is equal to 5.

27

00:02:24,300  -->  00:02:31,120
So the answer to that if we use another equal sign then this is also assignment.

28

00:02:31,320  -->  00:02:37,920
So here what we're doing is we're assigning 5 to 5 and they are assigning 5 to equal to 5 and we don't

29

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:38,690
really want to do that.

30

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:44,130
What we want to do is say equal to 5 is true because 5 and 5 are the same.

31

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:47,760
So what we do is we use two equal signs instead of one.

32

00:02:47,760  -->  00:02:53,770
So now we've got equal to 5 is the result of five equal equal five.

33

00:02:53,930  -->  00:02:56,970
So equal equal means we're comparing their values.

34

00:02:56,970  -->  00:02:58,590
So we're saying five is five.

35

00:02:58,590  -->  00:02:59,860
Five is equal to five.

36

00:02:59,880  -->  00:03:01,220
Yes that's true.

37

00:03:01,230  -->  00:03:09,010
So this evaluates to true and that goes into equal to 5 that are now equal to 5 contains the value truth

38

00:03:09,280  -->  00:03:10,180
.

39

00:03:10,180  -->  00:03:14,060
Notice that we don't have to assign this to a variable we can just say five equal equals five.

40

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:16,810
And that gives us truth as well.

41

00:03:17,040  -->  00:03:21,600
Similarly five less than three give us false because five is greater than three.

42

00:03:21,810  -->  00:03:25,260
And also we can do things like five greater than or equal to six.

43

00:03:25,270  -->  00:03:32,370
But if is false five greater than or equal to 5 gives us true and five greater than 5 gives us false

44

00:03:32,700  -->  00:03:36,650
because five and five are equal one is not greater on the other.

45

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:39,320
So that's why it gives us false.

46

00:03:39,420  -->  00:03:49,110
So knowing all of this create a for loop that will print whether each of the numbers in our numbers

47

00:03:49,110  -->  00:03:54,500
list is greater than 5.

48

00:03:55,050  -->  00:03:58,250
So it is a bit more challenging than before.

49

00:03:58,500  -->  00:04:00,690
But the only thing we have to print is true.

50

00:04:01,020  -->  00:04:06,570
If the number is greater than 5 or false if it's less than 5.

51

00:04:07,710  -->  00:04:12,110
So let's create the for loop for number in numbers.

52

00:04:12,120  -->  00:04:15,440
Now we are iterating over the numbers list.

53

00:04:15,450  -->  00:04:20,470
So number is going to be first 0 then 1 then 2 and so on.

54

00:04:20,850  -->  00:04:25,900
And what we want to do here is print number is greater than 5.

55

00:04:26,040  -->  00:04:31,200
And what this will do is if number is zero then zero greater than 5 is not true.

56

00:04:31,200  -->  00:04:38,550
It will print false then it's 1 and 5 Element falls and so on until it gets to 6 6 and 5 that's true

57

00:04:38,550  -->  00:04:38,880
.

58

00:04:38,880  -->  00:04:46,950
So what we're going to be seeing is six forces and then four troops which is exactly what we would expect

59

00:04:46,950  -->  00:04:47,440
.

60

00:04:47,550  -->  00:04:51,440
This is for the value 0 1 2 3 4 and 5.

61

00:04:51,450  -->  00:04:54,470
They are all less than or equal to 5.

62

00:04:54,660  -->  00:05:02,320
And finally six is the first number that is greater than 5 6 7 8 and 9 are all true.

63

00:05:03,870  -->  00:05:04,340
OK.

64

00:05:04,410  -->  00:05:06,420
So this is not too useful.

65

00:05:06,420  -->  00:05:11,910
Ideally what we would want to do is print this number is greater and 5 as opposed to printing.

66

00:05:11,910  -->  00:05:12,890
True.

67

00:05:13,530  -->  00:05:18,630
So we're going to look at exactly how we can do that in the next video by looking at if statements.

68

00:05:18,630  -->  00:05:19,260
So I see you there
