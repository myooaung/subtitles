00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.490
Hi are going back.

2

00:00:01.590  -->  00:00:05.850
This last video of the section which is going to be reviewing what we've learned and then we're going

3

00:00:05.850  -->  00:00:11.330
to be ready to move onto the next section where we can explore a bit more about postscripts and psycho

4

00:00:11.320  -->  00:00:20.190
OPG to this section taught us a lot about psycho OPG to how to interact with postscripts from within

5

00:00:20.190  -->  00:00:21.080
Python.

6

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:28.380
And it also taught us a lot about Python itself and things we can do such as the with statement and

7

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:31.760
how we can program our classes to interact with him.

8

00:00:31.830  -->  00:00:40.980
We've learned more about for example puppets we've learned about private variables we've learned about

9

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:47.770
passing keyword arguments we've learned about exceptions and how we can roll back a connection.

10

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:51.630
What connection pooling is why we need to commit connections.

11

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:57.870
We've learned quite a lot of stuff I'm quite proud of that I was able to transmit back to you and hopefully

12

00:00:58.250  -->  00:01:03.230
you were able to learn all that as well but sometimes it's not as easy.

13

00:01:03.270  -->  00:01:04.140
And I understand that.

14

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:10.860
So if you do have any questions do go ahead and ask in the course Q&A in the course forums because that

15

00:01:10.860  -->  00:01:13.310
is the best way to learn if you have any questions ask them.

16

00:01:13.440  -->  00:01:17.350
I would reply straight away or as soon as possible.

17

00:01:17.660  -->  00:01:24.060
So to review a table is a list that cannot be changed in the number of elements.

18

00:01:24.060  -->  00:01:29.140
And in order to define a table we need to put them inside brackets.

19

00:01:29.310  -->  00:01:32.240
And if you only have one element then you need a comma at the end.

20

00:01:32.400  -->  00:01:39.420
If you have multiple elements then you can just put them inside brackets and that's fine.

21

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:44.130
We've learned a bit about interacting with posh grace from within Python.

22

00:01:44.340  -->  00:01:51.150
We need a Carcer to be able to execute sequel and the cursor updates itself with the resultset of a

23

00:01:51.150  -->  00:01:55.470
select statement or it can be used to insert data as well.

24

00:01:55.470  -->  00:02:02.880
We've also looked at how we should put the parameters to a query in a table as the second argument to

25

00:02:02.880  -->  00:02:04.170
the Execute method.

26

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:06.870
So this Execute method here has two arguments.

27

00:02:06.870  -->  00:02:13.110
One is the query and then followed by a comma is the second argument which is the parameters that should

28

00:02:13.110  -->  00:02:21.060
be in the query we've learned about opening connections to the database we've learned about connection

29

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:27.140
pooling and why it is important because connections are not free and it takes time to open them.

30

00:02:27.210  -->  00:02:31.740
So we don't want to be destroying the connections and recreating them every time a connection pool is

31

00:02:31.740  -->  00:02:37.600
faster or more efficient even though it does take space in the memory because you have to store those

32

00:02:37.610  -->  00:02:39.890
ten connections.

33

00:02:40.080  -->  00:02:44.370
We've learned about returning the connections back to the connection pool to make sure that it does

34

00:02:44.370  -->  00:02:45.710
not empty.

35

00:02:45.720  -->  00:02:51.480
Now we've learned about the enter and exit methods to implement the with clause.

36

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:53.370
Amongst other things as well.

37

00:02:53.430  -->  00:02:59.730
So this was quite an interesting session and section I made a deliberately short I did not want to make

38

00:02:59.730  -->  00:03:07.560
a long app where I introduced all this contempt where we built something more grand because I didn't

39

00:03:07.560  -->  00:03:08.960
want to confuse you too much.

40

00:03:09.210  -->  00:03:15.610
So I thought that this section can introduce psycho OPG to and interactions with sequel and with post-arrest

41

00:03:16.440  -->  00:03:20.190
and then in the next section we can start building more interesting stuff.

42

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:24.420
So this was more about learning as much as possible in the shortest period of time.

43

00:03:24.720  -->  00:03:29.720
And now we are going to move on to creating a nice app that uses all this stuff.

44

00:03:29.840  -->  00:03:34.830
So we're going to be using Twitter integration for example to be able to log in and retrieve Twitter

45

00:03:34.830  -->  00:03:36.550
data and analyze it.

46

00:03:36.570  -->  00:03:38.090
So we're going to be quite an interesting app.

47

00:03:38.250  -->  00:03:42.230
So I hope you'll enjoy that and I'll be seeing you in the next section.
