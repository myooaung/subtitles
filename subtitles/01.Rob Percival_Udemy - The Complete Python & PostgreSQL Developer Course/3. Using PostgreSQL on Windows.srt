00:00:00,530  -->  00:00:06,660
Hi and welcome back and it's really we're looking at creating users and databases in postgrads in Windows

2

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:07,710
.

3

00:00:07,710  -->  00:00:11,380
The first thing to do is locate where you installed postscripts.

4

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:19,320
I'm going to go to the Windows Explorer and on my PC my local disk Program Files Pasqua sequel nine

5

00:00:19,330  -->  00:00:20,510
point five.

6

00:00:20,550  -->  00:00:22,460
So this is where I installed Pasqua.

7

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:27,450
And this is the default location so if you didn't change the location the most likely to be here.

8

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:35,910
And then we want to go to been been Stansel binary and usually contains everything that we can execute

9

00:00:36,120  -->  00:00:42,390
and the post-race Administration panel is one of these things we can execute.

10

00:00:42,600  -->  00:00:45,660
And then there's loads of different things here we can run.

11

00:00:45,950  -->  00:00:51,180
Now I've been having a play around with this and most don't seem to work in Windows.

12

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:54,330
For some reason but we don't care.

13

00:00:54,810  -->  00:01:01,470
And what we care about is running the PGE admin 3 which is a visual interface to Potter sequel which

14

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:02,890
is actually quite nice.

15

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:09,450
In other systems like Linux or Mac we're going to be using the terminal but lucky for Windows users

16

00:01:09,900  -->  00:01:17,640
we can use the graphical interface so just run that and then you get greeted with a very 90s sort of

17

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:22,690
graphical interface which nevertheless works quite well.

18

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:29,730
What we've got here is the Pasqua sequel server that we've installed and this is as you can tell it's

19

00:01:29,790  -->  00:01:36,540
running in local host which is your computer and port five four three two.

20

00:01:36,570  -->  00:01:42,270
The port is always denoted by that colon there and port 5:42 is the default port that we chose when

21

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:43,590
we were installing.

22

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:49,380
Let's just connect to that right click it and press connect and then you need to put in the password

23

00:01:49,500  -->  00:01:52,020
you chose during the installation.

24

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:57,140
So I'm going to put mine which is one two three four and then press OK.

25

00:01:58,050  -->  00:02:02,250
Then you have database's which is where you store data.

26

00:02:02,760  -->  00:02:06,710
You've got table spaces which we're not going to worry about at all in this course.

27

00:02:06,780  -->  00:02:08,340
And then you've got log rows.

28

00:02:08,580  -->  00:02:15,810
Logan rolls are your users and we are going to be creating one to allow us to log in the postscripts

29

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:16,860
user.

30

00:02:17,140  -->  00:02:23,220
He essentially has access to doing anything you want and that can sometimes be a bit dangerous.

31

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:28,740
So we're not going to use the postscripts user when we're dealing with data instead we're going to use

32

00:02:29,040  -->  00:02:34,410
our own custom user just for security purposes for example so we don't delete the server or things like

33

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:35,640
that by accident.

34

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:40,210
That's right click logging roads and go to new log in roll.

35

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:41,500
And here you can put in the name.

36

00:02:41,610  -->  00:02:45,000
I'm going to put my name but you can call it whatever you want.

37

00:02:45,380  -->  00:02:50,970
So I'm going to put my name in and then you're a Y.D. is not something that you can change it gets generated

38

00:02:50,970  -->  00:02:51,580
for you.

39

00:02:51,720  -->  00:02:52,920
You can write in a comment if you want.

40

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:54,940
No not necessary.

41

00:02:55,050  -->  00:03:01,060
And then definition here we can put in a password and I'm going to put in the same password again am

42

00:03:01,950  -->  00:03:03,410
just for security purposes.

43

00:03:03,420  -->  00:03:04,450
One two three four.

44

00:03:04,740  -->  00:03:05,880
That's fine.

45

00:03:06,400  -->  00:03:08,750
And again you can ignore that if you want.

46

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:14,670
The account is not going to expire in my case and also it's not going to have a number of connections

47

00:03:14,900  -->  00:03:20,640
but it is limited to if you do determine the number of connections that it's limited to then your account

48

00:03:20,670  -->  00:03:28,380
won't be able to interact with Pasqua sequel more than for example 10 times simultaneously ten connections

49

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:29,360
simultaneously.

50

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:31,410
I'm not going to worry with that for now.

51

00:03:31,440  -->  00:03:38,970
But for example if you were making an account that was being used by our web site for example you might

52

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:40,730
want to limit the number of connections.

53

00:03:40,890  -->  00:03:44,590
So your server doesn't run out of random access memory.

54

00:03:44,820  -->  00:03:46,900
That's potentially an option.

55

00:03:47,310  -->  00:03:48,750
Roll privileges.

56

00:03:48,750  -->  00:03:50,240
This is an important section.

57

00:03:50,330  -->  00:03:52,540
We can choose can create databases.

58

00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:54,540
We're not going to choose country roles.

59

00:03:54,720  -->  00:03:59,130
We're not going to do any thing else just can create databases because we're going to be creating a

60

00:03:59,130  -->  00:04:03,080
database for this use to rule membership.

61

00:04:03,120  -->  00:04:07,080
You can sometimes create roles and then members can be assigned to those roles.

62

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:10,590
So it's certainly a bit easier to reuse the roles.

63

00:04:10,720  -->  00:04:13,810
And not going to work with that in this user.

64

00:04:14,100  -->  00:04:19,530
Similarly with variables and security labels and in the end you can see the sequel code that is going

65

00:04:19,530  -->  00:04:22,070
to run to execute this user.

66

00:04:22,590  -->  00:04:29,680
So it's going to create a roll called Jose which has the ability to log in with a password on that.

67

00:04:29,700  -->  00:04:35,430
And then this is a password that is encrypted using M.D 5 which is an encryption algorithm and then

68

00:04:35,430  -->  00:04:40,250
it's going to allow it to create databases and that's valid forever.

69

00:04:40,950  -->  00:04:42,340
Ok then press OK.

70

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:44,610
And your logon Role gets created.

71

00:04:45,120  -->  00:04:48,860
And then we can go into databases and see there's already one big prosperous.

72

00:04:48,870  -->  00:04:53,400
This is for some system stuff and we're not going to be using that when we're instead going to create

73

00:04:53,400  -->  00:04:55,360
our own for learning purposes.

74

00:04:55,380  -->  00:04:58,170
So I'm going to call it learning.

75

00:04:58,590  -->  00:05:05,190
And then once again we can look at the definition and the encoding is what sort of character set we're

76

00:05:05,190  -->  00:05:05,670
using.

77

00:05:05,670  -->  00:05:08,480
UTF 8 is the most expensive.

78

00:05:08,610  -->  00:05:13,260
So we were going to use that no template that the full table space is fine.

79

00:05:13,260  -->  00:05:19,980
And then we've got a collection which is how it's how the characters are encoded or something I'm not

80

00:05:19,980  -->  00:05:21,370
really sure to be honest.

81

00:05:21,800  -->  00:05:27,930
I'm going to go for English United Kingdom as a default sort of locale and the character type as well

82

00:05:27,990  -->  00:05:28,610
.

83

00:05:28,950  -->  00:05:31,700
You can choose your own there.

84

00:05:32,270  -->  00:05:33,420
And that's it can I should limit.

85

00:05:33,420  -->  00:05:34,470
Not going to select.

86

00:05:34,470  -->  00:05:38,510
I think there are variables privileges that all fines you use a little sort are fine.

87

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:44,100
And this is the sequel code once again that what I've been running when we create this database so it's

88

00:05:44,100  -->  00:05:50,100
going to create that database learning with it being coding UTF 8 and then the collation and types are

89

00:05:50,120  -->  00:05:51,670
for United Kingdom.

90

00:05:51,670  -->  00:05:52,750
And there's no conics limit.

91

00:05:52,800  -->  00:05:56,700
So let's press OK and then we get our database here.

92

00:05:56,800  -->  00:06:03,550
So the spread on it and we get the connection so we can then see what we've got here.

93

00:06:03,570  -->  00:06:05,500
We've got catalogs.

94

00:06:05,520  -->  00:06:09,720
We're going to look at we've got extensions we're not really going to be using much of that.

95

00:06:09,840  -->  00:06:17,760
And we've got schemas which is the most important thing a schema defines and where your tables and your

96

00:06:17,760  -->  00:06:20,450
data your views and things like that live.

97

00:06:20,460  -->  00:06:25,440
So here in the public schema which is a default and the one we're going to be using we've got tables

98

00:06:25,680  -->  00:06:26,420
and views.

99

00:06:26,440  -->  00:06:30,550
Those two are the most important parts that we're going to be looking at in this course.

100

00:06:30,720  -->  00:06:36,210
So in the next video we're going to be exploring how we might go about interacting with all this stuff

101

00:06:36,230  -->  00:06:36,520
.

102

00:06:36,810  -->  00:06:37,680
So I'll see you in the next few
