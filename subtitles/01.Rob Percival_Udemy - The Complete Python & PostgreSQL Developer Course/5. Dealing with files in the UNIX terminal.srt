00:00:00,370  -->  00:00:04,670
I will welcome back in this video we're going to be talking about dealing with files.

2

00:00:04,890  -->  00:00:09,990
I'm just going to go into the Test folder here so you can see that my video 0.60 file has been created

3

00:00:09,990  -->  00:00:10,630
.

4

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:18,330
And now what I want to do is I want to rename the file because video Dotti XTi no longer is an appropriate

5

00:00:18,330  -->  00:00:20,310
name.

6

00:00:20,310  -->  00:00:25,760
There is actually no native way of renaming files.

7

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:33,930
The only thing we can do is move the file and move it from video Dr. 60 to another file with a different

8

00:00:33,930  -->  00:00:34,510
name.

9

00:00:34,770  -->  00:00:37,530
And then it going to rename the file.

10

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:40,630
So I'm going to do M.V. for move.

11

00:00:41,250  -->  00:00:48,470
And then because I am inside the Desktop folder I need to go into test and then into video that takes

12

00:00:48,470  -->  00:00:54,460
me and then I can move the file to a different location.

13

00:00:54,510  -->  00:01:03,420
For example I could move it to video not the XTi only and naturally that's going to move it from past

14

00:01:03,620  -->  00:01:06,370
slash video or text me into it up to 60.

15

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:12,720
So the file is going to disappear from the text folder and into the parent folder which is where I am

16

00:01:12,720  -->  00:01:15,120
currently at.

17

00:01:15,190  -->  00:01:15,960
So you can see the video.

18

00:01:15,960  -->  00:01:20,720
This appears there and it appears in the desktop.

19

00:01:20,760  -->  00:01:27,510
Let's undo that and do M.V. video that takes the test and this is going to move the video RTX the folder

20

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:31,710
into the Test folder without changing the name.

21

00:01:32,280  -->  00:01:33,330
So it moves it there.

22

00:01:33,390  -->  00:01:39,660
And finally to rename which is what we originally wanted to do video on site test slash video dot DXi

23

00:01:40,200  -->  00:01:41,760
into past slash.

24

00:01:41,830  -->  00:01:49,080
Hello Dottie XTi and that is going to move the file from video that takes me into hello Dottie XTi.

25

00:01:49,140  -->  00:01:53,670
So what it's doing really is renaming it.

26

00:01:53,670  -->  00:01:57,510
And as you can see the name has changed there as well.

27

00:01:58,020  -->  00:02:05,520
In some cases you are going to want to extract or read the content of a file but maybe you don't want

28

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:11,300
to launch vim because it's a bit too heavyweight just for reading the content of a file.

29

00:02:11,310  -->  00:02:16,440
So for example if we wanted to read the content of halloed ATX t we would have to do vim haloed on takes

30

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:23,670
the test on DST rather and then we'd have to read the content and then we'd have to press call on q

31

00:02:24,150  -->  00:02:25,250
to quit.

32

00:02:25,330  -->  00:02:26,810
It's just a bit of a hassle.

33

00:02:27,240  -->  00:02:33,710
And also to remember while you are modifying test slash halloed actually XTi in a computer.

34

00:02:33,900  -->  00:02:36,550
Nobody else can modify the same file or the same type.

35

00:02:36,660  -->  00:02:41,610
So even if you are opening halloed RTX the only for reading.

36

00:02:41,610  -->  00:02:44,460
Nobody else can go into that file at the same time.

37

00:02:44,480  -->  00:02:46,950
This is not important if you're using your own computer.

38

00:02:47,280  -->  00:02:52,050
But if you're using a shared computer then that might be an issue at some point.

39

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:53,400
So instead of launching vim.

40

00:02:53,430  -->  00:03:01,580
If you only want to read content use the command called cat and cat is used to concatenate things.

41

00:03:01,580  -->  00:03:07,150
That's where the name comes from but it can also be used to read things.

42

00:03:07,440  -->  00:03:13,230
So just do kept and then the file that you want to read and the contents of it come out and get displayed

43

00:03:13,230  -->  00:03:14,990
.

44

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:20,760
So this is how you can move files or rename them and also how you can display the text contents of a

45

00:03:20,760  -->  00:03:25,200
file and that's everything for this short video I just wanted to show you how you can deal with files

46

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:28,290
and move them about and stuff and that's it.

47

00:03:28,310  -->  00:03:29,100
As you the next video
