00:00:00.090  -->  00:00:04.080
Hi welcome back in this video we're looking at setting up our app.

2

00:00:04.620  -->  00:00:12.310
This app is going to allow us to create users and store them in pasta sequel using psycho Peachi too

3

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:12.680
.

4

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:19.380
It's going to be a fairly short app but nevertheless I'm really excited about going into this advanced

5

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:25.050
Python that we're going to be looking at and at interacting with Pasqua sequel being able to do the

6

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:30.300
stuff that we're going to be doing in this app is going to unlock many doors for you.

7

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:36.260
The first thing to do is to envision what the app is going to look like what files are going to be needing

8

00:00:36.270  -->  00:00:43.410
for example the first Filey you should always create in a Python project is one called the requirements

9

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:44.020
file.

10

00:00:44.100  -->  00:00:50.740
So let's right click on our project folder go to new and then file the file should be requirements dot

11

00:00:50.960  -->  00:00:54.530
XTi.

12

00:00:54.600  -->  00:01:02.130
These requirements not t XTi tells Python virtual environment what libraries the virtual environment

13

00:01:02.130  -->  00:01:08.550
needs in order to be able to run the program as we know Windows is a bit special with psycho Peachi

14

00:01:08.550  -->  00:01:09.200
too.

15

00:01:09.330  -->  00:01:15.480
But most other libraries can be installed directly with a virtual environment using for example the

16

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:17.870
on preferences that we've seen before.

17

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:22.410
And if you haven't seen them then you can open a patch on preferences.

18

00:01:22.410  -->  00:01:29.340
And in your project as a project interpreter and here you've got a bunch of libraries that you can install

19

00:01:29.850  -->  00:01:30.590
on Windows.

20

00:01:30.600  -->  00:01:34.090
You cannot install psycho-BS you to using this thing here.

21

00:01:34.410  -->  00:01:40.180
But on Mac you can and most libraries you can install using this thing.

22

00:01:40.260  -->  00:01:44.370
This thing is called Pipp and it's essentially a package repository.

23

00:01:44.490  -->  00:01:49.830
It lets you install packages for Python easily just by running a command or just installing them through

24

00:01:49.830  -->  00:01:50.510
here.

25

00:01:51.120  -->  00:01:54.930
So the packages here accept these two.

26

00:01:55.410  -->  00:02:01.140
Well except these the rather Pipp set of tools and we all really are by default installed all the other

27

00:02:01.140  -->  00:02:04.880
packages that your application uses should be in your requirements.

28

00:02:04.880  -->  00:02:06.140
Dotty XTi.

29

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:12.000
We can see that psycho OPG too is in here and its version 2.0 6.1.

30

00:02:12.330  -->  00:02:19.440
So lets press cancel and make sure that psycho G2 version 2.0 6.1 is in our requirements not textfile

31

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:25.920
so that other virtual environments that want to install our application and run it know what to install

32

00:02:25.940  -->  00:02:26.210
.

33

00:02:26.490  -->  00:02:32.500
So we simply type psycho PGE to equal equal point six point one.

34

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:34.530
And this font is really big.

35

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:37.650
So I'm going to change it down a wee bit and I'm going to show you how to do that.

36

00:02:37.650  -->  00:02:38.850
Now that we're here as well.

37

00:02:38.910  -->  00:02:44.910
Just go to your editor colors and fonts font and for some reason there is a bug that whenever I access

38

00:02:44.910  -->  00:02:47.310
the preferences the font gets bigger and bigger.

39

00:02:47.310  -->  00:02:51.140
So I have to tone it down and make sure that it is a bit smaller.

40

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:53.940
I think you can still see this fine.

41

00:02:54.240  -->  00:02:57.420
But obviously I hope I hope you can guess.

42

00:02:57.540  -->  00:03:00.970
By the time you're watching this I'm already going to have recorded everything.

43

00:03:01.660  -->  00:03:05.430
OK so apart from our requirements not TXI the file.

44

00:03:05.430  -->  00:03:07.910
We also want a couple of other files.

45

00:03:07.980  -->  00:03:14.640
The first file that we want is a python file that I'm going to call app Doppie Y and those is going

46

00:03:14.640  -->  00:03:17.280
to be the main file of our project.

47

00:03:17.280  -->  00:03:24.360
The file that we going to be running when we run our application all other files in our project are

48

00:03:24.360  -->  00:03:32.130
going to be bits of code that are going to use from within app Doppie Y and there's two of them.

49

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:36.160
There's going to be a python file called user.

50

00:03:36.330  -->  00:03:42.660
Notice how the dot P Y gets appended for you the user is going to store the class that we are going

51

00:03:42.660  -->  00:03:45.490
to be modeling users with.

52

00:03:46.050  -->  00:03:52.320
And there's also going to be another file called database and this is going to allow us to interact

53

00:03:52.320  -->  00:03:58.090
with a database we're going to put code in here to interact with a database and and retrieve data in

54

00:03:58.110  -->  00:03:59.740
that sort of stuff.

55

00:04:00.780  -->  00:04:06.330
OK so now we've set this up we know what the requirements RTX the file is and we've created our app

56

00:04:06.540  -->  00:04:10.610
our user and our database files we're ready to move on to the next video.

57

00:04:10.740  -->  00:04:11.410
So I'll see you there
