00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:07,380
Hi welcome back in the video we're going to be installing Python in order to install Python.

2

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:09,810
The only thing we have to do is come to this Web site.

3

00:00:09,810  -->  00:00:17,390
Python dot org and then hover over the download button and download Python 3.5 point 1.

4

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:22,320
If the version you see here is slightly higher than that everything is OK.

5

00:00:22,440  -->  00:00:23,450
Don't worry about it.

6

00:00:23,490  -->  00:00:28,720
You can download 3.5 point two or three point six and everything should be OK.

7

00:00:28,770  -->  00:00:34,200
So the other thing we have to do is press download and then install it like any other normal program

8

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:37,530
and that's it.

9

00:00:37,530  -->  00:00:41,740
If you are wanting to install Python on Windows Please see the windows video.

10

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:48,150
That is something extra that you have to do something small but nevertheless quite important if the

11

00:00:48,150  -->  00:00:55,110
platform that Spuyten the org suggests here is not the right platform ID if it suggests Macalester and

12

00:00:55,110  -->  00:00:57,430
you're using Windows than simply hover.

13

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:02,560
Simply click on the windows tab here or the other platforms.

14

00:01:02,610  -->  00:01:06,590
If you're using Linux and download it for that.

15

00:01:07,140  -->  00:01:07,610
OK.

16

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:10,000
So this was how to install Python on Mac.

17

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:12,600
Now in the next world you will going to install it on Windows.

18

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:17,910
And as I said if you are using Windows please do watch that video because it does contain important

19

00:01:17,910  -->  00:01:18,810
information.

20

00:01:19,260  -->  00:01:22,010
OK I'll see you in the next video.
