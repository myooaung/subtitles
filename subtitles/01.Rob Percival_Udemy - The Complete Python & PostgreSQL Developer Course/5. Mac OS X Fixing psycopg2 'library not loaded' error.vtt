00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:01.490
Find Welcome back.

2

00:00:01.560  -->  00:00:09.660
First of all let me apologize for any problem that you may be having due to the last Mac update 10 11

3

00:00:09.810  -->  00:00:12.480
El Capitan they've introduced.

4

00:00:12.480  -->  00:00:20.580
Apple has a small thing that nevertheless has affected the way the Pasqua sequel installs and it could

5

00:00:20.580  -->  00:00:24.300
be the cause of your problem.

6

00:00:24.960  -->  00:00:34.350
When we import psycho-BS you to here in Ideally it is possible that when you press enter something happens

7

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:39.510
a bunch of red text appears and it tells you something like library not loaded.

8

00:00:39.510  -->  00:00:42.540
Reason image not found.

9

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:49.840
And it's a few lines of hour of text and it can be a bit confusing understanding why that happens.

10

00:00:50.040  -->  00:00:51.080
So in this video.

11

00:00:51.300  -->  00:00:53.220
Let's go over how you can fix this error.

12

00:00:53.370  -->  00:01:00.330
And if this doesn't happen for you if you can import OPG to and that works then you do not have to worry

13

00:01:00.330  -->  00:01:06.150
about this video at all you can just skip it but if something does happen then please try the solution

14

00:01:06.150  -->  00:01:08.590
presented here first.

15

00:01:09.000  -->  00:01:16.590
The problem that you may be seeing is that when OSX introduced its new feature which is called the System

16

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:25.920
Integrity protection postgresql was not able to tell Python and the computer where to find some required

17

00:01:25.920  -->  00:01:27.260
code.

18

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:33.900
So what we have to do is to tell our computer when that code is and put it somewhere where the computer

19

00:01:33.900  -->  00:01:35.460
can find it.

20

00:01:35.460  -->  00:01:40.890
So what we're going to do is just go over those steps and the first thing we have to do is to figure

21

00:01:40.890  -->  00:01:43.650
out where Pasqua sequel is installed.

22

00:01:43.950  -->  00:01:50.130
And this normally will be the same place where actually it will be the same place as where we run our

23

00:01:50.910  -->  00:01:52.410
PGE admin program.

24

00:01:52.410  -->  00:02:01.650
So here in Mac it'll be in aside your Macintosh HD then it'll be inside the library and then it'll be

25

00:02:01.650  -->  00:02:05.110
in say pasta sequel and then nine point five.

26

00:02:05.280  -->  00:02:10.470
And as you can a pgm in series here and then you've got your bin folder where there's a bunch of stuff

27

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:16.440
and we've actually done a couple of scenarios used stuff here but really what we're interested on right

28

00:02:16.440  -->  00:02:19.550
now is in the lib folder.

29

00:02:20.100  -->  00:02:29.490
So the lib folder contains a bunch of code that Pasqua sequel uses which psycho-BS you two needs but

30

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:34.680
due to these new changes in OS X Pasko sequel has not been able to.

31

00:02:34.680  -->  00:02:39.610
Upon installation give them to us in a way that we can understand.

32

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:44.830
So all we have to do is to do the following.

33

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:52.410
You have to open up a terminal and that you can do just by opening up spotlight and typing in terminal

34

00:02:52.560  -->  00:02:57.600
and then you can load up the terminal like that and then you'll be presented with something that looks

35

00:02:57.600  -->  00:02:59.390
more or less like this.

36

00:02:59.380  -->  00:03:15.260
And all we have to do here is to say pseudo L.N. that S and then we're going to say slash library.

37

00:03:15.660  -->  00:03:18.100
And this is where it Pasqua sequel is installed.

38

00:03:18.330  -->  00:03:29.040
Slash Pascua sequel slash nine point five slash lib slash and there at the end of the error message

39

00:03:29.040  -->  00:03:36.640
in idealy which would look something like what you see now on the screen is quite scary error message

40

00:03:37.140  -->  00:03:42.800
but really what we're looking for is the please that says library not loaded.

41

00:03:43.320  -->  00:03:50.630
And then I'll be one of Liberty Assael 1.0 point o dot D Y lib or lib crypto.

42

00:03:50.700  -->  00:03:54.160
At one point 0.00 not D-y lib or lib.

43

00:03:54.190  -->  00:03:58.800
P-Q got 5 Datti widely so library not loaded.

44

00:03:58.800  -->  00:04:05.760
We'll see one of those three things and then what we want to do is go ahead and do pseudo Ellen dash

45

00:04:05.780  -->  00:04:09.660
X slash library slash Pasko sequel slash nine point five lushly.

46

00:04:09.930  -->  00:04:13.490
And then the name of the thing that idealy told you was missing.

47

00:04:13.500  -->  00:04:21.140
So Lyd SSL don't onepoint 0.00 point D-y lib.

48

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:29.810
And then you're going to do is a slash user slash local slash lib and then we're going to do that.

49

00:04:29.820  -->  00:04:33.870
It'll ask you for your password and you just have to put that in

50

00:04:36.900  -->  00:04:37.860
and then that'll be that.

51

00:04:37.860  -->  00:04:42.220
In my case it says it already exists because I've already done this in the past.

52

00:04:42.540  -->  00:04:51.570
But in your scenario it may just not say anything and then you can just try to turn ideally off and

53

00:04:51.570  -->  00:04:56.290
turn it on again and try to import takeable you again and maybe it will tell you the same error message

54

00:04:56.290  -->  00:05:00.740
or a very similar error message but with a slightly different library that's missing.

55

00:05:00.930  -->  00:05:06.810
And in that case all Lello have to ask you to do is to repeat this command here but with a slightly

56

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:12.510
different name of the end and that will be once again the name that idealy is telling you is missing

57

00:05:14.540  -->  00:05:20.280
and there should only be a maximum of three things that you need to do and once you've done those things

58

00:05:20.850  -->  00:05:24.230
then everything should just kind of work when taken.

59

00:05:24.480  -->  00:05:31.290
If it doesn't then please do ask a question and of course Chione were always available to help you.

60

00:05:31.830  -->  00:05:32.880
Sorry about these problems.

61

00:05:32.940  -->  00:05:37.950
Hopefully together we can overcome them and get started with an encyclopedia too.

62

00:05:38.370  -->  00:05:40.310
So that's it and I'll see you in the very next few
