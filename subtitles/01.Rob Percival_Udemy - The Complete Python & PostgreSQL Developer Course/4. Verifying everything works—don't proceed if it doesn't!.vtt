00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:05.580
I will come back in this video we're verifying that the same group e.g. to library that we've installed

2

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:07.290
is working.

3

00:00:07.920  -->  00:00:12.870
What I've done is I've launched the python shell the IDL program.

4

00:00:13.260  -->  00:00:19.140
And after you've followed the instructions for Windows or Mac depending on your computer make sure to

5

00:00:19.140  -->  00:00:25.100
follow what I'm writing here in idealy to make sure that it works.

6

00:00:25.140  -->  00:00:32.940
The first thing that we want to do is type import psyco P.G. to and when we press Enter absolutely nothing

7

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:33.700
should happen.

8

00:00:33.780  -->  00:00:38.970
But if something does happen like an error then do not continue.

9

00:00:39.360  -->  00:00:45.720
And instead please watch the very next video where we go over a solution and this will only happen really

10

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:52.800
if you're using Mac and if next video solution don't work then a post in the course forums and in the

11

00:00:52.830  -->  00:00:55.870
course page and we will help you out.

12

00:00:56.340  -->  00:01:01.410
Unless you feel brave enough to try on your own which I really cannot recommend because it is quite

13

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:04.720
a confusing confusing area.

14

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:12.480
So if you've imported psycho-BS youtoo without problems then let's try our first connection to our database

15

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:18.720
the way we open a connection is going to be Taiping connection equals and we're going to create a variable

16

00:01:18.790  -->  00:01:23.850
and it's going to be psycho pg to dot connect.

17

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:27.140
And then what goes here is the database.

18

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:29.450
And we say a database equals.

19

00:01:29.550  -->  00:01:33.600
And here we put the data which we're using which is learning is called learning.

20

00:01:33.600  -->  00:01:38.200
That's the database that we use inside Patekar sequel in typing Jetman 3.

21

00:01:38.340  -->  00:01:41.960
Then we type a comma and we see a user and this is postscripts.

22

00:01:42.090  -->  00:01:49.140
Even if you created a different user it would be this one for now and then the password because the

23

00:01:49.140  -->  00:01:57.350
password for the PGA Batmen 3 connections or when you open up Jetman 3 and you can connect to the database

24

00:01:57.360  -->  00:01:57.720
.

25

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:02.130
It asks you for a password or unless you left it blank and then you should put the password in here

26

00:02:02.140  -->  00:02:02.190
.

27

00:02:02.190  -->  00:02:04.010
And Mike it is one two three four.

28

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:10.110
And finally you should also type host equals local host.

29

00:02:10.980  -->  00:02:13.520
And then when we present once again nothing should happen.

30

00:02:13.530  -->  00:02:20.100
But the variable is created if you do get an error then raise that in the course forums as well.

31

00:02:20.100  -->  00:02:24.830
Finally we're going to create a cursor and we're going to go into what that exactly is later on.

32

00:02:25.830  -->  00:02:29.130
And that's going to be connection dot cursor.

33

00:02:29.130  -->  00:02:33.410
And finally we're going to do a cursor dot execute.

34

00:02:33.480  -->  00:02:34.440
Now we're going to type in here.

35

00:02:34.440  -->  00:02:38.520
Select star from purchases.

36

00:02:38.520  -->  00:02:45.030
So if you have data in your learning database as we inserted in the last few sections then they should

37

00:02:45.030  -->  00:02:46.740
have something in it.

38

00:02:46.770  -->  00:02:57.330
So we've run that and then we're going to do for row in cursor print row and you should get some data

39

00:02:57.330  -->  00:02:58.170
out.

40

00:02:58.200  -->  00:03:01.150
This is my purchases table there.

41

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:07.350
So if you are able to do that and it works then absolutely perfect.

42

00:03:07.350  -->  00:03:10.160
You are definitely ready to move on.

43

00:03:10.240  -->  00:03:17.250
And let's start creating our app and also in this video you've learned quite succinctly how to connect

44

00:03:17.250  -->  00:03:21.120
to your postscripts database and how to execute a select statement.

45

00:03:21.150  -->  00:03:23.080
So that's two birds with one stone.

46

00:03:23.430  -->  00:03:25.150
And now we are ready to move on to the next video.

47

00:03:25.290  -->  00:03:27.380
So I'll see you there.
