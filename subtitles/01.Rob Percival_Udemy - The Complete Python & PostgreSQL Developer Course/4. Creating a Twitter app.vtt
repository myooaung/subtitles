00:00:00.650  -->  00:00:05.440
I don't come back and this video we're looking at creating our Twitter app.

2

00:00:05.990  -->  00:00:14.370
Now the app is just something to tell Twitter that we are going to be requesting access tokens and request

3

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:16.310
all kinds of things like that.

4

00:00:16.440  -->  00:00:21.720
Basically when the user logs in with Twitter they're going to receive the screen saying do you want

5

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:26.830
to authorize your Twitter app name here to use your Twitter.

6

00:00:27.480  -->  00:00:34.680
So we have to create an app so that users can authorize it and then we will use it to do the requesting

7

00:00:35.130  -->  00:00:37.310
in behalf of the user.

8

00:00:37.800  -->  00:00:41.120
So let's go to apps dot Twitter and dot com.

9

00:00:41.460  -->  00:00:43.910
And then you need to be logged in in order to do that.

10

00:00:43.910  -->  00:00:49.970
So you need to log in to Twitter or create an account and then go to create a new app.

11

00:00:50.660  -->  00:00:59.310
Here you can put in the application details and the users are going to be looking at this name so you

12

00:00:59.310  -->  00:01:01.220
can give it a different name.

13

00:01:01.230  -->  00:01:07.820
In my case I call that tweet and Eliza SAAC for school of code.

14

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:09.390
You can call it whatever you want.

15

00:01:09.390  -->  00:01:10.920
It has to be unique.

16

00:01:11.610  -->  00:01:17.670
And then a description such as what it does this application analyzes tweets.

17

00:01:18.300  -->  00:01:27.710
Its a work in progress going to that and then a web site.

18

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:35.850
We dont have a website for this app yet but we can just put none yet there or just a placeholder whatever

19

00:01:35.850  -->  00:01:36.890
you want.

20

00:01:37.260  -->  00:01:44.940
The Colback you RL is where the user is redirected to when they sign in with Twitter.

21

00:01:45.180  -->  00:01:48.700
We dont have a Web site yet so we don't have a callback Ural either.

22

00:01:48.750  -->  00:01:50.450
We can just leave it blank.

23

00:01:51.030  -->  00:01:52.980
Finally you have to agree to the developer agreement.

24

00:01:52.980  -->  00:01:55.240
You can read that if you want.

25

00:01:56.400  -->  00:02:00.000
And thats it.

26

00:02:00.320  -->  00:02:08.550
And you can just sorry it has to be a valid Web site so just put exampled or com that should be fine

27

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:12.630
and then thats it.

28

00:02:14.790  -->  00:02:22.140
So once that's done your application will be created and then you have here a few things.

29

00:02:22.350  -->  00:02:30.690
You have some details about your app and you have keys and access tokens which are important you have

30

00:02:30.690  -->  00:02:32.290
permissions.

31

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:39.000
What sort of things you're going to be doing in the users Twitter accounts and you have your settings

32

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:42.780
which Odgers your name and things like that.

33

00:02:42.930  -->  00:02:47.970
The important part is the keys and access tokens.

34

00:02:48.080  -->  00:02:52.830
In fact the most important part is the consumer key and the consumer secret.

35

00:02:52.920  -->  00:02:55.160
What is a consumer a key and a consumer secret.

36

00:02:55.380  -->  00:03:04.890
Well in order to be able to perform requests to Twitter we need to first tell Twitter that we are this

37

00:03:04.890  -->  00:03:06.170
application.

38

00:03:06.540  -->  00:03:16.590
So we need to specify these two things when we are asking for request tokens or access tokens.

39

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:24.840
If we tell to these two values here they know we tweet analyzer school of code and then we can then

40

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:29.100
ask for request tokens or for access tokens.

41

00:03:29.670  -->  00:03:35.500
So these two are important and were going to be using those in the next video when we create these loggin

42

00:03:35.520  -->  00:03:36.680
with Twitter.

43

00:03:37.530  -->  00:03:44.190
Also if you see that if you think that somebody has access to this consumer key or consumer secret for

44

00:03:44.190  -->  00:03:51.000
example if you share it with somebody then you should regenerate consumer and see and make sure that

45

00:03:51.000  -->  00:03:53.240
nobody has access to these numbers.

46

00:03:53.550  -->  00:03:56.000
They are they should be private they should be secret.

47

00:03:56.040  -->  00:03:56.850
OK.

48

00:03:57.810  -->  00:03:58.640
That's right.

49

00:03:59.130  -->  00:04:02.950
And then we're going to be going into the next video.

50

00:04:03.010  -->  00:04:09.270
We're going to be looking at creating this log in with Twitter in a console so that we get the full

51

00:04:09.270  -->  00:04:11.550
flow of how this really works.

52

00:04:11.550  -->  00:04:13.160
So what's your next video.
