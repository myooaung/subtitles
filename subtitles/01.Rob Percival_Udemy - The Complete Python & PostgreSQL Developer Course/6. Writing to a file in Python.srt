Hi all come back in this video we're going to be looking at writing to a file.

2

00:00:05,730  -->  00:00:09,210
And this really is not going to be related to the app that we've created so far.

3

00:00:09,450  -->  00:00:16,260
I just wanted to introduce you to how you might open a file right to it and then close it so that in

4

00:00:16,260  -->  00:00:23,970
the next few videos we can work on saving our users and our movies to a file in life and it's actually

5

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:29,460
really simple to open a file and write to it.

6

00:00:29,490  -->  00:00:34,760
The only thing you have to do is use the open method.

7

00:00:34,800  -->  00:00:42,430
In fact what we're going to do is use the special construct and the reason we're using the special construct

8

00:00:42,430  -->  00:00:48,000
that I'm going to show you in a moment is because of the need of closing files when you've finished

9

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:50,310
writing to them.

10

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:53,140
If you open a file and you don't close it.

11

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:56,270
Python may not finish writing to it.

12

00:00:56,310  -->  00:01:03,120
What you told it to write therefore it is especially important that when you open a file and then write

13

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:05,890
to it you close it at the end.

14

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:10,860
And this plays in nicely with a special construct that I'm going to show you because this construct

15

00:01:10,920  -->  00:01:14,730
takes care of closing the file when you're done with it.

16

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:20,580
So you don't have to remember about closing the file if you use this construct and the construct is

17

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:25,160
as follows with open.

18

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:40,160
And then your file name my file Dotti XTi comma w as F and then you can here do something.

19

00:01:40,590  -->  00:01:44,260
Let me explain exactly what this does.

20

00:01:44,280  -->  00:01:49,220
The key part here for opening a file is this bit of the line here.

21

00:01:49,230  -->  00:02:00,300
Open my file are tasty and w it has to be w if you want to write to the file because write starts with

22

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:07,920
a W if you want to read from the file you would use R and there is a number of other letters you can

23

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:10,330
use to do different things.

24

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:17,910
No going to go into them here because we simply don't need either w anything other than w r.

25

00:02:18,720  -->  00:02:29,850
Finally as F. says open this file using the writing mode and call it f and the file is going to be called

26

00:02:29,880  -->  00:02:30,480
f.

27

00:02:30,510  -->  00:02:41,190
So now when we want to interact with the file we can say F dot right and then hello world for example

28

00:02:41,190  -->  00:02:43,350
.

29

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:46,880
And f is the file we've opened.

30

00:02:47,310  -->  00:02:55,200
Now because we've used the with constructor when we reach the end of the indented code the code that

31

00:02:55,200  -->  00:03:01,880
is below the colon and inside the with block when we reach the end which is here.

32

00:03:02,340  -->  00:03:06,080
And then it goes down and stops being indented Python.

33

00:03:06,130  -->  00:03:10,930
OK that's the end of the with block we no longer need f.

34

00:03:10,950  -->  00:03:17,220
So now let's close it and then you don't you don't have to say after PLOS which would be what you would

35

00:03:17,220  -->  00:03:22,680
have to do if you didn't use a with block so that I quoted it for you.

36

00:03:22,740  -->  00:03:24,960
And if we run app you why.

37

00:03:25,080  -->  00:03:27,100
Notice how my file actually appears there.

38

00:03:27,240  -->  00:03:28,760
We can open that and it shows.

39

00:03:28,760  -->  00:03:34,500
Hello world.

40

00:03:34,500  -->  00:03:39,570
Similarly if we use our we can read so we can say print.

41

00:03:39,600  -->  00:03:42,080
If not read line.

42

00:03:42,090  -->  00:03:49,560
And when we run that we see Hello world coming out.

43

00:03:49,560  -->  00:03:55,170
The purpose of this video was just to introduce you to this with construct.

44

00:03:55,290  -->  00:04:01,080
The fact that we can open files using the open command we give it the name and the mode which we have

45

00:04:01,170  -->  00:04:08,420
right and read as well as a number of others and ask f simply tells us that the file is called F..

46

00:04:08,550  -->  00:04:15,090
Inside this context here and here we can either write to the file or we're using W or read from it if

47

00:04:15,090  -->  00:04:18,930
we are using our Without done.

48

00:04:18,990  -->  00:04:24,140
Let's move on to the next video we're going to be working on saving our user to a file.

49

00:04:24,150  -->  00:04:25,920
I'll see you there.
