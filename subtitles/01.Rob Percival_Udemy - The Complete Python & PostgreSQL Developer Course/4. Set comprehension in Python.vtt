00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.710
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to look at a set comprehension and also we're going to

2

00:00:04.710  -->  00:00:09.310
start working on the app which is play the lottery.

3

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:14.490
I mentioned a couple of years ago that set comprehension and list comprehension are very much identical

4

00:00:14.990  -->  00:00:22.860
and they are except naturally the resultant output of a set comprehension is going to be a set the output

5

00:00:22.860  -->  00:00:25.640
of a list comprehension is a list.

6

00:00:26.070  -->  00:00:32.640
And now we know also the differences between a set and a list and that is that a cent has no duplicate

7

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:34.800
elements.

8

00:00:34.830  -->  00:00:39.540
With that said let's start working on our app.

9

00:00:40.050  -->  00:00:46.740
We want a lottery app where and I'm going to write comments for the requirements of this app where the

10

00:00:46.740  -->  00:01:00.000
user can pick six numbers and then the lottery calculates six random numbers then we match the user

11

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:03.190
numbers to the lottery numbers.

12

00:01:03.630  -->  00:01:11.660
And finally we calculate the winnings based on how many numbers the user matched.

13

00:01:12.400  -->  00:01:16.620
So the user is going to pick six numbers and then the lottery is going to calculate another six random

14

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:22.630
numbers which I'm going to add some more detail between 1 and 20.

15

00:01:23.220  -->  00:01:27.090
And then we're going to match the huge numbers to the lottery numbers and then we're going to calculate

16

00:01:27.090  -->  00:01:28.000
the winnings.

17

00:01:28.440  -->  00:01:32.630
So the first part of this program is to let the user pick six numbers.

18

00:01:32.700  -->  00:01:34.480
So let's do just that.

19

00:01:34.660  -->  00:01:41.250
And because this is one small part of our program to let the user pick numbers I'm going to put this

20

00:01:41.250  -->  00:01:49.560
into a method because it belongs as some sort of separate entity if you wish someone to create a method

21

00:01:49.890  -->  00:02:00.630
called Get play numbers and then I'm going to ask the user into your six numbers separated by commas

22

00:02:00.640  -->  00:02:02.030
.

23

00:02:03.420  -->  00:02:06.900
And this is going to allow the user to enter six numbers separated by commas.

24

00:02:06.900  -->  00:02:14.490
And remember we're separating my commas so that we can then split the string by the comma and get the

25

00:02:14.490  -->  00:02:16.670
numbers themselves.

26

00:02:16.770  -->  00:02:24.270
So I'm also going to assign this to a variable and this is going to be a number on the score c s v variable

27

00:02:24.600  -->  00:02:30.570
c as reasons for comma separated value and this is a number variable which is a common separated value

28

00:02:30.570  -->  00:02:32.100
variable.

29

00:02:32.160  -->  00:02:35.490
It just tells me exactly what it is.

30

00:02:36.540  -->  00:02:37.070
OK.

31

00:02:37.200  -->  00:02:45.450
And now what I want to do is create a set from these comma separated numbers of numbers.

32

00:02:45.450  -->  00:02:54.370
So now I want to create a center of integers from this number on the Scace as V.

33

00:02:55.440  -->  00:03:03.240
So it would be fantastic for you to pause the video and attempt this now because it will get a lot of

34

00:03:03.240  -->  00:03:07.090
the knowledge that we've learned so far and put it into one challenge.

35

00:03:07.110  -->  00:03:08.700
So go ahead and attempt that

36

00:03:13.550  -->  00:03:15.120
none of that's attempted.

37

00:03:15.330  -->  00:03:22.290
Let's calculate the numbers from that comma separated value.

38

00:03:22.440  -->  00:03:29.340
The first thing to do is to get the numbers separately as an A list so number on the school list is

39

00:03:29.340  -->  00:03:37.560
going to be number on the S V dot split on the comma and that is going to give me something like this

40

00:03:40.770  -->  00:03:41.230
right.

41

00:03:41.310  -->  00:03:44.650
Well it would have six numbers but you get the idea.

42

00:03:45.300  -->  00:03:55.530
And then what I want to do is to create an integer set which is going to use that set comprehension

43

00:03:55.540  -->  00:03:55.960
.

44

00:03:56.040  -->  00:03:56.800
So I'm going to do.

45

00:03:56.830  -->  00:04:01.390
Int number for number N number.

46

00:04:02.490  -->  00:04:06.150
And that is going to iterate over number list where number is going to be.

47

00:04:06.150  -->  00:04:12.360
Each of the strings and the value that I'm going to put in the set is that number converted into an

48

00:04:12.360  -->  00:04:19.720
integer and then that is going to be my integer set and then I can return the integer set.

49

00:04:19.770  -->  00:04:28.500
So whoever calls this method is going to receive a set of integers that the user has put in.

50

00:04:28.500  -->  00:04:29.590
So let's try that.

51

00:04:29.700  -->  00:04:30.890
Let's call this method.

52

00:04:30.930  -->  00:04:34.870
Get play in numbers and run it in our.

53

00:04:34.920  -->  00:04:37.930
I'm just going to save this lottery.

54

00:04:38.670  -->  00:04:44.220
Let's run this and see if it works in the python shell.

55

00:04:44.430  -->  00:04:52.050
So we're going to enter our six numbers separated by commas one two three four five and six and then

56

00:04:52.050  -->  00:04:55.570
we don't get anything back because we forgot to print it out.

57

00:04:55.710  -->  00:04:56.900
So there we go.

58

00:04:56.920  -->  00:04:57.680
Print

59

00:05:00.940  -->  00:05:02.350
we have to put that in there.

60

00:05:02.550  -->  00:05:06.900
So let's save that and run it again.

61

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:11.100
And now we get our set and we can see that we don't have quotation marks around them.

62

00:05:11.130  -->  00:05:15.630
So these are indeed integers which is exactly what we wanted.

63

00:05:15.630  -->  00:05:22.500
So now we've learned how to bring all that we've learned together and split the input and then also

64

00:05:23.010  -->  00:05:28.630
convert everything to a number using set comprehension.

65

00:05:29.100  -->  00:05:35.760
We could simplify this quite a lot if we wanted we could instead of defining a variable just return

66

00:05:35.790  -->  00:05:41.820
this value so we could do this if we wanted.

67

00:05:41.970  -->  00:05:48.780
But I think it is a bit more readable especially now that we are starting for us to keep things separate

68

00:05:48.870  -->  00:05:53.020
and have variables for every step of the way.

69

00:05:53.370  -->  00:05:56.300
So that is how we can bring everything together.

70

00:05:56.460  -->  00:06:00.780
And now let's continue and create the lottery random numbers.

71

00:06:00.780  -->  00:06:01.530
I'll see you in the next video
