00:00:01,120  -->  00:00:06,840
Hi will come back in this video we're going to be preparing to log in with Twitter and what I've done

2

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:10,940
here is created a new project created a virtual environment for it.

3

00:00:11,130  -->  00:00:16,110
And now we're just going to be setting this thing up so we can log in with Twitter.

4

00:00:16,440  -->  00:00:21,260
The first thing to do is right click your project go to new file and type in requirements tot he XTi

5

00:00:21,290  -->  00:00:21,550
.

6

00:00:21,810  -->  00:00:26,330
And that's going to be the file that as you know is going to hold in that dependencies.

7

00:00:26,390  -->  00:00:32,520
So the Python libraries that our project depends on in order for other people to be able to just install

8

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:35,460
what we write in here.

9

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:41,050
So the library is going here should be cheap installable libraries.

10

00:00:41,070  -->  00:00:44,800
This is we should be able to install them with Pipp.

11

00:00:44,850  -->  00:00:50,970
What I'm going to write is off too as that is a library that we're going to be using in this sort of

12

00:00:51,180  -->  00:00:58,140
logging with Twitter flow and it's used to just simplify the off process which Twitter Facebook Google

13

00:00:58,140  -->  00:01:01,370
Plus and others use them.

14

00:01:01,380  -->  00:01:06,060
I'm going to go and Right-Click the project and create a new python file which I'm going to call constant

15

00:01:06,060  -->  00:01:06,770
.

16

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:11,230
Now I've already got off to install them in a virtual environment.

17

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:16,200
But if you don't you'll get a nice window up here saying that you don't have it installed just install

18

00:01:16,230  -->  00:01:16,890
or two.

19

00:01:16,890  -->  00:01:20,910
If you don't have it installed already and you'll be fine.

20

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:26,430
Now we need a few constants here and I'm going to create a file with constants in them just so it's

21

00:01:26,430  -->  00:01:35,090
a bit easier to access those constants the constants we need or the consumer consumer consumer key.

22

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:37,840
The consumer secret.

23

00:01:38,370  -->  00:01:41,660
And these two are part of our couter application.

24

00:01:42,060  -->  00:01:48,240
And then we need a request token you RL which is going to be part of the Twitter API and it's going

25

00:01:48,240  -->  00:01:56,130
to it's going to be the you are the we request or other we ask a request token of then when the access

26

00:01:56,130  -->  00:02:00,840
token you are able and we need the authorization.

27

00:02:01,230  -->  00:02:02,550
You are right.

28

00:02:03,270  -->  00:02:07,740
So these are the concerns we need and we're going to have to go and find them on our application.

29

00:02:07,740  -->  00:02:10,200
So let's go there.

30

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:18,870
The first thing to do is go to your application and copy the consumer and the consumer secret and paste

31

00:02:18,870  -->  00:02:26,490
them in here consumer key consumer secret and then these other three requests can you read access to

32

00:02:26,490  -->  00:02:29,260
can you tell us an authorization yourself.

33

00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:31,350
Those are part of the Twitter API.

34

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:34,410
So let's go to the API documentation.

35

00:02:34,430  -->  00:02:42,390
Def dot dot com slash overview slash documentation and you'll get a Web site like this and we can go

36

00:02:42,390  -->  00:02:47,960
to auth there because this is not a web application.

37

00:02:47,970  -->  00:02:51,410
What we are creating it is a console application at least for now.

38

00:02:51,540  -->  00:02:57,150
We're going to need to use that PIN code that I talked about in an earlier video so that where we want

39

00:02:57,150  -->  00:03:00,740
to go is to pin based off.

40

00:03:02,220  -->  00:03:08,890
And here you have an overview where pin based off is and essentially is the same thing as implementing

41

00:03:08,890  -->  00:03:11,390
something with Twitter and the three legged authorization.

42

00:03:11,530  -->  00:03:16,040
Well the only difference being that the value for all the Colback must be said to be.

43

00:03:16,440  -->  00:03:21,330
And also here at some point the user sees a pin code that they have to give you back.

44

00:03:21,330  -->  00:03:22,410
So this is the pin code.

45

00:03:22,420  -->  00:03:25,470
They have to copy and give back to your application.

46

00:03:26,190  -->  00:03:27,390
OK.

47

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:32,800
So we're going to need a few things.

48

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:35,640
We're going to need the request token you.

49

00:03:35,790  -->  00:03:38,260
So that we can get a new request token.

50

00:03:38,490  -->  00:03:42,870
We're going to need the access token you or else so we can get a new access token once we've gotten

51

00:03:42,870  -->  00:03:50,340
that authorization code and we're going to need the authorize you RL which is used to request a user

52

00:03:50,350  -->  00:03:57,440
authorization that is to get the authorization pin code.

53

00:03:57,840  -->  00:03:58,470
OK.

54

00:03:58,830  -->  00:04:02,170
So let's just copy those.

55

00:04:02,190  -->  00:04:09,720
This is the request token you know we're going to need the access token you which is used to get an

56

00:04:09,750  -->  00:04:10,530
access token.

57

00:04:10,590  -->  00:04:18,900
Once we have the PIN code we need the authorization you RL which you use to get a new pin code.

58

00:04:18,930  -->  00:04:29,100
This is what users are gonna go to in order to say yes I agree to sign in with Twitter for this.

59

00:04:29,760  -->  00:04:35,040
Now that we have these Constans here we are ready to move to the next video and we're going to be starting

60

00:04:35,040  -->  00:04:37,130
the log in process.

61

00:04:37,140  -->  00:04:40,650
Another option was to just do everything in one video but it will be quite long and I don't really want

62

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:41,940
to bore you too much.

63

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:46,700
So let's split it up and I'll see you in the very next video we're going to get started with this.

64

00:04:46,740  -->  00:04:48,920
So I'll see you there.
