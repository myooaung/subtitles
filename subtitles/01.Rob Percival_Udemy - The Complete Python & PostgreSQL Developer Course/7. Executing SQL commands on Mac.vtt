Hi and welcome back before continuing with the course.

2

00:00:03.660  -->  00:00:06.980
Let's learn how we can execute sequel code in this.

3

00:00:07.050  -->  00:00:08.750
It's actually really simple.

4

00:00:08.760  -->  00:00:13.170
The only thing you have to do is select the data that you want to run the sequel code on and then press

5

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:15.060
this button up here.

6

00:00:15.180  -->  00:00:20.440
That brings up this query builder that you can see now on your screen.

7

00:00:21.110  -->  00:00:27.460
And what this allows us to do is write sequel code in here and then data output will come down here

8

00:00:27.480  -->  00:00:28.900
in the form of a table.

9

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:38.200
So we're going to be looking at how we can learn a sequel by using this sequel query builder.

10

00:00:38.910  -->  00:00:42.030
And we're going to be writing all of our secret code in here and we're going to see the output down

11

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:42.700
here.

12

00:00:42.720  -->  00:00:47.910
The secret code that we're going to be writing in here will then be directly translatable to your applications

13

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:50.590
or whatever else you want to use your equal code.

14

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:55.620
Even though we're going to be learning to use sequel in this window you can always use the same zip

15

00:00:55.710  -->  00:01:01.790
code anywhere else that you would want to interact with your database.

16

00:01:01.890  -->  00:01:09.120
We might do things using this window like inserting data into a database or creating tables or selecting

17

00:01:09.150  -->  00:01:12.280
from tables or filtering through tables and things like that.

18

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:18.030
So we're going to be looking at exactly all those things we can do using sequel in the next few videos

19

00:01:18.030  -->  00:01:18.840
.

20

00:01:19.050  -->  00:01:23.880
So without incentive whenever we're typing code in sequence we're going to be typing it in this window

21

00:01:24.010  -->  00:01:24.230
.

22

00:01:24.430  -->  00:01:26.480
Now see you in the next video we're going to get started with that
