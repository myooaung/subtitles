00:00:00,380  -->  00:00:06,920
Come back in this video we're looking at how to use the provided data files when you're in PGE admin

2

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:07,560
3.

3

00:00:07,590  -->  00:00:13,450
Select your database and press the sequel query builder.

4

00:00:13,770  -->  00:00:17,670
And then you'll be greeted with this window that we've seen before that allows you to construct your

5

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:23,850
sequel queries for the purposes of this course and to get you up to speed and get some data in your

6

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:24,660
database.

7

00:00:24,660  -->  00:00:30,630
We've also provided you with three sequel files that you can download from the download section in this

8

00:00:30,630  -->  00:00:31,900
lecture.

9

00:00:32,100  -->  00:00:38,370
If you download those and open the folder up then you'll have the three files that you can execute and

10

00:00:38,370  -->  00:00:43,920
those files all they do is create three tables and put some data in them just so you can get started

11

00:00:44,370  -->  00:00:45,170
a bit quicker.

12

00:00:45,360  -->  00:00:51,000
However we will cover everything that those files do here as well as you can learn what they are doing

13

00:00:51,000  -->  00:00:51,950
and how.

14

00:00:52,340  -->  00:00:54,600
But that's just to get you up to speed a bit faster.

15

00:00:54,600  -->  00:00:56,540
That's all for your convenience.

16

00:00:56,880  -->  00:01:02,730
So once you've opened this query builder presses this icon for open file or you can go to File Open

17

00:01:03,870  -->  00:01:11,180
and then you can find the appropriate files which are these three and run the first one first seven

18

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:16,430
underscore one and then seven on the go to then seven on the three to open seven on the school one underscore

19

00:01:16,460  -->  00:01:17,410
customers.

20

00:01:17,520  -->  00:01:21,050
Open that up and that populates this year.

21

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:26,910
And what that does is it creates a table and then insert some data into it and then add a primary key

22

00:01:26,910  -->  00:01:30,620
and we're going to be looking into what all those things are and how they work.

23

00:01:30,660  -->  00:01:36,750
And but for now all we have to do is press play which we have to up here and that just creates the table

24

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:38,730
for you so you don't have to do anything.

25

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:44,250
Then select all of the contents in here and just delete them.

26

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:48,930
And we're going to open up the second file and ask you if you want to save your changes and you just

27

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:51,380
can say no.

28

00:01:51,390  -->  00:01:55,130
Finally open up the second file and do the same thing.

29

00:01:55,140  -->  00:02:07,980
Just run it and finally delete everything there and open up the third file like that and run that again

30

00:02:07,980  -->  00:02:08,810
.

31

00:02:08,880  -->  00:02:14,610
And now what we've got is some data in them we can just close this what we've got now is

32

00:02:18,360  -->  00:02:22,120
three tables there and took a while to appear.

33

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:26,540
But nevertheless we got three tables that have customers items and purchases.

34

00:02:26,670  -->  00:02:30,970
And they have a very little amount of data but we're going to be putting more in the next few videos

35

00:02:30,980  -->  00:02:31,160
.

36

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:35,340
And this is just as we can in a small data set.

37

00:02:35,370  -->  00:02:40,230
Explain the different sequel commands and how they work and how you can use them.

38

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:45,930
And so it's going to be a quick overview of all the sequel commands that are going to be doing over

39

00:02:45,930  -->  00:02:52,020
the next few videos so that you guys can start using sequel in your applications quickly and then after

40

00:02:52,020  -->  00:02:56,910
we look at sequel we're going to be looking at how you can use sequel from within your pipe and application

41

00:02:56,970  -->  00:02:59,840
which is going to be really interesting as well.

42

00:02:59,850  -->  00:03:04,380
So without further ado let's move on to the next video Well we're going to be looking at how the sequel

43

00:03:04,380  -->  00:03:09,870
commands work which commands we can use and how you can really interact and get your data out in a format

44

00:03:09,930  -->  00:03:11,280
that you want.

45

00:03:11,280  -->  00:03:13,890
So what's next with you.
