00:00:00,340  -->  00:00:06,620
Hi and welcome back in this video we're going to look at using posh grass on Mac Miller we've installed

2

00:00:06,620  -->  00:00:14,460
the graphical interface all we have to do is go to your Applications folder find Postrel in here and

3

00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:18,420
then run the puji admin 3 program.

4

00:00:18,510  -->  00:00:24,180
You've also got access to the sequel shell which lets you interact with Pasko sequel through the console

5

00:00:24,600  -->  00:00:30,840
but because we're only learning sequel in this course and not really the intricacies of Postrel sequel

6

00:00:31,200  -->  00:00:38,250
then we're going to be looking at using PGE outman 3 which lets you run the query like that the same

7

00:00:38,340  -->  00:00:39,710
if you are going to be learning in the course.

8

00:00:39,720  -->  00:00:41,920
You can also do through the sequels shell.

9

00:00:41,960  -->  00:00:44,220
It's just a bit nicer to run them through.

10

00:00:44,310  -->  00:00:52,080
So let's open that up and then we will look at what we can do with it.

11

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:58,500
So what we've got here as soon as we open the PGE have 3 interface is a fairly nice bit 90s looking

12

00:00:58,500  -->  00:01:01,670
interface and that nevertheless works quite well.

13

00:01:02,130  -->  00:01:07,320
The first thing we've got here is our server that we've just installed and noticed it's got a cross

14

00:01:07,530  -->  00:01:09,260
because we're not connected to it.

15

00:01:09,570  -->  00:01:14,790
What to do is right click on that server and press connect and then you'll be asked for the password

16

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:18,340
that you used when you installed the server.

17

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:21,850
In my case I'm going to put mine in and then just press OK.

18

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:28,350
And then we've got here the contents of the server we've got databases table spaces group roles and

19

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:33,580
logging roles and these calls we're going to be focusing on data bases and logging roles.

20

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:36,230
We're not going to worry about people's spaces.

21

00:01:36,280  -->  00:01:43,890
And I'll briefly go into what a group rule is but we're not going to be creating any just yet a log

22

00:01:43,890  -->  00:01:50,010
in role as simply a user and users sometimes can log in to their server and they can do things like

23

00:01:50,010  -->  00:01:56,990
retrieve data from databases or tables and create more databases or tables and do other things.

24

00:01:57,000  -->  00:02:03,720
We've got one user called postscripts by default and I've created one called admin for this cause we're

25

00:02:03,720  -->  00:02:05,310
also going to create another user.

26

00:02:05,490  -->  00:02:09,730
So let's go reichlich logging roads and press new logging road.

27

00:02:10,350  -->  00:02:11,240
I'm going to call this user.

28

00:02:11,240  -->  00:02:16,140
My name's I'm going to put my name in the role name there and you don't have to worry about any of these

29

00:02:16,170  -->  00:02:17,300
other things.

30

00:02:17,760  -->  00:02:23,580
The definition you may prompt you might put in a password for the user and normally you would use a

31

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:30,160
password if the user was available for others to potentially try to log in with.

32

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:35,610
And what I mean with that is if you have a server for example online and people can potentially hack

33

00:02:35,610  -->  00:02:42,960
into it or connect to it and then you may want to use a password to secure your database a bit more

34

00:02:43,020  -->  00:02:44,010
.

35

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:47,250
Certainly not the same password as you would for the server.

36

00:02:47,340  -->  00:02:52,290
In this case you can also put a connection limit if you leave it blank.

37

00:02:52,290  -->  00:02:54,840
There is no limit where you can put in a limit here.

38

00:02:54,960  -->  00:02:56,760
And what that would do is for example.

39

00:02:56,760  -->  00:03:01,770
So you've got a web application that has a lot of users using it simultaneously but your server cannot

40

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:04,530
cope with more than 500 connections at once.

41

00:03:04,620  -->  00:03:09,750
Then you may want to put in a connection limit so that when more users try to use your app they'll just

42

00:03:10,350  -->  00:03:12,440
it'll just grab it slower essentially.

43

00:03:12,710  -->  00:03:14,190
So your server doesn't go down.

44

00:03:14,220  -->  00:03:20,910
So if your server is limited by Ihram you don't have a lot of RAM then maybe you want to put this in

45

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:21,170
here.

46

00:03:21,250  -->  00:03:23,450
But for now we're not worried about that.

47

00:03:23,580  -->  00:03:26,340
And this is more advanced stuff.

48

00:03:26,580  -->  00:03:29,960
The road privileges is what is more interesting.

49

00:03:30,810  -->  00:03:35,010
The first one is checked inherits rights from palindromes and this one doesn't have any parent roles

50

00:03:35,040  -->  00:03:42,390
but we might as well just get that checked super user ability means that it can delete all the databases

51

00:03:43,080  -->  00:03:49,340
and normally you do not want to give this property to anybody except your post user.

52

00:03:49,530  -->  00:03:54,790
That's just because the fewer users that have the ability to delete databases the better.

53

00:03:54,840  -->  00:04:01,060
It means there's fewer chances of potentially other people using the account to delete your data.

54

00:04:02,100  -->  00:04:02,610
I'm going to check.

55

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:08,280
They can create databases check box here because I'm going to be creating a learning database for this

56

00:04:08,280  -->  00:04:13,860
user that we're going to be using across there throughout the course to learn about how the sequel commands

57

00:04:14,920  -->  00:04:17,890
Kevin rerolls allows this user to create other users.

58

00:04:17,890  -->  00:04:19,700
And in this case I'm not really interested in that.

59

00:04:19,800  -->  00:04:26,910
And the other two were not really going to bother with roll membership allows to give this user a group

60

00:04:26,910  -->  00:04:33,900
role and that means that it can inherit from the group roles and potentially have extra privileges.

61

00:04:33,960  -->  00:04:36,260
But we're not going to worry about that here.

62

00:04:36,720  -->  00:04:41,310
Variables and security labels it's not something we should be concerned with.

63

00:04:41,340  -->  00:04:48,630
And finally the sequel command is just what is going to execute on the server when you press OK.

64

00:04:49,290  -->  00:04:57,000
So this is interesting because it tells you if you didn't have access to this visual terminal what you

65

00:04:57,000  -->  00:05:02,280
would have to do in the console to execute the same command and as you can see it's quite simple.

66

00:05:02,370  -->  00:05:09,150
Create role and the role name has the ability to log in and create databases and it's valid until infinity

67

00:05:09,150  -->  00:05:11,230
means it does not expire.

68

00:05:11,340  -->  00:05:12,260
Fairly simple command.

69

00:05:12,300  -->  00:05:19,050
So let's press OK and then we can go ahead and that will run and we will get on you user so that we

70

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:23,820
have a log in roll and now we can go into a data bases and create our database.

71

00:05:23,820  -->  00:05:29,450
Notice that you will only have a postscripts data base and of course sample database there as well.

72

00:05:29,570  -->  00:05:33,510
The some sample data and I'll be sharing that database with you so you can download the sample data

73

00:05:33,510  -->  00:05:35,080
for this course.

74

00:05:35,190  -->  00:05:39,720
First thing to do is right click databases and create press new database and then we can give this a

75

00:05:39,720  -->  00:05:41,190
name as well.

76

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:45,570
I'm going to give this the name learning and the owner is going to be the user.

77

00:05:45,570  -->  00:05:47,170
We just created.

78

00:05:47,700  -->  00:05:52,420
You've got other things like definition and we don't really have to worry about this because Pasqua

79

00:05:52,500  -->  00:05:55,980
will populate these automatically with your system values and things like that.

80

00:05:56,040  -->  00:06:00,330
So don't worry about this in coding is the character sense that we're using and there's load in here

81

00:06:00,780  -->  00:06:05,880
UTF 8 is a very extensive cactus and that allows you to use other languages like Chinese and things

82

00:06:05,880  -->  00:06:06,490
like that.

83

00:06:06,690  -->  00:06:15,690
If you want to store the actual debate if you want and add more space saving in your disk and fewer

84

00:06:15,690  -->  00:06:17,360
character sets used.

85

00:06:17,370  -->  00:06:19,140
You could choose to call ASCII.

86

00:06:19,260  -->  00:06:23,580
And I would only let you use the ASCII codes which include just essentially American characters American

87

00:06:23,580  -->  00:06:25,610
English characters and symbols.

88

00:06:25,620  -->  00:06:31,350
But we're going to use UTF 8 just because it gives us a bit more flexibility.

89

00:06:31,350  -->  00:06:33,430
Once again the connection limit.

90

00:06:33,630  -->  00:06:35,870
But we're not going to use that in this database.

91

00:06:35,880  -->  00:06:40,140
You've got some variables that we're not going to be using privileges that we're not going to be using

92

00:06:40,590  -->  00:06:42,420
security labels that we're not going to be using.

93

00:06:42,420  -->  00:06:47,670
And finally the sequel code is going to be running when we create this database.

94

00:06:47,880  -->  00:06:53,580
We're not going to be using privileges in this database because we've got the owner which is the person

95

00:06:53,580  -->  00:06:57,900
that's going to be accessing the database and the owner has the ability to enter data and retrieve data

96

00:06:57,900  -->  00:06:57,920
.

97

00:06:57,930  -->  00:07:00,710
So we don't need any extra privileges in there.

98

00:07:01,260  -->  00:07:07,950
Once again to create a database used to create database and then the database name and you can provide

99

00:07:07,950  -->  00:07:11,310
the encoding so that it does not use ASCII by default.

100

00:07:11,550  -->  00:07:18,060
So within coding UTF 8 that just gives it the encoding and then owner is the log in roles name connection

101

00:07:18,060  -->  00:07:23,820
Limited's minors one to not have a connection limit do notice the new sequel the new lines and spaces

102

00:07:23,820  -->  00:07:25,380
and things like that don't matter.

103

00:07:25,770  -->  00:07:31,290
So we could technically just have this like that if we wanted and they would do the same thing.

104

00:07:31,500  -->  00:07:36,830
But to not delete any characters the spaces are important just new lines are not.

105

00:07:36,870  -->  00:07:41,240
And finally the semicolon at the end just as it tells the sequel that this is the end of the statement

106

00:07:41,250  -->  00:07:44,270
so you can run that and so OK.

107

00:07:44,610  -->  00:07:46,800
And then that creates our learning database.

108

00:07:46,980  -->  00:07:51,170
Why pressing on it and then it gets a wee arrow there and we can see what's inside and there's quite

109

00:07:51,170  -->  00:07:52,450
a of things inside it.

110

00:07:52,610  -->  00:07:57,700
There's catalogs event triggers extensions schemas and slowly replication.

111

00:07:57,870  -->  00:08:06,480
The only thing we're going to be looking at in this cause which is basic sequel stuff schemas and we've

112

00:08:06,480  -->  00:08:09,030
got the public schema which is the default schema.

113

00:08:09,390  -->  00:08:12,050
And this allows us to define tables inside the scheme.

114

00:08:12,090  -->  00:08:16,490
You can have multiple schemas if you want multiple groups of tables.

115

00:08:16,830  -->  00:08:22,680
Living in the same server and if you use the public schema which is the default then that just makes

116

00:08:22,680  -->  00:08:26,400
it a bit easier when you're running sequel queries and I'll explain why later on.

117

00:08:27,360  -->  00:08:30,990
If we wanted to create a table we would just reichlich table unpressed new table and we're going to

118

00:08:30,990  -->  00:08:33,240
go into that in a couple of videos.

119

00:08:34,050  -->  00:08:39,630
But as I said I'm going to be sharing with you the code that you just have to run and then you'll get

120

00:08:39,630  -->  00:08:44,490
tables in your server with some sample data as well.

121

00:08:44,790  -->  00:08:53,010
So what about that and we've seen just quickly how to interact with the pgm in 3 program and create

122

00:08:53,040  -->  00:08:56,850
our own log and roll and database now that it is empty.

123

00:08:56,910  -->  00:08:59,550
But we're going to populate it very soon.

124

00:08:59,910  -->  00:09:01,240
With that said I'll see you in the next few
