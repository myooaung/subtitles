00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,700
Find the Mac in this video let's talk about creating the good repository.

2

00:00:05,700  -->  00:00:13,050
Remember when we're talking about get all of your files are in your file system and then we can use

3

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:16,800
get on top of that or the file system is your sort of base layer.

4

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:23,850
And you never lose the content of files in your file system unless you use specific get commands that

5

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:26,010
were going to be covering.

6

00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:31,710
Remember that if you lose things from your file system and you've not put them in it then you've lost

7

00:00:31,710  -->  00:00:32,460
them.

8

00:00:32,460  -->  00:00:38,240
So good is not a safe for everything and but it does provide some safety anyway.

9

00:00:38,400  -->  00:00:44,640
In the first video let's create the depositary which as you know is going to allow you access to the

10

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:45,510
other layers.

11

00:00:45,540  -->  00:00:53,880
The staging area the commits and pushing to a remote repository later on the first command that we need

12

00:00:53,940  -->  00:00:59,230
is inside the folder that we want to convert into a repository.

13

00:00:59,250  -->  00:01:03,690
This is the folder that we want to take snapshots of the files that are in it.

14

00:01:03,690  -->  00:01:12,210
We can do get in it and that initializes the get repository in this folder and notice what happens when

15

00:01:12,210  -->  00:01:13,260
I press enter.

16

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:16,110
I've got the same folder open here in the Finder for you to see

17

00:01:19,920  -->  00:01:22,600
the don't get folder appears.

18

00:01:22,620  -->  00:01:24,750
And inside this not get folder.

19

00:01:24,900  -->  00:01:32,550
We have the staging area which is a physical folder as well as a history of snapshots that we have done

20

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:35,120
which so far we've not done any.

21

00:01:35,340  -->  00:01:42,000
This is what I meant with the layers of physical layers that are stored inside your dot gatefold.

22

00:01:42,300  -->  00:01:45,860
Therefore it is important that you do not delete your dot gatefold.

23

00:01:45,890  -->  00:01:51,360
Don't think this is some crap that you can delete don't delete your don't get folder unless you are

24

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:53,070
sure that you want to delete your project.

25

00:01:53,130  -->  00:01:55,680
You know all the files related to it.

26

00:01:56,130  -->  00:02:00,420
The files in our project are going to be outside the docket folder.

27

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:06,510
But when we add them to the staging area parts of the files get copied over to the docket folder.

28

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:12,640
When we commit them that is create the snapshot the snapshot are also added to the docket folders.

29

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:16,150
Don't get folder has the history and all that stuff.

30

00:02:16,380  -->  00:02:24,120
And if you delete it you'll lose the history unless you put them in a online service like get up.

31

00:02:24,270  -->  00:02:31,650
Once you've created your get in it you'll get repository you have access in this directory and in other

32

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:36,610
folders inside this directory to get commands.

33

00:02:36,780  -->  00:02:41,880
One such get command is good status which is a very useful command that I would encourage you to use

34

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:49,440
often get started tells you the status or the status of your files within the gate ecosystem.

35

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:58,860
Let's press enter and we can see a bit of information we have on Branch master and we're not going to

36

00:02:58,860  -->  00:03:03,570
be looking at branches in discourse that's a bit more advanced topic but nevertheless I would encourage

37

00:03:03,570  -->  00:03:05,820
you to explore it later on.

38

00:03:06,590  -->  00:03:08,000
There is an initial commit.

39

00:03:08,160  -->  00:03:14,550
This means we haven't done any commits previous to the one that we could do now and then it gives us

40

00:03:14,610  -->  00:03:16,740
a list of untracked files.

41

00:03:16,740  -->  00:03:24,020
These are files that get knows nothing about because we've never added them to a snapshot before and

42

00:03:24,020  -->  00:03:24,690
it tells us.

43

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:28,410
Use get and file to include it in would we be committed.

44

00:03:28,410  -->  00:03:33,660
We're going to look at how to do that in the next video and then it has nothing added to commit but

45

00:03:33,720  -->  00:03:35,870
untracked files present.

46

00:03:36,000  -->  00:03:41,550
This is the untracked files and it tells us that we've not added anything to the staging area yet.

47

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:46,200
We're going to be looking at adding things to the staging area and committing them in the next video

48

00:03:46,200  -->  00:03:46,820
.

49

00:03:47,010  -->  00:03:48,770
Without further ado let's go there.

50

00:03:48,880  -->  00:03:49,440
So to your
