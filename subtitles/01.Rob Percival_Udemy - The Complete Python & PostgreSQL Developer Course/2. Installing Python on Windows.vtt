Hi will come back in this video we're going to install Python on Windows.

2

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:09.630
If you are using Windows please watch this video to the end because there is some important things you

3

00:00:09.630  -->  00:00:13.320
have to do while you install Python on Windows.

4

00:00:13.320  -->  00:00:19.530
The first thing to do is hover over the download button and then Python dot org should suggest download

5

00:00:19.530  -->  00:00:20.630
for Windows.

6

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:28.830
If it does then you can just press Python 3.5 point 1 or a slightly higher version if you're using Windows

7

00:00:28.830  -->  00:00:32.500
XP then unfortunately you cannot use that three point by point 1.

8

00:00:32.730  -->  00:00:40.350
But nearly all of the course content 99 percent of them will work fine in Python 2.7 point 1.

9

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:49.140
So you can also use that if you are using Windows XP or if you already have Python 2.0 and 11 or or

10

00:00:49.140  -->  00:00:50.520
so installed.

11

00:00:50.640  -->  00:00:56.250
So they want to recommend three point by point one let's download that and then it would just start

12

00:00:56.610  -->  00:01:03.300
downloading as normal and as you can see it's downloading down there and it's an E axes so we can just

13

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:06.320
click on it and run it as normal.

14

00:01:06.510  -->  00:01:12.120
And the here's the important thing that you have to do in Windows is press this checkbox down here and

15

00:01:12.120  -->  00:01:14.380
Python 3.5 to path.

16

00:01:14.460  -->  00:01:17.640
So check that and then just press install now

17

00:01:20.790  -->  00:01:25.500
and then once that's installed We'll have the programs that we need for these cores installed.

18

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:27.960
And I'm just quickly going to show you which ones.

19

00:01:28.080  -->  00:01:33.390
That is from just speeding through the section for your convenience

20

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:39.360
.

21

00:01:39.630  -->  00:01:40.070
OK.

22

00:01:40.140  -->  00:01:47.750
Now that Python is installed we can just close that and then go to our sand bar.

23

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:51.350
And this is the program that we're going to be using for the first few sections.

24

00:01:51.380  -->  00:02:01.710
Ideally we press that that will open up the python shell which is going to be our main programming tool

25

00:02:01.710  -->  00:02:04.540
for the first few sections of course.

26

00:02:04.680  -->  00:02:10.740
So if you manage to get this far then you are totally ready to get started with development and you

27

00:02:10.740  -->  00:02:13.540
can jump in straight to Section 2 of the course.

28

00:02:14.070  -->  00:02:17.430
That's fantastic so I'll see you there.
