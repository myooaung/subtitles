00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:05.320
Height will come back and there's video we're looking at to the select statement in sequel.

2

00:00:05.730  -->  00:00:11.220
The select statement let's retrieve a data from our database and have a look at it and potentially export

3

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:14.060
it and use it in our applications.

4

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:20.790
It is probably the most popular sequel say let's first click on our learning database that should have

5

00:00:20.940  -->  00:00:27.350
the data provided in the last lecture and go to execute sequel queries.

6

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:34.380
This brings up the window which allows us to execute the query gives us some data output and also allows

7

00:00:34.380  -->  00:00:36.220
us to write things that in the scratchpad.

8

00:00:36.240  -->  00:00:41.830
If we are so inclined the sequel command is fairly simple.

9

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:43.680
It has two parts.

10

00:00:44.040  -->  00:00:53.250
The first one is a select and then goes what columns you want to select and then from and then what

11

00:00:53.250  -->  00:00:55.950
table you want to select from.

12

00:00:55.950  -->  00:01:02.430
Notice that the only tables that we can select from those tables inside the database that we're using

13

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:04.610
the data is that we're using is up there.

14

00:01:04.830  -->  00:01:06.750
Is the learning database in my case.

15

00:01:06.960  -->  00:01:11.970
There's a couple other databases that you may have such as the default database where in my case I have

16

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:17.760
another database as well but the only databases you can access with this query is those that are in

17

00:01:17.760  -->  00:01:19.500
the database that you're currently connected to.

18

00:01:19.530  -->  00:01:23.580
Which makes sense we might put here.

19

00:01:23.850  -->  00:01:29.480
For example customers which is one of the databases that we've imported from The Last Lecture.

20

00:01:30.510  -->  00:01:37.020
And then in the select part what we put in is the columns that we want to retrieve the columns we want

21

00:01:37.020  -->  00:01:44.790
data for or optionally instead of specifying the columns that we want data for we can just put an asterisk

22

00:01:44.790  -->  00:01:45.610
.

23

00:01:45.630  -->  00:01:47.440
Now what do you think this asterisk is going to do.

24

00:01:47.460  -->  00:01:49.690
Take a wild guess.

25

00:01:50.820  -->  00:01:55.080
Well I think you've probably guessed that the answer this is going to select all of the columns in that

26

00:01:55.080  -->  00:01:56.240
database.

27

00:01:56.310  -->  00:02:05.030
So let's press play and see what happens and what you see here is all the data that is in that table

28

00:02:05.160  -->  00:02:06.430
the customer table.

29

00:02:07.080  -->  00:02:14.310
And so we've got a first underscore name call them an ID column and the last underscore name call the

30

00:02:14.310  -->  00:02:17.580
first name has a bunch of names in there.

31

00:02:17.670  -->  00:02:19.990
The last name has a bunch of names in there as well.

32

00:02:20.070  -->  00:02:27.480
And the ID just has numbers from 1 to 5 something that we also get as well as the name of the column

33

00:02:27.720  -->  00:02:30.510
is the data type.

34

00:02:30.600  -->  00:02:34.710
What sort of data is stored in this column.

35

00:02:34.740  -->  00:02:38.870
We've only got two differing data types in this table.

36

00:02:38.970  -->  00:02:46.830
First name and last name are both of type character varying and the ID is a type in the a character

37

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:55.320
data type just means letters numbers symbols anything you could store as a string essentially.

38

00:02:55.830  -->  00:03:02.520
Varying means that it can have up to 100 characters in this case of length.

39

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:08.750
If you do not have varying That means that all of the strings will have 100 characters long.

40

00:03:08.870  -->  00:03:14.010
Mean if they don't then empty spaces will be added as well.

41

00:03:14.010  -->  00:03:18.350
Finally this one has up to 255 characters in length.

42

00:03:18.570  -->  00:03:24.990
So the last name is slightly longer or can be slightly longer than the first names the integer is just

43

00:03:24.990  -->  00:03:28.110
a number that can be stored.

44

00:03:28.110  -->  00:03:34.890
Normally when you use an ID an identification column you want these to be integers because sequel has

45

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:39.620
the ability to automatically increment these numbers for you.

46

00:03:39.720  -->  00:03:44.760
So the next time we add a row the row would have the ID 6 which is nice because that means we don't

47

00:03:44.760  -->  00:03:49.460
have to worry about which row number where at.

48

00:03:49.470  -->  00:03:56.130
So let's say we want to select just the first name when we can also do that we can specify the table

49

00:03:56.130  -->  00:03:58.920
name and then period.

50

00:03:59.190  -->  00:04:01.130
And then the column name.

51

00:04:01.140  -->  00:04:06.450
So in this case customers Dalt first underscore name.

52

00:04:06.810  -->  00:04:07.810
If we press play.

53

00:04:07.830  -->  00:04:13.920
I'm sure you can expect these two columns to disappear and just the first name column to appear because

54

00:04:13.920  -->  00:04:19.560
we've also removed the asterisk and that is indeed what happens when we press play we get the first

55

00:04:19.560  -->  00:04:25.680
name call them with the first names of our users or our customers.

56

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:30.440
However we're not limited to only selecting one column or all columns.

57

00:04:30.450  -->  00:04:35.850
We can also select two columns or indeed any number of columns that we want and we can do that by using

58

00:04:35.850  -->  00:04:43.260
a comma so we can select customers dot first name comma customers dot the last name which would be another

59

00:04:43.260  -->  00:04:46.790
column and that will give me two columns.

60

00:04:47.250  -->  00:04:51.540
So what do you think is going to come out in the data output.

61

00:04:51.540  -->  00:04:53.710
I'm sure your guest will be first name.

62

00:04:53.820  -->  00:05:00.870
And then lastly trespassed and you are right we've got the first name in there and the last name out

63

00:05:00.900  -->  00:05:01.890
there as well.

64

00:05:03.390  -->  00:05:08.070
Something I don't like but sometimes it's useful but sometimes when you want to export data and send

65

00:05:08.070  -->  00:05:13.830
it to one specific customer for example you don't want to call them names to be first underscore a name

66

00:05:13.830  -->  00:05:14.470
and so on.

67

00:05:14.760  -->  00:05:20.440
Sometimes you want them to be improper English with proper capitalization and you can do that.

68

00:05:20.670  -->  00:05:24.450
You can use an alias command in sequel.

69

00:05:24.900  -->  00:05:31.690
And what the alias commando's is it renames one of your columns so as is the alias command.

70

00:05:31.710  -->  00:05:38.460
And what this will do is will see select customers dot first name call them giving it the name provided

71

00:05:38.670  -->  00:05:44.070
now and the name has to go inside quotation marks.

72

00:05:44.070  -->  00:05:48.200
So with this Lou it will just rename the column temporarily.

73

00:05:48.240  -->  00:05:52.210
When we select it it will not change the table column name.

74

00:05:52.290  -->  00:05:55.820
It will just temporarily call it first name.

75

00:05:55.850  -->  00:05:56.190
Notice.

76

00:05:56.190  -->  00:06:04.200
This has to go inside quotation marks because this thing here is not a table and it's not a sequel command

77

00:06:04.210  -->  00:06:04.280
.

78

00:06:04.350  -->  00:06:07.230
So it has to go inside quotation marks.

79

00:06:07.230  -->  00:06:13.950
So let's press play and then notice how this column is now called First Name the data type is still

80

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:18.260
there because that just gets shown to us so we can quickly see what it is.

81

00:06:18.270  -->  00:06:22.370
But it wouldn't get shown if you were to export data.

82

00:06:22.440  -->  00:06:28.200
Finally we can also do that with a last name if we wanted.

83

00:06:28.200  -->  00:06:31.510
And that will rename the last name column as well.

84

00:06:32.100  -->  00:06:35.390
Something to keep in mind now that we are starting to look at secret code.

85

00:06:35.400  -->  00:06:39.100
Is that secret code does not have to be in caps.

86

00:06:39.150  -->  00:06:47.790
It is nice because it gives you a quick it quickly allows you to see which things are secret code but

87

00:06:48.120  -->  00:06:52.950
you can just as well put it in lowercase and it works just as well so you don't have to worry about

88

00:06:53.340  -->  00:06:59.490
making uppercase so sequel does not care about the casing of your commands.

89

00:06:59.490  -->  00:07:01.990
It does care about the casing of your columns though.

90

00:07:02.100  -->  00:07:04.730
So make sure those are correct and of your tables.

91

00:07:05.550  -->  00:07:07.500
So we've looked at the select command.

92

00:07:07.590  -->  00:07:12.600
We've looked at selecting from the specific table and we've looked at the alias command which is X which

93

00:07:12.600  -->  00:07:16.020
lets us rename tables as we see soon.

94

00:07:16.020  -->  00:07:21.150
The ask.com and also lets us rename tables and we're going to be looking at that soon.

95

00:07:21.570  -->  00:07:26.430
So as trining columns or trining tables and select from as well.

96

00:07:27.390  -->  00:07:27.890
Okay.

97

00:07:28.030  -->  00:07:28.690
So in the next few
