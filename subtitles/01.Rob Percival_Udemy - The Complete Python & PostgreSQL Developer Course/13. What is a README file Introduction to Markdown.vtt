00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:07.530
Come back in this year you were looking at the read to me file read me files are extremely underused

2

00:00:07.770  -->  00:00:11.460
especially good read me files and it's important that you project.

3

00:00:11.460  -->  00:00:14.010
Have you read me file.

4

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:18.570
See if we go to our newly created repository here in get hub.

5

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:21.500
The first thing that it doesn't have is a description.

6

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:22.920
We should probably provide that.

7

00:00:22.950  -->  00:00:29.660
If this was a more important project and the other thing it doesn't have is a read to me and get hotels

8

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:35.880
you help people interested in this repository understand your project by adding a read me adding a read

9

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:41.580
me is important not only to help people understand what the project is about but also usually to tell

10

00:00:41.580  -->  00:00:48.090
people how to run your project how to install your project or yeah what it does what is useful for who

11

00:00:48.090  -->  00:00:55.020
should want to use it and why it's really a useful file to include and write in one is actually really

12

00:00:55.020  -->  00:00:56.070
simple.

13

00:00:56.070  -->  00:01:06.180
So let's go into our terminal and write our first read me file for this project what to do is open up

14

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:12.720
a new file called Read to me dot M.D so reads me not empty.

15

00:01:12.720  -->  00:01:16.500
I'm sure you know now how to open up this in a text editor.

16

00:01:17.400  -->  00:01:18.670
So go ahead and do that.

17

00:01:18.790  -->  00:01:25.110
And as you know it is vim read me that I'm b because we are in the Test folder which is where our project

18

00:01:25.110  -->  00:01:26.000
is located.

19

00:01:26.040  -->  00:01:27.940
This is the prime location to put it in.

20

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:34.340
Don't put it inside a subfolder because then get help won't be able to read it easily.

21

00:01:35.120  -->  00:01:35.390
OK.

22

00:01:35.410  -->  00:01:38.500
We created a new file called Read me dot and the.

23

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:41.040
And now we're going to go into insert mode.

24

00:01:41.670  -->  00:01:49.380
This is a dot M.D file which is what get habbe except this stands for Mac markdown and therefore we

25

00:01:49.380  -->  00:01:56.280
have to write this read me file in markdown format the markdown format is really simple and it's used

26

00:01:56.370  -->  00:02:05.130
to make your content more organized than if it was a just a basic text file while not being as complicated

27

00:02:05.190  -->  00:02:12.720
and as cumbersome to use as for example which DML would be to write a title in markdown which should

28

00:02:12.720  -->  00:02:16.220
be our first line using a hash symbol.

29

00:02:16.260  -->  00:02:20.480
One of these musical sharp symbols as well.

30

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:23.590
And here we can type your title after a space.

31

00:02:23.590  -->  00:02:28.260
This could be a great sequel analytics app.

32

00:02:28.740  -->  00:02:35.760
Then we can write a subtitle How to install the app and then we can just start piping newness all the

33

00:02:35.760  -->  00:02:37.730
Subbuteo has to hash symbols.

34

00:02:37.860  -->  00:02:43.890
And that just makes it a smaller pintle we can add three hash symbols four five six.

35

00:02:44.040  -->  00:02:45.310
We cannot add seven or more.

36

00:02:45.330  -->  00:02:47.740
But I think six subtitle should be enough.

37

00:02:48.390  -->  00:02:57.150
If we just type this'll be a normal paragraph you would in a text file so we can say to use this app

38

00:02:57.360  -->  00:03:06.670
you don't need to install it just download it and you can run it.

39

00:03:07.110  -->  00:03:09.890
You need python though.

40

00:03:10.440  -->  00:03:11.250
That's it.

41

00:03:11.670  -->  00:03:15.630
And hear why you should use this app.

42

00:03:15.690  -->  00:03:24.330
We can say it prints hello world what else do you need.

43

00:03:24.330  -->  00:03:25.880
There we go.

44

00:03:26.010  -->  00:03:27.780
This is a symbol read me file.

45

00:03:27.780  -->  00:03:34.320
Naturally you would do more things than this and other things you can do in markdown is with three back

46

00:03:34.320  -->  00:03:41.420
takes you can enclose code so you can see print Hello world.

47

00:03:42.060  -->  00:03:44.460
And that can be a description of what your code is.

48

00:03:44.700  -->  00:03:48.020
Although I wouldn't recommend putting all of your code in the read me file.

49

00:03:48.090  -->  00:03:50.130
That's what the code files are for.

50

00:03:50.160  -->  00:03:55.330
You can also type quotes with this greater than symbol.

51

00:03:55.410  -->  00:03:56.770
This is a great app

52

00:03:59.700  -->  00:04:03.870
somebody and there's a few more things you can do.

53

00:04:03.900  -->  00:04:07.930
But we don't really worry much about them like lists.

54

00:04:07.950  -->  00:04:12.820
You can type lists and then they will be printed out as appropriate lists and good hub.

55

00:04:13.020  -->  00:04:21.550
You can also write unordered lists such as a list of elements with a dash symbol.

56

00:04:21.720  -->  00:04:29.570
You can also make things bold by putting them around double asterisks.

57

00:04:29.790  -->  00:04:38.130
You can make things italics by putting them around underscores.

58

00:04:38.130  -->  00:04:40.650
You can include links and photos and things like that.

59

00:04:40.680  -->  00:04:43.970
We're not really going to be looking into that much detail here right.

60

00:04:43.980  -->  00:04:50.010
A read me file that tells users what your project is about how they can run it why they should use it

61

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:50.230
.

62

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:53.310
And then your project will have a lot better visibility.

63

00:04:53.310  -->  00:04:58.500
Make sure you've read me files are written in proper English or the language of your project so that

64

00:04:58.500  -->  00:05:04.770
when people do look at it they don't think that you are a lazy person who doesn't want to write properly

65

00:05:04.930  -->  00:05:06.050
.

66

00:05:06.220  -->  00:05:10.920
Also because companies will be looking at your read me files and therefore it helps if they are written

67

00:05:10.920  -->  00:05:13.400
properly and that's it.

68

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:14.830
But it's really all you need.

69

00:05:14.880  -->  00:05:25.260
Now let's save and quit and starters get and read me don't M.D get to commit an added My you read me

70

00:05:25.500  -->  00:05:33.870
file and this is going to cause an error because of a small bug where the exclamation mark doesn't really

71

00:05:33.870  -->  00:05:34.240
work.

72

00:05:34.260  -->  00:05:44.400
So we can just and do get comics that am and it may read me file and we can escape the exclamation mark

73

00:05:44.460  -->  00:05:52.950
to make sure that it is not treated as an operand by putting a backslash in front of it and then we

74

00:05:52.950  -->  00:05:58.170
can get push.

75

00:05:58.230  -->  00:05:59.000
There we go.

76

00:05:59.010  -->  00:06:01.580
It also tells you all of this stuff as well.

77

00:06:01.920  -->  00:06:10.250
And I would recommend just copying this come and get convert global push don't default is simple and

78

00:06:10.260  -->  00:06:13.340
paste pasted in there and then you will not get that message again.

79

00:06:13.830  -->  00:06:14.180
OK.

80

00:06:14.220  -->  00:06:17.750
Now let's go back to our repository and refresh.

81

00:06:18.000  -->  00:06:24.750
And now we have a nice looking reading the file that will tell people what our product is about and

82

00:06:24.810  -->  00:06:26.880
what it does naturally.

83

00:06:26.890  -->  00:06:32.070
Probably the print hello world is not a great sequel analytics so there is a bit misleading but you

84

00:06:32.070  -->  00:06:32.790
get the gist of it.

85

00:06:32.790  -->  00:06:36.390
This is just to show you how markdown works.

86

00:06:36.390  -->  00:06:40.310
Notice how you've now got this read me file there as well.

87

00:06:40.480  -->  00:06:45.420
And also remember that because you back slashed the exclamation mark it shows up there which is not

88

00:06:45.420  -->  00:06:49.860
very nice may just be better to avoid using exclamation marks altogether.

89

00:06:51.120  -->  00:06:51.710
And there you go.

90

00:06:51.720  -->  00:06:57.380
This is what Martin is how you can write it and how you can add a read the file to your get help project

91

00:06:57.380  -->  00:06:57.650
.

92

00:06:57.840  -->  00:07:02.190
And there you should because it tells people what it is how or why it's useful how to run it how to

93

00:07:02.190  -->  00:07:05.640
install it and why they should care about it.

94

00:07:05.640  -->  00:07:06.370
With that said.

95

00:07:06.450  -->  00:07:07.630
See your next video.
