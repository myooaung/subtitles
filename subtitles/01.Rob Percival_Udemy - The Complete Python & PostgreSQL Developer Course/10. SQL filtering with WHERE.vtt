00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:05.880
Hi and welcome come back in this video we're looking at the Web come command the where command is used

2

00:00:05.880  -->  00:00:09.040
to filter through our data for example.

3

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:14.940
So you were looking for the specific customer you could use the web command to find customers with a

4

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:23.070
specific first name or with a specific last name or indeed with both the way command goes after the

5

00:00:23.070  -->  00:00:25.410
table that we're selecting from.

6

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:29.960
So we can say select custom stock first name and Cosmas our last name from customer.

7

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:32.370
I'm going to remove the aliases just to make this a bit more readable.

8

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:35.020
But it works with the aliases just as well.

9

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:40.800
So select those are from customers way and I'm putting this in a new line just for readability purposes

10

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:41.050
.

11

00:00:41.050  -->  00:00:48.680
But you can leave it on the same line and that's fine as well where for example customers customers

12

00:00:48.860  -->  00:01:00.210
doctor first name because Roth note is that unlike in most programming languages Viscusi single equal

13

00:01:00.210  -->  00:01:01.180
signs.

14

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:05.980
And normally in programming languages when you want to do a comparison you would use two equal signs

15

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:08.580
but that is not the case in here.

16

00:01:08.700  -->  00:01:12.570
In here we only use a single equal times because assignment doesn't make sense.

17

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:16.340
We're not changing the data we're going to look at how we can do that later on.

18

00:01:16.530  -->  00:01:23.610
But for now we're not changing data so a single equal signs is used for comparison in sequence.

19

00:01:24.390  -->  00:01:26.830
I'm sure you can expect this to do some thing.

20

00:01:26.920  -->  00:01:33.240
And what would you expect it to happen in the data output.

21

00:01:33.260  -->  00:01:37.760
I'm sure you guessed it I would expect rose 2.5 to disappear.

22

00:01:38.970  -->  00:01:46.730
Unfortunately I was right and we can't only the customer that has a first name of Rowlf.

23

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:56.130
Now we've also got a customer that has a surname Watson and we can potentially select both customers

24

00:01:56.150  -->  00:01:56.240
.

25

00:01:56.310  -->  00:02:04.110
So for example we wanted to do a promotion where we are giving a discount to users called Rolfe or to

26

00:02:04.110  -->  00:02:05.540
users with a surname Watson.

27

00:02:05.550  -->  00:02:10.330
Now I understand the is not very realistic but nevertheless it will work for our purposes.

28

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:15.370
The purpose of this is just to teach you that these commands exist and how you can use them.

29

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:21.240
So we want those customers where the first name is Rolfe or with last name is Watson.

30

00:02:21.810  -->  00:02:27.870
So just like in English we want to select where first name is Rolfe or last name is Watson.

31

00:02:28.020  -->  00:02:35.370
We can do the same in sequence where first name equals Rolf or customers don't last name equals Watson

32

00:02:35.370  -->  00:02:36.620
.

33

00:02:37.620  -->  00:02:45.440
So let's press play and voila we get the customer with surname Watson in the.

34

00:02:45.480  -->  00:02:47.630
Similarly we can instead of.

35

00:02:47.630  -->  00:02:48.430
Or do.

36

00:02:48.450  -->  00:02:54.140
And so we can select customers the havet name first name Rowlf and last name Watson.

37

00:02:54.180  -->  00:02:55.320
Now we don't have any of those.

38

00:02:55.440  -->  00:02:57.660
So I would expect this to be empty.

39

00:02:57.810  -->  00:03:05.850
When I press play and they need the case we get no rows back but we're still selecting the columns first

40

00:03:05.850  -->  00:03:10.730
name or last name so they they do appear there but they just don't have any date.

41

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:12.410
OK.

42

00:03:12.540  -->  00:03:15.470
So this is how we can do a web command.

43

00:03:15.660  -->  00:03:22.500
And then we specify the columned and we say equals what we wanted to equal and we can optionally use

44

00:03:22.560  -->  00:03:31.740
and or or to do more filtering and we can continue to use more arms or orce so we can we can do that

45

00:03:32.040  -->  00:03:35.780
as well and we'll explore how that works later on.

46

00:03:36.000  -->  00:03:42.390
Do notice that Rolf and Watson once again are not tables or sequel commands so they have to go inside

47

00:03:42.390  -->  00:03:43.490
quotation marks.

48

00:03:43.710  -->  00:03:49.290
And normally these will be single quotation marks in some instances and some editors will allow you

49

00:03:49.290  -->  00:03:54.960
to use double quotation marks as well but in the PGE admin the editor doesn't seem to work quite as

50

00:03:54.960  -->  00:03:58.590
well with double quotation marks I'm not sure why.

51

00:03:58.620  -->  00:04:06.710
So if the double digit mark doesn't work stick to single ones and but both should work in theory.

52

00:04:06.810  -->  00:04:11.910
So with that said that's how we can do with command and we can filter through our data.

53

00:04:11.950  -->  00:04:13.090
Let's move on to the next video.

54

00:04:13.230  -->  00:04:15.100
So I'll see you there.
