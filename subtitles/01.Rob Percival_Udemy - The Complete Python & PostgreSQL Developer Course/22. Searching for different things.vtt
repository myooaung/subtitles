00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.280
I will come back.

2

00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:05.590
Now I promised that in the last week in the last video that we would be going into styling.

3

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:11.400
But actually there's a small improvement that I'd like to make and suggest to you before we proceed

4

00:00:11.400  -->  00:00:12.240
.

5

00:00:12.480  -->  00:00:19.320
And that is see how this search page is always doing the same Twitter request is always doing the same

6

00:00:19.320  -->  00:00:19.600
.

7

00:00:19.770  -->  00:00:22.690
Computers and filter images.

8

00:00:22.740  -->  00:00:29.090
Wouldn't it be nice if we could change that dynamically.

9

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:34.950
Wouldn't it be nice if we could allow the user to select what they want to search for.

10

00:00:35.910  -->  00:00:39.250
Well you can you can do that.

11

00:00:39.270  -->  00:00:46.890
You have the necessary knowledge somewhere in there to change that and make it dynamic and and give

12

00:00:46.890  -->  00:00:47.940
you a couple of hints.

13

00:00:48.090  -->  00:00:55.650
The way that I would do it is by using my own query string parameter but passed into the search.

14

00:00:55.650  -->  00:00:58.380
So why would do is I would say

15

00:01:04.870  -->  00:01:13.380
you know for example cars plus filter images what I would say is that when a user arrives at the search

16

00:01:13.380  -->  00:01:20.850
page they should pass an equally strong parameter and then I would retrieve that query string parameter

17

00:01:21.210  -->  00:01:23.700
and pass it in there.

18

00:01:23.700  -->  00:01:31.530
I think you can do that because we've looked at using and some where previously requests aren't there

19

00:01:31.540  -->  00:01:31.640
.

20

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:37.110
We looked at using request args before which allows us to get the value of the query string parameter

21

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:37.900
.

22

00:01:37.980  -->  00:01:40.040
So I would encourage you to do that.

23

00:01:40.170  -->  00:01:41.160
I think you can do it.

24

00:01:41.160  -->  00:01:46.400
So to take a moment to attempt that and then we'll do it here.

25

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:48.960
OK.

26

00:01:48.990  -->  00:01:57.750
Hopefully you got it the way I would do that a C query equals request no args don't get Q Where that

27

00:01:57.750  -->  00:02:04.890
Q is the name of the query string parameter and the content of query is going to be the content of that

28

00:02:04.910  -->  00:02:07.200
we used in parameter cost plus filter images

29

00:02:10.170  -->  00:02:14.960
and then what I would do is instead of computer plus filtered images I would just do that and then dot

30

00:02:14.970  -->  00:02:25.560
format query that is going to replace the query contents for that kill it save that and restart the

31

00:02:25.560  -->  00:02:34.050
app and then we're going to go over there and do the search for cars and filter images.

32

00:02:34.230  -->  00:02:35.550
And now we have something else.

33

00:02:35.560  -->  00:02:38.360
Now I'm assuming these things are cars but a lot of it is in Japanese.

34

00:02:38.360  -->  00:02:46.540
I can't really read it and there's a car there for that matter and I don't know.

35

00:02:46.840  -->  00:02:51.130
And there's some bad words in there as well so you didn't read though.

36

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:55.390
But nevertheless that is how you would do that.

37

00:02:55.410  -->  00:02:58.570
So that's what I wanted to encourage you to attempt.

38

00:02:58.590  -->  00:03:04.620
Make sure you're using your knowledge to expand these applications in whatever way you you deem appropriate

39

00:03:05.570  -->  00:03:07.380
as that is the best way to learn.

40

00:03:07.400  -->  00:03:08.940
I repeat myself.

41

00:03:09.150  -->  00:03:09.450
OK.

42

00:03:09.480  -->  00:03:10.390
That's everything for this video.

43

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:11.890
Thanks for watching.

44

00:03:11.900  -->  00:03:15.390
I'll see you in the very next hour and we're promised we're going to get starting with we're going to

45

00:03:15.390  -->  00:03:16.880
get started with styling.

46

00:03:17.100  -->  00:03:19.000
I'll see you there.
