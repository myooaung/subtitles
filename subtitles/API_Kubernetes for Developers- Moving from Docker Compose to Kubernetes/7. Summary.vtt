00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:00.880
[Autogenerated] well,

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.740
that's a look is scaffold and the functionality that it provides.

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.490
So we saw that scaffold out of the boss can convert

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.500
from Docker Compose to kubernetes, using the dash,

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.360
dash composed file flag that uses the composed tool under the covers to convert

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.340
the Docker Compose services into Kubernetes manifest files.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.470
We also saw that scaffold can be used to create a development workflow,

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.790
and as we change our code, it can rebuild images.

9
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.410
And that allows us to integrate our code directly in the kubernetes.

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.740
In scenarios where we need to do that,

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.020
it can automatically deploy updated images,

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.760
runs the different manifests against kubernetes and even can clean up.

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.340
The resource is once we're done,

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.450
I hope that gives you a good idea of what scaffold conduce GUID.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.210
As mentioned.

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.720
There are some other tools out there,

17
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.540
so it's worth exploring those two to see what fits best into your workflow.

18
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.620
I know some people who prefer to use draft others like tilt and

19
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.640
some like garden and even other solutions.

20
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.350
But the big take away from this is that there are tools to let you do

21
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.570
local development against an existing kubernetes cluster,

22
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.000
and that could be really powerful when your application needs that type of functionality.
