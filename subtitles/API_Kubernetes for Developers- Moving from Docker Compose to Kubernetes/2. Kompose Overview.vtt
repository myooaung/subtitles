00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.240
[Autogenerated] So what is the composed tool?

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.440
Well, they like to summarize it this way.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.240
It's kubernetes plus Docker Compose and put those two

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.710
together and you get composed kind of creative,

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.790
actually, on the naming now.

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.350
Officially, they define it this way,

7
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.890
though composes a tool to help users familiar with

8
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.740
Docker Compose moved to Kubernetes.

9
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.710
It takes a Docker Compose file and translates it into kubernetes.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.430
Resource is, and it does it very quickly and efficiently, I'm gonna add.

11
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.640
It's very easy to use, provides a minimal amount of flexibility,

12
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.140
but some flexibility, and we'll even deal with things like volume types.

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.450
Now, why would I want to use the composed tool?

14
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.880
Well,

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.850
obviously I have a Docker Compose file and I want to

16
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.930
migrate that or move it translated.

17
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.240
Whatever you wanna call it into kubernetes Yamil files,

18
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.170
that's a lot of work to do on your own.

19
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.460
I mentioned this a little bit earlier in the course,

20
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.160
and while it certainly could be done with things like code snippets,

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.030
there's some of those available, for example,

22
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.950
in ves code, it still would require quite a bit of work,

23
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.650
especially if you're Docker Compose.

24
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.640
YAML file has a lot of services in.

25
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.270
It may be a lot of volumes, environment,

26
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.740
variables and all the other things that go with that.

27
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.270
So what we can do with this tool,

28
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.970
then is run it through this composed convert command that we're

29
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.770
gonna learn about that will then by default,

30
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.140
generate Kubernetes services and deployments.

31
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.700
Now you can override that, actually, And if you wanted to do,

32
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.780
for example, Damon sets, that's a possibility,

33
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.340
and there's even some others.

34
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.900
But the default is what most of us would be after,

35
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.240
and that is services and deployments.

36
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.960
What's really nice about it, though, is, for example, with the services.

37
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.940
If you had several ports that are available for a given Docker Compose services,

38
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.840
really the container that's running the course,

39
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.540
then it would translate those ports and put them in the deployment.

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.970
But then,

41
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.760
to allow communication between all of the pods that

42
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.240
will run with the deployments, it would set up the necessary services.

43
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.950
So if you had, for example,

44
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.480
a front end application and he needs to talk to a back end API,

45
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.110
it will automatically configure the services to make that happen.

46
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.830
And then, with a little more work,

47
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.000
you could even add a load balancer in front of that.

48
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.020
If you'd like, it'll even deal with things like volumes.

49
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.780
The default is if it sees a volume and Docker Compose.

50
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.650
It'll convert that into a persistent volume and then generate

51
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.140
the appropriate volume claiming things.

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.940
But you can override that.

53
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.700
And if you wanted something to be a config map for some reason

54
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.240
or another type of resource like host path,

55
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.140
then you could do that as well.

56
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.430
So there's a few overrides we'll talk about and

57
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.640
I'll show you some of those flags.

58
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.030
So that's the general idea.

59
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.110
And what I love about it,

60
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.960
because I've used it on several projects over the years,

61
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.820
is that literally in under a second,

62
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.350
I can either have a single file generated with all

63
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.600
these resource is or multiple files.

64
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.640
I normally prefer multiple files, but it's great to have that automated for me.

65
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.390
Now, as I mentioned in the introduction to this module at the end,

66
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.280
we're gonna look at the generated Yamil and yeah,

67
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.420
there's gonna be some things you'll probably want to change their going to AD CS

68
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.340
quite a few labels that have the word composing the label,

69
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.640
and you may or may not want that,

70
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.920
but at least it will save you all the pain of doing the initial

71
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.960
conversion because it's a lot easier to modify something than it

72
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.940
is obviously to do it all from scratch.

73
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.000
So now that we've talked through what the composed tool is, let's go ahead and see how we can get it installed.
