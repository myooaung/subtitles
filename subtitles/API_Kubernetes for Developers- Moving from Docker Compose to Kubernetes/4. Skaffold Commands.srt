00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,320
[Autogenerated] to move from Docker Compose to kubernetes with scaffold,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,940
there's only a few commands that you need to know.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,210
In fact, the conversion part of it is a single command.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,020
But then I'm gonna show you some others you can use to run and

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,040
development mode and more production mode.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,240
So the first main command that you're gonna use is called scaffold in it.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,060
Now, normally,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,790
if your project is configured in a certain way like it

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,540
has a Docker file that it confined, then this might be enough to get you started.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,040
But since we're here to talk about moving from Docker Compose into kubernetes,

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,940
fortunately they have an option for that.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,300
And we can do this scaffolding it dash dash composed file.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,110
So that's the flag we can use and then give it the name of your

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,070
Docker Compose file Now under the covers.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,830
What this will do is actually used the composed tool that we

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,560
covered previously in the course and convert your Docker Compose

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,180
services into the kubernetes manifest files.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,060
So it's really doing the same thing as composed,

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,530
But I'm gonna show you there's a little more to the story

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,490
here that we're gonna circle back to now.

21
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,700
If you already have the kubernetes manifest files and just

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,140
want to run your containers in kubernetes.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,840
Then you can use this flag, dash k,

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,740
and this stands for the kubernetes manifest files,

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,070
and then we can give it the path.

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,000
In my case, I called the folder dot a a s,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,840
and then we're gonna grab all the ammo files that happened to be in that folder.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,040
Now,

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,340
the end result of any of these three commands is a scaffold dot

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,840
YAML file and this is the file we're gonna use with some of the

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,570
other commands we're gonna cover in order to very easily get our

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,240
containers up and running.

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,450
But instead of using Docker Compose to do that,

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,830
we can actually do it within kubernetes,

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,110
either.

36
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,840
A local kubernetes cluster like Docker desktop,

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,940
many Cuban a Rayvon a remote one.

38
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,120
Now,

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,400
in addition to defining the Docker Compose file or the kubernetes

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,760
manifest files that you want to initializer this scaffold dot YAML file

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,360
with you can also use a dash cache artifact or dash a for short flag to

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,640
actually define custom build artifacts.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Now defining the kubernetes files is good,

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,140
and we could do that with the previous flags that I showed.

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,090
But You also need to tell it.

46
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,020
Where are the Docker files?

47
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,070
They're gonna be used to build the images.

48
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,540
They're gonna run within kubernetes as containers.

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,590
So to do that,

50
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,220
we can either go into the Yamil that's generated from running scaffold .NET or

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,210
when we run the command we can add this flag So he would be an example of Dash A

52
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,140
And they were going to say our builder is Docker.

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,200
Now they actually support several different builders.

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,940
I'll refer you to the docks on that, but we're gonna focus just on Docker here.

55
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,750
Now, the payload for the Docker build is gonna be our Docker file.

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,510
So notice I have this engine x dev Docker file and the name of

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,650
the images going to make is in genetics.

58
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,070
Jump start in this case now,

59
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,970
what that will do is update these scaffold dot YAML file with

60
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,460
information about how to actually build the image as we change the

61
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,620
source code files so you can do live development Now,

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,640
we can make changes to our source code scaffold automatically kicks in,

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,540
builds our image and then redeploys it into kubernetes.

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,360
And so it makes for a really nice and smooth development

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,960
workflow between source code to kubernetes Once we've used

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,840
these scaffolding Nick Command, that will give us these scaffold YAML file.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,460
From there we can go ahead and run different types

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,340
of commands such as Scaffold Dev.

69
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,450
Now,

70
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,690
this will be used just typically on your local machine to move

71
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,070
these images into kubernetes pods as containers.

72
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,900
And then again, every time you change your code,

73
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,940
it can automatically rebuild that image and redeploy it.

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,440
Now there's pros and cons of that,

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,370
and there's gonna be some scenarios that you'll see coming up where

76
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,140
doing a live rebuild oven image might take too long.

77
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,280
So, for example, if you do any front and type frameworks or libraries,

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,960
maybe Angular react view things like that Well,

79
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,530
because they typically do in npm install and some other things along the way

80
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,120
to build code that might take longer than you wanna wait.

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,360
So I'm gonna show you a few tricks we can use to work around that now,

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,200
if you're not doing development and you want to run it more like a

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,040
production scenario where it just runs at once,

84
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,140
then you could do a scaffold run,

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,940
and this just builds and deploys the project one time and then it's done.

86
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,290
So for the example coming up, we're gonna focus on the Scaffold Dev Command,

87
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,120
and I'll show you how it actually watches for these code changes

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,240
and rebuild your images and redeploys them.

89
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,440
It's pretty neat how it does it,

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,030
but keep in mind that there are other commands as well.

91
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,550
Such a scaffold run.

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,640
There's a scaffold, debug and even more that you might end up using.

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,840
But when it comes to just moving from Docker Compose to Kubernetes,

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,950
Scaffold can make that process very easy because it uses

95
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,980
the composed tool again under the covers.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,730
But it takes it a step further and can actually make it where it

97
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,000
deploys your images and containers into kubernetes. So let's take a look at that in action.
