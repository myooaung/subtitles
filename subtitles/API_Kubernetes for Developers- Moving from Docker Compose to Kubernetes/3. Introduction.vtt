00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.560
[Autogenerated] Let's look at where we're gonna cover in

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.240
module one to kick off the course.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.540
So first, we're gonna do some review.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.030
Maybe you've worked with Docker Compose in the past,

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.720
but you haven't used a lot lately.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.980
Or maybe you've heard of kubernetes.

7
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.820
Maybe even watched one of my previous courses or another,

8
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.540
but just haven't had a chance to use it much.

9
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.730
Well,

10
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.020
we're going to start things off with a quick review of what Docker Compose is.

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.850
Well, look at the Yamil talk about services,

12
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.010
bridge networks and things like that just to set the stage and get the

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.940
basics down in case you haven't used it recently.

14
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.980
Now, from there, we're gonna do the same thing with kubernetes.

15
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.370
We're gonna review what Kubernetes nodes are the master node and worker nodes.

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.030
And then we'll go into a quick overview of some of

17
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.120
the different resource is again.

18
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.200
If you've already watched the previous courses in

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.710
learning path or worked with kubernetes,

20
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.410
you should already know a lot of this.

21
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.340
But it'll be a quick overview, just in case you haven't touched it for a while.

22
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.990
Finally,

23
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.050
we're gonna wrap up with what I think is the most

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.710
interesting part of this module,

25
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.540
and that is we're gonna take a Docker Compose file the YAML file.

26
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950
And I'm gonna show you how we can map parts of that two

27
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.340
different kubernetes resource is.

28
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.300
Ultimately, that means we're gonna be mapping parts of one file too many files,

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.520
so kind of a one to many scenario between one Docker Compose and many

30
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.700
kubernetes resource XAML files Understanding that's pretty critical.

31
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.510
Because although I'm going to show you how we can

32
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.770
automate this with some tools later, you might,

33
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.340
at some point want to to tweak or change what these tools generate.

34
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.500
So knowing about these options and the mapping between these kind of two worlds,

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.250
if you will, is important.

36
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.000
That's why we're gonna go over. Let's go ahead and jump right in, then to a review on Docker Compose.
