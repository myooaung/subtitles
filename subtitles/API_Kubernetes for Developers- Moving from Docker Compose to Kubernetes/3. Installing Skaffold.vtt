00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.250
[Autogenerated] getting scaffold installed is just a ZZ as getting the

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.200
composed tool installed that we saw earlier in the course.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.340
So let's walk through that process on Mac, Linux and Windows.

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.480
So first off, if you go to scaffold dot dev,

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.340
you can click on Get Scaffold,

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.910
and from here they provide a really nice and easy way to find

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.260
the target operating system and the instructions on how to get

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.440
it going on that operating system.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.440
You'll notice we have Linux macOS windows and you can even run docker.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.150
You want to use this now for Linux, you can run this cruel command,

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.940
and then that's followed up by a pseudo command.

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.270
And on Mac, you kind of have that option as well.

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.000
You could do brew install.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.570
I prefer homebrew.

15
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.430
Maybe use Mac ports.

16
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.660
That's an option.

17
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.450
But if you scroll on down, you'll see we can also do the Linux type approach,

18
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.740
where we could do a cruel command and then a pseudo command.

19
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.580
So I kind of let you choose what you want to do now for me.

20
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.800
I do use homebrew a lot, and whenever that's an option, I typically go with it.

21
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.980
But of course, everybody does a little bit differently.

22
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.310
But let me show you that process coming into a command prompt I can.

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.340
Just add that particular command brew install scaffold.

24
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.840
Now, this would assume that you have homebrew installed.

25
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.580
Of course,

26
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.140
you get more information from the home Bruce site if you're interested.

27
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.140
But if you don't have Homebrew or Mac ports, feel free to do the cruel cmdlet.

28
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.550
Now, I already run this, so it should be pretty quick,

29
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.440
but this will now go out and stall scaffold.

30
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.650
Now that's all we have to do now from here.

31
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.940
If I type scaffold,

32
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.470
you'll notice I get a bunch of commands and the main commands.

33
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.310
We're gonna look at our right here.

34
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.850
We're going to see Run and Dev, and then we'll also look at in it.

35
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.190
But you could see they have quite a few commands that

36
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.520
you can run through if you'd like.

37
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.600
Now let's switch over to the windows side.

38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.140
So on windows, we do a very similar processes far as going to the web page,

39
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.540
click on get and then switch it over to windows.

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.760
Now,

41
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.420
if you use chocolatey or if you use wind get or some of the

42
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.410
other options available with Windows.

43
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.540
You could do that, but you can also just download the binary directly.

44
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.510
And then once you've done that, you need to add it to your path.

45
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.240
So I'll go ahead and download it.

46
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.240
We'll go ahead and keep it.

47
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.740
And now that's downloaded.

48
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.030
We can.

49
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.640
Go ahead and go to the folder, and I'm just going to rename it to Scaffold.

50
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.340
And then I'm gonna add it to a Tools folder,

51
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.540
and this is gonna look familiar from the previous

52
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.350
section where I talked about Composed.

53
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.420
So let's go down into my tools and there's are composed.

54
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.100
I'll add it here now.

55
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500
I've already added it to my path because I did that

56
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.250
with Composer earlier in the course.

57
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.340
Now, since it's already in my path, I'm gonna open up a command prompt here,

58
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.070
and we'll go ahead and type scaffold, and there we do.

59
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.780
We get the same exact behavior on Windows on Mac,

60
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.040
or it would be very similar on Linux as well.

61
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.020
So that's how easy it is to get installed.

62
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.870
It's almost identical to what we did with the composed tool.

63
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.630
A lot of tools were like this, So now that we've seen that.

64
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.970
Let's go ahead and move forward,

65
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.000
and we'll take a look at how we can actually run some of these different scaffold commands.
