1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,980
[Autogenerated] let's get started talking about what we're

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,340
gonna be covering throughout this course.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,080
So we're going to start things off by talking about Docker Compose and

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,940
kubernetes and mapping those two technologies together.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,970
If you've worked with Docker Compose,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,970
then you're probably familiar with Docker Compose services

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,240
and some of the YAML file you can write.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,880
But how does that actually map up against kubernetes re

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,310
sources such as deployments and pods?

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,140
Different networking techniques, services, things like that.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,240
We'll talk about that,

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
and I'll provide a visual to help you map those two together.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,690
From there,

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,520
we're gonna talk about how we can move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,540
using Docker desktop and something called Docker Stat.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,110
And you might have heard of Docker swore more swarm mode before.

17
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,580
But if not, I'm gonna show you a really simple setting.

18
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,800
You could enable in Docker desktop That'll make it so they

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,430
could just use Docker Compose Azure source but actually

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,540
run your app in kubernetes.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,000
Next up is gonna be talking about moving from Docker Compose

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,180
to kubernetes using a tool called composed,

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,540
but you'll notice this has a K.

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,640
This is an open source tool that will actually

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,180
translate your Docker Compose services.

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,540
Yamil into Kubernetes manifest file YAML file.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,550
So it'll do all that translation that we're gonna talk about early

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,140
on in the course and kind of map that for you,

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,700
you're more than likely have to go in and change it as I'll talk about,

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,390
do a few tweaks here and there.

31
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,140
But it provides a great way to get started and will save you a lot of time.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,570
From there.

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,040
We're gonna talk about a really cool,

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,230
open source tool from Google called Scaffold and Scaffold.

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,560
Actually,

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,050
uses compose under the covers so it can move from Docker Compose kubernetes.

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,640
But it allows you to do live development against Kubernetes.

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,540
So, for example, I could actually make a change to code scaffold can detect that,

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,440
automatically rebuild the image and then deploy it up to kubernetes.

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,950
Now there's gonna be some use cases where maybe rebuilding

41
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,540
the image is just too time consuming.

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,820
So I'll show you a few tricks, such as file sinking that we can do.

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,540
This is a feature of scaffold and other features that it offers.

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,280
Once we've gone through, all those modules will go ahead and put it all together.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,250
I'll review using Docker stack composed and scaffold with some different

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,970
projects so that you can get a nice review of the role they can play and how

47
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,940
they can help you move from Docker Compose to Kubernetes.

48
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,950
So now let's move on to talking about the target audience

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,190
for the course prerequisite knowledge.

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,700
You need to have to get the most out of the course

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,000
software that you're going to need, as well as where you can get the code samples.
