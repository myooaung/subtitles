00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.430
[Autogenerated] I always like to start every course off with the

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.400
target audience prerequsites knowledge software that you need and

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.180
where you can get the code samples.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.740
So let's walk through that quickly.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.090
So the target audience is obviously people working with kubernetes,

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.720
but specifically its developers looking to switch from running

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.230
their containers with Docker Compose on their machine to actually

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.910
running those containers in kubernetes, maybe for development,

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
maybe for staging, testing or other types of scenarios.

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.640
So as long as you fit into that realm,

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.950
then you'll definitely get a lot out of this course

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.800
because I'll show you multiple techniques for moving

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.040
between Docker Compose and Kubernetes.

14
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950
When it comes to the prerequisite knowledge for the

15
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.190
course to get the most out of it,

16
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.340
here's a few things you need to know ahead of time.

17
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.990
First off,

18
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.270
you need to be comfortable using command line tools and virtual machines.

19
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.190
Now we're not going to really work directly with virtual machines.

20
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.980
In this course, however, I will be using Docker desktop,

21
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.910
and that does use virtual machines behind the scenes.

22
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.440
And, of course, the way we communicate with that is through cmdlet tools.

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.730
You also need a general understanding of Docker Docker containers,

24
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.340
images how those images get built and how you can run them.

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.990
Now if you're brand new to Docker,

26
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.230
I would highly recommend that you first watch my Docker for web

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.160
developers course to learn about those fundamentals,

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.650
because will just dive right into Docker containers and all

29
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640
those types of things in this course, and I will assume you already know that.

30
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310
So that would be a course to check out.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.140
If you don't know much about Docker at this point,

32
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.150
you also need to have an understanding of core concepts of kubernetes,

33
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.600
and I have a course for that as well.

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.440
That's in this learning path called Kubernetes for developers core concepts.

35
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.800
Now, if you're already familiar with things like pods,

36
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
deployments, services and other core kubernetes resource is,

37
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.810
then you should be good to go.

38
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440
But if not, you can check out that course.

39
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.410
And then finally,

40
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.740
we're all about deploying what was Docker Compose containers to kubernetes pods.

41
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.090
So knowing some of the different deployment techniques is also important,

42
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.010
and part of this kubernetes for developers learning path has a course called

43
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.680
Deploying your coat so you can definitely check that out.

44
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.140
If you'd like more information about different deployment techniques.

45
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.320
Now,

46
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.180
assuming that you already have a background in Docker and at

47
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.600
least some of the fundamentals of kubernetes,

48
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.670
then you should be fine going through this course.

49
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.490
But if not now you know where to go.

50
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.520
To learn more about those is far as the required software.

51
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.040
There's a lot of different things you can use to run kubernetes on your machine.

52
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.770
I'll be using Docker desktop because it's the easiest way to

53
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.540
get all of this going on Mac and Windows.

54
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.630
However, it's not the only option out there.

55
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.540
So although I'm gonna focus specifically on Docker desktop,

56
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.360
you could also use many kubectl so very easy to get going across multiple

57
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.440
operating systems kubernetes in docker to be another option.

58
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.880
Or you could even have a full blown kubernetes cluster

59
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.240
and get that going with kubectl npm.

60
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.820
Now that one's gonna be a lot more work to get going.

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.780
But that would be a full kubernetes cluster that you might

62
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.940
actually installed within your company, for example,

63
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.030
so I'll let you choose what you would like.

64
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.360
But as I mentioned,

65
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.240
I will be focusing 100% on Docker desktop throughout this particular course.

66
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.080
Now the final thing is, where can you get the code samples?

67
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.340
I'm going to show several different projects as I walk through

68
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.250
this course and you can find all of them here.

69
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.840
So they're all up on GitHub dot com slash dan EULA lean

70
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.990
and the first one Angular jumpstart is gonna be a project

71
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.840
that I'll demo quite a bit.

72
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.810
Provides a nice, simple way to get started,

73
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.860
but has Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifest files There's

74
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.160
also Docker and Kubernetes course code.

75
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.240
This is from the previous courses.

76
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.500
Now, I'm not gonna go into that one as much.

77
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.050
But if you'd like some demonstrations of things like deployments,

78
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.230
pods, services and more,

79
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.550
you'll find quite a bit in there and then the Final

80
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.450
one code with Dan Docker services.

81
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.810
If you've taken my Docker for web developers, course you've seen that.

82
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.000
But if not,

83
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.150
I'll be doubling that as well to move from Docker Compose

84
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.840
to kubernetes throughout the course.

85
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.000
So now that we've covered those items, let's go ahead and jump in the first modules introduction
