00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.930
Hello my friends.

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome back to the practical activities.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.050
This time on the clamor or still in association rule learning.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.340
All right.

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
So this tutorial is actually going to be a quick one because as you understood in Carol's intuition

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.220
lecture while the clamor all is actually a simplified version of the primary moral because we only deal

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.400
with the support and we don't even have rules we only consider sets of products of which we analyze

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.450
to support.

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.210
So it's way simpler than the primary moral and therefore that leads to the second reason why this will

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.970
be quick.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.440
Really.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.280
If you have to choose an association will learning moral to association rule mining.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.800
I by no doubt recommend the primary moral.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.510
However it's possible that in some business problems you will only consider the support you know you're

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.470
only interested in doing a support analysis and therefore you might use a clout in exceptional situations.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.270
But still even with the primary you can do this.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.890
So that's why it's gonna be quick.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.220
And besides the way we're going to build a class you know in Python is by just adapting our primary

19
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.610
model so that we only consider the support right because indeed the class doesn't include any confidence

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.200
or left analysis.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.730
Okay.

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.150
So let's do this quickly.

23
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.630
This will give you an extra associational learning model in the toolkit.

24
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.980
So that's still good anyways but really the focus should be on the primary model.

25
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.500
All right.

26
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
So before we start let's make sure everyone here is on the same page.

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.390
I give you the link to this further right before this story.

28
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.010
Also make sure to connect to it.

29
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420
And now let's all go into Part Five.

30
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.960
Association will learning then Section 29 a club and Python where you will find two fouls the clamor

31
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.560
for an IP one B format and the same data set Market Basket optimization.

32
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.320
Let's quickly remind us scenario there is a shop owner in herself friends who would like to boost the

33
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.470
sales of the shop and therefore he's trying to find the best association of products to sell to the

34
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.530
customers in a deal and the deal that this owner has in mind is the following.

35
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.000
Buy one for it and get another one for free.

36
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.200
So this time we're gonna use a color analysis to analyze the highest supports of combination of products.

37
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.940
Here are two products because the deal is.

38
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.850
Buy one get another one for free.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.600
So well that's exactly the same scenario as in a primary and therefore let's directly get into the implementation.

40
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.830
All right let's open it.

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
We're going to open it with either Google collaboratively or duplicate and notebook.

42
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.580
Choose your favorite and now the notebook is opening soon.

43
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.630
It will be laying out and in a second we should have it.

44
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.540
There we go.

45
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.900
All right so loading it then laying it out.

46
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.480
And there we go.

47
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.380
We have it.

48
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.370
So that's the ClA implementation as you will notice.

49
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.070
It is very similar to the prior implementation because indeed the way I built the Islamic law is just

50
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.670
by adapting this binary package to the Islamic law by only considering the support.

51
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.920
And I'm going to show you exactly how I did it.

52
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.470
You know I'm going to show you from scratch how I turned that a primary implementation into this new

53
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.000
color implementation.

54
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.190
So here instead of you know creating a copy of this color implementation and then you know removing

55
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.100
all the cells and re implementing them from scratch we're going to take instead our primary implementation

56
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.940
then we're going to create a copy of this implementation by clicking here on Save a copy in drive and

57
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.110
then that's where you know that's on this copy that I will show you how I transformed this prior implementation

58
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.890
to the excellent implementation.

59
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.060
All right Are you ready.

60
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.320
Let's do this.

61
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.090
So the first thing I did was to.

62
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.870
Well very simply change the name here of the IP Wendy file and I called it iCloud.

63
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.740
All right let's start with the simplest change then still very simple.

64
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.670
I change a title here from Priory to Ella.

65
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.890
I'm really showing you everything I did to make that extra implementation.

66
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.040
Then I looked section after section and see if I had to change anything here.

67
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.450
We still have to install this by repackage because you know we're building a clamor all through a simplified

68
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.770
version of the primary model.

69
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.720
So let's keep this.

70
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.840
We can remove all the outputs here because we will rerun everything.

71
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.920
Then I give the three same libraries here.

72
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.870
I came to the same data repricing phase you know because indeed we still need that transactions list

73
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.190
containing all the transactions into a list.

74
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.910
All right then here when training the primary model on the data set.

75
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.850
Well same I kept everything we could even you know remove the main confidence and Min lived here in

76
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.710
order to really only consider the sport but I recommend to still keep them because you know these two

77
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.270
will give you even stronger associations.

78
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.990
So I don't recommend to remove them.

79
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.850
And then I kept these because we're still in the same scenario to find the best deals by one product

80
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.330
get another product for free.

81
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.030
So we still have to keep this.

82
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.880
But then in the end I'll explain how to run some class analysis on a larger set of products.

83
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.150
Right.

84
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.220
Because remember that with iCloud we're not considering rules but sets of products.

85
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.930
And that's because we're only considering the support you know the support of a set of products like

86
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.050
let's say ABC which is of course the number of transactions containing the price a b and c divided by

87
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.510
the total number of transactions.

88
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.760
Right.

89
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.260
So that's why there is not this direction and therefore these rules.

90
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.050
Okay.

91
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.050
So here I kept exactly the same we can you know change a primary here by iCloud if you want depending

92
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.070
on how you want to see it.

93
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.790
Okay.

94
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.100
And then when visualizing the results that's where I'll show you what I did as a main change you know

95
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.430
as an essential change here.

96
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.590
I didn't change anything.

97
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.680
I still displayed all the rules you know in this list of complicated structure.

98
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.490
But then here when you know putting all the results you know all the rules well organized into a penny's

99
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.280
data frame.

100
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.890
Well I'm going to show you what I did.

101
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.860
Let's crawl down.

102
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.250
Well this time since we no longer have confidences and lift for our rules.

103
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.090
Well very simply I do this and then I removed these two rows.

104
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.260
You know the confidences and the lift removed of that inspect function and then same obviously we have

105
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.180
to remove that here as well.

106
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.480
Right.

107
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.020
Because for the clamorous there is no confidence or lift that we go and same in the comms names here

108
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.370
you know when creating the final data frame nicely visualizing the result.

109
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:42.940
Well I removed of course confidence and lived here and I even replaced you know left hand side by actually

110
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.570
product one and right hand side by product.

111
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.090
And that's because you know in the clamor there is no rule.

112
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.050
You know we're only considering set of products.

113
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.210
And therefore there is no question of left hand side or right hand side of a rule.

114
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.660
All right.

115
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.480
So that's what I changed in the cell then in this cell.

116
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:09.160
Well I simply had to remove it because you know the principle of the iCloud model is just to return

117
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.070
to different sets by descending supports you know from the higher support to the lowest one.

118
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.040
And therefore here we absolutely need to sort these supports directly.

119
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.090
So I just remove this cell and this one as well so that we can directly display the results by descending

120
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.830
not lifts but supports.

121
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.750
All right.

122
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.480
And of course to do this here we had to replace lift by support and now it should be all good.

123
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.970
Let's remove this and let's rerun everything.

124
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.430
You know we can also remove this by the way right.

125
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.610
We have no output.

126
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.160
So now we're gonna rerun everything with First let's not forget to upload the data set inside a notebook.

127
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.450
All right.

128
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.100
So right now the notebook is connecting to a runtime to enable file browsing and in a second we should

129
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.500
see that upload button.

130
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.520
There we go.

131
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.910
All right let's upload then.

132
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.820
Please find your machine learning.

133
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.810
It is that and data set folder in your machine and go to Part 5 association with learning then Section

134
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.980
29 ELA python.

135
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.720
And there you go.

136
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.830
Please select your data set Market Basket optimization.

137
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.110
All right.

138
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.940
So this will upload it inside a notebook in a second.

139
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.610
Right.

140
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.590
It's a big data set.

141
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.100
There we go.

142
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.170
Perfect.

143
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:29.210
And now we're simply going to run everything and make sure everything works properly by clicking runtime

144
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.010
here and then run.

145
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.890
Oh so first it will install that by repack repackage the same way by first downloading it from the link

146
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.140
and then installing it into the notebook.

147
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.750
There we go then importing the libraries and data processing phase then the training and then the results.

148
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:50.720
So here we have of course the same results as before but then for the final results you know which are

149
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.650
supposed to be the final output of the iCloud moral.

150
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.590
Well there you go.

151
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.100
You have them here displaying the results sorted by descending support.

152
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.870
And indeed we see the combination of two production of the set of two perks from the high support open

153
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:13.220
0 1 5 9 which means one point six percent down to the lowest support you know for the 10 highest supports

154
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.220
and a 10 sets of products with a 10 higher support.

155
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.060
All right.

156
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.800
And that's you know exactly what the output of the Islamic LML is supposed to be.

157
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.640
So you see we simply built this a clamor all by adapting the Priory model to the Islamic rule and returning

158
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:34.850
the exact same output as a clam are all supposed to give us meaning the sets of products having the

159
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.550
high supports and then if you want to perform an analysis with larger sets of Barack because here we

160
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.920
only do this four sets of two products.

161
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:49.760
Well very simply you just need to you know in the training sale you just need to change these parameters

162
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.160
from index equals to you can keep this one but then increasing the maximum length and this will give

163
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.960
you some larger set of products.

164
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.510
And even if you know you will have this set of several products here and then one pair here because

165
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.130
you know there is still this direction as in a rule.

166
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.130
Well that's fine because then the support of a rule with several products on the left hand side and

167
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.900
one product on the right hand side.

168
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.010
Well it's still the same support of the set containing all these products.

169
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.110
All right so that's how you would use this color implementation for larger set of products.

170
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.580
Okay.

171
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.490
So good.

172
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.290
Let's have a quick look at the result.

173
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.480
Well we have kind of the same ones as before but this time in a different order because we sort of them

174
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.960
by descending supports but there you go the set of two products that appear most frequently in the store

175
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.900
you know there are Chase most frequently are Herb and pepper with grumpy whole wheat pasta with olive

176
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.800
oil pasta with Asciano mushroom cream sauce with Asciano you know all these seem very relevant associations

177
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.350
leading to exquisite meals cooked at home.

178
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.870
Right.

179
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.360
All this actually makes me kind of hungry.

180
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.780
Okay.

181
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.810
So there you go.

182
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:02.990
So you have now an extra Association wool learning model in your toolkit that clamor all nicely adapted

183
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.840
from the Priory model.

184
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:12.310
But remember my recommendation I still recommend to work with the Priory model because these extra metrics

185
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:18.290
such as the confidence and the lift will give you much stronger results in the end but good that you

186
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.430
have the two models.

187
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:25.490
And now we're going to move on to a very exciting part which is reinforcement learning and you have

188
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:31.670
to know that here we will actually make a step a lot closer to artificial intelligence because reinforcement

189
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:37.890
learning is a branch of machine learning with which you know you can implement robotics in a robot.

190
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:43.970
And of course in part 6 we won't implement a robot but still you will get the basics of artificial intelligence

191
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.860
and how you can build robots.

192
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.380
So I can't wait to see you in this next part you can actually hear by the sound of my voice that reinforcement

193
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.660
learning is one of my favorite branches of machine learning and my favorite application of A.I. so I'll

194
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.560
be more than happy to teach it to you.

195
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.440
And until then enjoy machine learning.
