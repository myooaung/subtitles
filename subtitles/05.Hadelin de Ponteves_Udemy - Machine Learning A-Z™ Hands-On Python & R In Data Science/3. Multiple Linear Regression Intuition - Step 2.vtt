Before we dive into the section I wanted to give you a quick heads up that there is a caveat around

2

00:00:07.020  -->  00:00:13.800
everything that we're doing with linear regressions linear regressions have assumptions and the assumptions

3

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:19.920
are listed below linearity homos kids to city multivariate normality independence of errors and lack

4

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:21.350
of multicollinearity.

5

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:27.160
And before building a linear regression model you need to check that these assumptions are true.

6

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:31.720
And then you can only proceed and be sure that you're building a good linear regression model.

7

00:00:31.800  -->  00:00:33.940
Well in this section we won't be focusing on that.

8

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:40.710
We won't be focusing on the assumptions of linear regression in this section of the course but if you

9

00:00:40.710  -->  00:00:46.590
ever do need to build a linear regression then make sure that you don't just blindly follow the steps

10

00:00:46.590  -->  00:00:52.440
that I present to you in this section of the course but you do need to go back to the assumptions of

11

00:00:52.440  -->  00:00:56.830
the linear regression and research them and make sure that they are correct when you're building your

12

00:00:57.090  -->  00:00:57.600
regression
