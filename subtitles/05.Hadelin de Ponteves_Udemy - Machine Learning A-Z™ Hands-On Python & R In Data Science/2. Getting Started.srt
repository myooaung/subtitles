Hello and welcome to parts 1 data processing.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,720
So I had to start with this part because this is a crucial step in the journey of making a machine learning

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,450
model.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,230
If there is no data repossessing your machine learning model won't work properly.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,000
So it's you know it's like preparing a journey.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Imagine you are about to go for a long journey while you have to prepare.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
It's in every book your flights book your hotels and the pack your luggage.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,920
That's definitely the boring part.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,690
Before the trip but then when everything is well-prepared and you're ready to go your trip might be

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,230
amazing.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,170
Well it's the same for our machine learning journey.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,360
We have to prepare some stuff in order to make sure that we build our machine learning models without

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,290
any issues.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,470
And this stuff that we need to prepare for a machine learning trip happens to be data processing.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,960
So I have to be honest with you this is the boring part but we are only doing this so that we get the

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,690
maximum fun later in this course when we make all the machine learning models.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,600
So trust me we have to do it because if we don't do it we will miss out on all the fun of machine learning.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,830
So I did the best I could to gather in this part all the essentials of data processing and even if I

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,230
made sure to make it as simple as possible.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,050
There is all you need to know about data processing there is all you need to know how to do to prepare

21
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,250
any data set for any machine learning model.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,460
So excluding this one there are going to be eight tutorials in this part.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,250
So hold onto them and I promise you that we will get a lot of fun once we start our machine learning

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,570
journey.
