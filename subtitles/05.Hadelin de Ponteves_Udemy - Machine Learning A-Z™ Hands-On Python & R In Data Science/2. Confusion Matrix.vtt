00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:06.030
Confusion matrix don't just model these terms sometimes that they come up with like why would you call

2

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:10.740
something like confusion matrix when it's designed to explain things.

3

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:15.000
Anyway let's get into the confusion matrix.

4

00:00:15.000  -->  00:00:22.350
So last time we left off over here where we discussed false positives and false negatives type 1 errors

5

00:00:22.350  -->  00:00:28.050
and type 2 years so the false positive is when you predict that something will happen but it actually

6

00:00:28.050  -->  00:00:33.690
doesn't happen and that's a type 1 error and a false negative is when you predict that something won't

7

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:34.500
happen.

8

00:00:34.680  -->  00:00:38.110
But it does actually happen and there's a type 2 here.

9

00:00:38.520  -->  00:00:41.310
So let's see what we can do with these.

10

00:00:41.460  -->  00:00:47.490
Let's start building a matrix and we'll understand what it is exactly saying as we go along with it

11

00:00:47.490  -->  00:00:47.830
.

12

00:00:47.850  -->  00:00:53.550
So we've got the white hat at the top of the predicted dependent variable.

13

00:00:53.550  -->  00:01:01.840
So whether or not we're saying that event will happen at the top and on the left we've got the Y just

14

00:01:01.840  -->  00:01:10.440
the Y actual dependent variable so there it's telling us whether or not that event actually did happen

15

00:01:10.460  -->  00:01:11.000
.

16

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:14.630
Now under each one of them let's put the two different options that are available.

17

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:21.230
You can either have 0 or 1 so 0 for Y had one for Y had 0 for y and one for Y.

18

00:01:21.420  -->  00:01:25.470
And in that space between them there's four more squares there.

19

00:01:25.500  -->  00:01:27.680
That's where our confusion matrix will be.

20

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:30.980
So we'll start off the further Square right away here.

21

00:01:31.050  -->  00:01:39.120
That is intersection of when y had is 1 so we're predicting something will happen or the person will

22

00:01:39.120  -->  00:01:41.700
take up the offer or the event will occur.

23

00:01:41.700  -->  00:01:44.350
And at the same time it actually did happen.

24

00:01:44.670  -->  00:01:54.000
So let's say for instance we had 50 observations in or out of our observations the ones that we said

25

00:01:54.120  -->  00:01:56.530
will happen and actually did happen.

26

00:01:56.530  -->  00:01:57.700
There's 50.

27

00:01:58.170  -->  00:02:01.210
Now let's look at the ones that didn't happen.

28

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:05.430
And we also said that they won't happen so basically we said that won't happen and they actually didn't

29

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:05.930
happen.

30

00:02:06.120  -->  00:02:14.820
So let's say that in there we have three five so 35 of the observations that s.o. will have a hundred

31

00:02:15.210  -->  00:02:19.900
and fifty of them actually did happen and our prediction was that that will happen.

32

00:02:20.040  -->  00:02:22.530
And thirty five of them they didn't happen.

33

00:02:22.530  -->  00:02:26.010
But we also said that they won't happen based on our model.

34

00:02:26.010  -->  00:02:27.900
Now let's look at the other two squares.

35

00:02:28.230  -->  00:02:35.460
So can you guess from here which one is the false positives and which ones are false negatives.

36

00:02:35.460  -->  00:02:36.770
I'll give you a second to do it.

37

00:02:36.780  -->  00:02:39.860
You can post a video if you want to try.

38

00:02:39.870  -->  00:02:41.000
Try this on your own.

39

00:02:41.400  -->  00:02:48.480
So the false positives or the type 1 error are at the top on the right because that's Type 1 error is

40

00:02:48.480  -->  00:02:51.750
when you're saying that something will happen but actually it doesn't happen.

41

00:02:51.900  -->  00:02:57.230
And remember the the way I remember it is it's not as bad as saying that something won't happen and

42

00:02:57.240  -->  00:02:58.920
actually does happen.

43

00:02:59.010  -->  00:03:02.500
Although that might not necessarily be the case but it's an easy way to remember it.

44

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:07.740
So that's how timepoint era it's up at the top of hour on the right now on the left at the bottom we've

45

00:03:07.740  -->  00:03:09.620
got the false negative for the type 2 error.

46

00:03:09.630  -->  00:03:13.480
When we're saying that something won't happen but it actually does happen.

47

00:03:14.130  -->  00:03:17.680
And let's say we had 10 and five and them respectively.

48

00:03:17.850  -->  00:03:24.450
So this is your confusion matrix and what it's telling you is it's giving you a quick overview of how

49

00:03:24.450  -->  00:03:26.280
well your model is performing.

50

00:03:26.280  -->  00:03:33.840
If you look at the diagonal the lice Dagh and all what it won't be colored probably in in your report

51

00:03:33.840  -->  00:03:34.760
that you'll be studying.

52

00:03:34.860  -->  00:03:40.200
But if you look at the top left in the bottom right just if you just remember in that that way those

53

00:03:40.200  -->  00:03:41.310
are the good things.

54

00:03:41.310  -->  00:03:44.250
So in total that's how much you predicted correctly.

55

00:03:44.490  -->  00:03:48.320
And the other diagonal so the top right and the bottom left those are the bad things.

56

00:03:48.310  -->  00:03:51.000
Those those are the observations that you weren't able to predict.

57

00:03:51.000  -->  00:03:52.230
Those are your errors.

58

00:03:52.230  -->  00:03:57.390
So the more you have in the first diagonal the better the more you have in the second taggle the worse

59

00:03:57.960  -->  00:03:59.270
you Mallos performing.

60

00:03:59.430  -->  00:04:03.450
And let's have a look at two ratios that you can calculate.

61

00:04:03.450  -->  00:04:10.080
So one of the first rate is the accuracy rate and you take the correct predicted divide by total.

62

00:04:10.110  -->  00:04:13.470
In our case we predicted correctly 85 the total is 100.

63

00:04:13.470  -->  00:04:17.370
So if we do if I bet 100 we get an 85 percent accuracy rate.

64

00:04:17.610  -->  00:04:22.680
And you can tell it right away just by looking at the confusion matrix especially if you know the total

65

00:04:22.680  -->  00:04:26.590
number of observations right away so you don't have to do a calculation at.

66

00:04:26.700  -->  00:04:30.220
Add up all the values in the Matrix.

67

00:04:30.390  -->  00:04:32.280
That way you can just divide by 100.

68

00:04:32.340  -->  00:04:39.270
But even by looking at the confusion metrics you can quickly understand what the accuracy rate is and

69

00:04:39.270  -->  00:04:40.220
also the error rate.

70

00:04:40.230  -->  00:04:47.880
So you take the total that you were wrong about and you divide by the entire total So in this case it's

71

00:04:48.810  -->  00:04:50.100
15 to 100.

72

00:04:50.130  -->  00:04:52.560
It's 15 percent error rate.

73

00:04:52.560  -->  00:04:56.590
That's all for today we'll be using the confusion matrix in our next tutorial.
