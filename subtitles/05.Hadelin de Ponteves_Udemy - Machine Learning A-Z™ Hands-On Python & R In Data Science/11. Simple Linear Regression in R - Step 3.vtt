00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:02.540
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02.790  -->  00:00:06.250
So in the previous tutorials we prepared our dataset.

3

00:00:06.450  -->  00:00:12.360
Then we fitted the simple linear regression model to our training set and now we are going to predict

4

00:00:12.450  -->  00:00:16.470
the test results because we trained our model on the training set.

5

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:20.890
And we want to see how it can predict new observations.

6

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:25.770
So to do this we're going to create our vector of prediction y present.

7

00:00:26.460  -->  00:00:27.020
I'm calling it.

8

00:00:27.020  -->  00:00:27.490
Why.

9

00:00:27.510  -->  00:00:33.570
Because this is a vector of prediction that is the vector that will contain the predicted values of

10

00:00:33.780  -->  00:00:39.860
the test set observations and we are going to use to predict function.

11

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:41.110
I'm going to write that here.

12

00:00:41.280  -->  00:00:43.390
So that's a pretty function parenthesis.

13

00:00:43.420  -->  00:00:46.650
And in this function it's really really simple.

14

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:52.080
We will just need to input two arguments the first one is our regressors.

15

00:00:52.080  -->  00:00:54.470
So that's the simple in our regress or.

16

00:00:54.900  -->  00:00:59.840
And then come up and then the second argument is new data.

17

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:01.700
So that's that's the name of the argument.

18

00:01:01.710  -->  00:01:08.720
But then this new data is the data that contains the new observations that we want to predict the result

19

00:01:08.720  -->  00:01:08.970
.

20

00:01:09.000  -->  00:01:11.910
And so obviously that's the test.

21

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:17.450
And actually that is ready we are ready to build our vector of predictions.

22

00:01:17.510  -->  00:01:19.610
I will just remind what this is going to do.

23

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:21.180
Here we have a test set.

24

00:01:21.210  -->  00:01:23.950
This is the column of the number of years of experience.

25

00:01:23.970  -->  00:01:30.690
So what will happen is that our simple regression will predict for each of these tested observations

26

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:32.190
the salary.

27

00:01:32.460  -->  00:01:37.860
So we won't be the same salary here because these are the real salaries the salaries that actually exist

28

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:38.890
in real life.

29

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:44.880
But since we saw that there is a strong Leonhart dependency between the years of experience and the

30

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:50.700
salary the predictions returned by our simple and or regression model should be close to the salary

31

00:01:50.700  -->  00:01:50.980
.

32

00:01:51.030  -->  00:01:56.040
Anyway we're going to see that in the final step of this simple in their aggression model because we

33

00:01:56.040  -->  00:02:02.830
will visualize on a graph all the results but so far it's just to explain you what we're expecting.

34

00:02:02.850  -->  00:02:09.180
So let's go back to where I'm all and let's select this command or control plus enter to execute.

35

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:13.610
And here we go the vector of prediction is now created.

36

00:02:13.800  -->  00:02:15.290
So let's have a look at it.

37

00:02:15.330  -->  00:02:20.450
We're going to type wide spread here in the console and here it is.

38

00:02:20.490  -->  00:02:26.020
These are all the salary predictions for our 10 observations in our test set.

39

00:02:26.410  -->  00:02:26.730
Okay.

40

00:02:26.730  -->  00:02:32.610
So for example let's let's have a look at the first observation the real value the real salary of the

41

00:02:32.610  -->  00:02:38.770
first employee of the test that was forty six thousand $205.

42

00:02:38.940  -->  00:02:44.600
And let's see what our model predicted it predicted the thirty seven thousand dollars.

43

00:02:44.630  -->  00:02:44.890
Okay.

44

00:02:44.910  -->  00:02:50.820
So that's not too close then if we look at the second observation which is the fourth employee let's

45

00:02:50.850  -->  00:02:57.120
call it the fourth employee his real salary is forty three thousand five hundred twenty five dollars

46

00:02:57.510  -->  00:03:04.230
and ormal predicted 44000 $322 which is this time much closer.

47

00:03:04.590  -->  00:03:06.880
Okay so that's it with this tutorial.

48

00:03:07.050  -->  00:03:13.860
And now the next tutorial is my favorite part the part where we visually see what everything that we've

49

00:03:13.860  -->  00:03:19.950
been making that is we will be visualizing on a graph the training set results and the test that results

50

00:03:19.970  -->  00:03:20.150
.

51

00:03:20.310  -->  00:03:26.040
So we will make to graph a first graph showing the predictions of the trend set observations and the

52

00:03:26.040  -->  00:03:30.840
second graph showing the predictions of the test set observations and we will see how the simple in

53

00:03:30.840  -->  00:03:34.410
their regression line approach the real observations.

54

00:03:34.740  -->  00:03:36.980
So I look forward to seeing you in the next tutorial.

55

00:03:36.990  -->  00:03:38.760
And until then in your machine learning
