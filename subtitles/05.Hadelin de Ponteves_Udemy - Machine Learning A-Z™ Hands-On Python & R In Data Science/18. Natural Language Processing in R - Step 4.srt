00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:02,470
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02,640  -->  00:00:07,380
So now let's proceed to the next step of the cleaning process which is about removing all the numbers

3

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:08,590
from the reviews.

4

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:15,240
So we will just copy this line and pasted below because you'll see that now doing the next steps of

5

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:20,610
the kitchen process is going to be very easy because we will always use the same line here to update

6

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:21,870
the corpus.

7

00:00:21,870  -->  00:00:27,420
And as each new step we are going to apply the right transformation that we want to do for the particular

8

00:00:27,420  -->  00:00:31,680
step of thinking process to the whole corpus thanks to the T.M. map function.

9

00:00:31,680  -->  00:00:36,660
So basically what we just need to do is replace this content transform transformer with two resin put

10

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:41,560
by remove numbers and that's all we apply.

11

00:00:41,560  -->  00:00:46,740
Just remove numbers functions the reviews and the corpus threw the team up function and that will remove

12

00:00:46,830  -->  00:00:50,640
all the numbers of all the 1000 reviews in the corpus.

13

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:52,500
So let's check it out to check that out.

14

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:57,750
We cannot do it with this first review because this first review doesn't contain any number so nothing

15

00:00:57,750  -->  00:00:59,020
will be removed here.

16

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:05,060
But I had a look at the data sets and there is the review 841 that contains a number.

17

00:01:05,250  -->  00:01:07,000
Let's have a look at this review.

18

00:01:07,250  -->  00:01:10,850
To do this we will use the same line as we used to look at the first review.

19

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:17,790
So I'm pressing the Abara here to take this line of code that gives us access to the reviews and in

20

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:22,510
putting the index one here will put the 841 index.

21

00:01:22,580  -->  00:01:28,010
And now let's press enter to have a look at the review and the review is for 40 bucks ahead.

22

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:29,680
I really expect better food.

23

00:01:29,880  -->  00:01:35,400
So that's a negative review and what should be highlighted in this review is this 40 number here which

24

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:41,460
we want to see if it's going to be removed once we apply this remove numbers function to the reviews

25

00:01:41,460  -->  00:01:42,510
of the corpus.

26

00:01:42,510  -->  00:01:46,770
So that's all the numbers in the reviews can be removed thanks to the team map function.

27

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:48,360
So let's check it out.

28

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:52,450
We will select this line and execute done.

29

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:56,460
And now let's have a look at this 841 review.

30

00:01:56,670  -->  00:02:03,520
So I'm pressing the up arrow twice to get back to this line of code giving us the original review.

31

00:02:03,590  -->  00:02:05,320
It's now the corpus is updated.

32

00:02:05,490  -->  00:02:11,270
Let's see if the number 40 disappeared and it did 4 bucks ahead.

33

00:02:11,280  -->  00:02:12,950
I really expect better food.

34

00:02:13,110  -->  00:02:15,880
Forty does appear and that's exactly what we wanted.

35

00:02:16,050  -->  00:02:16,750
So great.

36

00:02:16,770  -->  00:02:23,670
Basically all the numbers are now removed from the reviews in the corpus nextstep done and we are ready

37

00:02:23,670  -->  00:02:30,390
to move on to the next step which will be about removing any kind of punctuation in the reviews because

38

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:35,850
of course in our sparse metrics in the end we don't want to get a call in for a comma or another calling

39

00:02:35,910  -->  00:02:42,160
for a colon or another call for a dot or for a semicolon or any kind of punctuation.

40

00:02:42,180  -->  00:02:46,740
Of course we only want to create some columns for relevant works that will help the machine learning

41

00:02:46,740  -->  00:02:51,840
classification algorithm to see the correlations between the presence of the words and the outcome whether

42

00:02:51,840  -->  00:02:54,090
the review is positive or negative.

43

00:02:54,090  -->  00:02:56,210
All right so let's do that in the next tutorial.

44

00:02:56,250  -->  00:02:57,900
And until then in Germany learning
