00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:04.320
Arrived so multiple linear regression data set.

2

00:00:04.410  -->  00:00:05.430
Let's get straight into it.

3

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:06.640
This one's going to be fun.

4

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:11.550
Fifty startups is going to be a venture capitalist fund challenge.

5

00:00:11.550  -->  00:00:12.670
All right.

6

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:14.390
So what do we have here.

7

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:17.470
We've got we've only got five columns.

8

00:00:17.580  -->  00:00:26.040
But the real interesting thing about this data is that this is like an very realistic lifelike business

9

00:00:26.040  -->  00:00:26.840
challenge.

10

00:00:26.850  -->  00:00:31.720
So you've got 50 companies here 50 companies in total.

11

00:00:31.950  -->  00:00:41.040
And what they have is they have some extracts from their profit and loss statements from their income

12

00:00:41.040  -->  00:00:41.380
report.

13

00:00:41.380  -->  00:00:46.350
So how much did the company in this given financial year that you're analyzing and for how much in that

14

00:00:46.350  -->  00:00:51.900
year did it spend on research and development how much did it spend on an administration like paying

15

00:00:51.900  -->  00:00:54.060
employees paying executives and so on.

16

00:00:54.150  -->  00:00:57.100
And how was it spent on marketing to those of the tree.

17

00:00:57.150  -->  00:01:00.730
Three major operational spans I guess.

18

00:01:01.440  -->  00:01:03.460
And which state it works in.

19

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:09.970
And finally what is the profit What was the profit of that company for that financial year.

20

00:01:10.320  -->  00:01:15.690
And the challenge here is this is a data set is totally anonymize so we don't know the companies.

21

00:01:15.810  -->  00:01:24.810
And also there's only 50 companies so there is a venture capitalist fund that has hired you as a data

22

00:01:24.810  -->  00:01:31.410
scientist to analyze these 50 companies over analyze this data set and create a model that will tell

23

00:01:31.410  -->  00:01:36.180
the venture capitalist fund which types of companies it should.

24

00:01:36.180  -->  00:01:41.380
It is most interested in investing and their main criteria is the profit.

25

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:44.550
So profit is their dependent variable.

26

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:47.640
The most important variable for them and these are all independent variables.

27

00:01:47.700  -->  00:01:52.890
So you have to create a model which will tell you about profit based on R&D spend in the station market

28

00:01:52.890  -->  00:01:58.470
spend and state and bear in mind that the venture capital fund is not looking to invest in these 50

29

00:01:58.470  -->  00:01:59.340
companies per se.

30

00:01:59.340  -->  00:02:04.410
It's not just giving you a data set and then like obviously then they would invest in this one because

31

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:06.070
it's got the highest profit profit.

32

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:13.380
But what they're looking for is this is a sample and they want to understand for instance where companies

33

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:18.900
perform better in New York or California all other things held equal or which companies perform better

34

00:02:18.900  -->  00:02:21.070
if you hold these columns equal.

35

00:02:21.070  -->  00:02:21.520
All right.

36

00:02:21.570  -->  00:02:26.120
Will a company that spends more on marketing perform better or a company spends less on marketing.

37

00:02:26.130  -->  00:02:31.340
Also they want to understand the main thing probably I want to understand is how do when they assist

38

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:32.090
companies.

39

00:02:32.190  -->  00:02:37.920
Do they look for companies to spend more on R&D spend or on research and development or companies to

40

00:02:37.920  -->  00:02:39.210
spend more on marketing.

41

00:02:39.210  -->  00:02:47.670
So which of these two spends yields better results of profit brings more results of profit and based

42

00:02:47.670  -->  00:02:54.120
on your model that you'll create they will have a They'll set up a set of guidelines for their own venture

43

00:02:54.120  -->  00:02:59.040
capitalist fund and they'll be like OK so we are more interested in companies this is just an example

44

00:02:59.040  -->  00:03:05.880
that work in New York or operate in New York and that have a very low administration spend and a very

45

00:03:05.880  -->  00:03:11.660
high R&D spend which is the R&D spend has to be much higher than Administration marking spend something

46

00:03:11.660  -->  00:03:11.970
like that.

47

00:03:11.970  -->  00:03:20.250
So basically you helping them create a model based off of this sample that will allow them to assess

48

00:03:20.580  -->  00:03:27.360
where and in which into which companies they want to invest to achieve their goal of maximizing profit

49

00:03:27.380  -->  00:03:27.800
.

50

00:03:28.200  -->  00:03:33.770
So there you go it's it's already not an obvious data said it's got many variables got many records

51

00:03:33.780  -->  00:03:35.860
you can't just tell off the top of your head you can.

52

00:03:35.910  -->  00:03:38.280
You probably can see that they're ordered by profit here right.

53

00:03:38.300  -->  00:03:40.850
But there is kind of a mix all over the place.

54

00:03:40.860  -->  00:03:44.520
So let's get into this is going to be a fun and exciting section.
