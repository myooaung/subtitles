00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:02,450
Hello and welcome to this art tutorial.

2

00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:07,260
So in the previous tutorial we implemented Thompson something from scratch and now time for the moment

3

00:00:07,260  -->  00:00:08,760
we've all been waiting for.

4

00:00:09,000  -->  00:00:12,630
Let's see if Tompson sampling can beat UCB.

5

00:00:12,630  -->  00:00:19,210
So in fact we are ready to execute this code section here and find out about the final results.

6

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:24,290
So let's remember the random selection gave us a total reward of 1200.

7

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:30,390
On average the UCB algorithm gave us a total reward of two thousand one hundred and seventy eight.

8

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:35,340
And now let's see if Tompson sampling can beat that.

9

00:00:35,340  -->  00:00:41,990
Now let's select everything from here to the top because you know we have an important data set.

10

00:00:42,060  -->  00:00:47,610
So we will execute everything on once to immediately get this final result that we're so excited to

11

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:48,720
find out about.

12

00:00:48,720  -->  00:00:49,650
So ready.

13

00:00:49,650  -->  00:00:56,030
I'm going to press command and to execute and let's see who is the big winner.

14

00:00:56,370  -->  00:00:57,060
Here we go.

15

00:00:57,240  -->  00:01:04,380
And it turns out to be Thompson said I'm playing because we got a total reward of two thousand six hundred

16

00:01:04,640  -->  00:01:05,620
and two.

17

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:09,850
So we have some random factors so let's not scream victory yet.

18

00:01:09,860  -->  00:01:16,500
We are going to execute that again to see the new we Wardwell we get 2600 almost.

19

00:01:16,680  -->  00:01:17,560
We can do that again.

20

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:23,100
And basically it's averaging around two thousand six hundred.

21

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:25,040
So yes definitely.

22

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:27,950
It's being the upper confidence bound algorithm.

23

00:01:28,140  -->  00:01:33,240
And by the way remember that with the UCB algorithm we almost doubled the total reward of the random

24

00:01:33,240  -->  00:01:34,450
selection algorithm.

25

00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:39,510
But now with Thompson sampling we're not only building the UCB algorithm but also we are doing better

26

00:01:39,510  -->  00:01:47,040
than doubling the random selection total we want because we get this 2600 total reward on average which

27

00:01:47,040  -->  00:01:49,470
is more than the double That one thousand two hundred.

28

00:01:49,650  -->  00:01:50,820
That's what it's all worth.

29

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:56,760
The random selection algorithm on average so great definitely Thompson something is a big winner.

30

00:01:56,760  -->  00:01:59,190
And now we have a last thing to check.

31

00:01:59,400  -->  00:02:04,590
You know remember we need to check that Tompson something also gives us the best ad that has the highest

32

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:09,180
conversion rates you know on which the users of the social network we click the most.

33

00:02:09,180  -->  00:02:15,180
And so we need to make sure that it's also the adversion number five which was the adversion found by

34

00:02:15,180  -->  00:02:23,370
the UCB algorithm and to check that out very efficiently we can select this code section here and execute

35

00:02:23,660  -->  00:02:25,180
to look at the histogram.

36

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:26,280
And here we go.

37

00:02:26,400  -->  00:02:31,160
We also get that the version that was most collected is adversion number five.

38

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:35,670
And by the way Nusi we had some higher bars here if I remember correctly.

39

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:41,520
But here with Tompson sampling we can clearly see that this was this adversion number five here that

40

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:43,110
was most selected.

41

00:02:43,230  -->  00:02:48,960
You know this bar here corresponding to the adversion number five is clearly dominating the other boys

42

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:54,050
and that's because Tomsen something quickly figured out which ad is the best you select.

43

00:02:54,090  -->  00:02:57,840
That is it quickly figured out which ad has the best click through rates.

44

00:02:57,870  -->  00:03:02,910
And so now we can congratulate ourselves because we clearly solved very efficiently this click through

45

00:03:02,910  -->  00:03:05,040
rate optimization problem.

46

00:03:05,040  -->  00:03:09,560
And the best algorithm that we found for this is Thompson sampling.

47

00:03:09,600  -->  00:03:16,290
All right so congratulations for having implemented these two algorithms UCB and Tompson sampling.

48

00:03:16,470  -->  00:03:20,790
That's the end of the section and that's also the end of this part reinforcement learning.

49

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:23,100
So I look forward to seeing you in the next part.

50

00:03:23,190  -->  00:03:25,430
Natural Language Processing.

51

00:03:25,530  -->  00:03:27,120
Until then in Germany learning
