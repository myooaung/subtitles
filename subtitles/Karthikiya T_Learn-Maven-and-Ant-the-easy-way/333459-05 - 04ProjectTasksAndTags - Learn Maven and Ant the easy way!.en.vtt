00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
in this video,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.000
we're going to talk about project targets and tasks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.350
We had some understanding on all these tags.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.850
Who let us try to get into more details.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.560
First,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.300
let's talk about the project tank.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.590
The project tag is the root tag for all the tax it to defund within this XML.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.560
And there's just going to be one project tag per XML and is going to take the following

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.730
form along with its mandatory tribute default,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.370
which would point to a default target.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.060
So this also means that it's mandatory that you specify at least one target with some tasks

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.650
in it.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.900
Well,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.780
you don't have to really mention the task,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.940
but there's no meaning off target without specifying the task about from this attribute.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.360
You can also specify a couple off more attributes for your project tag,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.380
and those are best there and the name attribute.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.820
The name represents the project name,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.530
and this will come in handy for certain tasks.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.330
For example,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.550
it's that you wanted to create a bar file off your project,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.840
then the task can certainly make use off this name to create the var file with this name,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.890
just to give you an example.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.920
And then we have the best there,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.020
which is the best directory where your tasks were drunk and its value defaults to the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.200
directory wherever you're XML file is reciting,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.960
which is this the current directory.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.830
If you want to change it,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.750
you can change it.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.180
And that's going to be the best directory where your task Ford run.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.390
Coming to target with the water tails,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.100
it's essentially going to constitute a list off task.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200
And when we call this target,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.020
the ant is going to execute all the list off past,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.750
present in it.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.370
A target can also depend on another target.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.410
Let me just explain you what I mean.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:02.110
Let's say I wanted to create another target and I'm going to call it Target,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.150
another target.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.050
Now let's say that this target is going to depend on this target,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.200
for example,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.120
that so that we wanted to display hello world in two different tasks.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm going to take on the world apart from here.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.930
I mean,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.540
it's copy this Tass and get it off this,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.470
and I'm going to paste it all here Now.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.450
We wanted to display hello world,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.310
but before we display this world we want to make sure that will display Hello.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.880
First.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.440
For that we're going to make There's another target as the default target and we're going

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.990
to add one after good Here,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.550
which is depends on is going to point to the test target.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.870
So by default this target will be involved.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.750
And since we said this target depends on another target,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.920
test target will get executed first,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.510
and then the control will come into this task.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.710
We're actually going to take a real time example off this when I'll show you how to write

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.350
the builder maximal for our project.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.850
But for now,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.900
this is a very simple example.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.150
Let's try to run this and sure enough,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.490
in displayed hello and then bowled.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.850
So this is a very useful attributes and coming to task.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.770
There are a lot off tastic and perform using and and each one of these tasks will have

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.880
their own corresponding attributes specific toe.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:59.150
That task have actually created a document where I have documented all the list off popular

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.110
tanks which are being used,

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.840
and I'm not going to walk you through right now because few of these examples are going to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.640
use some tags which you're currently not aware off.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.520
So we'll talk about them first,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.950
and then we'll get back.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.250
And I'd understand all these tests.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.570
So for now,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.600
I guess this will suffice.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.250
See you soon.
