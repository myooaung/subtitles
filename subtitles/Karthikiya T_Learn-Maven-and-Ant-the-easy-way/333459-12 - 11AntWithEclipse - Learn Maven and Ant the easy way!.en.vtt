00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
in this video,

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.820
we're going to take a look at how to work with Aunt in Eclipse.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.580
I d.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
Now I'm assuming that you have some hands on experience using Eclipse,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.190
and I assume that you know how to run Java programs in eclipse.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.540
If you're not used to eclipse I D.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.850
And you've used a different I D,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.780
for example,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.370
IBM,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.350
SNET beans,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.860
then that's financially can just quickly download,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.070
eclipse and install it.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.370
It's an open source,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.930
and if you're used to knit beans,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.540
I d.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.590
Then this should be a cakewalk for you.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.290
The both are pretty similar,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.340
but it lips is a better one with better features.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.090
If you're a Java developer,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.010
then you should get it off net beans and start using eclipse because this is the most

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.880
popular I d used in the industry.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.790
Or if you're not ever off any ideas at all,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.680
then you can check my course on Java programming.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.320
Their ARV used both net beans as well as the eclipse.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.890
I d.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.700
All right,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.550
let's continue.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.590
So what I'm going to do now is I'm actually going to import all the content in here in two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.900
or Eclipse and Roman And then I'm going to build the project using this builder maximal

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.340
file.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980
And once I do that,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.110
I'm expecting the war file to get deployed in the service.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260
So was my baps directory.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.400
So let's go to a clips and created our project.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.370
I'm going to give it some name,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.740
my Aunt project or whatever the name the Jewish tag you look.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.020
Finish right.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.110
Click on the project,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.870
Click on Import Chills File system under the general category.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:47.270
Flick Next and now choose the directory wherever your files are reciting.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.340
In my case,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.550
it's Annie Directory.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.880
It shows that project or the folder click OK,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.190
chills this as well as a builder.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.280
XML click finish.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.400
Now where is open?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.600
The and Bandel can go to Windows Show view and then choose the aunt option.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.340
If you don't say it,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.410
then you can click on this other and then search for and and just double click it or just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.770
chose it.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.300
Then click open and then you have this panel open.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.490
Let me just pull it here so that you can see it.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.270
So this means that eclipse comes with this and tool built in,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.590
and what we can do is to drag this builder XML file into this panel,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.280
and so you would see that file along with its targets.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.740
So this is the file,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.820
and if you expand it,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.270
you would be able to see all the list of targets in it.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.620
Now all we have to do is right.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.950
Click on this and then donors and build.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.890
He can also run individual targets if you wish.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.000
And then,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.950
sure enough,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.580
the builder's successful.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.100
If we run this program,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.030
make sure that you're able to run a simple Java file,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.150
and that will ensure us that the Javan Roman to set correctly.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.550
If that's the case,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.750
you shouldn't be seeing any errors in here.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.250
And sure enough,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.860
we have that war file deployed in the kebabs directory.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.700
So that's great.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.920
No,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.410
no doubt eclipses reporting another here,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.230
let's see what it is you're seeing all these errors because eclipses not ever off the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.670
Soviet dot jar file,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.810
where our classes and interfaces are reciting.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.740
But our and file is ever offered because to go to our project under the ribbon of directory

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.740
,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.800
we have provided the jar file and in our building,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.550
facsimil,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.290
we're pointing to the slip directory as a class part,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.620
so there were no errors about building the project.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.960
But in eclipse,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.000
you may be seeing these to solve this problem.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.580
We need to add external jar files,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.810
choose class pod at external jars,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.750
and then you can chills that file under Tomcat Live directory,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.760
Search for Soul It AP and George are again.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.680
So let's is something that I've explained in my celebrates and Jsp Cores can check with

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.240
that if you wish.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:50.250
And then we got rid off all those errors and let's to refresh off the project,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:05:01.000
clean all projects and you see that that are going but intend off this video is to show you

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.400
how you can use the clips to play with.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.950
And so you're able to see all the targets in here.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.770
An eclipse will definitely come in handy,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.790
especially if you have a very large build a maximal file.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.360
So you'd be able to see a quick summary off all the targets and it run individual targets

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.900
just like so.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.950
And then you're good.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.850
So you in my next video
