00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
in this video,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.550
we're going to talk about maven site life cycle,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.450
particular catalyst off life cycle that we had talked about,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.690
one of which is made in sight.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.000
So what is site?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.050
It essentially is creation off a website.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.170
The talks about your project and is automatically done by maven.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.240
So many is going to take care of creating the cascading style sheets in majors,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.750
etcetera and ultimately created website for your project.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.700
So let's see how it's done.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.050
Before we tried to create site for a project,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.220
I went to add the following plug in That's Maven project in four reports.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.740
Plug in.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.780
So this pregnancy actually going to create reports?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.550
Will the water reports in a while after we generate the site?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.380
So this plug in to have it as part of the plug ins tag and then in my kids,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.270
I'm using devotion to about eight.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.480
I think there are latest abortions available,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.850
but I haven't experimented with them.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.830
You can use the latest version,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.790
or better yet,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.640
if you want to follow along with me,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.670
then you can just use the same version.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.490
And now all you have to do is,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.660
as you would expect is to run the command maven side.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.650
But before that,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.220
just run Ambien clean to clean up all the results that were previously generated.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.590
So now I'm going to hit.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.150
Enter.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.020
There is going to take a while,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
especially if you're running this for the first time since I've already done that once,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.680
it's not going to take a lot of time.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.250
Should be done in a few seconds.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.570
Take a look at this output.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.680
It is sort of generating each and every individual report.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.150
We have report for dependents information,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.550
and then we have a report for dependencies.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.510
Or we have another report for the project team.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.500
Remember,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.430
we had added list of developers contributors,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.100
etcetera.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.140
So this report is going to constituent that we're going to take a look at that.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.220
So we're done.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.320
We see this message build success.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.790
So if you go to the target data tree,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.460
let's to refresh Banadir right click and click Andre fresh.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.700
Or I could just simply hit at five from your keyboard.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.200
So here we have it.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.990
Let's go to this directory.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.100
I'm going to select this particular director and hit old Enter.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.190
It's going to open the properties and if you click this icon,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.750
that's going to take us to that directory in our operating system.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.170
So here we are.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.650
And if you open the index Oreste email file,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.010
you would have all the details about the project.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.040
And here is a description about the project,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.410
whatever we had added as part of the description tag and similarly going to see pretty much

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.450
every other information that we have added.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.400
Like,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.970
for example,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.170
if we go to Project Team here,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.300
we're going to see all the list of contributors developers,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.250
etcetera.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.110
So these are the details that we have added,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.810
you know,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.280
previous video and similarly have other details as well.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.900
Dependency coverage is actually going to talk about some of the stats on dependencies like

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.860
number off dependence is no cause it's three and their corresponding artifact.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.190
It has also pointed out number off snapshot dependence is available,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.050
and it's one in our case and for the very reason we haven't ever here.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.330
This error means that our project is not ready for release has evolved.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.340
Mentioned When you're about to release your project,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.130
you need to take care off all the snapshot worsens.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.840
You need to replace Emmett,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.010
some standard war shins.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.200
And here's a snapshot we have That's specially off project A.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.550
So we need to start off,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.500
make changes here before we try to release our project.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.750
We have dependencies report just going to list on all the dependencies we have.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.590
And we also have one for plug ins.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.360
You have plug ins and plug in management.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.350
I'm going to talk about black in management quickly by the end of this video.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.220
But here are the plug ins that a part of for Project Sandman is going to help us create a

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.550
website that has the combination off all these reports.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.650
If you want to customize report,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.550
then we have a special tag for that.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.350
So in here,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.240
let me just son,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.970
come in this.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.050
I'm going to get it off the plug in from here,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.800
and I'm going to make it part off this reporting tank.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.050
When you define this plug in as part of the reporting tank,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.280
then you have little more flexibility.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.460
We can introduce lot off other times in here that can go as part of this plug in.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.000
Now,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.770
in order to figure out what needs to go in here you can defer to the plug in documentation

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.500
can just do a quick Google search off the Stone Maven project in for reports Plug in.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.790
And most likely,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.920
the first ring would take you to this page.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.650
And here are the list off Gold's available a spot off the plug in,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.550
and each and every goal takes care off,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.420
generating each and every individual report.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.140
So we have one for dependencies who have won four team plug ins,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.900
etcetera.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:50.800
So what I'm trying to do here is I'm just going to try to create a site which has only one

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.420
report,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.990
and that's going to be the report off.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.240
Dependence is so let me just quickly do Emmy in clean.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.870
But before that,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.610
make sure that we save this file have been clean and then Ambien site.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:21.950
So it has generated only the dependencies report versus If you take a look at here,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.200
it has generated all the reports.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.550
Let's go there and trying to visit the side,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:35.020
and we only have the dependence is report this just to give an example,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.250
the flexibility that never nor first but reporting tank similar.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.300
If you have any other plug ins that deal with documentation generating reports etcetera.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.890
If you add the mass part of this reporting tag,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.870
you'll have better flexibility.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.050
Were society in those presents as part of the bill tank,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.930
and also,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:05.830
I need to mention that if you'd like to deploy your site onto a particular silver,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.880
then you can just introduced this particular tag distribution management inside which you

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.590
would mention the stag site,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.520
and it would mention where you want to deploy your site.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.640
But in order for this to work,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.000
you need to add this particular silver has sparked off these settings out.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.780
XML under dot m two directory And here's a format to define your own.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.930
So over we're going to talk about settings.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.840
Are XML incoming video?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.660
And once you do that,

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.070
once you define your silver and wants to define the distribution management.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.770
And when you do Ambien install Moon is actually going to s a p,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:53.170
that particular website to the remote server end to this particular location so that now

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.650
the world can view it.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.010
And lastly,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.250
as I've already mentioned,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.070
let's talk about the plug in management tank.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.660
If you go to the effective bomb,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.750
you would notice that there is one tag plug in management.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.740
This is similar to the plug in stack,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.210
but the difference is whatever plug ins that you defined in here and their configurations

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:26.420
are applicable not only in this product but also to all the sub projects are the projects

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.350
that are child toe this project.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.640
Remember,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.190
we had created a Web application using the web app archetype.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.050
So there we have seen a project which has multiple child projects.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.290
So this will come in handy there.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.510
You just have to customize display gins in one location,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.250
which is in the parent palm file,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.850
and it would get reflected across all the child projects.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.180
But if child project defines the same plug in,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.500
then that will have the preference.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.900
It will all right,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.780
the behavior,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.050
whatever is defined in Parent Palm.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.620
So that's about it.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.060
See,

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.650
assume.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.480
See you soon.
