00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
All right,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.950
let us take a look at how to set up the enrollment to start using the end tool,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.310
post awful search for this term.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.750
Download aunt in Google and then you'll be getting all these results.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.270
Click on the first link and make sure that the site name is Apache dot org's.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:25.300
So this explains that and Tool is actually provided by Apache Foundation and is also an

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.160
open source,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.900
so you can download the source code if you wish.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.680
So now all we have to do is to download the ZIP file depending on your washing preference.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.510
Obviously you'd like to pick the top one,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.450
which is the latest Russian have already downloaded the ZIP file,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.750
and I've extracted it in one of the folders.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.450
In my case,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090
it's and he drive,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.140
and this is how the extracted files would look like You can extract them anywhere you wish

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.140
.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.700
But one thing that you had to make sure is to copy this part and then you go toe windows

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.870
and Roman variables by hitting the Windows key and search for environment variables.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.310
Hit,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.920
Enter,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:18.700
click on this button and make sure that you add this particular variable with the name and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.810
underscore home.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.870
It has to be exact same name,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.400
including the case,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.690
and add your home directory off and here click OK,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.440
and in addition to that,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.290
it would always be better to add the path variable as well,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.470
because and is a command line tool.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.050
And we want to run the end commands from any directory in the command line.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.750
So it's always better that you add this part variable,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.810
which actually points to the BIN directory off the End home directory,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.750
just as we did here.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.890
I have already done that.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.050
I don't have to do it again.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.540
And this is the been doctor that I'm talking about,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.250
where you'll have all the scripts,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.550
and this is a main script here.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.150
The ant script.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.900
This is what we're going to use throughout our course,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.390
and apart from all the script,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.250
we also got set off libraries,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.900
and this is where the actual functionality off all the task that we went execute will

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.650
decide.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.130
We're going to talk about it to know next video,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:36.480
though I also need to make sure that you add job a home and run variable because,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.140
as I've just mentioned all these libraries will be run only when you have the Javan,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.760
Roman said.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.450
If you're able to run Java programs in your computer,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.610
then chances are that you have already said these environment variables like Java home

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.970
Jerrick,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.480
a home,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.230
J.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.190
R E home,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.450
etcetera.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.910
If you haven't done so,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.560
please go ahead and add deals and roamed Variable Tazewell java home points to the jet Icky

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.550
home directory.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.650
And make sure that the name is exact same Javon disk or home to re crucial.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.870
And also make sure that you have the J.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.750
R E home,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.750
and it points to the J.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.550
R E directory just as you see here.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.990
Ideally,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.130
Java home will suffice,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.950
but it would always be good to add this as well.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.590
All right,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.550
I think that's all there is to it.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.620
Now,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.360
in order to make sure that we're able to use the end tool,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.980
open the Windows Command processor by hitting windows are and then CMD that would give you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.050
this Windows Command Prosser just type in end hyphen version,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.650
and this should show us the washing off the end that we've just installed just as you see

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.250
it here.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.450
So this means that things are in good shape and we're good to go.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.850
All right.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.790
See you in my next video.
