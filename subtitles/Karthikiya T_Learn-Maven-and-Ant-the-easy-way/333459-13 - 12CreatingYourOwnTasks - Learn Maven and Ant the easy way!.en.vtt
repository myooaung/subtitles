00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
in this video,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.490
we're going to take a look at how to create our own on task.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.430
We have didn't look at the host off task that and offers,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.250
and I think they would pretty much suffice for a need.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.620
And in fact,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.560
in my experience,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.750
I've never created a custom task like I'm doing now.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.460
But they intend off.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.520
This video is just explain the flexibility that and offers and the kind off control that it

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.400
lets you have on the project.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.540
So just for completeness off the scores,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.700
I'm going to show you how to create your own task.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.390
But as I mentioned,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.200
you would really need it.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.450
But I'm just explaining it anyway,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.300
someone to create a new project.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:50.250
I'm going to call it my custom task and then finish in here.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.350
I'm going to create a package or a class file and in the Spanish liken also specify my

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.060
package.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.650
I'm going to say the name Toby.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.650
My custom tag are rather task,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.450
and I'm making it part off this package.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.710
The Pakistan name is going to say more,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.630
we can change it.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.060
I'm going to say my own whatever and click finish now in order to create your own task.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.030
We need to extend a class called Task and this class doesn't decide in standard Javal

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.850
Library.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.350
It is part of the ant library that we've done good,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.510
but this is so little stride Important.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.120
That jar file has an external jar going to choose class.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.920
But add external jars,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.070
go back and choose a jarring the lib directory,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.610
which is,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.750
and our jar.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.950
That's where you have all those classes.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.010
And then I'm going to important.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.740
So we have one from the FX con current.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.810
We don't want it.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.740
What we want is the one from ork Apache tools and and in here we're going to actually all

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.950
right,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.050
the method.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.610
I'm going to use eclipse built and functionality to do the job for us.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.470
I won't expand this task and then I'm going to choose this method click OK,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.740
and then eclipse will do the job for us in here.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.700
I'm just going to simply display message.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.660
But instead of using system dot R dot printing method,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.010
I want to use this method log and I'm going to pass in some argument to this,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:54.380
going to say hello from custom tag example of whatever.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.110
And then what I'm actually going to do now is to create a jar file out off this.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.270
So let me do that.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.590
When directly connote export.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.450
It was a jar full option and then click Next.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.520
We don't want include all these and,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.060
uh,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.390
we want to include the Java file,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.390
though Chose the location.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.660
Very want to save the file.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.250
In my case,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.690
it's in there.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.210
Stop.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.300
But the name my own door jar click finish.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.540
This would come by.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.150
I'll build a jar file that has all the dark class files.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.650
So here it is.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.680
I'm just simply going to copy it into our good old directory.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.550
Want to create a new folder here,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:50.550
and I'll call it Custom Task example and went to best it in here.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.050
Let me also create a builder maximal file here.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:07.440
Now it's going to take a while for me to write the XML file.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.120
So I'm going to pause the video and get back on the same hold it.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.830
Here we are with the XML file.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.540
What you have to do is to define our task.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.860
Isn't the stag task death and then the attribute of significance is this the name of the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.250
class,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.350
including including its package.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.510
And then you would specify where that jar file is reciting.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.270
In our case,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.690
it's in the same directory,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.160
which is the best directory,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.310
and then you're going to provide some name.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.000
This is a name that we're going to use to use it as a custom.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.490
Dag.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.770
Now what this custom tag does is it's going to actually execute whatever is the court

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.270
inside the execute method,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.270
which in our case,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.250
is just simply going to display a message.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.450
So let's run this building maximal file.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.470
And sure enough,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.680
we have that message getting displayed.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.450
Great.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.950
So that's about the custom task.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.910
In fact,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.050
all the times that we've been executing has some kind off code associate ID and all the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.950
court decides in the Lib Directory of the End Home Directory.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.430
All right,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.450
see you soon.
