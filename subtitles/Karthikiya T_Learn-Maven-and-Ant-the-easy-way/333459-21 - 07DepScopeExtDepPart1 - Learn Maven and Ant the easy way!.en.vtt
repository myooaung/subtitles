00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
in this video,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.480
we're going to talk about this scope tag that goes inside the dependency tag,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.770
the scope that will help us specify the scope of the dependency and the list of possible

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.980
values that can go inside the scope tank.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.050
Our days we're going to talk about each one of these in detail in this video.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.760
First,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.480
let's talk about the compile.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.060
If you said the scope to become pile for a dependency,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.770
that means that dependency or that particular jar would be required during the compilation

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.110
time off your project as a less during the run time.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.300
In short,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.560
that jar library will be made available in all the class parts.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.390
For example,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.770
say that you're trying to create a Web application,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.450
and that Web application is dependent on another project.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.760
Who's resulting artifact would be a jar file.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.610
Now,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.490
when you have a verb application that is dependent on your person project,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.370
then not only do you need that jar file off the dependent project while the compile develop

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.240
application,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.230
but also during the run time.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.450
You know that little straight this let me just create a new Melvin project,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.300
and this time it's going to be have ever application someone to choose this particular

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.180
archetype,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.520
the BAP.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.150
This will create the project structure that is relevant for a web application.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.790
So let's hit next.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.370
I'm going to name this project as Project A and let me copy this package toe come in handy

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.370
.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.040
Pretty soon it finish.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550
This is going to take a while.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.050
You can see the progress on the bottom right corner.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.550
So here we have it.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.760
No,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.390
for this purpose have actually created a class file with the name my project tester Java

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.830
that recites inside the SRC Main Java and under this package in or my project And all it's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.840
doing is it is having a method which,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.670
when we call,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.280
is just simply going to return the string as simple as that.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.960
Now,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.580
inside our web application,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.280
we're going to create an object off this class and then call this method.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.070
So let's see how to do that.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:37.600
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to create a soul that and inside,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.150
which I'm going to read this message and displayed on the browser ultimately.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.360
So if you go inside our SRC main,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.650
we don't have the job a folder.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.450
We have to create one,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.800
because guess what?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.150
We have to follow standard maven Dell'Utri conventions,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.450
Winter said.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.470
Java and hit finish and inside.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.640
What?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:12.500
I'm going to create a package and the package is going to be this.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.290
Whatever I had copied earlier,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.820
the Group I D and then the project name again.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.100
This is a good practice.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.550
Have all did explain the significance off it.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.140
When does it finish?

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.850
And inside what I'm going to create our soul leapt.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:42.310
I'm going to name it as Project A test or whatever you wish to give.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.740
And here is the Ural Mapping if you're not aware of,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.330
so let then I recommend you to go to my course on the same.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.010
Have talked about networking.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.620
So let's JSP is Jerry BC etcetera.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.060
It's an excellent course,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.200
and there you'll have complete understanding on all these technologies.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.660
So I'm assuming that you have some idea on so less GSP and Tom gets over in general.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.740
If not,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.240
that's fine.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.740
Azrael,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.580
just try to understand what we're trying to do here.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.990
Basically,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.820
we're trying to manage.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.850
Our dependence is,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.530
and that's the purpose off this course.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.120
So I'm going to hit finish now,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.450
in order to save your time,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.840
I'm actually going to.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.590
But before that,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.720
we have a never here.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.310
Can you guess what it is?

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.840
It says we don't have the required libraries.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.580
So what is the solution that made to give for this problem?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.770
Any guess?

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.650
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.250
A is we're going to add our solar dependency.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.350
I'm not sure if you guessed it.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.750
It's pretty straightforward,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.160
right?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.630
So we go here and then add the dependency and I'm going to do control shift F to give

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.750
proper indentation.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.860
Actually,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:14.380
we supposed to put this inside the dependencies stack and held a control shift F All right

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.380
.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.370
That looks great.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.050
Now all we have to do is to right click on it and may have been of that project.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.280
And soon,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.150
Once the progress reaches 100% you would see those areas getting disappeared.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.900
Anyway,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.370
Let me dispose of brilliant,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.910
right?

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.550
This all that code that I wanted to introduce.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.490
All right,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.300
here we are.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.990
We have a very basic chord.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.260
All I'm doing here is I'm just inst Enshi ating my protest which is part of this project.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.250
My project and I'm just simply trying to display that message.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.110
Whatever is being sent from here.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.090
So again,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.320
we have a problem here.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.750
Can you guess what the solution would be this time?

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.530
We need to add the dependency as simple as that.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.980
So we're going to say,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.280
you know,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.290
palm dot xml off project A That this project is dependent on my project.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.490
How are we going to specify that?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.050
That's by using the coordinates off our my project.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.750
So I'm going to copy this invested in here.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.500
But alternatively,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.380
we can use the eclipse feature.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.380
You goto this dependency stag.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.770
You have the convenience off adding the same,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.650
using the graphical user interface.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.310
Someone to click this ad.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.960
I went to search for the group I d hit Enter and you would come across with our project.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.390
Just choose it and hit.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.970
OK,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.350
that's all there is to it.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.100
We have our new dependency tag added in here automatically by eclipse.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.800
So eclipse is a great tool.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.570
This proves enemy.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.950
So let's go back to our soul it and make sure that our class file is at our free.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:14.190
So this time we still have problem because we haven't updated this when to do maven of dead

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.050
project?

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.750
All right,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.050
Once it's done,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.910
the holy amounts would be able to see the fix.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.740
Now,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.010
if you take a look at this code here,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.150
it's pretty basic.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.560
We're just trying to get that message and display again.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.850
You have to know something about.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.460
So let's to understand the scored.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.930
And if you wish,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.190
you can take a look at my course on the same.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:44.300
So what am I going to do next is I'm going to pack it this project as a war archive and so

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.600
I can deployed onto the Tomcat server so I would right click on the project run.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.540
As this time I'm going to choose.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.510
This option may even build,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.790
and then we have to provide the name of the goal.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.200
Again.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.550
We'll talk about goals for Is this etcetera?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.620
Incoming videos.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.030
But for the time when you can think of gold as an an task.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.980
So just as you have a name associated with day with each task in and we have a name

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.260
associated with each of the goals in maven,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.470
So this time the goal that I'm going to in work is package if you take a look at the effort

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.190
to Palm,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.670
you would be able to find this goal someone to serve,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.180
run.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.610
So this will package everything,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:35.050
as if our archive let me pull this up so we haven't ever heal it to what it is.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:43.850
It says that jar file are dependent Jar file is missing in the repository.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.690
That's because if you go to a repository,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.250
we don't have the jar file in here.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:58.650
How do we get one is by doing may even install off for dependent project.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.850
So let's do that.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:16.470
So we got the success message and we have the jar file residing in the repository now.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.090
No,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:25.850
we're good to go and do the build again with the option a cage,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:35.640
We have another ever.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.050
How can you guess what this means?

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:48.620
Just as we specified become bile abortion in here way to specify the same in this bomb

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.880
Direct similar as well.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.480
So let's do that because we now have the jowl file that needs to become piled.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.450
Now let's build it.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:09.350
And this time it should work.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.810
And sure enough,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:19.840
it is successful and we do have an artifact created that's to refresh,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.950
and we have it in here.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.950
Let's go to the directory wherever that heart defect is reciting.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:37.450
Going to copy it and go to the Web app static tree off our silver and passed it in there.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.380
I already have.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.870
The Tom gets over running,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:48.580
and all I have to do now is to go to that Ural and see if things are working fine.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:55.670
I already have the Ural Handy Flynn had enter.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.280
And sure enough,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.720
it wrote.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.350
Well,

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.470
great.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.660
All right,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.350
we'll continue from next video.
