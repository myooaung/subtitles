00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
in the suite of We're going to Talk About repositories.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.910
We already had some understanding on what is repository and its purpose in this video.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.830
We'll get into more details on the same well.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.730
This week is going to be quite long.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.550
And so I have decided to break this 1,000,000 to 2 videos in the 1st 1 We're going to talk

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.500
about the local depository,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.850
which will be this video,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.600
and in the second we're going to talk about the rest.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.750
This is just for your psychological satisfaction.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.410
So let's talk about the local depository,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.860
a local depositories,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.330
just simply one of that addict to reason.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.750
Deciding in your computer with the name repository under dot m two.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750
We had already talked about it,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.150
and this is where all the jar artifact will be reciting that your project needs.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.380
So basically,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.300
whenever you specify this,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.260
dependence is and try to build,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.780
the project maven will search for deceptive facts in the local depository.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.330
If they're not present there,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.170
then it is going to go take a look at the central depository,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.250
which was set in the Super Palm,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.480
and if they're available there,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.850
it's going to download them into local depository.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.350
If they're not,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.550
then it's going to report,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.320
and ever so the advantage of having a local depository is quite obvious.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.340
You'll have all the libraries reciting in one place and all the projects that you're going

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.350
to create or work in your computer.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.400
I will defer to this library for their dependency needs,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.050
so we'll have a single jar and the jar file can be referred across multiple projects,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.130
and there won't be any confusion.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.640
Well,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.580
in some cases,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.600
you may want to make the artifact off one project made available to another project.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.400
Say,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.020
for example,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.750
you have another project in here,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.250
and that project is actually dependent on this project.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.850
Then you want to build this product first,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.090
and so we'll store the artifact in the local depository so that those libraries will be

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.350
available on the depending project.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.280
You know,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.050
to make these libraries available for another project only have to do is to do may even

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.620
install now,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.490
in order to understand what is maybe install way to talk about plug ins goals pays us

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.310
etcetera.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.770
But for the time being,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.210
when you do Rana's Ambien install,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.630
this is as good as running the M in script,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.060
resulting in the BIN directory off,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.060
maybe Home Directory and then passing the argument Install for the time being,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.920
contain cough install as the target name.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.400
So just as we provided the target name while running the and script,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.900
you're providing a target name essentially to the maven script.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.950
And the beauty off maven is that this is not only going to execute this particular target,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.640
but all the targets that needs to come.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.610
Prior to this,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.160
Hagen will talk about it in coming videos,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.750
but just run it the way I'm doing.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.890
And once you click it,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.660
the job off install is essentially to copy the artifact into a local depository,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.890
and so it can be made available to other projects.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.180
So it's building well.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.110
We seem to have some matters in here.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.390
Let's take a look at what it is.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.720
So here we have it.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.570
It just saying the source Option five is no longer supported.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.170
Well,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.650
this has something to do with the compiler plug in has of all the dimension.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.860
Memon is actually combination off multiple plug ins.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.170
All the tacit you're going to perform it.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.360
Navan were actually done by plug ins,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.250
including compilation off the source files.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.510
The problem we have right now is that the compile a plug in has defaulted to use Java

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.390
washing five,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.270
which is no longer supported.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:11.590
So we can fix the problem in multiple ways one needs by go to the effective bomb and you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.050
would find that plug in such for compiler.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.250
We can take this cord and all right,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.590
it,

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.960
you know,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.260
actual palm and we're going to provide additional para meters to set the job.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.310
Abortion or alternatively,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.310
we can also said the properties has part of these properties.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.290
So in order to set the job abortion,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:44.000
you have to use the following tag is a maven compiler source and you're going to provide

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.090
the washing in here.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.130
You can actually provide one off this building properties just as we do with,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.550
and I'm going to say,

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.070
Java abortion.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.080
I went to copy the same and said the target wash in as well,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.850
going to change us to target.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.380
I copied the same here as well.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.840
So now all the plug ins which have something to do with the job abortion will now take a

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.800
look at this particular property to get diversion.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.640
We're talking about properties.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.760
They're no different from properties in.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.120
And just as we have some building properties in and we do have some pretty fine properties

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.290
just as you see here,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.120
,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.310
I also put a link which you can refer to.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.870
Take a look at all the list off three different properties available and let's go to this.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.350
Link them to copy it and let's go here.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:54.000
So could just have a great look and pretty,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.150
is it implement?

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.080
We have properties for Java home the Version Exeter,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.250
just as we have an end.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.520
But if you'd like to get some information on specific properties like this,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.050
you have to refer to the plug in documentation and see how we can deal with it.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.580
Well,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.300
for now,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.720
to keep the ball rolling,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.750
this would suffice.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.450
You don't have to set any additional properties or anything of that sort,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.610
but I believe this is still going to cost problem because we're currently having Java

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.480
Washington.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.440
But we have and all the version off the compiler plug in.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.650
So I think things won't work.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:44.110
We may need to get more specific and explicitly mentioned an older washing of java but in

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.850
here what what we're actually mentioning is we want to come about our Java files with the

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.940
source version,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.190
and we want to make it fit those class files for the Stargate abortion.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.260
That's what this source and target means.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.410
So let's try to build it again and see if things will work.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.750
My guess is it want.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.070
But before that,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.050
there's one additional thing which meant to do if you go here,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.190
this is not required at all.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.390
But it's highly recommended because when you have a project with lot off tasks,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.580
then moving is going to be needing some memory.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.180
So if we said this as part of the system variable under enrollment variables,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.290
then things will run smoothly.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.780
Even if you don't set this,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.650
things may still go well,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.810
but you may face problem it later Point of time,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.050
so let's set it right away.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.390
Let's go to our enrollment variables.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:49.350
Click on enrollment variables going to add a new system variable in here.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.240
No,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.830
I've been copied this from here and that.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.280
So hit.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.850
Okay,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:07.430
I'm going to make this instruction part off the downloadable so that he can copy and do the

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.950
same said.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.010
Maybe in options of whatever.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.910
All right,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.710
let's move on.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.360
Let's have the file.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.610
So let's build the project and see what's going to happen.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:33.680
Don us immune install and this works.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.550
That's great.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.910
It didn't was still had the problem with the Compel a plug in.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.970
So one alternative is to all right,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.630
this plug in by copping it from here and all right,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.260
it in our poem that XML download the latest version.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.870
But for the time being,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.750
since we haven't talked about plug ins,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.940
I'm going to just simply said this to worsen,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.280
say,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.960
nine,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.320
for the time being,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.750
absurd to mine as well.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:16.800
And let's try to build a project now with me even install.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.510
If you reach to this.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.250
Fares were tests have started,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.010
and that means things are already good.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.620
And sure enough,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.550
we have this message build success.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:39.100
So know what this install task has done for us is it has done all the predict was a task,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:45.400
including the creation of the artifact and then the install would actually install that

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.360
artifact in a local depository.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.080
But where is going to store this jar file?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.170
Whether we have this new director with the name Target.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.650
That's where the resulting artifact would decide.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.850
One of which is this.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.330
So they installed us,

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.570
would essentially copied this to a local report story.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.800
But where is it going to copy?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.050
Can you make a guess?

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.250
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.820
Well,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.270
it's going to copy in this location.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.450
Calm that company with that defect named my project etcetera.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.400
So let's goto our repository and take a look at it.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.650
So we have calm company,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.950
my project,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.550
and then we have this snapshot in here.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.200
Well,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.650
I guess that's it on this local depository.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.320
But there's one last thing I'd like to mention distant guests.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.200
If you'd like to point to a different directory for your local depository,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.320
then you can make those changes in the settings or XML file.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.190
And what is that?

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.620
Settings dot XML file.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.250
Let me just show you what I mean.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.890
Under moving home director,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.960
you have this character with the name Khan inside,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.990
which would be able to locate this file settings,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.700
or XML,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.300
and if you open it,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:06.550
you can actually introduce some settings that would remain common for all the maven

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.280
projects running in your computer,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.030
one of which is going to talk about very local depository,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.100
is reciting by default.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.030
It is going to point to use a home dot I'm to depository,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.720
which we have seen.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.180
But if you'd like to point to different territory,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:30.050
you can just use this particular tag local depository and introduce it in here.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.590
And you would point to that directory from the point you're repulsed.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.170
Her location will not be pointing to it to this new directory,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.130
but it's recommended that you not mess with this particle s settings Arctic similar under

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.350
the contradictory,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.630
but rather what you should do,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.670
ideally is.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:55.950
And to copy this settings are XML file into the empty directory and passed it in here.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.310
Open it and make your edits.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.340
As you wish.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.850
No mess with the actual settles or XML,

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.650
but you can change it Over here.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.860
It's a recommended practice.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.450
But if you indigence the same tag inside your poem that XML,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.470
then it will have the preference.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:22.240
So the preference that goes like this what have you defined inside the palm there?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.850
XML.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:29.440
We'll have higher preference over whatever you defined in the settings dot xml file under

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.500
your daughter into directory and whatever you define within this settings are XML.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:41.280
We'll have higher preference over this saddens our XML residing in the maven contradictory

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.890
so accordingly need to define your settings.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.750
We're going to talk about the settings dot xml file.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.570
We have a video dedicated for that as well.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:59.170
Let me under these changes and and I guess that will sapphires on local depositories See

00:12:59.170 --> 00:12:59.670
you soon.
