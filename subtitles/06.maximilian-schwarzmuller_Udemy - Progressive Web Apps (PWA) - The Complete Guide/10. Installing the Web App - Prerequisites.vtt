00:02.260 --> 00:07.530
In the last lecture, I showed you how our web application looks like on a native device and how we can actually

00:07.530 --> 00:11.720
add it to the home screen and how we can then start it with this button.

00:11.820 --> 00:18.090
Now it would be nice if we wouldn't have to add it manually but instead if the browser would prompt

00:18.090 --> 00:19.140
us to do so

00:19.350 --> 00:24.380
and on this page, you can see it. Here on the right, you just saw the banner coming up from the bottom,

00:24.390 --> 00:25.650
let's do this again.

00:25.650 --> 00:32.160
They're entering a page here and this page will actually be a progressive web page and then you see

00:32.160 --> 00:34.290
this banner sliding up from the bottom

00:34.290 --> 00:38.690
whether we want to install this or not, add it to the home screen. On this page

00:38.690 --> 00:45.390
you also find the criteria and I do link to this page, link can be found at the end of the module or

00:45.390 --> 00:50.960
to be precise at this page which is linked here which is an always kept up-to-date

00:50.990 --> 00:56.760
version of the requirements because these requirements will probably change over time

00:56.760 --> 01:01.350
and right now, these are the current requirements to be fulfilled to see the banner but as they might

01:01.350 --> 01:02.010
change,

01:02.040 --> 01:08.370
it's far more useful for you to know where to look it up than to rely on the video here which might

01:08.370 --> 01:11.130
simply not be true in one year or so.

01:11.130 --> 01:17.010
So right now at the point of time I'm recording this, we need to have a web app manifest with a short name,

01:17.220 --> 01:28.380
name, a 144x144 icon and a start URL as well as a service worker and our page being

01:28.380 --> 01:33.500
served via https which is generally a requirement for service workers.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.420
Now I will come back to service workers later in the course,

01:36.450 --> 01:41.700
they are a super important topic for progressive web apps and I don't want to dive too deep into them

01:41.700 --> 01:42.690
right now,

01:42.690 --> 01:49.220
again this is some extra feature you need to unlock on your page, which depends on your page being served

01:49.220 --> 01:55.310
via https, localhost is an exception though and you will need this too for this web app install 

01:55.320 --> 01:57.060
banner to appear.

01:57.060 --> 02:03.450
Finally your page needs to be visited at least twice with at least five minutes between these visits

02:03.570 --> 02:04.880
to see that banner.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.380
So these are the current requirements,

02:06.380 --> 02:10.050
again check this page to see the up-to-date requirements.

02:10.050 --> 02:14.610
Now since we need service workers here, we don't fulfill these requirements yet,

02:14.700 --> 02:19.680
we will do so soon in this course though once we covered service workers. For now

02:19.680 --> 02:24.370
be aware that this banner exists, prompting the user whether he wants to install it or not

02:24.450 --> 02:26.460
but you can always toggle it manually

02:26.470 --> 02:28.160
via add to home screen.
