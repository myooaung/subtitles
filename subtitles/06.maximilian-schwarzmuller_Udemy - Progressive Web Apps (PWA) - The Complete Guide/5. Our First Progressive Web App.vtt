WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:08.400
Now that we learned a lot about what progressive web apps are and why they are awesome, let's build our

00:08.400 --> 00:10.230
first very simple one

00:10.440 --> 00:13.970
and for that as I already mentioned it, please use Chrome.

00:13.980 --> 00:19.880
I strongly recommend it because whilst we will build it in a way, the course project I mean, that it also

00:19.890 --> 00:21.590
works on older browsers,

00:21.810 --> 00:26.610
you of course also want to see all the new features you are using, right and Chrome is one of the browsers

00:26.610 --> 00:30.620
which supports most of them or all of them actually we will use in this course,

00:30.720 --> 00:31.960
so I recommend using it.

00:32.020 --> 00:35.350
Now throughout the course, I will always highlight which browser supports what

00:35.460 --> 00:38.410
but again, Chrome is the one supporting everything.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.620
Additionally, the developer tools are awesome,

00:40.620 --> 00:45.060
I'm going to use it and it will be easier for you to follow along if you are using Chrome.

00:45.060 --> 00:50.610
Of course you can go back to your favorite browser outside of course again then. Besides Chrome, we'll also

00:50.610 --> 00:51.220
need NodeJS.

00:51.240 --> 00:58.530
Now we're not writing a server-side application here but NodeJS ships with npm, it's package manager

00:58.680 --> 01:04.890
and it's the de-facto package manager for development projects, for front-end Javascript development

01:04.890 --> 01:08.850
projects and we will use it too to install some dependencies,

01:08.970 --> 01:13.220
mainly one dependency, a development server to really simulate that

01:13.230 --> 01:17.170
our application runs on a server even though it runs on the local device.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.710
So make sure to visit nodejs.org and simply download the latest version,

01:21.750 --> 01:24.070
if you're having problems with that,

01:24.180 --> 01:26.490
choose 6.11 instead

01:26.580 --> 01:30.440
or whatever the latest stable version is at the point of time you're viewing this.

01:30.450 --> 01:33.160
So make sure to download and install NodeJS,

01:33.210 --> 01:39.810
again we're just using it to bring up that development server and to manage our dependencies, our libraries

01:39.840 --> 01:41.130
and so on.

01:41.190 --> 01:45.710
Once you've got all of this set up attached to this lecture, you can find a download.

01:45.810 --> 01:53.730
Download it and open it in your favorite IDE - Sublime, Atom, Web Storm, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, whatever

01:53.730 --> 01:54.740
that is, 

01:54.750 --> 01:58.620
this is the starting project we'll use here, later in this course,

01:58.620 --> 02:00.620
we'll use a different project though.

02:00.780 --> 02:07.020
Now here first of all with NodeJS installed, you need to open up your terminal or command prompt on

02:07.020 --> 02:12.750
your operating system and this here is the normal terminal, just integrated into my IDE and navigate

02:12.750 --> 02:19.090
into that project folder and in there, simply run npm install, npm refers to this Node Package Manager

02:19.090 --> 02:22.040
we installed automatically together with Node.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.120
Once you hit enter, this will install all dependencies which is only one in our case,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.440
you can check it in the package.json file,

02:29.490 --> 02:31.910
it's this HTTP server here. Now

02:31.920 --> 02:34.220
this simply is a development-only server,

02:34.260 --> 02:39.450
why don't we just double-click on the HTML files? Because if we double-click on them, we use the

02:39.450 --> 02:42.390
file protocol and that's not HTTP

02:42.510 --> 02:47.490
and for that reason, all the features I want to show you won't work because it's not really served like

02:47.490 --> 02:48.780
a web application.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.840
We want to simulate it as such though and test it as such,

02:51.840 --> 02:57.150
hence we need a web server and this is a super simple development-only server where we don't need to

02:57.150 --> 03:00.440
write any code to get it to run our app.

03:00.510 --> 03:06.300
Once you did install it, you can run npm start in the same terminal and keep that running because the

03:06.300 --> 03:07.850
server needs to keep running

03:07.980 --> 03:11.550
and then here you see the URL under which you can see your application.

03:11.550 --> 03:16.400
Now let's open it by simply navigating back to the browser and entering it here,

03:16.530 --> 03:21.200
you could also open localhost:3000 by the way and you will see this is

03:21.200 --> 03:27.360
the application I want to start with. It plays a nice little animation, showcasing the advantages of progressive

03:27.360 --> 03:29.290
web apps and what you're going to learn

03:29.290 --> 03:33.890
in this course. It's nice but it's a normal website,

03:34.230 --> 03:39.430
let's turn it into a progressive web app together. Back into your project,

03:39.450 --> 03:43.190
open the public folder and there, you see that

03:43.230 --> 03:44.480
sw.js file.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.470
That's going to become important,

03:46.500 --> 03:47.840
I'll explain what it is,

03:47.940 --> 03:50.700
a service worker, later in this course.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.410
Now for now, let's go to src/js

03:52.410 --> 03:53.710
and then the app.js

03:53.730 --> 03:54.930
file.

03:55.200 --> 04:02.530
Here's a very simple code to run that animation by simply adding CSS classes every x seconds.

04:02.580 --> 04:06.020
Now before we execute that, let's do something else,

04:06.180 --> 04:18.190
let's run navigator.serviceWorker.register and there, pass a string where you point to 

04:18.230 --> 04:18.630
/sw.js,

04:18.650 --> 04:23.020
so basically to that file. That's all for now,

04:23.420 --> 04:25.010
just add this line.

04:25.130 --> 04:29.430
Now save it and thereafter, reload your page.

04:31.360 --> 04:39.380
Now let's open up the developer tools and go to the application tab, if you click on service worker,

04:39.480 --> 04:41.650
you now see that this is populated,

04:41.910 --> 04:44.840
we'll come back to what exactly happened here later in the course.

04:44.860 --> 04:49.250
You also see I'm previewing this as a native device or as a mobile device,

04:49.320 --> 04:51.480
you can always toggle between these displays,

04:51.570 --> 04:54.910
I like this quite a lot because we're building something which would look good there,

04:54.930 --> 04:58.270
so why don't we use it here? And now with that,

04:58.290 --> 05:06.210
let's tick offline here or under network, offline. Also make sure you disable the cache here under network.

05:06.210 --> 05:13.350
Now if we reload the page, you see it still works even though we have no internet connection anymore

05:13.470 --> 05:15.290
and you could say yes makes sense,

05:15.300 --> 05:18.910
it's running on my local machine, right?

05:19.200 --> 05:19.590
Yes

05:19.620 --> 05:26.100
but if we take the offline button here, Chrome will basically simulate that this internet is off, that this

05:26.100 --> 05:28.400
browser can't connect to this server

05:28.440 --> 05:33.590
and keep in mind, we have a real web server here because we did start. we didn't just double-click

05:33.600 --> 05:35.550
the HTML file as I explained.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.200
So this really is working an offline mode

05:38.520 --> 05:44.130
and if you don't believe me, go to the application service worker and click unregister there and reload

05:44.130 --> 05:44.770
again,

05:44.970 --> 05:48.150
now you get this there is no internet connection screen.

05:48.540 --> 05:56.550
This is our first application where we successfully register a service worker so that our application

05:56.550 --> 05:59.430
works even if we are offline.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.990
Now we'll learn much more in this course

06:02.070 --> 06:07.860
but this is a great first step and we'll build up on this and learn how we can use different strategies

06:07.860 --> 06:14.130
to decide what to store for offline usage and what not, how to add these push notifications and much

06:14.130 --> 06:14.500
more,

06:14.550 --> 06:16.860
I can't wait to dive into that with you.

06:16.860 --> 06:22.500
So with that, let's not lose any time and let's continue seeing what exactly makes up progressive web

06:22.500 --> 06:25.880
apps and which features we are going to learn about in this course.
