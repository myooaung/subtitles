WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:08.960
So over the last lectures, we learned what progressive webs apps are and why we might want to build our next

00:08.960 --> 00:11.800
web application as a progressive web app.

00:12.260 --> 00:17.920
Now let me show you an example for a progressive web app, at app.ft.com,

00:17.930 --> 00:21.440
you can visit the application page of The Financial Times,

00:21.560 --> 00:25.040
this runs in the browser but it is a progressive web app.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.980
It feels a lot like an app

00:26.990 --> 00:32.810
if we navigate around there with the animations and the menu and if I open my Chrome developer tools

00:32.810 --> 00:38.840
and switch into device mode by pressing this icon here, you see of course it also looks like a

00:38.840 --> 00:39.770
mobile app.

00:40.130 --> 00:44.060
Now a cool thing happens if I now do the following.

00:44.270 --> 00:50.060
If I go to network in the Chrome developer tools which I strongly recommend using, I recommend using Chrome

00:50.060 --> 00:54.830
for this course because it supports all the features you're going to learn about and its developer

00:54.830 --> 00:55.810
tools are awesome,

00:55.910 --> 00:57.320
more about this later.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.070
So if you go to network and click on offline here, you can simulate that you're offline.

01:03.140 --> 01:08.360
Now if I reload that page, you'll still see some content.

01:08.420 --> 01:09.770
The images are not there,

01:09.770 --> 01:13.180
I'll give you that but you can still read that article here.

01:13.370 --> 01:18.690
This is because it is a progressive web app offering you some nice features.

01:18.780 --> 01:26.270
Now Google even built a tool which you can use to judge how well a site performs as a progressive web

01:26.270 --> 01:29.090
app and it's built right into the developer tools

01:29.090 --> 01:33.470
if you're using the latest version of Chrome, it's lighthouse.

01:33.550 --> 01:40.100
If you don't have the auto-tab here though, you can simply search for lighthouse chrome and then find

01:40.100 --> 01:43.080
the page where you get installation instructions about lighthouse,

01:43.130 --> 01:45.460
you can add it as a Chrome extension then.

01:45.680 --> 01:51.150
Now if you do have that auto-tab, let's perform an audit on the Financial Times page here

01:51.260 --> 01:57.480
and this will now do a couple of checks to find out how well this performs as a progressive web app.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.570
Let's wait for this to finish and analyze the results.

02:01.510 --> 02:02.690
So the test is done

02:02.710 --> 02:09.460
and overall the page does OK. A couple of features are missing which would make it a really good or awesome

02:09.460 --> 02:10.690
progressive web app

02:11.020 --> 02:16.090
and the performance isn't that great here but that might also be connected to my performance here on

02:16.090 --> 02:17.770
the machine whilst I'm recording.

02:18.070 --> 02:24.330
So this is a decent progressive web app implementing a lot of the features and I will also explain in

02:24.340 --> 02:28.470
one of the next lectures that it is ok to not reach 100 here,

02:28.630 --> 02:35.380
you do have the choice between going all the way to it, not at all or any step in-between,

02:35.410 --> 02:41.250
you can add features of that progressive web app world as you need them in your app.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.520
So this is nice,

02:42.520 --> 02:44.640
now I want to show you another page.

02:44.740 --> 02:50.980
You can't open that because its offline but this is the course project we'll build, it's an Instagram clone, a

02:50.980 --> 02:55.380
simple one of course as a progressive web app. It looks and feels nice

02:55.420 --> 02:59.520
in my opinion, the cool thing is that this of course is a progressive web app.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.270
Now one thing we can do is we can take an image,

03:02.350 --> 03:05.360
so let's allow camera access and hey here I am.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.480
So let me quickly take an image here,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.020
you will see I'm sitting in front of a green screen,

03:10.240 --> 03:14.700
let's also get my location, so I'll need to allow that to fetch it.

03:14.720 --> 03:23.050
It will be masked here, I don't want to show my full location and then let me enter some title during

03:23.050 --> 03:26.640
my recordings and keep in mind, this is in the browser,

03:26.740 --> 03:33.130
it's just looking like on a real device, throughout the course though, I will also show how the app runs on a real device.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.650
So for now, let me click post here to post this.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.110
Now it's safe for syncing

03:38.140 --> 03:41.470
and if we reload, there it is already,

03:41.500 --> 03:44.380
so this has saved on some server.

03:44.380 --> 03:49.180
Now again you can't access this page here but you will build it on your own and we will also ship it

03:49.180 --> 03:52.280
to the web at the end of the course. Now

03:52.290 --> 03:54.240
thus far you might think it's nice,

03:54.240 --> 03:57.870
that camera thing is nice but not super impressive.

03:57.910 --> 04:04.780
Now let me turn off my Wi-Fi here, to really have no internet connection anymore. If I reload the page,

04:04.780 --> 04:10.000
you can ignore these errors because they are basically cached and I still see my page,

04:10.030 --> 04:13.870
even my content here and I can still navigate around.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.940
Now there's one more thing I want to do

04:15.950 --> 04:19.740
for which I will need internet connection, so let me quickly turn it on again,

04:20.480 --> 04:23.750
I want to enable push notifications.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.310
So let me click here and allow access

04:26.660 --> 04:31.440
and now I get this push notification here on my other screen,

04:31.460 --> 04:36.330
so unfortunately this isn't recorded because push notifications were turned on.

04:36.380 --> 04:43.620
Now with that, let me now go offline by turning off the Wi-Fi and now I try to send another posts.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.010
Let me take a picture

04:47.660 --> 04:51.120
and let's send this from offline mode, I'm in Munich.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.960
Let me add post here

04:52.960 --> 04:55.690
and it's also saved for synchronization.

04:55.690 --> 05:02.650
Now clearly it can't send it, I have no internet connection, so let's say I now come back online because

05:02.650 --> 05:09.630
my Wi-Fi re-establishes connection. Now it's syncing this and if I reload the app,

05:09.670 --> 05:12.590
here it is, from offline.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.280
This is what makes this a progressive web app,

05:15.300 --> 05:21.780
a lot of the features you might know from your native apps but you haven't seen that often in a web

05:21.780 --> 05:22.620
app.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.720
This works fully offline,

05:24.750 --> 05:26.150
it caches everything, 

05:26.200 --> 05:31.620
it accesses the device camera, has push messages as you saw and much more.

05:32.130 --> 05:37.470
So now let me conclude this by making an audit on this app too, so that you can see what you're going to

05:37.470 --> 05:38.550
build in this course.

05:38.640 --> 05:44.790
Let's perform an audit here with lighthouse again and let's see how many features about progressive

05:44.790 --> 05:50.130
web apps I packed into this application and what you're going to learn in this course

05:50.130 --> 05:55.210
therefore, I'll be back once this audit finished. The audit finished

05:55.260 --> 05:58.590
and here you can see I got a 100 in progressive web app,

05:58.680 --> 06:04.640
so this is a perfect progressive web app using all the features that make up a progressive web app.

06:04.740 --> 06:10.560
You see the other metrics are also amazing and that means you're going to learn a lot of useful

06:10.560 --> 06:16.740
things in that course because we'll start from scratch, we'll build this app together and add all these

06:16.740 --> 06:19.430
features that lead to this 100 together.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.910
Can't wait to get started with you.
