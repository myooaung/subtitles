WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:06.170
There's this other core concept I want to emphasize as well,

00:06.320 --> 00:08.140
it's a progressive web app,

00:08.240 --> 00:10.610
what does the progressive actually mean?

00:10.610 --> 00:13.410
It doesn't mean you can use the device camera.

00:13.880 --> 00:20.070
Indeed, it basically means that we can progressively enhance our web application.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.370
So let's consider this starting point,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.130
we have three different web apps,

00:24.140 --> 00:25.540
one is a legacy web app,

00:25.550 --> 00:32.090
so an older web app using older technology and probably also supporting older browsers.

00:32.390 --> 00:39.440
Then we have an existing modern app which is maybe also a traditional web app, not not a single page application

00:39.440 --> 00:47.540
nothing fancy but it target's modern browsers because maybe it's an internal company tool or some page

00:47.540 --> 00:54.050
which mainly addresses tech enthusiasts, something like that and maybe we have an upcoming project and

00:54.050 --> 01:00.140
there, we can pretty much bank on people having more modern browsers because support is already getting

01:00.170 --> 01:02.750
better, more people are using modern browsers,

01:02.750 --> 01:05.090
it's probably going to be better in the future too.

01:05.420 --> 01:11.090
So we have these three different apps, can we only turn the upcoming project into a progressive web app

01:11.090 --> 01:16.500
now? Because rewriting an existing app from scratch certainly isn't an option,

01:16.520 --> 01:21.010
so if you want to turn this into a progressive web app, you can't just start over.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.700
Well let's have a look at the near future,

01:23.810 --> 01:29.360
we can simply add some features to our existing app and this is actually something I will show you on

01:29.360 --> 01:30.200
the course.

01:30.200 --> 01:36.660
We will take a project and add features step-by-step and you can stop at any given point,

01:36.890 --> 01:40.890
you can stop after adding an app manifest and a basic service worker.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.250
You can stop after you implement the basic caching, advanced caching, push notifications,

01:46.250 --> 01:52.640
you can stop all the time. Now your existing modern app, here you can maybe implement some more progressive

01:52.640 --> 01:57.710
web app features and for the upcoming project you have there, you can start from scratch obviously,

01:57.740 --> 02:03.200
so you can fully implement it as a progressive web app right from the start and plan everything with

02:03.200 --> 02:04.670
that in mind.

02:04.730 --> 02:12.490
Now in the further away future, our older application might use some or multiple progressive web app

02:12.500 --> 02:13.780
features but not all of them 

02:13.820 --> 02:15.200
and that's perfectly fine,

02:15.230 --> 02:18.260
you don't have to use zero or 100% percent,

02:18.290 --> 02:22.810
you can absolutely use 40% of all the features you learn in the course,

02:22.820 --> 02:26.630
pick the ones which enhance your application and add them.

02:26.780 --> 02:32.810
Now therefore our middle app here maybe is a completely converted progressive web app

02:32.930 --> 02:38.240
in the end because we added all the features which make up a progressive web app. We have solid caching

02:38.240 --> 02:43.550
in different circumstances, we use push notifications and all that stuff.

02:44.030 --> 02:49.790
And our upcoming project already of course was planned as a progressive web app and therefore also is

02:49.790 --> 02:55.400
one and this is important because I know that a lot of people are looking at all these technologies and

02:55.400 --> 03:02.720
are saying, well I don't have the resources or the time to rebuild my old app and I have to support old

03:02.720 --> 03:03.710
browsers anyways,

03:03.800 --> 03:09.530
these users are never going to see the new features and I can only answer you, that's not a problem,

03:09.530 --> 03:16.010
simply add the features which enhance your application right now and feel free to turn it into a complete

03:16.010 --> 03:17.980
progressive web app if you have the time.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.080
Definitely consider it for all upcoming projects though.
