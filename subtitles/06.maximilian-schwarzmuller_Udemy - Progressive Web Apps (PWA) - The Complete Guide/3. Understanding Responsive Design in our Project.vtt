00:02.150 --> 00:06.180
So back in our course project, this is how it looks right now

00:06.320 --> 00:12.050
and I always opened it in this mobile device preview here in the Chrome developer tools.

00:12.170 --> 00:17.450
Now actually of course I can turn this off and if I close the developer tools, you see this already is

00:17.450 --> 00:22.200
a responsive web application. In fullscreen mode on a desktop,

00:22.220 --> 00:27.980
we have the toolbar with our navigation items up here in a button and we can see the card here

00:28.100 --> 00:29.810
and we have that image here

00:30.020 --> 00:36.420
but if I shrink that screen even without entering device preview mode, you'll see how it adjusts

00:36.590 --> 00:42.300
and now we have the toolbar icons, from a certain point on, they are gone and we only have that side drawer.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.710
So the application already is responsive because I'm using this material design lite package behind

00:48.710 --> 00:50.290
the scenes, the package

00:50.510 --> 00:59.270
we basically import with that style import here in our index.html file, this CSS file combined with Javascript

00:59.270 --> 01:03.350
file here which is for example responsible for the drawer working,

01:03.470 --> 01:07.010
we ensured that our application already is responsible.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.380
Now let's inspect what's causing that.

01:09.500 --> 01:17.080
Actually if we inspect our toolbar here for example, as I increase it, you will see that the classes here

01:17.090 --> 01:17.800
changed,

01:17.840 --> 01:19.130
did you see that flicker,

01:19.160 --> 01:20.980
watch closely here on the right.

01:21.050 --> 01:25.970
If I shrink this, it's purple because the class has changed.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.870
Now what's changing is that if I increase this to be on a big screen, it has these classes

01:31.880 --> 01:36.430
but if I shrink it, it gets the extra isSmall screen class.

01:36.470 --> 01:39.800
Now that is simply attached via Javascript to be honest

01:39.950 --> 01:45.400
but the isSmall screen class decides that we no longer should see the toolbar icons.

01:45.440 --> 01:53.920
So on the header row here or to be precise, on the navigation here, these icons or these items here,

01:53.920 --> 01:56.900
they're no longer visible because they get hidden

01:56.900 --> 02:05.110
if we have the isSmall screen class added. If we click the whole navigation area, here if isSmall screen is

02:05.120 --> 02:05.670
added,

02:05.750 --> 02:07.360
the display is set to none,

02:07.540 --> 02:10.090
so that leads to the toolbar items disappearing.

02:10.220 --> 02:15.650
And this is one way of implementing a responsive design, using Javascript to detect when the screen

02:15.650 --> 02:22.880
size changes and attaching a certain class or removing a certain CSS class. The CSS native way is this

02:22.880 --> 02:30.440
one here though, use a certain media query, in this example that the width of the screen is a maximum

02:30.440 --> 02:32.630
of 1024 pixels

02:32.720 --> 02:36.520
and then this style here will only get applied if this is true.

02:36.620 --> 02:42.440
If I increase this beyond that boundary, you'll see the media query is gone here because now we have more

02:42.440 --> 02:49.120
than 1024 pixels, you can see it here in the top right corner as I move this and hence this is removed.

02:49.400 --> 02:54.350
So this is generally how we already work with it without us writing any code for it.

02:54.350 --> 02:59.600
Now if you build your application from scratch and you don't use any library as I do, you will have to

02:59.600 --> 03:01.280
write all the logic on your own

03:01.400 --> 03:04.710
and this is where this responsive design course you should have a look at

03:04.850 --> 03:06.510
comes into play.

03:06.590 --> 03:07.880
Now that's one thing

03:07.910 --> 03:12.140
but I also want to write my own code, for example this card.

03:12.140 --> 03:16.110
It always has the same width, no matter how wide my screen is,

03:16.160 --> 03:21.260
I also want to take care about this image here because on big screens, it doesn't look as good as it

03:21.260 --> 03:22.050
could,

03:22.070 --> 03:24.160
we could actually use a bigger image there.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.200
Let's start with CSS and media queries though.
