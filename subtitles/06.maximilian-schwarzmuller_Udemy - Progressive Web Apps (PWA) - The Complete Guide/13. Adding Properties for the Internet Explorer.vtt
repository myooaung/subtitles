In the last lecture, we had a look at how we can improve the experience on Safari,

00:06.780 --> 00:13.650
now there are also a couple of other meta tags we can add to really create a good user experience,

00:13.650 --> 00:20.250
for example for the Internet Explorer. Now Edge will soon support the manifest.json file but the

00:20.250 --> 00:22.260
old Internet Explorers won't.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.780
Well, we can at least improve the experience a bit here too,

00:25.800 --> 00:34.830
again with a meta tag where the name now is msapplication-TileImage, so this will be the image used

00:34.920 --> 00:37.530
on this Windows tile

00:37.530 --> 00:43.440
then if we save this to the home screen and here, the content then is an icon we want to use,

00:43.470 --> 00:47.090
I will point to the 144x144

00:47.100 --> 00:58.260
icon here, so /src/images/icons and then its app-icon-144x144.png. Another

00:58.260 --> 01:00.400
meta tag we can add for

01:00.480 --> 01:04.530
Internet Explorer is the msapplication,

01:04.530 --> 01:11.340
again this is kind of showing that it is related to a web application-like approach, the tile color,

01:11.360 --> 01:15.310
so the background color behind the icon and here I'll set the content to

01:15.450 --> 01:22.060
#fff to have this white background color behind the icon and again, this will be on the

01:22.110 --> 01:23.650
windows tile.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.930
And finally, there is one other meta tag you can add,

01:27.150 --> 01:34.890
this is interesting across browsers, it's the meta tag where the name is theme color and you can set

01:34.890 --> 01:41.910
this to a content, typically to the same content as you have in your manifest.json file for the theme.

01:41.970 --> 01:46.250
So this color here, the theme color specified here,

01:46.260 --> 01:53.520
you also set it here and whilst Chrome and so on will read this from your manifest.json file, other

01:53.530 --> 01:59.910
browsers will parse this and also Chrome use this as a fallback in case it has some issues with the

02:00.030 --> 02:02.510
manifest.json file or anything like that,

02:02.610 --> 02:06.830
so it's good to also specify this in the index.html file.

02:06.990 --> 02:14.400
Now finally one thing you absolutely have to do is, do the same in all the pages you are loading, not

02:14.400 --> 02:15.180
just in the root

02:15.180 --> 02:16.670
index.html file.

02:16.710 --> 02:22.320
So also do the same for the other page in the help folder, there below the manifest,

02:22.320 --> 02:24.860
I also add all the links and tags

02:24.990 --> 02:28.770
we just added in our main index.html file.
