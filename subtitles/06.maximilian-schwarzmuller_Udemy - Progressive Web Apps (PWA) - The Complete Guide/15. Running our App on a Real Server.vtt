WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:08.620
With all the enhancements we made over this module, let's now finally see our application run on a real

00:08.620 --> 00:09.730
web server

00:09.730 --> 00:16.440
and keep in mind, we're already using Firebase and Firebase also has a hosting solution.

00:16.450 --> 00:21.470
So what I'll do is, I'll open my terminal and run Firebase deploy.

00:21.640 --> 00:26.410
In the past, we did this to ship a new function version, now we'll still upload the function in this case

00:26.440 --> 00:32.720
too but we always also just uploaded our project, our public folder to the hosting

00:33.010 --> 00:34.740
and now this is exactly what I want to do here now.

00:34.740 --> 00:41.460
I want to upload my updated project from the public folder to Firebase hosting so that we can see

00:41.540 --> 00:47.770
it run on a real server, I'll be back once it is finished. The deployment finished and now I can fetch this

00:47.770 --> 00:49.880
hosting URL here.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.180
Now let's go back to the browser and let's open it there.

00:54.570 --> 00:59.520
In this new tab, I now have my application running on a real browser

00:59.760 --> 01:01.730
and there it seems to work,

01:01.830 --> 01:03.570
let's reload this one more time.

01:03.600 --> 01:10.140
Now if we load this page though, we get this error regarding the 404 page. Now that has something to

01:10.140 --> 01:12.820
do with how Firebase serves that page,

01:12.840 --> 01:18.710
it's basically not storing it like a normal HTML page as it is lying in our source directory here.

01:18.990 --> 01:23.840
That's why workbox fails to precache it because it's not there anymore,

01:23.910 --> 01:26.700
Firebase basically took it and store it differently,

01:26.700 --> 01:34.650
hence what I'll do here is all added to globIgnores, the 404.html page, so that this doesn't get

01:34.650 --> 01:40.500
precached. Precaching that page isn't that important anyways because if we had a route where we expected

01:40.500 --> 01:46.620
HTML which is not known and we're offline, we'll load our offline fallback anyways

01:46.620 --> 01:49.800
and if we're online, the 404 page will work.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.360
So removing it from precaching shouldn't be an issue

01:53.640 --> 02:01.400
and with that, we can simply rerun generate-sw, we don't need to rerun the whole build process,

02:01.410 --> 02:04.670
we didn't change any script so no need to re-minify,

02:04.710 --> 02:07.310
we only need to ensure that the service worker is up-to-date

02:07.620 --> 02:13.990
and then we can rerun Firebase deploy to ship this updated version to Firebase. And with the 404.html

02:14.030 --> 02:16.890
file excluded from precaching,

02:17.010 --> 02:21.890
you'll see it's now missing in that file manifest array, with that excluded,

02:21.990 --> 02:23.840
it should work on Firebase too.

02:23.940 --> 02:29.360
So let's wait for this to finish and that's then have a look at our Firebase project and see if it now

02:29.370 --> 02:36.000
works as expected. So the deployment finished, with that I reload the tab, let me reload it one more time,

02:36.210 --> 02:40.240
close it and re-open it to really install a fresh service worker version

02:40.410 --> 02:46.880
and now here, we should see that under application caches, we've got all these workbox caches

02:47.130 --> 02:50.830
and now we no longer get an error. If we go offline,

02:50.880 --> 02:53.180
it works as we would expect it to work

02:53.490 --> 03:00.300
and let's now even test background synchronization by really going offline, turning Wi-Fi off and creating

03:00.300 --> 03:01.500
a new post.

03:01.540 --> 03:05.880
I'm asked if I want to allow this because it's a brand new service worker on a new domain,

03:05.970 --> 03:12.150
so I'll click yes, capture this and test from Firebase now.

03:12.150 --> 03:17.430
Let's get a location, allow it but it won't work because I'm offline,

03:17.430 --> 03:19.910
so let's enter one, that's ok by me,

03:20.160 --> 03:21.470
let's click post.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.270
It's now saved for syncing,

03:23.400 --> 03:31.520
so let me now go back online by turning Wi-Fi back on and with that, we should see that it tries to

03:31.520 --> 03:32.650
synchronize that

03:32.810 --> 03:36.890
and it did and I forgot to subscribe to push subscriptions.

03:36.970 --> 03:38.520
We would have gotten one though,

03:38.770 --> 03:45.140
we can see that if we inspect database, that there is a new post, test from Firebase.

03:45.430 --> 03:48.140
So this is all working as it should,

03:48.340 --> 03:49.270
this is awesome,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.400
now we see it on a real host.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.290
Let's do one final thing with that project now.
