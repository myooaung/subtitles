We're nearing the end of this course throughout all the course modules you learned about a ton of features

1
00:08.320 --> 00:13.870
you can add to a web application to turn it into a progressive Web application.

2
00:13.870 --> 00:20.200
Now if you have a look at your serviceworker file you might realize that it can become really big especially

3
00:20.200 --> 00:27.190
if you add a lot of Route parsing or request URL parsing to it to handle different URLs with different

4
00:27.190 --> 00:29.170
caches and strategies.

5
00:29.170 --> 00:33.220
Now thankfully there is a tool to help you with that in this module.

6
00:33.280 --> 00:39.460
We'll have a look at workbox a tool by Google which makes managing your service worker easier and

7
00:39.460 --> 00:41.060
way more automatic.

8
00:41.110 --> 00:47.310
You'll learn how to use it how to use its more advanced features like routing or request parsing.

9
00:47.530 --> 00:52.000
And how does can really help you build your progress of web application.

10
00:52.270 --> 00:58.450
And once we got that finished Why don't we audit our application and let's see what lightless has to

11
00:58.450 --> 00:59.420
