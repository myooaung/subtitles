00:02.640 --> 00:09.230
In this course module, you've got an overview over the API and the promise API, two super important API

00:09.240 --> 00:15.840
you have to know when working with service workers and with progressive web apps in general. You will

00:15.840 --> 00:20.600
notice that throughout this course, we use promises all over the place,

00:20.610 --> 00:26.940
therefore this then call and catch call has to be something you immediately recognize and you understand

00:26.940 --> 00:29.030
where it's coming from and what it does,

00:29.040 --> 00:31.200
that was the goal of this module.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.490
You'll also see that we do quite a lot of fetch requests,

00:34.500 --> 00:36.790
we'll even use fetch in the service worker,

00:36.810 --> 00:38.950
actually we already do so as you learned

00:39.120 --> 00:43.100
and it's important to understand for you too, what does fetch actually do?

00:43.140 --> 00:44.610
It sends a HTTP request,

00:44.670 --> 00:46.270
that's the core of it.

00:46.320 --> 00:52.800
Now if that you're well prepared and we can now go back to the progressive web app and dive much deeper

00:52.890 --> 00:54.060
into service workers.
