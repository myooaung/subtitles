00:02.590 --> 00:08.890
Congratulations, you made it through the entire course and you therefore learned a lot about progressive

00:08.890 --> 00:10.100
web apps.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.040
Now what are your next steps,

00:12.040 --> 00:15.960
what can you do next? After this course,

00:15.970 --> 00:20.860
I strongly encourage you to practice everything, you gained a lot of knowledge,

00:20.890 --> 00:27.940
you learned a lot but without practicing, that knowledge will quickly be gone too or at least parts of

00:27.940 --> 00:28.870
it.

00:28.870 --> 00:36.370
Take the things you learned here and gradually enhance your next project and/or your existing projects,

00:36.370 --> 00:38.960
that's what progressive web apps are for,

00:39.040 --> 00:45.720
that's the progressive in the name. You can add the features you can need in your application to them,

00:45.760 --> 00:51.430
you don't have to make a full conversion but I definitely encourage you to consider making your next

00:51.430 --> 00:56.810
project a complete progressive web app for the many reasons outlined in this course.

00:57.010 --> 01:03.220
Now besides practicing the things you learned, you can also dive deeper into the APIs, I gave you a very

01:03.220 --> 01:08.350
thorough overview but of course there's always more you can do, for the geolocation,

01:08.350 --> 01:12.790
you can try watching a user position instead of just getting the current one.

01:12.790 --> 01:16.770
You can try recording a movie with the camera API.

01:17.170 --> 01:23.110
You can dig into all the things you've learned and go beyond what you learned here in this course

01:23.260 --> 01:29.260
and then there are other APIs I want to point your direction to, an upcoming API is the payments

01:29.260 --> 01:30.040
API.

01:30.150 --> 01:35.320
Now this is not yet implemented, at least at the point of time I'm recording this.

01:35.320 --> 01:42.970
It'll be an API which once fully implemented makes checkout processes much easier. Instead of requiring

01:42.970 --> 01:45.630
your users to enter credit card data,

01:45.790 --> 01:52.480
you can basically hook into that API if you are developer of the page and the user will see a uniform

01:52.570 --> 01:58.720
checkout form where he can add his credit card data once and then use it on all pages which support

01:58.720 --> 02:05.200
this, kind of what you already know from native apps too where you can pay via the app stores for example.

02:05.930 --> 02:07.020
Another important API

02:07.050 --> 02:10.780
I want to point your direction to the web animations API.

02:11.140 --> 02:16.790
We only added one basic animation through CSS in this course and there is nothing wrong with that,

02:16.840 --> 02:25.660
if you can, use CSS it has powerful animation capabilities but with the web animations API which isn't

02:25.660 --> 02:32.310
supported by all browsers but polyfills exist, you can control animations through Javascript,

02:32.470 --> 02:38.160
that's not strictly better but sometimes gives you that extra control you need.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.370
And there are of course other things, in general progressive web apps

02:42.370 --> 02:46.640
never have a limit, you can keep on adding features,

02:46.690 --> 02:50.270
just make sure to add them in a way that your app also still works on

02:50.320 --> 02:57.310
older browsers and never forget the core, offline functionality and installability with the web app

02:57.310 --> 02:58.380
manifest.

02:58.630 --> 03:01.450
And with that, I can only encourage you to move on,

03:01.480 --> 03:02.590
take these things,

03:02.620 --> 03:04.440
dig deeper, practice,

03:04.450 --> 03:10.180
have a look at these APIs or the ones you learned in this course and build amazing applications

03:10.180 --> 03:10.860
with that.

03:10.870 --> 03:13.490
I can't wait to see what you're going to build,

03:13.690 --> 03:16.730
definitely share anything you have in this course.

03:16.750 --> 03:17.890
Have a great time,

03:18.040 --> 03:18.340
bye
