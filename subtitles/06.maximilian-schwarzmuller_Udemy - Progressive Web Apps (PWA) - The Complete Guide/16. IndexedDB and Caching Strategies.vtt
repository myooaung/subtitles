00:02.310 --> 00:06.720
Over this module, you learned a lot about indexedDB, how to access it,

00:06.720 --> 00:11.430
we have a lot of utility methods which we can now conveniently use to do all these common operations

00:11.430 --> 00:13.920
of adding, reading and deleting

00:14.400 --> 00:16.470
and with that, you learned a lot about it.

00:16.470 --> 00:19.690
Now as I mentioned, check out the documentation at the end of this module,

00:19.710 --> 00:24.750
so in the lecture at the end of this module which allows you to learn more all about the different methods

00:24.750 --> 00:29.790
you can use besides the ones I showed you here but the ones you see here are the ones which already

00:29.790 --> 00:33.620
should get you to basically everything you need to do.

00:33.750 --> 00:39.420
Now we already use this in our cache then network strategy,

00:39.570 --> 00:44.790
however as I already outlined and I'll emphasize it here again because it is important, you

00:44.790 --> 00:48.300
can use indexedDB in all the caching strategies,

00:48.420 --> 00:53.120
you replace the application cache with it and you typically use it if you have JSON data,

00:53.130 --> 00:59.310
so if you have content data. Content which is probably dynamic, which might change a lot and definitely

00:59.310 --> 01:05.220
content which you might want to transform or which you want to store in the way you later use it as

01:05.220 --> 01:05.960
we do here.

01:06.210 --> 01:10.410
If you have typical assets like images, Javascript files, CSS files,

01:10.410 --> 01:16.110
HTML files, you of course go with the cache API which is why we still use all the other strategies in

01:16.110 --> 01:18.700
the other set up in our service worker too.

01:18.810 --> 01:23.910
Now we have the full flexibility though, we have two different ways of storing data depending on which

01:23.910 --> 01:25.170
type of data we have

01:25.320 --> 01:28.350
and with that, we vastly improved our application,

01:28.350 --> 01:31.740
now having powerful tools for different situations.
