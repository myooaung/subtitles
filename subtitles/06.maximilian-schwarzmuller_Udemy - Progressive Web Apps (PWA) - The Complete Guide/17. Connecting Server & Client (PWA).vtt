In the last lecture, we created a subscription, stored it on the server,

00:06.770 --> 00:08.060
that's great,

00:08.060 --> 00:13.370
now let's use or work on the server side to send a new push message.

00:13.370 --> 00:18.720
Now before I do that though, here's one important information about the subscription we just stored.

00:19.100 --> 00:24.660
I always emphasize that the subscription refers to a browser on the device and this is true.

00:25.010 --> 00:30.980
It also refers to a given service worker there because as you saw when we set up the subscription, we

00:30.980 --> 00:33.160
set it up through the service worker.

00:33.160 --> 00:40.280
Now if we go to our client application, to the applications tab and click clear site data, we also get

00:40.280 --> 00:44.920
rid of the service worker, at least if we have unregistered servers workers ticked here

00:45.290 --> 00:48.580
and then also get rid of our existing subscriptions.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.860
Of course not on the server because we don't reach out to the server to clear them here.

00:52.860 --> 01:00.500
We better would do that though because these subscriptions on the server won't work anymore if we unregister

01:00.500 --> 01:07.250
the service worker, if we just update it by simply adding code to the service worker, reloading the page,

01:07.280 --> 01:09.380
closing the tab and opening a new one,

01:09.410 --> 01:12.200
so this normal update procedure,

01:12.200 --> 01:18.800
it won't be a problem because there, we won't re-install a completely new one but if we unregister a

01:18.800 --> 01:22.860
service worker, we render all existing subscriptions useless.

01:22.940 --> 01:26.790
So use this with care, that's something you definitely have to keep in mind.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.880
Keep your service worker registered, update it,

01:29.930 --> 01:31.220
whatever you need to do

01:31.370 --> 01:37.100
but if you unregister it, also make sure to clear up your subscriptions on the server because they will

01:37.100 --> 01:38.900
no longer be valid.

01:38.900 --> 01:43.200
Now with that, in the next lecture let's actually start sending push messages.
