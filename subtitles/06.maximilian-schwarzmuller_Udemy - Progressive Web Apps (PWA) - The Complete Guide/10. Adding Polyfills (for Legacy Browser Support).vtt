Throughout this module, you learned the very basics about promises and fetch,

00:05.950 --> 00:09.820
obviously you can dive deeper and in the lecture at the end of this module,

00:09.820 --> 00:14.090
you will find some additional resources in case you are interested. However

00:14.100 --> 00:18.920
here's one important thing I want to clear up right now, fetch and promises

00:18.940 --> 00:24.940
do have good browser support, check that last lecture I was mentioning but they aren't supported

00:24.940 --> 00:28.190
by all browsers, especially not by older ones.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.900
Now as you learned, a progressive web app is about progressively adding features, so that your app is really

00:34.960 --> 00:39.370
awesome in modern browsers but also pretty good in older ones.

00:39.370 --> 00:45.760
Now if we use fetch and promises in our normal Javascript code, so not in the service worker which only

00:45.760 --> 00:51.500
works on modern browsers anyways but in the code which runs on every browser, we obviously get a error

00:51.500 --> 00:56.050
if we execute our app or run our app on an older browser.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.430
So we have two options,

00:57.490 --> 01:01.540
we either don't use fetch and promises there,

01:02.020 --> 01:08.860
that's possible to an extent but if we don't use fetch, we can't intercept these fetch events here in

01:08.860 --> 01:12.090
our service worker, so might not be the best option,

01:12.460 --> 01:19.120
so the other option is to use polyfills, not written by me but from other authors, two very popular

01:19.120 --> 01:23.330
polyfills for both fetch and promises.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.870
So simply copy the two files into your Javascript folder, feel free to also copy them in other folder

01:28.870 --> 01:34.500
if you would like to do that, I'll place them in the Javascript folder here, fetch and promise

01:34.530 --> 01:36.180
and again this code is not written by me,

01:36.220 --> 01:43.660
it's by third-party package authors, so basically authors of these promises. Links to the documentations

01:43.660 --> 01:50.520
and the Github repos of these polyfills can be found in the last lecture of this module. And with these

01:50.530 --> 01:52.050
polyfills added here,

01:52.090 --> 01:53.810
we also have to import them,

01:54.010 --> 01:56.840
we have to import them before we execute other code,

01:56.860 --> 02:04.030
so prior to app.js. The first has to be promise because the fetch API uses promises and the second

02:04.030 --> 02:06.720
therefore is the fetch.js file

02:06.870 --> 02:11.190
and you have to add the same imports to any other page where you plan on using these features,

02:11.200 --> 02:16.840
in my case here the help index.html file. There also you have to add it before 

02:16.930 --> 02:17.710
app.js,

02:17.740 --> 02:20.940
so basically add them before you use them.

02:20.950 --> 02:25.000
Now with that we're almost done, to enable

02:25.030 --> 02:32.920
the promise API here, I have to go to the app.js file and at the very top here, I will check if

02:33.250 --> 02:39.990
in my window, if there is a promise object which would mean that my browser natively supports promises.

02:40.030 --> 02:47.320
If this is not the case, hence the exclamation mark, then I want to set this on my own, so window.promise

02:47.320 --> 02:53.440
will then be equal to promise which is provided by the promise.js file.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.350
So this enables or activates the promise polyfill

02:56.410 --> 03:00.040
only if my browser doesn't have promises implemented

03:00.060 --> 03:07.060
anyways. So with that, we got the polyfills added and we now ensure that this also works on older

03:07.060 --> 03:07.960
browsers.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.640
Now it did work in Chrome anyways, I just want to check if we get any errors here,

03:11.680 --> 03:14.240
we don't, so that's looking great.

03:14.290 --> 03:21.020
With that we enabled promises and the fetch API on older browsers too. Now before we continue,

03:21.160 --> 03:27.520
let's understand how we can actually interact with our own fetch requests in the service worker.
