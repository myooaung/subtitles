00:02.170 --> 00:09.100
So let's dive into the last feature set, the last set of options which is important and that is actions.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.460
Actions takes an array where you can,

00:12.460 --> 00:18.240
you guessed it, specify multiple actions and each action simply is a Javascript object.

00:18.250 --> 00:22.710
Now here, actions and action object takes three properties.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.810
The first one is action and allows you to basically give this action an ID,

00:27.880 --> 00:30.690
you can pick whatever you want, it has to be a string

00:30.910 --> 00:37.240
and here I could name this confirm. Actions are the buttons displayed next to your notification and as

00:37.240 --> 00:40.400
before, you can't rely on the device showing these

00:40.450 --> 00:43.200
or maybe the device only supports two actions

00:43.210 --> 00:46.680
and if you specify three, the last one is cut off.

00:46.910 --> 00:48.960
These should never be core features,

00:49.030 --> 00:55.360
you can only rely on the user being able to tap on your main notification, actions might not be displayed

00:55.960 --> 01:02.110
but you can add some extra sugary to your notification by adding some actions but always be prepared

01:02.170 --> 01:03.880
that they might never get triggered,

01:03.940 --> 01:05.610
just want to highlight this.

01:05.920 --> 01:11.290
So we have an ID, the next is the title, that's the actual text which is displayed on the action,

01:11.290 --> 01:16.980
so on this action button. The title can also be anything you want, here I'll name this OK

01:17.020 --> 01:19.590
and again, this is what gets displayed.

01:19.660 --> 01:25.690
The last thing is an icon and this again might not be supported by all devices but some devices can show

01:25.700 --> 01:31.060
an icon. Now I'll take the camera icon here because it's the only one I have here, typically of course you might

01:31.060 --> 01:35.500
want to pick a checkmark here for confirm or whatever you need.

01:35.500 --> 01:42.700
Now I'll duplicate this to also have another action, I'll name this cancel and say cancel here too, use the

01:42.700 --> 01:44.970
same icon because it doesn't really matter

01:45.130 --> 01:48.550
and now I get two actions on this notification.

01:48.790 --> 01:52.110
Let's have a look at how this looks like on my Mac.

01:52.420 --> 02:00.160
If I go back to the application, to the application tab and clear my site data to start fresh, reload

02:00.160 --> 02:01.300
everything,

02:01.300 --> 02:09.160
let me now click enable notifications and now you see, on my other screen, here's the screenshot, that I have

02:09.430 --> 02:12.930
a notification with actions.

02:13.300 --> 02:18.690
Now I can click any of these actions and we can also listen to these clicks.

02:18.710 --> 02:21.350
Now that is what I'll cover in the next lecture.
