This is how we left our application at the end of last module. Now by the end of this module, it still

00:08.780 --> 00:12.820
looks the same but under the hood a lot changed. If I reload,

00:12.830 --> 00:20.270
now it works offline but even on a different page, we either get that fallback or if we've been on that page

00:20.270 --> 00:21.000
already

00:21.020 --> 00:23.830
like now, if I now go offline again,

00:24.140 --> 00:25.700
hey there it is.

00:25.700 --> 00:30.660
So what we added is dynamic caching and in general in this module,

00:30.740 --> 00:34.350
we'll have a look at loads of caching strategies you can use,

00:34.460 --> 00:37.280
of course will also implement them all.

00:37.460 --> 00:43.070
Therefore our service worker file continues to grow and you will learn how you can not just pre-cache

00:43.070 --> 00:48.680
some assets during installation and serve them when requested but you'll learn how you can dynamically

00:48.710 --> 00:54.980
add items to the cache as the user fetches them automatically when navigating around in your app and

00:54.980 --> 01:00.110
you will learn about different strategies of serving them when offline because there's more than one

01:00.110 --> 01:01.630
way of doing that.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.920
So let's dive into that and

01:02.940 --> 01:08.810
let's have a look at these advanced caching strategies and let's learn how we can dynamically add items

01:08.960 --> 01:09.720
to the cache.
