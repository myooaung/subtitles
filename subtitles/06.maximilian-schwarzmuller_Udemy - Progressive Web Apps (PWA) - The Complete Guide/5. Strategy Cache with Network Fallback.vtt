Now that you learned a lot about the basics of caching with service workers,

00:06.130 --> 00:09.470
let's dive into some of the strategies you can use.

00:09.580 --> 00:15.480
Now what we're using right now in our fetch event listener is cache with network fallback,

00:15.520 --> 00:20.290
so we first tried to access the cache and then if that fails or if we don't find the item in the cache,

00:20.530 --> 00:22.510
we fallback to the network,

00:22.510 --> 00:28.540
so it looks like that. Our page sends a request to the service worker or put in other words, the service

00:28.540 --> 00:34.380
worker intercepts any request the page sends and then the service worker has a look at the cache.

00:34.390 --> 00:39.390
Now if a resource is found, it is directly returned, if it is not found,

00:39.400 --> 00:41.040
we execute another step,

00:41.230 --> 00:46.480
we reach out to the network and the network then returns the response.

00:46.480 --> 00:53.050
Now what we also do is we step in with the service worker and put that response onto the cache again to

00:53.050 --> 00:58.500
have dynamic caching and make sure that for future requests, we can find the resource in the cache

00:58.720 --> 01:04.430
but even without that, this is what the strategy is called, cache and then network fallback.

01:04.450 --> 01:10.180
The good thing about this strategy is that we can instantly load assets if we have them in the cache, which

01:10.180 --> 01:13.860
is even good if we do have Internet access because it's very fast.

01:13.870 --> 01:19.420
The bad thing of course is this especially when used generically, that we parse everything like that

01:19.900 --> 01:25.080
and for some resources, especially resources which should be highly up-to-date,

01:25.270 --> 01:30.730
this is bad because we might return old versions which are still in the cache because we don't reach out

01:30.730 --> 01:37.130
to the network by default, only if an element is not in the cache. Before we come to a better solution

01:37.130 --> 01:37.840
to that,

01:38.210 --> 01:41.550
let's have a look at one other strategy we might use.
