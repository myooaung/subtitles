WEBVTT

00:02.660 --> 00:05.540
Now throughout this course, we're building a real project,

00:05.540 --> 00:09.530
you already saw the finished result earlier in this module.

00:09.950 --> 00:15.230
Now attached to this lecture, you'll find the starting setup of this project because we're not going

00:15.230 --> 00:18.240
to start with a blank file for the single reason

00:18.260 --> 00:20.220
that you watching me write

00:20.220 --> 00:23.700
HTML, CSS and Javascript code is pretty boring,

00:23.720 --> 00:27.090
there's nothing progressive web app-ish about that.

00:27.380 --> 00:33.950
So what we'll start with is a very simple boilerplate set up with a frame of an application without

00:33.980 --> 00:36.040
any logic, without any features in it,

00:36.140 --> 00:39.010
that's all going to get added by us.

00:39.050 --> 00:45.200
So if you downloaded and extracted that folder, open it in your favorite IDE or editor like, for me it's

00:45.200 --> 00:51.510
Web Storm, for you it could be Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Atom, whatever you like.

00:51.620 --> 00:56.810
Now in there, then open the command line, the terminal and navigate into that project folder,

00:56.840 --> 01:04.490
this here simply is a command line integrated into my IDE. In the extracted project folder, run npm install.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.150
Now for that to work, you need NodeJS

01:06.260 --> 01:10.400
installed which you probably have since you needed it earlier in the course.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.850
So make sure to go to nodejs.org

01:11.860 --> 01:15.700
to download the latest version of NodeJS, here

01:15.740 --> 01:20.010
we only need it for its package manager which will install all the dependencies

01:20.080 --> 01:21.490
of this project.

01:21.530 --> 01:23.600
Now if we hit enter, it will do that,

01:23.600 --> 01:27.840
the dependencies of this project is really only one dependency,

01:27.860 --> 01:34.850
this HTTP server here. Now this HTTP server is required to have a development server running on our local

01:34.850 --> 01:37.400
machine hosting our web application.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.170
To be precise, it will host everything inside the public folder.

01:41.510 --> 01:46.150
Now why do we need that and don't just double-click onto our HTML files there?

01:46.370 --> 01:49.400
Because if we double-click, we use the file protocol

01:49.460 --> 01:51.660
and with that, we can't build a progressive web app,

01:51.680 --> 01:58.040
a lot of HTTP features are missing because it's not using HTTP and therefore we can't simulate a real

01:58.040 --> 02:00.810
web app as it would be served over the wire,

02:00.950 --> 02:02.980
so that is why we need a development server.

02:03.300 --> 02:08.960
Now the installation finished and with npm start, we can start this server and again, it will now serve the

02:08.960 --> 02:13.880
public folder. In there you see we have an index.html file, so this is what gets loaded

02:13.880 --> 02:17.640
first. You can always end the server with control-c

02:17.870 --> 02:19.790
but you should not do that

02:19.820 --> 02:24.360
if you want to keep on developing. If you're done, shut it down

02:24.390 --> 02:27.050
and if you start again, restart the server.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.680
Now with that, you can open localhost:8080 in Chrome.

02:30.710 --> 02:35.410
Now theoretically you can use any browser you want but I strongly recommend using Chrome,

02:35.420 --> 02:39.960
it supports all the features you are learning in this course, so you can see everything we build

02:40.130 --> 02:44.060
and of course we will build this app in a way that also works in older browsers

02:44.060 --> 02:46.410
but seeing the features isn't too bad, right?

02:46.820 --> 02:49.700
Additionally, Chrome has awesome developer tools.

02:49.730 --> 02:56.990
If you open them, you can either use the shortcut which is command-alt-i or control-alt-i or you

02:56.990 --> 02:59.660
simply go to these three dots here and there

02:59.650 --> 03:03.440
to more tools, developer tools.

03:03.440 --> 03:08.610
So if you open them, you have all the developer tools you might already know,

03:08.660 --> 03:13.680
the most important part for us later in this course will become the application tab,

03:13.850 --> 03:19.820
the audit's tab is what you already saw with lighthouse and you can also have a look at the console

03:19.820 --> 03:21.560
to see any errors.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.530
Now one important thing can be found under the network tab, there

03:25.550 --> 03:28.930
make sure that you do disable caching,

03:28.940 --> 03:34.400
this will only work if the developer tools are open but then it will make sure that the default browser

03:34.400 --> 03:36.300
cache isn't getting used

03:36.590 --> 03:42.710
and I want to disable this just to prove to you that we indeed are using the service worker for all

03:42.710 --> 03:47.660
the caching things we'll do later in the course. It will make sure that everything works correctly and

03:47.660 --> 03:54.110
you are not waiting for the browser cache to update and reflect your latest changes or stuff like that.

03:54.110 --> 03:57.430
Additionally, you might want to try out this toggle device

03:57.500 --> 04:01.450
toolbar button which allows you to preview your application

04:01.550 --> 04:06.920
basically as if it were to run on a real device, it's mainly just doing the styling,

04:06.920 --> 04:12.380
it's not really emulating a real device but it allows you to switch between different devices and see

04:12.380 --> 04:14.680
how it would look on them.

04:15.140 --> 04:19.490
Now with that, let's focus on the application we're starting with.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.830
As I said, I gave you a basic frame here and that really is what it is,

04:23.840 --> 04:29.420
we have a side menu with a help page we can load and the main feed page here, we can click this plus to

04:29.450 --> 04:33.230
open this modal here but we can't do anything in this app yet,

04:33.260 --> 04:36.650
clicking anything else but this plus won't do anything useful.

04:36.740 --> 04:42.410
Now we're starting off with this nice already responsive styling due to a package we're using. In the

04:42.410 --> 04:47.670
index.html file, you can see the import to the material-design-lite package from a CDN.

04:47.750 --> 04:53.330
This is basically like bootstrap, just using the material designed by Google and I'm using this so that

04:53.360 --> 04:58.250
we have a lot of nice styling to start with and don't have to write everything about this app from scratch

04:58.520 --> 05:04.910
because of course this course is about progressive web app features and not writing plain old boring HTML,

05:04.930 --> 05:11.500
Javascript and CSS, there are other courses for these fundamentals. In the index.html file,

05:11.890 --> 05:14.350
you can see that we have a very traditional set up,

05:14.380 --> 05:16.230
there's quite some markup in there,

05:16.270 --> 05:20.150
most of that is really just responsible for the navigation

05:20.440 --> 05:23.970
and generally, this gives you the frame I was talking about.

05:24.140 --> 05:29.950
Now that being said, no logic lives in this app. If you inspect the other files in the source folder, you will

05:29.950 --> 05:32.980
see that the Javascript files are pretty empty,

05:33.010 --> 05:37.990
this file just handles the plus button on the starting page

05:37.990 --> 05:42.850
and of course we will add all the logic together, you will see the same in the CSS files,

05:42.850 --> 05:45.450
just some very basic styling, nothing fancy.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.590
The images, especially the icons will become important later in the course.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.170
Finally in the help folder, you have the index.html file which renders this help page.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.190
So just some dummy code to start with.

05:57.220 --> 06:00.510
With that I'd say let's dive into the next lectures,

06:00.550 --> 06:05.190
so that we can soon start adding some cool features and logic to this application.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.770
Can't wait to do that together with you.
