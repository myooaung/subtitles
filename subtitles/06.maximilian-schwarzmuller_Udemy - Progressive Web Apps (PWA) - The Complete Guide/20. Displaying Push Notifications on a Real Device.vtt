00:01.980 --> 00:08.020
So I'm on my device here and since I haven't set up a notification here, a subscription, I'll quickly clear

00:08.050 --> 00:11.240
all the site data here to start fresh,

00:12.230 --> 00:13.820
reload the page one more time,

00:13.880 --> 00:16.190
so I should have an active service worker here,

00:16.220 --> 00:18.340
we can see that it was activated,

00:18.590 --> 00:23.010
you'll see I'm of course fetching all my data here already.

00:23.060 --> 00:29.880
Now I will first of all turn on notifications to create a new subscription on this device too, allow notifications

00:30.230 --> 00:37.010
and we should see if we quickly switch to Firebase, that under subscriptions, we got a second subscription.

00:37.010 --> 00:41.900
This actually targets a different endpoint, the same starting URL but a different ID here at

00:41.900 --> 00:44.370
the end because it has its own endpoint,

00:44.390 --> 00:45.870
it's a different subscription.

00:46.010 --> 00:53.030
Now back on the debugging screen of that device, let's start pushing messages and you do see my device

00:53.030 --> 00:54.670
screen here,

00:54.710 --> 00:56.230
now let's keep it open.

00:57.050 --> 01:02.930
On the left, you can now see my screen on my Mac Chrome application and on the right over the

01:02.930 --> 01:06.570
console, you'll see what I'm forming on my device.

01:06.690 --> 01:10.060
Now I'll quickly create a new notification,

01:10.260 --> 01:15.070
actually the same text as before, just also with a two, on my Mac application

01:15.390 --> 01:21.400
and we should see a message appearing on the mobile device, even though it's a completely different device

01:21.420 --> 01:23.590
and keep in mind, it's a real device.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.090
And indeed it vibrated

01:26.250 --> 01:35.020
and if we open it, we see new posts added here too and there, you also see new post added as a text. So this appeared

01:35.110 --> 01:39.970
on my mobile device even though I didn't create it there because we obviously had the subscription here

01:40.000 --> 01:41.130
too

01:41.270 --> 01:44.110
and of course we also got the notification here on the screen.

01:45.140 --> 01:47.920
So with that, let me quickly clear all of that

01:48.230 --> 01:51.020
and now you saw this in action,

01:51.080 --> 01:58.430
let's now see how we can interact with this notification to maybe open a URL and how we can even send

01:58.430 --> 02:01.800
the page we want to open from the server to the web app.
