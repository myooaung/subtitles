00:02.180 --> 00:09.200
So in our starting project, we want to add a web app manifest and to do that, I opened the project in

00:09.200 --> 00:17.420
Web Storm, the IDE I'm using. Now you can use any editor or IDE you want, such as Visual Studio Code or Atom

00:17.540 --> 00:24.560
or Sublime Text or whatever you like. Simply open that project, this whole folder you downloaded and

00:24.560 --> 00:25.890
extracted in it

00:26.180 --> 00:30.820
and then there, we have the various files, the index.html file in the public folder

00:30.920 --> 00:36.260
and the index.html file in the help folder or in the public folder. Also some source files which we'll dive

00:36.260 --> 00:37.280
into later,

00:37.310 --> 00:40.370
we don't need them for now or to be precise,

00:40.460 --> 00:45.110
some of them are already getting imported in that index.html file.

00:45.110 --> 00:49.910
Now here, we got that simple code which basically generates the page you're viewing,

00:50.030 --> 00:57.110
we're using the material lite library to get beautiful stylings and materially styled components

00:57.200 --> 00:58.470
out of the box.

00:58.490 --> 01:03.100
We wanted to add a web manifest though and a web manifest simply is a file

01:03.110 --> 01:06.450
we add to our root web folder,

01:06.460 --> 01:12.650
so in this case the public folder, the folder containing our index.html file. In there, we simply add

01:12.650 --> 01:19.250
a new file and you have to name this file manifest, one word .json,

01:19.250 --> 01:22.050
so it's a JSON formatted file.

01:22.280 --> 01:30.680
Now as such a file, it starts and ends with curly braces and in-between, we add some properties to

01:30.680 --> 01:33.610
give this file some configuration.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.320
Now I'll come back to the properties in the next lecture,

01:36.320 --> 01:41.340
for now let's make sure that this file gets used in our application. To use it,

01:41.390 --> 01:47.840
we have to go to all pages in our app, so the index.html files in the root folder and in the help

01:47.840 --> 01:51.880
folder, I'll start in the index.html file on the public folder

01:52.250 --> 01:55.590
and there in the head section here,

01:55.610 --> 02:01.250
we have to add a new link and I will add it here at the bottom right at the end of head.

02:01.250 --> 02:09.500
So a new link, however not linking to a stylesheet but instead here, we describe this to be a manifest

02:10.220 --> 02:18.470
and we'll link with the ref attribute to /manifest.json, slash because we refer to the root

02:18.470 --> 02:19.010
folder,

02:19.040 --> 02:20.460
the public folder in this case,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.360
so the root folder where our API is served from

02:23.480 --> 02:26.690
and then there we point to the manifest.json file

02:26.690 --> 02:31.940
and since it directly sits in the root folder, it's just /manifest.json.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.080
Now I'll copy that

02:33.080 --> 02:38.930
and add the same in the index.html file in the help folder here because there, we of course

02:39.020 --> 02:43.470
also want to include the manifest.json because and that's an important take away,

02:43.550 --> 02:48.890
you should add your web app manifest to any page you have in your application.

02:49.010 --> 02:53.550
So if you have a single page application which we don't have here, that's good for you,

02:53.570 --> 02:59.210
you only need to add it to one file but if you have a multi-page application or any application where

02:59.210 --> 03:05.210
you render your views on the server and you have multiple possible views, you need to add that file to

03:05.300 --> 03:10.150
every view, every page you send back from your server.

03:10.160 --> 03:15.740
Why do you need to do that? Because you want to ensure that the browser is able to load that manifest

03:15.740 --> 03:19.950
with your additional configuration, no matter which URL you visit

03:20.060 --> 03:25.910
and obviously if for example a user enters a blog article on your page because he found it on Google,

03:26.120 --> 03:32.480
you want to make sure you still provide that native web app or this progressive web app feeling to him.

03:32.750 --> 03:38.460
So with that, we added the manifest.json file, what can we add inside of it now?
