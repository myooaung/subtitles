00:02.300 --> 00:07.430
So in the last lecture, we worked on our server side code to make sure we can handle incoming form data

00:07.430 --> 00:09.010
with files.

00:09.020 --> 00:16.520
Now we want to test it and to test it, we'll of course use our application, reload it,

00:16.580 --> 00:22.420
we changed the service worker so now we should install the new service worker, open tab to activate it

00:23.440 --> 00:28.160
and now with that, we can actually open this,

00:28.360 --> 00:30.840
take a nice image,

00:31.140 --> 00:32.590
that's not a nice image,

00:32.610 --> 00:34.120
we'll still send it

00:34.530 --> 00:37.800
and we already get an error here

00:37.830 --> 00:43.480
before I try to send it, that dataURItoBlob is not defined.

00:43.860 --> 00:50.670
That's a super hard to find and fix error because it's very hard to figure out what's wrong here.

00:50.670 --> 00:52.370
Do you have any idea?

00:52.390 --> 00:59.720
Hint, have a look at the service worker and the files we pre-cache.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.470
Now let me show you what's wrong.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.660
We clearly added this method to utility.js,

01:05.720 --> 01:09.030
still somehow our code doesn't find it.

01:09.050 --> 01:13.770
The issue is that in the service worker, we never pre-cache the utility file.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.340
We dynamically cache it though,

01:16.370 --> 01:21.980
so if we visit a page at least once, we add it to the dynamic cache which is why we didn't have any issues

01:21.980 --> 01:27.110
in the past. We still should add it to our pre-cache here,

01:27.170 --> 01:35.090
so I'll add utility.js here. Now we change that file and I'll bump up the static version, though not strictly

01:35.090 --> 01:37.540
required since we already change the file.

01:37.790 --> 01:44.010
I'll reload the file and/or the page and open a new tab to activate a new service worker.

01:44.210 --> 01:51.160
If I now try this again, I can't look good on these images. Anyways

01:51.680 --> 01:55.100
I again get this dataURItoBlob is not defined,

01:55.280 --> 01:58.020
even though we're now pre-caching the file.

01:58.130 --> 02:00.730
The issue as I said is hard to find.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.310
We do have that file in two caches now, the static one, we successfully pre-cache it,

02:06.410 --> 02:07.720
here it is

02:08.120 --> 02:09.770
but also still in that dynamic

02:09.770 --> 02:12.340
one from before, here it is

02:12.680 --> 02:18.500
and turns out it fetches this one which of course is not the updated version because we never changed

02:18.530 --> 02:21.680
our dynamic version number because we didn't need to in the past,

02:21.860 --> 02:27.840
well now we need to. So let me bump this up so that this gets cleared, that we start new.

02:28.040 --> 02:33.770
So I'll refresh this to install the new service worker and I'll activate it now so that the old

02:33.770 --> 02:35.580
cache gets cleaned up.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.800
We see in the console,

02:36.890 --> 02:40.040
the old dynamic cache was removed.

02:40.040 --> 02:47.880
Now we also have issues getting this sf-boat because we don't have it in our dynamic cache now.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.450
Now we don't get this sf-boat anymore

02:50.690 --> 02:53.500
and if we reload, we get these errors.

02:53.570 --> 02:59.600
The reason for that is simple, we can't get them from the web anymore because I deleted that file on Firebase

03:00.230 --> 03:03.380
and it was the file we had on our old posts.

03:03.380 --> 03:09.110
So what I'll do is quickly get rid of all old posts because we'll start adding posts with images soon.

03:09.560 --> 03:14.170
So now we get rid of the error because we'll have no more posts with that image anymore.

03:14.420 --> 03:18.410
So now, let's go there and now try to take a good picture,

03:20.210 --> 03:20.740
yes

03:20.840 --> 03:22.180
better at least

03:22.510 --> 03:25.610
and let's now test that upload from Munich.

03:25.890 --> 03:28.920
So let's hit post here to upload it

03:28.920 --> 03:29.610
and this looks good,

03:29.610 --> 03:37.350
I get my push notification and if we now open Firebase and go to the database, we see our new post here, from

03:37.350 --> 03:45.380
Munich, test upload. We see a URL here and under storage, we also see the file here,

03:45.820 --> 03:51.380
here. Now if I reload the page, we also see our posts here.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.830
So this is now working

03:52.890 --> 03:56.680
and you could change the image positioning simply with CSS styles.

03:56.730 --> 03:57.730
That's awesome,

03:57.900 --> 04:05.700
now we indeed can upload our own images to Firebase, to any back-end actually, we're just sending a normal

04:05.790 --> 04:07.530
HTTP request in the end, right,

04:07.530 --> 04:09.230
that's all we do in the service worker,

04:09.390 --> 04:17.790
just sending a fetch request here with some post data and we're handling it, in this case on our example back-end

04:17.790 --> 04:18.920
using Firebase,

04:18.930 --> 04:22.620
of course you could use any back-end, can't stress this enough.

04:22.770 --> 04:25.670
The real king here is the camera though

04:25.710 --> 04:31.920
and you who probably also got a working camera in your application too. Now that we see each other,

04:31.990 --> 04:37.980
I can announce that the next thing we'll take care about is this geolocation feature here, so that

04:37.980 --> 04:40.660
we can actually get our real location.

04:40.710 --> 04:44.120
We'll do this in the next lectures, before we do that,

04:44.130 --> 04:47.390
here's one other thing we must not forget though.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.220
Let's dive into that first.
