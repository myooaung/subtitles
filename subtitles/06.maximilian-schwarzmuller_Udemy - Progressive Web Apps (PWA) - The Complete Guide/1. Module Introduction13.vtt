In this court module, we'll have a look at responsive design

00:06.090 --> 00:07.550
and here's something important

00:07.620 --> 00:13.210
I mentioned earlier and I will mention again. This is not a deep dive into responsive design,

00:13.350 --> 00:19.380
you can create a full course about this topic and there is a good reason why this is possible because

00:19.380 --> 00:23.690
it's a huge topic and there are many things you can tweak and you could optimize.

00:23.700 --> 00:29.210
I strongly encourage you to dive into such a course because I don't want to squeeze one in this course,

00:29.490 --> 00:32.130
this course is about progressive web apps in general

00:32.250 --> 00:39.250
and I want to focus on all the technologies which are the meat of the progressive web app, which drive

00:39.250 --> 00:42.950
it like service workers, push notifications and so on.

00:43.230 --> 00:49.500
In this module, I'll refresh some of the core basics about responsive design to make sure you have

00:49.500 --> 00:56.550
an idea of what it means and to have some points to start thinking about when it comes to optimizing your

00:56.550 --> 01:02.760
web application because obviously, we want to make sure that it doesn't just work good on mobile devices,

01:02.760 --> 01:09.540
it should also look good and load fast. Therefore responsive design is important, in this module you'll

01:09.540 --> 01:11.110
get a brief refresher.

01:11.130 --> 01:16.620
Definitely spend some time in dedicated courses to make sure you get the most out of responsive design.
