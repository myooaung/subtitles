It's obviously nice that we can run our application on Chrome for Android but our users are typically

00:09.810 --> 00:16.560
coming from other operating systems and browsers too, both on the desktop as well as on mobile devices.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.650
So we can't rely on them using Chrome

00:19.800 --> 00:23.100
and we also can't rely on them using Android.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.460
Now I mentioned the browser support and I showed you that only Chrome and Opera are supporting the

00:29.460 --> 00:36.420
manifest at the point of time I'm recording this, though support is coming to Microsoft Edge and Firefox,

00:36.480 --> 00:40.320
so we will see a lot of browsers supporting this very soon.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.620
Safari however doesn't support it

00:42.660 --> 00:50.040
and that of course is a disadvantage because whilst Android and Chrome have a huge market share, Safari

00:50.100 --> 00:53.550
on iOS also is quite important.

00:53.550 --> 01:00.140
Now the good thing is whilst this browser doesn't support the manifest.json file, it also won't fail,

01:00.210 --> 01:06.600
it will simply ignore it and we can add some other properties to the index.html file to get at

01:06.600 --> 01:09.310
least a comparable feeling there.

01:09.540 --> 01:17.690
We can add a couple of meta tags here to make sure that our application also looks nice on iOS and

01:17.690 --> 01:21.320
Safari and this is what I want to show you now.

01:21.360 --> 01:28.590
So besides the manifest, in this index.html file I will add a couple of other entries in this head section

01:28.590 --> 01:35.350
here to make sure our application looks and feels nice on Safari and iOS too.

01:35.730 --> 01:45.660
So the first one is a meta tag here and it has a name attribute where the value will be 

01:46.470 --> 01:56.630
apple-mobile-web-app-capable and I'll set content to yes.

01:56.670 --> 02:00.510
So this looks cryptic but in the end, this will be understood by webkit,

02:00.570 --> 02:06.260
so by the Safari browser, it will see this meta tag and it'll recognize this key,

02:06.270 --> 02:08.310
so make sure to not mistype it,

02:08.340 --> 02:13.760
apple-mobile-web-app-capable is the correct key and then it will read the value here

02:13.770 --> 02:21.090
and if the value is yes, it knows that we want to treat this as a mobile web app which also allows us

02:21.090 --> 02:25.680
to add it the home screen, get our icon there and launch it from the home screen.

02:25.710 --> 02:30.390
So we basically have this manifest replacement here,

02:30.420 --> 02:34.410
so for Chrome, it detects the manifest and knows what we want to do, here

02:34.440 --> 02:38.410
we explicitly tell Safari by adding this meta tag.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.240
Of course we need to add more information though,

02:41.340 --> 02:51.890
for example we also want to add another meta tag with the name of apple-mobile-web-app,

02:51.930 --> 02:57.720
so you see the pattern, this is basically for all identifiers related to this web app like feature

02:58.030 --> 03:05.160
here set status-bar-style, all separated with dash to a certain content,

03:05.160 --> 03:12.480
for example, we could set the style here to black and this controls how the status bar will display on

03:12.480 --> 03:14.190
these devices.

03:14.190 --> 03:26.210
This is also great if we use another nice meta tag here, name is apple-mobile-web-app-title which allows

03:26.220 --> 03:32.130
to set a title, by default it would infer it from the title tags here which would actually be nice for

03:32.130 --> 03:33.620
this application already

03:33.690 --> 03:39.830
but if you have a deviating title, you can specify it here under content. I'll set pwagram

03:39.870 --> 03:42.330
and therefore I could just use the default title

03:42.330 --> 03:48.420
but again you could specify any deviating title here and Apple or iOS would use that below your

03:48.440 --> 03:50.150
icon and so on.

03:50.160 --> 03:55.030
We also want to let Apple know or iOS know which icon to use,

03:55.050 --> 03:57.580
we do this with a link. Here

03:57.660 --> 04:06.210
we have a link of type Apple touch icon and Apple or iOS will again understand this and then load this

04:06.240 --> 04:14.900
icon here for the app and this is /src/images/icons/app-icons-144x144.png,

04:15.210 --> 04:18.880
so

04:18.990 --> 04:26.310
basically this icon here. Now as you can see, we got loads of icons here though and also, we get some special

04:26.480 --> 04:31.560
Apple icons. So whilst I could point to this icon to have some basic support,

04:31.710 --> 04:38.430
I can also load the Apple optimized icon here by simply changing name to Apple

04:38.460 --> 04:44.700
icon, now I'm referring to this and I can also add a sizes property and be clear about the size of this

04:44.700 --> 04:45.210
icon,

04:45.240 --> 04:47.320
so that just as with the manifest 

04:47.320 --> 04:49.810
where we also add multiple icons,

04:49.850 --> 04:52.560
the iOS browser is also able to load

04:52.560 --> 04:56.660
the best icon for a given device and screen resolution,

04:56.910 --> 05:03.780
so now we can simply add a lot of icons here for the different sizes I have. Now I don't want to bore

05:03.780 --> 05:05.230
you so I will skip ahead,

05:05.400 --> 05:11.370
of course feel free to copy and paste this from the final source code you can find at the end of this

05:11.370 --> 05:12.130
module.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.700
So with that, I added all these special Apple icons which are just normal pngs optimized for Apple

05:17.940 --> 05:25.110
and I made Apple aware of it as well as with these three meta tags here which allow Safari to load this, at least

05:25.170 --> 05:29.660
a bit close to a progressive web app like supported in Chrome.

05:29.910 --> 05:34.940
You won't have the same amount of support, obviously since a couple of properties we have in the manifest.json

05:34.940 --> 05:36.700
file are missing here

05:36.840 --> 05:42.000
but at least we are close to it or have some basic support.

05:42.180 --> 05:48.510
Now this is how we can get a better experience on iOS and with Safari.
