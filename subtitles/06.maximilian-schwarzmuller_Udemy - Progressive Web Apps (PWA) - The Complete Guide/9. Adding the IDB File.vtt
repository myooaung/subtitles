You can use indexedDB just like that,

00:04.470 --> 00:09.360
it's a normal browser feature and therefore you can access it directly in Javascript.

00:09.360 --> 00:16.340
The normal indexedDB API is a bit clunky though and it also uses a lot of callbacks.

00:16.350 --> 00:21.720
Now since we already live in promise land here and we especially maybe want to stick to that in service

00:21.720 --> 00:27.040
workers, it's better if we use a special package wrapping indexedDB,

00:27.060 --> 00:32.730
this is purely optional and the general way you use indexedDB won't change but it gives us a nicer

00:32.730 --> 00:33.770
way of using it,

00:33.900 --> 00:35.670
that's why I recommend using it.

00:35.730 --> 00:42.210
The package I'm talking about is IDB by jakearchibald, which by the way has an awesome offline cookbook

00:42.210 --> 00:44.610
with a lot of service worker recipes and so on,

00:44.610 --> 00:50.400
so definitely someone who is deeply into service worker, progressive web apps and offline development.

00:50.910 --> 00:55.330
This package simply wraps indexedDB and allows you to use promises

00:55.590 --> 00:59.720
and on this page to which you of course can find a link at the end of this module,

00:59.820 --> 01:03.300
you'll find a detailed documentation of that package.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.750
Now of course, I'll also show you how to use it in this course.

01:06.870 --> 01:13.380
So let's go back to our project and to use it, we need to basically import it. Now attached to this lecture,

01:13.410 --> 01:20.370
you'll find a file, idb.js which you can simply drop into your js folder and this is the

01:20.370 --> 01:26.670
package by jakearchibald, this IDB package basically providing that wrapper.

01:26.670 --> 01:31.670
So this is the package I want to use to be able to use that wrapper and to use it,

01:31.680 --> 01:35.550
we of course have to import it, both in the service worker,

01:35.550 --> 01:37.480
I will show you how that works later

01:37.560 --> 01:39.520
and of course in our front-end code

01:39.690 --> 01:41.750
and that's where I'll start for now.

01:42.040 --> 01:49.650
So here in the index.html file, I'll simply add a new import at the bottom, below the promised polyfill

01:49.680 --> 01:55.040
which of course gets used by IDB but above the app.js if we plan on using it in there,

01:55.170 --> 02:01.770
so maybe after fetch, here I'll import the idb.js file. And the same in the help page if you plan

02:01.770 --> 02:03.800
on using some IDB features there too

02:03.990 --> 02:07.020
but I'll put my IDB related code in the feed.js,

02:07.080 --> 02:11.430
so for me importing it in the main index.html file is all I need.

02:11.460 --> 02:16.320
We also want to use it in the service worker though because that is where I'll actually start using

02:16.320 --> 02:21.300
it because before I can show you how we fetch data from the database, I need to show you how we can store

02:21.300 --> 02:22.060
data in it

02:22.110 --> 02:23.910
otherwise fetching is kind of hard.

02:24.180 --> 02:29.320
So in the next lecture, we'll add IDB to the service worker and start using it there.
