00:02.640 --> 00:08.400
In this module, we had a look at background synchronization, a super important feature since it allows

00:08.400 --> 00:15.630
us to enhance our applications such that we can even send requests, send data if we are offline. Prior

00:15.630 --> 00:16.600
to this module,

00:16.620 --> 00:17.870
we could only read it,

00:17.910 --> 00:19.560
now everything is possible

00:19.680 --> 00:23.660
and this of course unlocks many possibilities in your next project too.

00:23.900 --> 00:30.780
You can make sure that you store data and send it once connectivity is back, to provide the best possible

00:30.780 --> 00:32.220
user experience.

00:32.220 --> 00:40.020
Keep in mind on Chrome for Android for example, this even works if your browser is closed because a background

00:40.020 --> 00:44.350
process keeps on running and will make sure that the data gets synchronized.

00:44.550 --> 00:45.780
That's just amazing,

00:45.780 --> 00:47.280
so definitely use it.
