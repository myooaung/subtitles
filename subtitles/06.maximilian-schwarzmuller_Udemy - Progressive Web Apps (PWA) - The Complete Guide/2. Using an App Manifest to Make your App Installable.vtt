So as already mentioned in the teaser video, this module is all about the web app manifest which in the end is

00:09.020 --> 00:15.070
just one single file we add to our web application and which we specify on our web pages to

00:15.070 --> 00:19.570
be loaded via the browser which makes our web app installable,

00:19.590 --> 00:26.440
which means we can add it to the home screen of our mobile device and there, it will feel and look

00:26.440 --> 00:32.110
like a native app, so we can open it like we open any native app.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.080
And why would we want to do that?

00:34.420 --> 00:40.180
Well if users just visit our web page like this, they might enjoy it but they constantly have to type

00:40.180 --> 00:43.630
the URL or manage the bookmark.

00:43.630 --> 00:51.430
Now with a home screen icon which we can get via the app manifest, we increase user interaction

00:51.430 --> 00:52.990
with our application

00:53.110 --> 00:59.930
because if you think about your own behavior, how do you use your smartphone?

00:59.980 --> 01:07.570
You probably visit the same apps a lot and you typically visit them by simply tapping on these icons on

01:07.570 --> 01:08.530
the home screen.

01:08.710 --> 01:16.390
Hence if we get on the home screen with our application, if we could get our web app on that home screen,

01:16.780 --> 01:19.850
we would probably drive user engagement

01:20.080 --> 01:22.140
and that can only be good for us.

01:22.210 --> 01:28.450
This is why we want to get there and this is exactly what the web app manifest, this file we can add,

01:28.870 --> 01:30.220
allows us to do.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.200
So let's jump into a web application and create such a manifest.
