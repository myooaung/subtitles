WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:05.510
So we learned about the app manifest properties,

00:05.530 --> 00:09.550
let's now add them to our manifest.json file, so that we can actually see it

00:09.560 --> 00:17.170
in action. I will start with the name and since this is a JSON file, every property has to go between double

00:17.170 --> 00:18.460
quotation marks,

00:18.460 --> 00:23.560
so "name" is the first property I want to configure here,

00:23.560 --> 00:26.860
the value also goes between double quotation marks.

00:26.950 --> 00:34.560
I will name it Instagram as progressive web app since we kind of build an Instagram clone here, a

00:34.570 --> 00:36.460
very simple version of that.

00:36.490 --> 00:43.360
Now that's a rather long name, so let's also add the short underscore name property where I will simply

00:43.360 --> 00:46.000
name this pwagram,

00:46.180 --> 00:54.040
so basically the short version which will be displayed below the app icon for example. Speaking of

00:54.040 --> 00:58.000
that, before I configure anything else about this application,

00:58.060 --> 01:01.790
I want to add an icon so that we can see something.

01:02.140 --> 01:07.350
So let's add the icons property, also between double quotation marks

01:07.480 --> 01:14.590
and next let's add the value which is an array, not between double quotation marks. Here we specify multiple

01:14.650 --> 01:22.660
objects with curly braces, also not between double quotation marks which configure the various icons we use.

01:22.660 --> 01:27.510
Each icon consists of three properties at least, the first property is the source,

01:27.520 --> 01:35.010
so basically pointing to the pathway to find this icon. Now if we expand source here, under images, you'll find

01:35.010 --> 01:38.090
an icons folder which holds, well a lot

01:38.110 --> 01:39.690
icons actually.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.920
Now I'll come back to what these apple icons here do,

01:43.030 --> 01:46.210
the app icons are the ones I want to use for now,

01:46.510 --> 01:54.850
so let's start with the smallest one, the 48x48 icon. So the source simply is slash to refer to our

01:54.850 --> 02:01.810
root folder which is public, since that is where our API is served from, then source,

02:01.810 --> 02:04.490
so now we're inside this folder here.

02:04.600 --> 02:12.100
Next you want to go into images, so let's add images here and let's add icons thereafter to access the

02:12.160 --> 02:19.090
icons folder and then let's simply pick the icon we want to refer to, in this case app-icon-48x48.png,

02:19.330 --> 02:22.520
so

02:22.570 --> 02:30.970
this icon here. That's the path to the icon, we also need to give the browser a little bit more information,

02:31.720 --> 02:38.820
for example the type, the type here is image/png.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.780
Now this is the type we want to use,

02:41.990 --> 02:47.870
we also need to give it information about the size because whilst it is encoded in the file name, we could

02:47.870 --> 02:49.670
give this icon any file name,

02:49.760 --> 02:51.980
so that is isn't enough for the browser,

02:52.130 --> 02:55.650
instead let's add a sizes property here

02:55.820 --> 03:05.480
and let's be very clear about the size. The size is always identified as an X by X ratios of 48x48 in

03:05.480 --> 03:06.440
this case,

03:06.440 --> 03:10.800
so always the width times the height.

03:10.910 --> 03:15.370
So this is the information we need to give it about the first icon.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.290
Of course there are more icons,

03:17.780 --> 03:22.330
so let's add the next icon, 96x96.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.830
I simply have to change the names here and the same should be true for you since you downloaded my project,

03:27.830 --> 03:36.850
so you already have all these icons and we will do this all the way up to this app icon 512 to 512.

03:37.040 --> 03:43.410
So I will quickly do this and exchange the number every time I add a new icon here,

03:43.430 --> 03:46.460
so the next one for me is 144

03:46.700 --> 03:52.490
and feel free to skip ahead to the end of this part here because it might not be that interesting since

03:52.490 --> 03:57.950
you need to add all these icons, still want to give you a chance to follow along smoothly though.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.720
So we're approaching the end here,

04:01.650 --> 04:03.570
we're at 256

04:03.570 --> 04:05.370
icon already,

04:05.520 --> 04:07.250
now let's add two more,

04:07.260 --> 04:09.170
the next one is the

04:09.620 --> 04:12.280
348x348

04:12.300 --> 04:18.510
icon here, excuse me 384

04:18.560 --> 04:24.300
and finally the last icon I want to add is the 512x512

04:24.320 --> 04:26.900
icon for very big devices.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.020
These are all the icons added

04:29.150 --> 04:33.250
and with that, the browser should be able to load our app correctly.

04:33.590 --> 04:38.570
Now with that added, let's go after these square brackets, so often the icons array

04:38.590 --> 04:44.780
and let's start adding more properties because besides the icon, we also can specify a start

04:44.800 --> 04:51.350
URL, remember that is the property which defines which page should be loaded when we launch our

04:51.350 --> 04:54.030
app from this home screen icon. Here

04:54.050 --> 05:00.930
I want to load /index.html referring to the index.html file in our main directory.

05:01.970 --> 05:07.100
Besides that, I also want to set up a scope, so which pages should be part of the progressive web app

05:07.430 --> 05:13.790
and here I will specify a dot which basically means all the files in the public folder are part of my

05:13.850 --> 05:21.890
progressive web app. Next I'll add display and display for me here is standalone,

05:21.960 --> 05:24.550
however there are other options too,

05:24.750 --> 05:33.540
you could also specify full screen which basically means that it will cover up the whole screen and

05:33.540 --> 05:39.610
whilst standalone still would have a toolbar and basically behave like a standalone app,

05:39.700 --> 05:45.180
fullscreen is like the fullscreen native apps you know where you don't see any controls at all.

05:45.240 --> 05:49.830
Not typically the choice you take for web applications but you could do that.

05:50.190 --> 05:53.530
You can also choose minimal UI,

05:53.580 --> 06:00.390
this will also feel like a standalone application but with a reduced amount of UI elements and you can

06:00.660 --> 06:05.260
also choose browser which will open it like a normal web page in the browser.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.450
Now that's not very native application-like,

06:08.580 --> 06:12.970
so I will use standalone which is the common choice you take here.

06:13.890 --> 06:19.830
We can next also set the orientation of our application,

06:19.830 --> 06:31.190
now orientation can be any or portrait or landscape. Now any obviously allows the user to switch whilst

06:31.230 --> 06:35.570
portrait and landscape limit it to a certain orientation.

06:35.940 --> 06:43.500
If you specify portrait primary, you also make sure that it doesn't switch if the user rotates the device

06:43.500 --> 06:46.900
by 180 degrees which still is portrait

06:46.920 --> 06:49.450
but obviously upside down.

06:49.590 --> 06:52.450
Well not on your web app but the device.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.250
So portrait primary makes sure that it only is portrait if the basically home button

06:57.350 --> 06:59.570
is at the bottom of the device

06:59.580 --> 07:02.660
and again, any and landscape are the alternatives.

07:02.660 --> 07:07.510
Now I will set it to portrait primary for this app here,

07:07.590 --> 07:12.090
however be aware that in other apps you might not want to limit this,

07:12.090 --> 07:15.900
maybe you want to give the user the freedom to rotate it,

07:15.960 --> 07:18.660
so definitely set this with care.

07:18.660 --> 07:24.090
Again I will go with portrait primary here but depending on the app you're building, you might want to

07:24.090 --> 07:29.920
set this to landscape or to any maybe. Now that's it for the orientation,

07:29.940 --> 07:32.970
we also can change the colors,

07:33.060 --> 07:39.600
I did mentioned this in the previous video. For example we have the background color here, the background

07:39.600 --> 07:45.120
color allows us to define the color which is used in the background whilst our page is building up or

07:45.210 --> 07:46.490
on the splash screen,

07:46.500 --> 07:51.200
so this loading screen whilst the whole application is still loading. Here

07:51.300 --> 07:57.990
I will choose #fff which is the hex code for white color because I want to have a white splash

07:57.990 --> 08:01.250
screen with only our icon being placed in the middle of it.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.750
The browser will do this automatically for us,

08:03.750 --> 08:06.400
you will see it in one of the next lectures.

08:06.630 --> 08:12.710
You can also set up a theme color here, the theme color defines the overall theme

08:12.720 --> 08:19.020
for example used in the toolbar or in the tasks switcher and here, I picked a nice color which is basically

08:19.020 --> 08:24.330
the color used by the CSS package I used for styling the application,

08:24.330 --> 08:32.920
it's #3f51b5, that's this nice purple look you can see on our running web application,

08:33.130 --> 08:34.300
this look here,

08:34.360 --> 08:37.780
so the color of the toolbar. With the color set up,

08:37.870 --> 08:40.210
you can also add a description

08:40.510 --> 08:45.340
and again, this is a text which will be used by the browser whenever it needs to present a description

08:45.340 --> 08:46.380
to the user.

08:46.570 --> 08:57.370
So here a simple Instagram clone implementing a lot of PWA love, seems like a good description for

08:57.370 --> 08:59.840
the application we're building here.

09:00.040 --> 09:05.800
Now to conclude this, there are two other properties you learned about, dir to set the direction, could be

09:05.800 --> 09:07.180
right to left,

09:07.210 --> 09:11.990
now typically is probably left to right though which is the default

09:12.070 --> 09:13.130
but here,

09:13.240 --> 09:14.250
LTR then

09:14.260 --> 09:18.750
but here you could specify a different direction to let the browser know about this.

09:18.880 --> 09:26.440
And we also have lang, I'll set it to EN-US but you can use any four character color code or five characters

09:26.440 --> 09:31.130
actually with the dash to specify what the default language of your application is.

09:31.540 --> 09:34.700
And that's our own manifest.json file,

09:34.750 --> 09:42.080
now let's see how we can test it and where this actually will work in the next lecture.
