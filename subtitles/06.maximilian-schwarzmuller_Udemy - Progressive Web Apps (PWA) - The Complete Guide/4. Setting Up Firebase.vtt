WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:08.520
In this course, I'm going to use Firebase which is like a managed server solution by Google.

00:08.620 --> 00:11.680
Now on Firebase, we can basically build a real back-end

00:11.710 --> 00:17.170
but without creating the whole NodeJS server from scratch which we don't want to do here because this

00:17.170 --> 00:23.090
is no NodeJS course, we want to focus on progressive Web Apps and that mostly happens in the browser.

00:23.110 --> 00:29.410
So with Firebase, we can easily set up a back-end which offers us a database, file storage and even the

00:29.410 --> 00:36.070
possibility to run some code and build our own restful endpoints, so it offers everything we need

00:36.130 --> 00:42.460
and under the hood, it will use NodeJS. The best thing about it is for the scope of this course,

00:42.490 --> 00:44.790
you can absolutely use it for free,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.480
it has a free tier plan,

00:46.510 --> 00:48.340
we can check this under pricing

00:48.520 --> 00:54.010
and the quotas, the limits you have in that plan are more than enough for what we're going to do in this

00:54.010 --> 00:54.640
course.

00:54.790 --> 01:00.220
So the good thing is, you can set this up, use that, it will really run in the Internet but you don't pay

01:00.220 --> 01:01.240
anything

01:01.240 --> 01:04.150
and with that, let's go to the console to sign-in,

01:04.180 --> 01:06.130
you need a Google account for that.

01:06.130 --> 01:11.800
Now once you are signed in, you're on this starting dashboard. Now you might not have any projects yet,

01:11.800 --> 01:17.030
I already have some but I'll simply create a new project by clicking on add project.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.540
Now there, you can choose any name,

01:19.570 --> 01:25.840
I'm going to name mine pwagram and then you can choose a region. The region here can simply be

01:25.840 --> 01:27.490
the country you're located in,

01:27.550 --> 01:30.730
it doesn't affect where this project runs

01:30.760 --> 01:33.280
so you don't pick where the server is at here.

01:33.760 --> 01:39.190
Then you click create project to, well set this project up and this can take a couple of seconds and

01:39.280 --> 01:43.050
then you will be taken to the Firebase console.

01:43.050 --> 01:45.310
This is the dashboard for your project,

01:45.340 --> 01:50.550
it can look overwhelming at the start but in the end, it's really easy to use.

01:50.950 --> 01:57.070
On the left here, you have all the options or all the features of Firebase, as you can see there are plenty

01:57.070 --> 02:01.590
of them, we'll use the database and storage to store images,

02:01.780 --> 02:07.990
we'll also host our application on Firebase later to really see it run in the web and we'll use cloud

02:07.990 --> 02:13.840
functions to create our own restful endpoints we can send data to. Now for now, I only want to use

02:13.840 --> 02:16.950
the database and storage because that's all I need,

02:17.050 --> 02:18.210
well for now.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.460
So let's start by clicking on database here

02:21.880 --> 02:27.320
and the first thing we should do here for the purpose of this course is open it up.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.660
These rules you have here under rules tab define who can read and write to the database.

02:32.950 --> 02:36.690
Now normally, this is restricted to authenticated users,

02:36.760 --> 02:38.760
we don't use authentication here though,

02:38.890 --> 02:43.100
you could of course add it but it's not really related to creating a progressive web app,

02:43.210 --> 02:45.740
you use it in the same way in every web app.

02:45.850 --> 02:52.210
So therefore what I'll simply do is I'll switch this check if we are authenticated just to true which

02:52.210 --> 02:55.640
gives us read access. I'll later also do this for

02:55.660 --> 02:56.140
write

02:56.140 --> 02:59.030
to make sure we can write without being authenticated.

02:59.030 --> 03:03.080
Again, this is just for the demo purposes in this course, in a real project,

03:03.100 --> 03:10.370
you probably have some form of authentication. So with that, we ensure that we can read our database and no worries,

03:10.390 --> 03:13.030
I will show you how you access your database soon,

03:13.270 --> 03:17.970
let's now go to data and populate our database with some data.

03:18.070 --> 03:22.480
The Firebase database you see here doesn't work with tables or anything like that,

03:22.480 --> 03:25.750
instead what we have is a JSON structure,

03:25.780 --> 03:30.940
so like JSON data, so it should be really easy to understand since it basically looks like a Javascript

03:31.000 --> 03:32.120
object.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.770
It's empty at the beginning but we can easily add a new node by clicking on the plus here

03:36.970 --> 03:43.050
and I want to name this first new node posts because this should store a couple of posts below it.

03:43.210 --> 03:50.490
Now once we set up this, you can click on the plus again to add a sub-node below that posts node and

03:50.520 --> 03:50.890
there,

03:50.890 --> 03:56.200
I want to have my first post. This is basically like a unique ID of the post,

03:56.260 --> 04:01.410
you could enter a number here, a random string or simply something you can easily understand like first

04:01.430 --> 04:02.360
post,

04:02.640 --> 04:06.330
then I'll nest even more data below that first post.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.540
So what should be inside that post?

04:08.740 --> 04:12.070
I want to have a URL to an image I can display,

04:12.340 --> 04:19.990
maybe also store the ID in here, though we would have it at the top level and also store like a location

04:20.350 --> 04:23.010
and then the title of the post,

04:23.020 --> 04:26.620
this is basically what I want to show in my application later.

04:26.620 --> 04:31.550
So we'll have an image and I'll enter a dummy value here for now,

04:31.570 --> 04:35.480
later we'll replace it with a real link and then I can click add

04:35.710 --> 04:39.760
and now we can add more data to that first post by clicking the plus next to it again

04:39.970 --> 04:48.850
and also enter a title, like awesome trip to SF because I'm going to upload a San Francisco picture

04:48.850 --> 04:51.170
because I've been there recently.

04:51.190 --> 04:57.370
Now the next thing I want to store here is the location, the location could also be another nested

04:57.370 --> 05:04.900
object with coordinates or for now, just a string, like in San Francisco. So this is what I'll add here

05:05.680 --> 05:07.380
and I'll add one more item,

05:07.390 --> 05:12.710
it's kind of optional, I'll name it ID and this can be first post here too.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.080
So basically the same as we have here, could also be different one, I'll choose this one.

05:18.100 --> 05:22.280
So this is now my first post and the data piece

05:22.330 --> 05:24.350
I want to work with in this application.

05:24.610 --> 05:27.220
Now feel free to add more of course,

05:27.310 --> 05:35.020
I will now upload an image, so that we have something to display. The storage tab here or the storage

05:35.140 --> 05:38.650
area also uses rules, by default,

05:38.710 --> 05:40.330
you don't need to change these,

05:40.390 --> 05:43.160
upload is only permitted to authenticated users

05:43.240 --> 05:49.690
and if you're working in this console here, you are treated as authenticated and reading is also allowed

05:49.690 --> 05:55.240
to authenticated users but there is a special way we can access the users anonymously too and we'll use

05:55.240 --> 05:56.040
that way.

05:56.380 --> 06:01.990
So now I want to upload a file and I'll just use that San Francisco picture I already used as a dummy in

06:01.990 --> 06:02.910
the project.

06:03.130 --> 06:08.710
So I'm in the complete guide folder here which is our project and there in the source folder under

06:08.770 --> 06:09.340
images,

06:09.400 --> 06:16.440
I have that San Francisco picture which I took from a boat, I'll simply upload this. So this will upload it to

06:16.630 --> 06:26.070
Firebase storage and there if I click on that on the right under file location, you will see this download

06:26.070 --> 06:26.940
URL.

06:27.010 --> 06:34.220
Now if you click on it, you copy it and now if you open it in a new tab, you can load it anonymously

06:34.240 --> 06:38.090
because here I am just accessing it just as everyone else could access it.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.260
This is the URL

06:39.310 --> 06:41.100
I want a store in my database now,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.090
so this download URL.

06:43.120 --> 06:49.650
So back in the database for the image, I'll now replace the free access here with that URL.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.770
So this is now updated

06:50.770 --> 06:55.510
and now we have that URL stored and the good thing is whenever we fetched the data, we can

06:55.510 --> 07:02.500
simply use that URL for example in an image tag or as a background image in CSS and I will automatically

07:02.500 --> 07:07.910
fetch that without us adding any more code. So this is the set up I want to use for now

07:08.170 --> 07:09.790
and with that, we get a back-end set up.

07:09.820 --> 07:15.880
Now in the next lecture I want to connect our front-end to this Firebase back-end by making HTTP requests

07:15.940 --> 07:17.020
to fetch that data.
