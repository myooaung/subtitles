00:02.120 --> 00:08.810
So with the basics now set up about the elements we want to use in our HTML file and the styling of these

00:08.810 --> 00:09.590
elements,

00:09.590 --> 00:15.020
I now want to access the camera. That is an interesting part to start with in my opinion

00:15.020 --> 00:21.410
and for that, we need access to this video element and to this canvas element.

00:21.410 --> 00:23.160
Now the idea is the following,

00:23.360 --> 00:28.050
I want to stream a live picture of the device camera to this video element.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.620
So it's going to be a video, not just an image,

00:30.620 --> 00:35.190
we're not just taking a static image, we're showing the video here in the web browser

00:35.630 --> 00:42.070
and then we'll use the canvas to basically freeze that image whenever we click the capture button.

00:42.350 --> 00:44.320
Why do I use this approach?

00:44.510 --> 00:47.140
Well, let me start from the opposite direction.

00:47.180 --> 00:53.090
You could just use this input picker and if you tap that on let's say an iPhone, you will automatically

00:53.120 --> 01:00.020
get an interface provided by the iPhone which allows you to select the image by either taking one

01:00.240 --> 01:05.990
using the native device camera and the native camera app or to pick one from the file system, so from the

01:05.990 --> 01:07.270
gallery.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.170
That's of course nice and you could absolutely use that, by the way it's presenting this set up because

01:12.170 --> 01:14.410
we're accepting only images here.

01:14.480 --> 01:20.480
However it would be even nicer if we could embed this full experience into our web app, so that the

01:20.480 --> 01:23.710
user doesn't have to leave our web app to take a picture

01:23.810 --> 01:25.410
and this is exactly what I want to do here,

01:25.490 --> 01:31.040
that's why we need both a place to stream the video whilst the user is basically calibrating his camera

01:31.100 --> 01:33.770
and looking to get a good picture

01:33.980 --> 01:38.900
and then the canvas to actually take that picture and the button of course to trigger that event.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.300
So that's how we use these three elements and we'll do this in the feed.js file which is responsible

01:44.300 --> 01:47.600
for managing this HTML file here.

01:47.600 --> 01:53.850
So for that, I'll add new variables at the top to get access to the player, the canvas and to this button.

01:54.140 --> 01:58.750
So the video player will be this element, the video element.

01:58.850 --> 02:03.890
So with query selector here, I could simply select videos and it's the only one but I can also

02:03.890 --> 02:09.710
use player because it has the ID player, as you can see here, ID player,

02:09.710 --> 02:12.610
the canvas has the ID canvas so we can use that there.

02:12.830 --> 02:14.080
And that's exactly what I'll do,

02:14.210 --> 02:22.160
I'll copy that and rename the other one canvas element, whatever you like and use the ID canvas

02:22.190 --> 02:27.650
and finally I need to get access to the button and also the image picker because we want to show that

02:27.650 --> 02:29.820
if we got no access to the camera.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.570
So the button first, that's the capture button, that's the ID,

02:33.620 --> 02:41.280
so let's get access to that. I'll name it capture button here too and use capture button here,

02:41.390 --> 02:47.960
so the ID we set up in the HTML file, that's the capture button. Oh it's btn, so good that I

02:47.960 --> 02:49.460
looked, btn,

02:49.640 --> 02:51.540
that's the ID of the button

02:51.890 --> 02:56.230
and now for the image picker here, we got the ID image picker.

02:56.510 --> 03:05.550
So we'll copy that and I'll create one more variable which I'll name image picker and enter that ID name

03:05.550 --> 03:06.140
here.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.150
So I'm selecting all these elements here by ID.

03:09.270 --> 03:15.330
One last thing I'll also fetch is access to this whole area for the image picker because I also want

03:15.330 --> 03:16.670
to hide this

03:16.680 --> 03:21.120
h6 tag here, so I'll also get access to pick image.

03:21.540 --> 03:30.240
So that's the last thing, I'll name it image picker area maybe, get access to query selector and then

03:30.270 --> 03:32.690
pick by the ID, pick image.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.090
So with these elements, I'll now work, again it's the video element,

03:36.090 --> 03:42.030
the canvas, the button, the image picker input and the div surrounding the image picker input and

03:42.060 --> 03:43.980
its heading.

03:44.010 --> 03:49.860
So in my open create post modal where I basically open it by sliding it up, that's where I also want

03:49.860 --> 03:51.520
to initialize my media.

03:51.660 --> 04:00.140
So I'll create a new function which I'll name initialize media because here I want to initialize the camera

04:00.200 --> 04:05.350
or the image picker depending on the features the given device supports.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.930
Now for that, I of course need to do this or I want to do this in a progressive way,

04:10.970 --> 04:19.320
so I want to enable the camera in a progressive way, that it works on as many devices as possible

04:19.550 --> 04:24.000
and I will try this right after we opened that modal.

04:24.140 --> 04:31.370
Now let's find out how we can initialize the media and get access to the camera on as many devices as

04:31.370 --> 04:33.690
possible in the next lecture.
