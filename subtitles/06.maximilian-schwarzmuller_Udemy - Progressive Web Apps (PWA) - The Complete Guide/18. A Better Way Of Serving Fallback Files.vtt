Here's another improvement I want to share with you. Have a look at this line here where we check whether

00:08.000 --> 00:13.390
we are trying to access the help route and if we failed to do so because we're in the catch handler

00:13.390 --> 00:20.380
here, I return the offline.html file. It's working but the issue is, as we start adding more

00:20.380 --> 00:26.580
and more pages, I have to keep on writing or adding conditions to the if statement,

00:26.800 --> 00:31.680
I have to check if it's either help or maybe dynamic.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.320
Now that leads nowhere,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.960
that's not how we want to do it

00:35.020 --> 00:42.460
if it should be written in a flexible way. So instead of checking the URL, let's indeed check the request

00:42.460 --> 00:43.900
headers.

00:43.900 --> 00:51.320
There we can call a get method to get a specific header and I'm interested in the accept header. There

00:51.370 --> 00:58.780
I now want to see if the accept header includes, that's a helper method we can use, includes text/html,

00:58.930 --> 01:05.260
which just means the incoming request accepts HTML as an answer

01:05.530 --> 01:10.830
and that's of course the perfect candidate for this fallback page because that is HTML.

01:11.290 --> 01:13.790
So with that, we're now way more flexible,

01:13.930 --> 01:15.540
let's see if it works.

01:15.640 --> 01:21.610
Going back to the application, I'll clear the storage, you could of course also reload and close the tab

01:21.610 --> 01:28.720
and open a new one. Reload this tab to install the service worker and reload again to do all the fetching

01:28.720 --> 01:36.940
we want to do here and now with that, let's see. If we refresh the cache, in the dynamic cache,

01:37.150 --> 01:43.750
we get a couple of entries but we haven't gotten the help page. So let me now go offline and reload, this

01:43.750 --> 01:45.160
works,

01:45.160 --> 01:52.690
let me switch to help now and we still see the offline.html page even though we're now loading it differently,

01:52.750 --> 01:58.900
so our new way of loading it clearly also works and this is another improvement which is way more flexible

01:59.080 --> 02:01.370
than looking for specific URLs,

02:01.540 --> 02:05.330
always consider this if you have fallback items.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.210
That's another important thing I want to add here,

02:08.570 --> 02:11.610
here we return an offline.html file,

02:11.680 --> 02:16.900
in other cases, maybe you want to return something for failing image requests.

02:16.900 --> 02:22.960
If you know the request accepts an image, maybe you have a dummy image you can return or for CSS, you have

02:22.960 --> 02:28.060
a dummy CSS file, so you can return more than just fallback pages,

02:28.120 --> 02:33.020
you can return any fallback file and the image example is pretty good,

02:33.250 --> 02:39.780
if the image is missing, maybe an avatar or some dummy image does it for now.

02:39.790 --> 02:40.980
So keep this in mind,

02:41.020 --> 02:44.330
you can return more than just a fallback HTML file,

02:44.410 --> 02:46.330
you can return any file here,

02:46.480 --> 02:53.630
you just have to pre-cache it, simply add it here to the static files and then look for what the header accepts,

02:53.770 --> 02:55.950
if that's an image, return an image.
