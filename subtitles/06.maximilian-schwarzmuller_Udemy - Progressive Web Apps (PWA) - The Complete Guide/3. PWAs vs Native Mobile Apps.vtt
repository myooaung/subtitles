00:02.670 --> 00:10.050
Let's compare native apps with mobile apps to find out if it makes sense to build a web app to begin

00:10.050 --> 00:13.710
with. Here's a number which might discourage you

00:13.710 --> 00:18.240
but no worries, I'll say more about this number over the next seconds.

00:18.780 --> 00:28.320
If we have a look at the usage of our smartphone, here's a report by comScore from 2015 made in the U.S.

00:28.800 --> 00:37.800
We see that the average smartphone user spends 87% of his time in native apps whereas only 13%

00:37.800 --> 00:40.620
of the time go into the mobile web,

00:40.710 --> 00:45.280
so the user visiting a web page in the browser on the mobile phone.

00:45.410 --> 00:49.720
Now this is clearly discouraging because, why would we build a mobile web app

00:49.830 --> 00:57.180
if a native app is so much better? Let's first of all find out why people spend so much time in native

00:57.180 --> 00:58.320
apps.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.440
One important factor are push notifications,

01:01.440 --> 01:03.660
they drive them back into the apps.

01:03.690 --> 01:07.420
You get a push notification, you tap on it, you're back into the app.

01:07.650 --> 01:12.050
Push notifications communicate with you even if the application is closed,

01:12.240 --> 01:16.520
even if the phone is tucked away into your pocket.

01:16.980 --> 01:22.860
Additionally we have home screen icons which make it easy to start the app, you pull out your phone,

01:22.860 --> 01:24.310
you have some time to spare,

01:24.330 --> 01:26.310
just open one of the apps and that's it,

01:26.310 --> 01:28.140
this is how you use it, right?

01:28.140 --> 01:29.820
That's harder for web apps,

01:29.830 --> 01:35.610
web pages of course. You can add them to the home screen but it's not like you're prompting the user to

01:35.610 --> 01:36.330
do so,

01:36.360 --> 01:39.500
you don't have an app store where people would go and search for you,

01:39.690 --> 01:43.560
so getting on a home screen traditionally has been hard for web apps,

01:43.590 --> 01:46.000
it's a huge plus for native apps though.

01:46.470 --> 01:52.320
Additionally we have access to native device features like the camera, geolocation and other things

01:52.440 --> 01:59.850
and of course many native apps also work offline, at least a certain part of the apps works offline.

01:59.850 --> 02:04.930
These are all good reasons why people are using native apps. Now as I already said,

02:04.980 --> 02:10.710
the cool thing about progressive web apps is that we can basically bring all these things into the web

02:10.710 --> 02:11.380
too,

02:11.610 --> 02:14.350
so maybe this can switch relations,

02:14.520 --> 02:19.560
that's not the only argument for the mobile web though. Even though today a lot of the people are using

02:19.560 --> 02:20.280
native apps,

02:20.340 --> 02:24.210
let's have a look at some arguments against native apps.

02:24.210 --> 02:29.640
One argument is that you of course have to learn two languages if you want to support iOS and Android

02:29.940 --> 02:36.450
or you need multiple developers, would be nicer if you could just write an application in the language

02:36.450 --> 02:37.440
you already know,

02:37.500 --> 02:39.810
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on,

02:39.810 --> 02:42.450
so if you could just use web application.

02:42.450 --> 02:49.470
Now the better argument is this number though. Even though the majority of users use native apps, 80%

02:49.470 --> 02:57.660
of the time goes into the top three apps which unfortunately probably isn't your app, it's most likely

02:57.660 --> 03:00.960
Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, something like that.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.380
So there's only very little time to spare for other apps

03:05.580 --> 03:09.630
and here's one other figure, how many new apps do you guess,

03:09.660 --> 03:14.350
does the average user install per month on his phone or her phone?

03:15.730 --> 03:18.250
Did you guess something, one, five, ten?

03:18.550 --> 03:21.710
It's zero, absolutely zero.

03:21.730 --> 03:24.760
The average user doesn't install a new app,

03:24.880 --> 03:29.930
you install new apps if you have a new phone but thereafter you rarely add new apps.

03:29.980 --> 03:37.230
These are the statistics that makes it clear that the web has something big to offer,

03:37.360 --> 03:38.200
its reach,

03:38.410 --> 03:40.170
let's compare the reach.

03:40.240 --> 03:46.650
We have the top thousand native apps and web pages visited from Mobile. In the native apps,

03:46.650 --> 03:50.180
w have 3.3 million users, in the web apps,

03:50.290 --> 03:51.960
we have 8.9.

03:52.210 --> 03:57.730
So even the less time goes towards the web, more people are visiting it,

03:57.760 --> 04:00.260
we can reach a broader audience there.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.160
The reason of course is connected to the figure of the 80% being spent in the same app.

04:05.170 --> 04:08.830
People do spend a lot of time in native apps but always in the same apps,

04:08.980 --> 04:12.010
the average app doesn't get that many visitors.

04:12.070 --> 04:14.010
Now the web has a huge advantage,

04:14.050 --> 04:18.910
you don't need to install anything from the App Store which takes time, in which you have to do actively.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.610
You search for something,

04:20.620 --> 04:21.840
Google shows the result,

04:21.850 --> 04:24.030
boom you're on your web page.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.680
You take a bookmark and you're back.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.670
So this is how you use the web.

04:28.690 --> 04:33.960
It's so much easier to get onto these web pages and that's a huge advantage of the web.

04:34.170 --> 04:43.360
Now since we can get advantages of the native device, offline access, camera and so on, to the web combined

04:43.360 --> 04:49.040
with that figure, sounds like progressive web apps aren't that bad of an idea.

04:49.420 --> 04:54.520
Let's confirm this hypothesis by having a look at this comparison.

04:54.550 --> 04:57.240
We have native apps and traditional web apps,

04:57.280 --> 05:03.400
so no progress of web app, a traditional web app which doesn't offer access to any native device features.

05:04.300 --> 05:10.450
If we compared them by capability and reach, the native app of course has awesome capabilities,

05:10.480 --> 05:15.610
we can leverage the operating system and access a lot of native device features.

05:15.610 --> 05:21.380
On the other hand, the reach isn't that good for the reasons we heard about. A web app on the other hand,

05:21.380 --> 05:25.610
a traditional one doesn't really have access to all these device features,

05:25.630 --> 05:28.160
it probably doesn't run offline,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.010
so that's not too good but the reach is really good.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.670
You can find it via Google,

05:32.680 --> 05:40.240
it's just one address in the URL bar away. A progressive web app now combines the best of both worlds,

05:40.580 --> 05:41.400
there

05:41.440 --> 05:44.220
we can access a lot of the native device features,

05:44.260 --> 05:51.220
we can make it available offline and we do have good reach of course because it's still a web app, still

05:51.220 --> 05:54.100
running in the browser. This is, well

05:54.100 --> 05:59.880
we will focus on progressive web apps in this course and why learning them really is a good idea.

05:59.920 --> 06:05.550
You can get the best of both worlds and deliver awesome experiences to your users.
