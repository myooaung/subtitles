00:02.210 --> 00:06.870
So that was a lot of talking about what progressive web apps are, why we use them and what we're

00:06.870 --> 00:08.800
going to build in this course.

00:08.820 --> 00:14.340
Now let's see what exactly we'll learn in this course and how we'll walk through all these topics.

00:14.610 --> 00:20.220
Well right now, we're still getting started but we're almost done and in the next module, we'll have a look

00:20.220 --> 00:22.290
at the application manifest.

00:22.420 --> 00:29.100
This is this document which tells the browser more about our web application and you'll learn everything

00:29.100 --> 00:31.740
about it in the second module.

00:31.740 --> 00:37.990
Thereafter, we'll already dive into service workers because they are such a core building block. Now service

00:37.990 --> 00:44.750
workers and in general, a lot of progressive web features use promises and the fetch API.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.320
Therefore I'll have a short module where I briefly refresh the knowledge about these core concepts

00:52.380 --> 00:58.530
so that we're all on the same page because we're going to use a lot of promises and the fetch API throughout the course.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.680
It's easy to use that,

00:59.730 --> 01:03.820
I just want to make sure that we all know what we're using there.

01:04.050 --> 01:10.440
Now once we got that refresher, we'll head back to service workers and learn how we can use them to provide

01:10.470 --> 01:12.700
offline access through caching.

01:13.110 --> 01:19.260
We'll then continue on this road and dive into advanced caching strategies using service workers, to

01:19.260 --> 01:25.710
really have the right strategy for which ever asset you're going to load in which ever situation in your

01:25.710 --> 01:26.610
app.

01:27.240 --> 01:34.800
After that, we'll have a look at how we can cache dynamic content with indexedDB because thus far, we

01:34.800 --> 01:39.150
will have cached assets like CSS files, script files, images.

01:39.150 --> 01:42.190
Now what about JSON data you get back from a rest endpoint?

01:42.300 --> 01:43.650
We can cache that too

01:43.830 --> 01:46.380
and there you will learn how to best do that.

01:46.770 --> 01:50.300
Once we did that, we'll have a look at responsive design.

01:50.310 --> 01:55.830
Now I already said I won't dive into it super deeply here because there are whole courses about that

01:55.980 --> 01:58.460
and you can indeed create whole courses about that,

01:58.710 --> 02:05.070
so I just want to give you some core features, some basics you need to know but I definitely encourage

02:05.070 --> 02:07.680
you to pick up a separate course on this topic,

02:07.680 --> 02:13.800
it's super important and more than I could fit in to this course where I really want to focus on all the

02:14.040 --> 02:16.940
other core technologies. Now,

02:16.950 --> 02:23.820
with responsive design added, we'll go back to these new core technologies and we'll have a look at

02:23.820 --> 02:31.530
background synchronization next which describes the process of us sending something whilst we're offline and therefore

02:31.530 --> 02:32.830
of course it would fail

02:33.180 --> 02:39.930
but of a way to store that and send it when the internet connection is re-established even if we did

02:39.930 --> 02:46.140
close the application by then. You'll learn it in this module and thereafter, we have a look at web

02:46.140 --> 02:47.740
push notifications,

02:47.790 --> 02:54.440
so how we can receive and send push notifications even if our application is closed.

02:55.480 --> 03:00.090
Now as a next step, we'll have a look at the media API and geolocation,

03:00.100 --> 03:05.770
these are not strictly core features of a progressive web app but since you typically use native device

03:05.770 --> 03:10.930
features in progressive web apps, it's super important to know how to use two of the most important

03:10.930 --> 03:12.230
and popular features

03:12.280 --> 03:19.150
you can use on a real device and I'll dive into this in this module. Now after that, we learned a lot

03:19.150 --> 03:26.800
about the different technologies and we'll see that it can get hard to manage all our service worker code.

03:27.610 --> 03:31.680
Therefore we'll then dive into automated service worker management,

03:31.720 --> 03:37.940
I will show you a tool you can use to make a lot of the things you had to do manually before

03:38.050 --> 03:40.660
easier by doing them automatically

03:40.800 --> 03:45.760
and once we did this, I'll dive into single page applications and progressive web apps to show you how

03:45.760 --> 03:53.190
to turn your number one favorite framework application into a single page application with ease.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.360
With that, we'll have learned a lot,

03:56.390 --> 04:01.760
this course will do more than just get you started with progressive web apps,

04:01.810 --> 04:06.650
it will really allow you to use that knowledge, dive deeper,

04:06.670 --> 04:10.760
use it in your next project and I'm super excited to get started,

04:10.780 --> 04:17.720
so let me spend one more word about the course project set up and how you get the most out of this course

04:17.980 --> 04:21.750
and then we'll get right started and dive into the application manifest.
