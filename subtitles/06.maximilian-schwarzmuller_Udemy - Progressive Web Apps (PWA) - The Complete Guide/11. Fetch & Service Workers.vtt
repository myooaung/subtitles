I mentioned in the last lecture that adding a polyfill file makes sense because it allows us to use fetch

00:07.700 --> 00:15.050
on any browser and we want to use fetch and therefore not fallback to then old Ajax request

00:15.050 --> 00:22.340
in our main Javascript files because in modern browsers, we then can also react or own fetch events

00:22.520 --> 00:24.310
in the service worker.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.930
Remember that we have an event listener for fetch events,

00:28.160 --> 00:29.910
well what are we doing here?

00:30.140 --> 00:32.550
We're sending a request with fetch.

00:32.570 --> 00:36.290
This will also trigger the fetch event in the service worker.

00:36.500 --> 00:44.450
So as I mentioned earlier, the fetch listener is triggered whenever the HTML file fetches data,

00:44.450 --> 00:47.550
for example one of our Javascript files or an image,

00:47.660 --> 00:50.210
these are all implicit fetch requests

00:50.480 --> 00:54.920
but also if we manually send a fetch request in a Javascript file,

00:55.100 --> 01:01.640
so here with the fetch API and I can prove this to you. If we have a look at our console log with a lot

01:01.640 --> 01:03.260
of fetch statements there,

01:03.410 --> 01:10.850
now one of the last fetch statements here should relate to our own fetch request we sent, can be tricked to find

01:10.850 --> 01:16.790
one but actually this one here is a promising one because if we inspect that, we see that the request

01:16.850 --> 01:22.500
object in there actually has a URL of httpbin.org/psot,

01:22.670 --> 01:27.350
so you might need to click too through some of these statements to find one fitting to your own

01:27.350 --> 01:32.940
fetch statements but this one is one in my case. This is triggered from the service worker,

01:32.990 --> 01:37.400
it's printing out the request we send and it's letting the request pass

01:37.400 --> 01:40.340
because we don't do anything else with it in the service worker

01:40.580 --> 01:45.410
but we see that the methods post and that the URL is the URL we're sending the requests

01:45.410 --> 01:46.080
to.

01:46.370 --> 01:54.830
So that proves that we can also catch or listen, react to our own fetch requests in the service worker,

01:55.250 --> 01:59.080
something which will become important later in the course again.

01:59.090 --> 02:02.150
So with that, the basics of promises and fetch should be set,

02:02.240 --> 02:03.710
let's continue in the course.
