Before we dive into writing our service worker code and registering a service worker, we have to understand

00:08.240 --> 00:10.880
in which browsers we can actually use it.

00:11.010 --> 00:16.710
Now service worker availability and the support of the various features related to service workers can

00:16.710 --> 00:17.760
be checked on

00:17.760 --> 00:23.900
this is service worker ready page here, which you'll find in the last lecture of this module.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.870
Generally, all browsers are open to service workers and are on their way to supporting them, though some

00:30.870 --> 00:37.800
of them like Safari are a little further away from that support being shipped, Edge also still is in development.

00:37.800 --> 00:43.620
Now the important thing is, even if a browser doesn't support it yet, it's still worth using service workers

00:43.800 --> 00:49.380
because with Chrome supporting it both on desktop and mobile, a huge user base already has access

00:49.380 --> 00:50.240
to this feature,

00:50.370 --> 00:56.760
so you can already improve your application for a huge audience and other browsers will probably also ship

00:57.090 --> 01:01.530
support relatively soon, maybe already at the point of time you're watching this video,

01:01.950 --> 01:04.610
it's already worth improving your web applications

01:04.620 --> 01:08.580
for that reason. That's the progressive part about progressive web apps,

01:08.640 --> 01:13.770
you add new features for the audience who is able to use it and the app will still work for the other

01:13.770 --> 01:14.060
users and

01:14.080 --> 01:17.020
browsers too, just without service workers.

01:17.190 --> 01:22.190
So that's the support, as you can see, pretty decent already and bound to become better.
