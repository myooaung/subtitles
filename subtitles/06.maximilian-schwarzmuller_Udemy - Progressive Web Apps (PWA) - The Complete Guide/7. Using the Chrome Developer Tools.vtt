So now that we learned that Chrome is a decent choice for testing the web manifest,

00:06.150 --> 00:07.990
let's see how we can test it there.

00:08.010 --> 00:13.040
I already have the developer tools open and you should do the same, if you don't have them up right now,

00:13.110 --> 00:15.980
you can open them via the menu here in the top right,

00:16.050 --> 00:21.330
then more tools and then developer tools or the shortcut which is displayed next to it.

00:21.330 --> 00:25.590
So there you have the developer tools and I recommend switching device mode because this looks

00:25.590 --> 00:26.480
a bit more

00:26.560 --> 00:32.110
web app-like, I guess. There you will find this application tab

00:32.130 --> 00:36.340
and this is all about web apps or progressive web apps to be precise.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.350
So click it and there are a lot of things we will cover throughout the course like service workers,

00:41.370 --> 00:44.960
for now let's have a look at the manifest part here.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Now if you reload your application, it should detect the app manifest. It points to the path,

00:51.060 --> 00:56.100
here you see the name and the short name, the start URL, the theme color you've chosen, the background

00:56.100 --> 01:00.660
color, orientation standalone and the icons it identified.

01:00.820 --> 01:08.190
This is a good part of the browser or a good way of testing if it actually was detected correctly, if

01:08.190 --> 01:12.070
you have any syntax errors in there or if it works.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.480
Now with that, we can see that it was detected correctly

01:15.630 --> 01:19.680
but of course it would be nice to see how it looks like on a real native device,

01:19.680 --> 01:24.850
keep in mind, that's just a browser simulating a device here from a display perspective.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.290
We would like to see it really being added to the home screen of a real device,

01:29.340 --> 01:33.510
so let me show you how to test it on a real device in the next video.
