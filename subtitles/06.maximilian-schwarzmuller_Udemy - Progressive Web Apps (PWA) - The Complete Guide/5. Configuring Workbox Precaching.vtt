00:02.080 --> 00:08.130
So in the last lecture, we got started with workbox, we installed it and generated this first service worker

00:08.290 --> 00:12.160
where it's already managing our static assets automatically.

00:12.190 --> 00:14.300
Now a couple of things need to be fixed,

00:14.320 --> 00:15.480
it's caching assets

00:15.490 --> 00:24.320
we don't want to cache, like the different icons here and it also doesn't cache our fonts, our CSS

00:24.380 --> 00:27.410
styles we're pulling in from a CDN for example.

00:27.480 --> 00:32.850
That also is of course bad because due to that reason, our application doesn't work as it should.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.160
Now we're going to fix this step-by-step,

00:35.200 --> 00:40.630
let's start by making sure we only precache the items you want to precache and that's where this

00:40.630 --> 00:46.960
workbox-cli-config.js file becomes important again. This file was generated automatically due to

00:46.960 --> 00:48.740
our choices during the setup

00:48.910 --> 00:53.830
but that's only a basic file or a basic version, we can tweak it to our needs,

00:54.100 --> 00:57.420
so let me quickly walk you through the options you see here.

00:57.730 --> 01:03.700
There you see the glob directory which just means, in which folder do the assets you want to cache live?

01:03.730 --> 01:10.960
So here it's a public folder, then a pattern is defined, how can the individual files in that directory

01:10.960 --> 01:18.220
here be identified and this pattern here simply says in any folder, any file name with any

01:18.220 --> 01:20.270
of these extensions should be cached,

01:20.410 --> 01:24.260
that's of course too ingeneric, so we're going to fix this soon.

01:24.340 --> 01:28.660
We also have something else here, we define which files should be generated,

01:28.660 --> 01:30.700
so which service worker should be generated

01:31.120 --> 01:37.390
and you can also kind of combine these patterns with the ignore patterns and say I want to cache these

01:37.400 --> 01:42.340
files but don't cache files with this name for example,

01:42.340 --> 01:45.110
so you can explicitly ignore some files here.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.840
Now there also are more options you can set up.

01:47.950 --> 01:52.840
Here's the official documentation which unfortunately isn't that great

01:53.050 --> 01:58.360
but if you work with it a little bit, you get used to it and know how to use it.

01:58.360 --> 02:04.540
So here I'm on the page which defines how we can configure this build process, so exactly what we configure

02:04.540 --> 02:07.600
here in this config file.

02:07.630 --> 02:13.630
Now there, you'll see all the different properties you can set up like swDest, the destination of the 

02:13.630 --> 02:15.460
to-be created service worker.

02:15.640 --> 02:20.890
You see you can also specify an input service worker which will basically be expanded,

02:21.130 --> 02:24.500
now I'll come back to this in the next lectures.

02:24.760 --> 02:30.580
Here you see the other things you already know, globPatterns, globDirectory and there are more options,

02:30.580 --> 02:31.620
feel free to browse

02:31.620 --> 02:32.120
through this,

02:32.200 --> 02:34.770
a link can be found at the end of this module of course,

02:34.900 --> 02:39.040
to find out if you need to set up something special in your project.

02:39.040 --> 02:45.460
Now one thing I definitely want to do for now is in my setup here,

02:45.880 --> 02:49.070
I want to finetune the globPattern.

02:49.150 --> 02:55.300
I don't want to pull in all files, I want to get rid of the images for example because I don't want

02:55.300 --> 03:01.210
to import all these icons. So I'll add a new pattern, simply as a new element in this array and there I'll say

03:01.330 --> 03:07.260
in the source images folder and this has to be seen relative from the directory you defined here,

03:07.300 --> 03:12.790
so public source is the full path but just specifies source images.

03:13.060 --> 03:20.730
So in that folder, I want to store all, let's say jpg and png files, this would be the globPattern

03:20.730 --> 03:21.930
for this.

03:22.060 --> 03:28.810
Now this ensures that I don't pull in files from the icons subfolder because I don't have **/

03:28.810 --> 03:32.300
which would be a wild card for any subfolder,

03:32.410 --> 03:37.270
I just have a wildcard for the name but only files in the images folder itself.

03:37.540 --> 03:42.770
So this already makes sure I don't pull in all these unnecessary images.

03:43.360 --> 03:49.310
Additionally we could say I don't want to precache the help page because we hadn't done that before.

03:49.570 --> 03:54.020
So in globIgnores, I'm going to add help/**

03:54.040 --> 03:56.850
which means don't put anything into this

03:56.980 --> 04:00.120
which is below the help folder.

04:00.130 --> 04:06.540
So basically if that's a file or if it's a subfolder or a file in a subfolder, everything will be ignored.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.550
Now this is the set up I want to go with for now,

04:09.700 --> 04:14.970
so with that, let's open our terminal again and let's rerun this npm run generate-sw command

04:14.980 --> 04:20.020
we set up. This will now generate a new service worker and overwrite the old one

04:20.230 --> 04:23.490
and there you can see, the file manifest got a bit leaner.

04:23.620 --> 04:27.780
We still clash a lot of files obviously but all the icons and so on are gone.

04:27.830 --> 04:32.600
Now you can continue tweaking this but for me, this is already looking better here

04:32.680 --> 04:36.280
and we now got a file manifest which makes more sense for me.

04:36.370 --> 04:43.450
Still we're not precaching any of our fonts or CSS files we're pulling in from a CDN. Now for that, we'll

04:43.450 --> 04:50.950
use a new feature and this new feature will be related to routing, so that we store some assets when

04:50.950 --> 04:56.920
we pull them from a certain URL in a special cache and this can easily be implemented with

04:56.920 --> 04:57.940
workbox.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.730
Let's explore how that works in the next lecture.
