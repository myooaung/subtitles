Over the last lectures, we learned a lot about caching using service workers and the cache API. The cache

00:08.330 --> 00:13.960
API is awesome for caching assets like script files, CSS files or images.

00:14.090 --> 00:15.680
Now what about dynamic data?

00:15.740 --> 00:22.100
With that, I mean data we get from a server for example. We can also cache this but it's best to not use

00:22.100 --> 00:25.680
the cache API for that but indexedDB.

00:25.710 --> 00:26.890
Now in this module,

00:27.020 --> 00:28.610
I'll explain what this is,

00:28.700 --> 00:34.190
I'll also explain the difference between caching dynamic content and dynamic caching

00:34.190 --> 00:40.370
and by the end of the module, we'll have an application which still works offline providing us access

00:40.370 --> 00:44.550
to the data we've fetched from the server if we do have Internet access.

00:44.660 --> 00:50.270
That's of course a huge improvement because then our application always shows some content even if the

00:50.270 --> 00:55.570
user is not online and if he is online, we'll make sure to prefer data from the server.

00:55.580 --> 00:59.070
Let's dive into that and let's dive into caching dynamic content.
