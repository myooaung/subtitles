00:02.270 --> 00:08.240
So back in the service worker file in our main project, we already added quite some functionality regarding

00:08.240 --> 00:09.130
caching,

00:09.140 --> 00:15.260
now I want to dive into some advanced use cases and actually, we want to start with caching triggered by

00:15.260 --> 00:23.930
a user event. Then we will access the caching, not from inside our service worker but from inside our normal

00:23.930 --> 00:27.220
Javascript code in the source Javascript folder.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.620
A typical use case for that is an article on a news site which we want to save to access it later, maybe

00:33.620 --> 00:35.100
even offline,

00:35.140 --> 00:38.470
this is what I want to simulate for that and to simulate it,

00:38.480 --> 00:45.560
I temporarily need to turn off our dynamic cache here because if it's turned on, we can't simulate this because

00:45.560 --> 00:52.630
we're caching everything anyways. So we're adding a new card dynamically here in this div, the shared moments

00:52.630 --> 00:53.280
div,

00:53.390 --> 00:58.570
this happens in the feed.js file through this create card function here.

00:58.630 --> 01:05.480
Now my goal is to add a button here which allows us to save this card when the user wants to do so.

01:06.260 --> 01:13.720
For that, I will first of all add such a button and I will it at the end of my supporting text element

01:13.730 --> 01:15.890
here, where I input some text

01:15.890 --> 01:17.930
anyways I set the text content,

01:17.930 --> 01:19.910
well I also want to append a button,

01:19.910 --> 01:21.300
let's see how that looks like.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.620
Let's add card supporting text and append a child here.

01:26.630 --> 01:34.370
Now this child should be a button element, so I'm going to create a var card save button maybe, whatever

01:34.370 --> 01:41.520
name you like with document create element and then it will be of type button,

01:41.780 --> 01:48.560
so let's simply add this button here, we can add some styling thereafter too. To see this change,

01:48.560 --> 01:53.430
we of course have to go back to the application and reloading won't do,

01:53.480 --> 01:59.360
we have to clear the storage to get rid of the old service worker, the old cached files from the assignment

01:59.360 --> 02:07.070
from the last module. So clear the site data to get rid of everything and then reload. With that, we don't

02:07.070 --> 02:09.520
have dynamic anymore so reload the route page,

02:09.670 --> 02:14.400
you see that card here, you don't see a button on the card though.

02:14.690 --> 02:16.580
The reason can be found in the elements tab,

02:16.640 --> 02:18.920
we have a button with no text in there,

02:19.190 --> 02:21.370
if I do add a caption though,

02:21.590 --> 02:28.240
so if we access the save button and set the text content equal to save and then we go to our service

02:28.250 --> 02:31.100
worker and bump the version up because we changed that file,

02:31.100 --> 02:35.730
now we can go back to the application, reload and then close the tab and reopen it,

02:38.130 --> 02:42.120
like this, then we should see the save button here.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.170
Now obviously, you could position somewhere else

02:44.190 --> 02:49.080
but the key thing is we do have a button here which we should be able to click.

02:49.500 --> 02:55.230
Let's see if the click does something on that button by simply adding a click listener to it,

02:55.380 --> 02:57.070
so I can do that here,

02:57.150 --> 03:00.930
card save button and add an event listener,

03:00.930 --> 03:01.620
click

03:01.920 --> 03:10.140
and there, I want to trigger a method which I'll name onSaveButtonClicked. Don't add parentheses

03:10.140 --> 03:14.910
here because I only want to have a reference to another function which I'll add above it which

03:14.910 --> 03:16.630
I'll name onSaveButtonClicked,

03:16.640 --> 03:21.720
so the name I used down there. Here I will get the event object because this will be triggered by the

03:21.720 --> 03:22.740
event listener

03:22.770 --> 03:25.970
and for now, I simply want to output clicked here.

03:26.010 --> 03:32.010
So with that, let's go back to the service worker, change that to V6 to update that because we updated our

03:32.010 --> 03:40.770
code, reload the page thereafter, reload it by opening a new tab and now we should see that if we clicked

03:40.770 --> 03:43.250
this button here, we see clicked in the console.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.290
So that's working.

03:44.370 --> 03:49.530
Now in the next lecture with that prepared, I want to make sure that upon clicking here, we do save the

03:49.530 --> 03:55.350
card for offline access because right now if I go offline and I reload the page, our app shell is there

03:55.440 --> 04:00.360
but of course the icons are missing due to disable dynamic loading as well as the card.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.230
The card is what I want to bring back.
