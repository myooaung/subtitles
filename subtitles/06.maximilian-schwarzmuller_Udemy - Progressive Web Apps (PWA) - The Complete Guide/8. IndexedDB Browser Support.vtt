00:02.240 --> 00:04.620
So here we are on caniuse.com

00:04.700 --> 00:09.190
and of course a link to this can be found at the end of this module and here you see the browsers

00:09.190 --> 00:13.130
support. As you can see it's really good, global all together.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.190
you reach almost all users,

00:15.230 --> 00:18.690
so it's well-supported without any polyfills required,

00:18.710 --> 00:19.850
that's a good thing.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.630
So using it is pretty safe, pretty secure 

00:22.730 --> 00:24.350
and that's why we'll use it.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.270
It's supported by a lot of browsers,

00:26.270 --> 00:28.190
it can be used in service workers,

00:28.220 --> 00:33.010
it's great for storing JSON data, which other arguments would you need?

00:33.230 --> 00:36.790
So with that, let's move on and let's see how we can actually use it.
