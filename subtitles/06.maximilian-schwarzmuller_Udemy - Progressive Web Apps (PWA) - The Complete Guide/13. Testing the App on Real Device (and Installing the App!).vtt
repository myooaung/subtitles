00:02.280 --> 00:06.220
I now connected my real Android device to my Mac here

00:06.510 --> 00:12.930
and again this should also work if you have an Android emulator running on Mac. Make sure you have developer mode

00:12.960 --> 00:16.490
enabled as described in the last lecture in this article

00:16.770 --> 00:23.550
and with that you can go in the Chrome developer tools on your machine, to these three dots here,

00:23.700 --> 00:27.050
more tools and then remote devices.

00:27.170 --> 00:32.400
Now if you click here, this section here at the bottom of your developer tools should open and there

00:32.400 --> 00:35.210
you see, all devices which are connected,

00:35.220 --> 00:37.010
in my case that's my real device

00:37.200 --> 00:41.610
but before I switch to it under settings, you see that I enable

00:41.610 --> 00:44.600
port forwarding, make sure to check this.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.490
This allows you to enter this URL here on the left in your device,

00:49.530 --> 00:56.910
so on your device and be redirected to this URL on your Mac or Windows machine because by default

00:56.940 --> 01:03.110
if you would enter localhost:8080 on your real device or the emulator, that would of course refer to

01:03.120 --> 01:05.350
the device itself,

01:05.370 --> 01:10.860
so we need to set up this redirection to be able to easily and conveniently access our local web project

01:10.980 --> 01:17.580
from the device. So with that if I now click on the one plus, you'll see Chrome is connected to it, you see the

01:17.580 --> 01:18.720
Chrome version

01:19.110 --> 01:20.750
and now I could enter a new tab

01:20.790 --> 01:24.860
either from the developer tools or I do it directly on the device.

01:24.890 --> 01:26.700
So let me quickly do that,

01:26.700 --> 01:27.450
here we go.

01:27.450 --> 01:33.610
You see I open pwagram on my device and now I can click inspect here and again, this should also work

01:33.650 --> 01:35.410
if you are running an emulator.

01:35.520 --> 01:39.340
Now the screen you're seeing on the left here actually is the screen on my device.

01:39.510 --> 01:46.950
You can see it, my mouse is here and still I can open the side menu because I just tapped on it on my device.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.720
So it's connected,

01:48.720 --> 01:54.640
the cool thing is the log you see here now also is the console log from my real device,

01:54.720 --> 02:00.660
so the service worker was installed there too. Of course this is a totally different user and browser

02:00.700 --> 02:06.920
therefore and hence it is not related to the service worker installed in my Chrome browser on my Mac,

02:06.960 --> 02:13.260
so if I were to push a new version for example where I needed to close existing tabs, I just need to

02:13.260 --> 02:17.460
do that on a given device to update the service worker on that device,

02:17.490 --> 02:19.290
just wanted to highlight that.

02:19.770 --> 02:23.320
So back to this device then, service worker was installed,

02:23.520 --> 02:29.850
let's click on the application tab in the developer tools then. Here you see we got a service worker running

02:29.850 --> 02:30.650
on it

02:31.080 --> 02:37.480
and if we check the service worker, we see the code of it, this is actually the code we wrote.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.780
Now the cool thing is if you click on manifest here, you can click on add to home screen to trigger

02:43.790 --> 02:47.140
this install banner on the local device,

02:47.140 --> 02:56.500
so I'll do this and here you see it, you see the device install banner where I can click add or deny it.

02:56.530 --> 03:00.210
Now I'll deny it here and it's gone.

03:00.220 --> 03:02.160
This is how we can trigger it manually,

03:02.260 --> 03:05.630
now the cool thing as we can just test it,

03:05.840 --> 03:11.260
this proves that we fulfill all criteria to show this to a real user too,

03:11.350 --> 03:17.320
of course not upon the press of a button but once you visited the page a second time after five minutes.

03:17.430 --> 03:22.650
Now the best thing is you can even control when this banner is shown.

03:22.930 --> 03:30.510
The earliest possible point of time is if all the criteria here are met when the user visits the page for

03:30.510 --> 03:33.560
a second time after at least five minutes.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.730
However sometimes you don't want to show the banner at this point of time,

03:37.750 --> 03:38.510
why?

03:38.710 --> 03:40.580
Let's have a look at this in the next lecture.
