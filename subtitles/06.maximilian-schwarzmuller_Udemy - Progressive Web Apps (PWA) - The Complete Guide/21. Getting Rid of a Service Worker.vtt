I want to come to an end in this module which is really a complex module. You learned a lot about service

00:08.440 --> 00:11.110
workers and caching with service workers,

00:11.120 --> 00:15.050
finally what if you actually want to get rid of a service worker?

00:15.050 --> 00:17.660
I only showed you how to register one, didn't I?

00:17.930 --> 00:20.540
Well getting rid of it is simple too.

00:20.990 --> 00:27.440
Let's say you want to get rid of a service worker whenever you click that plus icon in your app here,

00:27.670 --> 00:29.810
this icon here. Right now

00:29.810 --> 00:32.880
we open our pop-up there.

00:32.990 --> 00:37.610
Now of course getting rid of a service worker there might not make that much sense but it is a nice

00:37.610 --> 00:39.670
way to trigger that from code,

00:39.740 --> 00:40.580
so I'll do it

00:40.600 --> 00:48.590
there. The place to do it therefore is the click listener here, open create post modal where we already

00:48.590 --> 00:51.950
try to open this app install banner.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.720
Now besides doing that, after this if block,

00:54.800 --> 01:00.390
I'll also unregister the service worker. You can do this easily by accessing it,

01:00.410 --> 01:07.160
first of all you should check if the service worker exists in your navigator, otherwise you try to access

01:07.160 --> 01:15.110
something which isn't there. Then you can call navigator service worker, get registrations to get all

01:15.110 --> 01:18.030
active registrations,

01:18.070 --> 01:25.340
this will actually be a promise which resolves after a while and gives you all the registrations and

01:25.340 --> 01:34.290
then you can loop through them. So you can create a loop for var equals zero or i equals zero,

01:34.430 --> 01:43.580
i smaller than registrations length, increment i and then unregister them step-by-step inside of the for

01:43.580 --> 01:44.080
loop.

01:44.150 --> 01:52.920
So simply say registrations i to get the registration for the given loop iteration, unregister,

01:53.060 --> 01:57.800
that's all, this will unregister the service worker. Since we change the feed.js

01:57.840 --> 02:02.140
file, I'll go to the service worker and bump up the static version,

02:02.180 --> 02:04.930
so that we fetch the latest version of that file,

02:05.300 --> 02:07.870
then I'll reload the application here

02:08.820 --> 02:18.140
and again having internet is a good idea for that, reload this and close that, open a new tab.

02:18.460 --> 02:24.750
Now with that, we simply reinstall the service worker and in application, we see here it is.

02:24.940 --> 02:30.180
Now let me click that plus here and you see it immediately switched to deleted.

02:30.490 --> 02:32.910
Now it's still running here,

02:33.010 --> 02:39.400
so if I turn this offline, it's gone though because it was running until I reloaded the page.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.150
Now it's gone,

02:40.150 --> 02:41.960
we have no more service worker here.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.130
If I reload, we install a new one

02:44.290 --> 02:46.420
and of course we can delete that too.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.380
So that is simply how this works, 

02:49.390 --> 02:53.950
how this works with the service worker and how we can get rid of it.

02:53.980 --> 03:00.940
One important implication of getting rid of it is that as soon as you do so and you visit the page again

03:00.940 --> 03:02.290
and you don't get a new one,

03:02.350 --> 03:07.350
so I turn offline to ensure this, the cache is also gone,

03:07.480 --> 03:08.750
it's cleared for you

03:08.890 --> 03:11.150
so you don't have to take care about that.

03:11.170 --> 03:15.150
So this is how you can unregister a service worker if you ever need to do that,

03:15.400 --> 03:20.530
I will comment this code out here because I don't really want to unregister it here in my application

03:20.530 --> 03:24.610
on a plus click but I found it important to share this as well.

03:24.670 --> 03:30.610
And with that, you got the full bandwidth of service worker power, you know a lot about what you can do

03:30.610 --> 03:34.560
with it and especially of course how you can use it for caching.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.810
You are a true caching master now,

03:37.120 --> 03:39.160
please keep on practicing it

03:39.230 --> 03:44.650
and with that, I'm very happy to continue with the course and dive deeper into more features progressive

03:44.650 --> 03:47.020
web apps offer or can use.
