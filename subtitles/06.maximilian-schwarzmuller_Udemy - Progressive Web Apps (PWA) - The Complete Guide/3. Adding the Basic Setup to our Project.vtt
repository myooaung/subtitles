00:02.520 --> 00:07.450
In our application, it all starts in the index.html file in the public folder,

00:07.450 --> 00:10.480
this is where we have the modal to fetch some user input.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.150
If we have a look at our application, I'm referring to the modal we open with the plus icon

00:14.160 --> 00:19.590
here. Here we fetch title and location and that of course is the data we want to post to the server.

00:19.630 --> 00:23.590
Now clicking post doesn't do anything except for reloading the application right now,

00:23.590 --> 00:25.120
so this is what we have to work on,

00:25.150 --> 00:31.090
we have to connect this button, the post button with our Javascript file because this is where I then

00:31.090 --> 00:34.600
want to listen to that request and do something.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.730
Now this is all inside a form and that button happens to have the type submit,

00:39.730 --> 00:44.890
so what we can do is we can simply register a submit listener on that form. Good place to do

00:44.890 --> 00:50.740
this is of course in the feed.js file because that is the file we import in the index.html file and

00:50.740 --> 00:56.250
which handles all the post related things, all the feed related things.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.120
So there, I

00:57.130 --> 00:59.370
first of all want to get access to the form,

00:59.410 --> 01:05.770
I do this by grabbing it with document query selector and then form, accessing the form tag itself because

01:05.770 --> 01:11.320
it's the only form tag I have on this whole page so I can get access to it like this

01:11.830 --> 01:17.530
and then I went to register a submit listener. So I'll do this here at the bottom but of course you can do

01:17.530 --> 01:18.690
it wherever you want,

01:18.970 --> 01:21.440
I will simply reach out to the form,

01:21.460 --> 01:26.980
so to this variable I just set up here which gives me access to that form and register a listener with

01:27.070 --> 01:28.440
add event listener,

01:28.600 --> 01:30.410
I want to listen to the submit event

01:30.610 --> 01:35.360
and of course then execute a function as we always do, here

01:35.410 --> 01:36.990
I get access to the event.

01:37.750 --> 01:41.820
So this is my listener, this is the submit function then.

01:41.980 --> 01:48.250
Now in this submit function, I first of all want to prevent the default so that the page doesn't get loaded

01:48.430 --> 01:52.400
because the default of a submit event is the send data to the server.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.780
Now I won't do it like this though,

01:54.820 --> 01:59.440
I want to do it via Javascript and therefore I have to cancel the default.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.150
Now the next step is to simply check if we have some data in the form.

02:04.360 --> 02:12.550
So for that, I will implement an if check to see if the title and the location field here is populated

02:12.550 --> 02:13.840
with data.

02:14.140 --> 02:15.820
So for that, I can use the IDs

02:15.820 --> 02:22.390
these inputs have, title has the ID title and location has the ID location and I

02:22.390 --> 02:27.370
can get access to these elements too. So for that, I'll simply get access to them here,

02:27.370 --> 02:31.490
title input would be document query selector

02:31.600 --> 02:35.940
and then I set it's title, ID title though, so let's add a hashtag

02:36.280 --> 02:42.850
and now for the location, it's basically the same just replace the name with location input for the

02:42.850 --> 02:46.360
variable and then ID location here at the end.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.860
Now I can check if I do have values in an if statement here,

02:49.960 --> 02:56.490
so if title input.value because remember, title input itself is just the input element, value gives us

02:56.550 --> 02:58.220
access to whatever the user entered

02:58.630 --> 03:06.370
and I will trim this and check if it's equal to an empty string or if location

03:06.370 --> 03:11.750
input value trimmed is equal to an empty string,

03:11.800 --> 03:17.230
then I want to return because then I know that no valid data was entered and I want to ignore that click

03:17.230 --> 03:18.530
on the post button.

03:18.850 --> 03:22.860
In all other cases though, I of course want to continue.

03:22.990 --> 03:26.140
Now first of all, I want to close the modal here

03:27.460 --> 03:31.780
and I do have a function, close create post modal which will slide it down.

03:32.020 --> 03:38.120
So I will simply use that and call close create post modal here as a first step.

03:39.140 --> 03:45.890
Now the next thing I want to do is I want to add, as a side note here before we return, we could have thrown

03:45.910 --> 03:51.690
an alert, please enter valid data, to give the user a hint that the data is invalid.

03:52.010 --> 03:58.310
So after closing the create post modal though, I now want to register this background synchronization

03:58.310 --> 03:59.710
request.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.470
Now this is something I'll do in the next lecture.
