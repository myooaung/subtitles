WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:08.390
In the last course module, we started with the first important building block of progressive web apps,

00:08.650 --> 00:15.040
the manifest.json file which passes some extra information about our web app to the browser.

00:15.320 --> 00:22.340
Now we can supercharge this file with a second important building block, service workers. In this module,

00:22.340 --> 00:23.980
we'll dive into service workers,

00:23.990 --> 00:31.490
we're going to create our own service worker which then leads to one nice behavior already, we can install

00:31.490 --> 00:33.730
our application on the home screen.

00:33.890 --> 00:39.960
So let's dive into service workers and utilize their features to enhance our web application.
