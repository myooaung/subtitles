1

00:00:00,470  -->  00:00:06,300
In this lesson we will begin learning about the different types of inputs that are at our disposal when

2

00:00:06,300  -->  00:00:12,710
we are creating forms in an earlier lesson we learned about the input type of text.

3

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:19,110
So if I save and refresh my browser you can see a basic text input but there's an old saying that when

4

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:23,210
the only tool you have is a hammer everything begins to look like a nail.

5

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:29,290
So while the text input definitely has its place it's not the right choice for every type of field.

6

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:34,630
So let's imagine that we're creating a form and we want to collect the user's email address.

7

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:36,720
There's a special type for that.

8

00:00:36,720  -->  00:00:44,730
So let's set up a standard form we use the form element let's move our input to sit inside the form

9

00:00:44,730  -->  00:00:54,990
element and remember that we want to have a label associated with any fields so label email need to

10

00:00:54,990  -->  00:00:56,680
associate the label with the input.

11

00:00:56,680  -->  00:01:00,230
So we'll give the label A for attribute of email.

12

00:01:00,480  -->  00:01:03,890
We'll give this input an ID of email.

13

00:01:03,930  -->  00:01:06,730
Now this is the important part for type instead of text.

14

00:01:06,780  -->  00:01:08,980
We can actually include e-mail.

15

00:01:09,150  -->  00:01:12,560
And then let's go ahead and also give the input A name of email.

16

00:01:12,690  -->  00:01:23,130
And finally let's give this form a submit button input type equals submit value equals save.

17

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:27,690
So if I save and refresh we can see here is a 4.

18

00:01:27,720  -->  00:01:31,650
It's labeled If I click on the label it automatically puts my cursor in this field.

19

00:01:31,650  -->  00:01:37,190
Now if I type something that is not an e-mail address and click save.

20

00:01:37,380  -->  00:01:44,100
Most modern web browsers will automatically try to validate the form data so you can see in Firefox

21

00:01:44,160  -->  00:01:47,250
it's telling me please enter an email address.

22

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:54,780
This means that if we would have used text as the input type the form would have gladly submitted with

23

00:01:54,780  -->  00:01:56,060
this value in this field.

24

00:01:56,070  -->  00:02:02,250
But because we used the type of e-mail the form knows that there needs to be an email address in this

25

00:02:02,250  -->  00:02:05,760
field or it won't accept the form submission.

26

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:11,580
Another advantage of using the email input type is that it greatly enhances the user experience for

27

00:02:11,610  -->  00:02:13,580
touch screen users.

28

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:19,650
So if someone's using a touchscreen device and they tap on this field the on screen keyboard that displays

29

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:27,870
should include the at symbol in a fairly prominent location because it knows that this is an email input

30

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:30,560
and you're going to need the at symbol.

31

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:36,120
So if we contrast that with the onscreen keyboard that is displayed if this was a text field you might

32

00:02:36,120  -->  00:02:41,850
need to click a symbol's button to toggle different onscreen keyboard layout in order to find that symbol

33

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:42,360
.

34

00:02:42,360  -->  00:02:49,210
So in other words by choosing the correct input type for your field you're making the lives of touchscreen

35

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:51,520
users a bit simpler.

36

00:02:51,600  -->  00:02:54,530
Now email isn't the only special input type.

37

00:02:54,750  -->  00:02:56,910
Let's take a quick look at another one.

38

00:02:57,480  -->  00:03:01,650
Let's imagine that we wanted to collect a user's telephone number with our form.

39

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:06,860
So we will include input with the type of tell for telephone.

40

00:03:06,930  -->  00:03:12,330
Let's go ahead and give this input a label telephone.

41

00:03:13,050  -->  00:03:21,420
Give it a four attribute with a value of telephone give the input an ID that matches that telephone

42

00:03:21,430  -->  00:03:21,590
.

43

00:03:21,750  -->  00:03:25,190
And finally let's give this input a name of telephone.

44

00:03:25,560  -->  00:03:31,740
So now if I save and refresh my browser we won't see anything special because I'm using a desktop or

45

00:03:31,740  -->  00:03:32,860
laptop computer.

46

00:03:32,940  -->  00:03:39,600
But if we were using a touch screen device when we tap on this field the on screen keyboard would resemble

47

00:03:39,600  -->  00:03:45,290
that of when you're dialing a telephone number so it would be very easy to enter a phone number.

48

00:03:45,480  -->  00:03:50,910
Now in an effort to keep this lesson from becoming very repetitive I'm not going to go through every

49

00:03:50,910  -->  00:03:52,940
single input type in front of you.

50

00:03:52,980  -->  00:03:58,980
We've seen e-mail we've seen tell for telephone if you're creating a form and it feels like there really

51

00:03:58,980  -->  00:04:01,340
should be a special type for that input.

52

00:04:01,350  -->  00:04:03,020
Odds are there is.

53

00:04:03,090  -->  00:04:08,340
So in the course materials for this lesson I will include a more exhaustive list of all of the different

54

00:04:08,340  -->  00:04:09,570
input types.

55

00:04:09,570  -->  00:04:12,830
But for now let's move on to something a bit different.

56

00:04:12,840  -->  00:04:19,680
Up until this point the only type of field that we've seen is a text box about this size that can receive

57

00:04:19,680  -->  00:04:21,230
a single line of input.

58

00:04:21,480  -->  00:04:25,260
Well what if we want to allow our users to type an entire paragraph.

59

00:04:25,310  -->  00:04:26,900
There's a different field for that.

60

00:04:27,150  -->  00:04:34,230
So let's race this field and let's create a field where our users can type a message instead of input

61

00:04:34,240  -->  00:04:34,380
.

62

00:04:34,380  -->  00:04:42,630
There's an element name text area and unlike input we want to be sure to include the closing tag for

63

00:04:42,630  -->  00:04:43,830
text area.

64

00:04:44,300  -->  00:04:49,710
So let's go ahead and create a label for our textarea your message

65

00:04:52,230  -->  00:05:02,250
give the label a four attribute with a value of your message will give the text area an ID your message

66

00:05:02,250  -->  00:05:03,420
.

67

00:05:03,420  -->  00:05:11,400
Now the text area element does not need a type attribute because it is its own unique element text area

68

00:05:11,410  -->  00:05:11,950
.

69

00:05:12,300  -->  00:05:16,760
And finally the name will be your message.

70

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:23,130
So now we save and refresh we can see that there is a much larger box than the traditional text input

71

00:05:23,340  -->  00:05:25,310
that weve seen in earlier examples.

72

00:05:25,320  -->  00:05:33,390
So now users can begin typing their custom message and if they hit enter or return on their keyboard

73

00:05:33,600  -->  00:05:37,020
they can even go down to second and third and fourth and fifth lines.

74

00:05:37,230  -->  00:05:43,890
So the text area element is how we receive a paragraph or actually multiple paragraphs of text and that

75

00:05:43,890  -->  00:05:46,460
will conclude this particular lesson.

76

00:05:46,470  -->  00:05:48,010
Let's review what we've learned.

77

00:05:48,120  -->  00:05:51,870
We learned that there are different input types for receiving different types of data.

78

00:05:52,080  -->  00:05:57,270
So if we're receiving a telephone number we should use a special type for that if we're receiving an

79

00:05:57,270  -->  00:06:00,370
e-mail address we should use a special type for that.

80

00:06:00,390  -->  00:06:06,930
And finally we learned that when we want to receive multiple lines of text we can use the text area

81

00:06:06,990  -->  00:06:14,220
element in our next lesson we will learn that we don't always want our users to manually type in data

82

00:06:14,220  -->  00:06:14,540
.

83

00:06:14,610  -->  00:06:19,030
Sometimes we want them to choose between a pre-determined set of options.

84

00:06:19,110  -->  00:06:20,870
I'll see you in the next lesson.
