00:00:00.500  -->  00:00:09.210
In this lesson we will learn about special characters in HTL a special character is a punctuation mark

2

00:00:09.210  -->  00:00:15.500
or a symbol or any other character that we cannot simply tie directly into a text editor.

3

00:00:15.510  -->  00:00:22.470
So for example in front of you I have included a list of the top 10 most common h TMLC special characters

4

00:00:22.800  -->  00:00:24.660
that you should be familiar with.

5

00:00:24.660  -->  00:00:28.140
Now let's hop into our text editor and blast through these.

6

00:00:28.380  -->  00:00:32.290
The first special character in our list is right single quote.

7

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:37.510
So the code for that is ampersands which you can usually get by holding Shift on your keyboard.

8

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:39.440
And then the number seven.

9

00:00:39.510  -->  00:00:43.970
So it's ampersands and then R S Q You o semi-colon.

10

00:00:44.370  -->  00:00:50.920
We save and refreshing our browser we can see there is the symbol Next up left single quote.

11

00:00:51.360  -->  00:00:56.330
It's exactly like the one we just typed out only with an L instead of an R for left.

12

00:00:56.380  -->  00:01:00.160
So L S Q You o semi-colon.

13

00:01:00.420  -->  00:01:01.820
Right double quote.

14

00:01:02.310  -->  00:01:11.610
And probably yes it's ampersands and then R D for double â‚¬2 semi-colon left double quote.

15

00:01:12.000  -->  00:01:13.370
Ampersands l.

16

00:01:13.410  -->  00:01:16.130
D quot semi-colon.

17

00:01:16.230  -->  00:01:20.080
So if I save and refresh in the web browser we can see the various symbols.

18

00:01:20.310  -->  00:01:24.200
Now you may be thinking why do I need special codes for these symbols.

19

00:01:24.210  -->  00:01:31.650
I have a button on my keyboard to the left of my enter or return key and I can simply use that to create

20

00:01:31.650  -->  00:01:32.820
these symbols.

21

00:01:32.820  -->  00:01:34.800
Well the reason you don't want to do that is twofold.

22

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:41.040
Number one we use these symbols in H.M.S. syntax so it's probably not a good idea to get those mixed

23

00:01:41.040  -->  00:01:46.560
up when you're actually trying to output text and number to those keystrokes aren't angled to the left

24

00:01:46.560  -->  00:01:50.790
or the right the way that the proper punctuation marks are moving on.

25

00:01:50.880  -->  00:01:58.260
Ampersands again because we use the ampersand symbol in HTML codes you don't want to simply type the

26

00:01:58.260  -->  00:02:02.430
ampersand symbol when you want to output the ampersand symbol instead.

27

00:02:02.580  -->  00:02:08.460
The code for that is the ampersand sign and then the letters Ampe and then a semi-colon and that will

28

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:10.130
output the ampersand symbol.

29

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:17.640
Next up the greater than symbol because we use this symbol so much in H DML syntax we definitely do

30

00:02:17.640  -->  00:02:20.830
not want to simply try to output it in a text editor.

31

00:02:20.880  -->  00:02:29.430
So instead the symbol for this is ampersands and then G.T. for greater than less than ampersands LTE

32

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:35.760
for less than copyright ampersands and then simply the word copy and then a semi-colon.

33

00:02:35.760  -->  00:02:38.230
We include a semicolon after all of these.

34

00:02:38.250  -->  00:02:46.870
Next up the registered symbol ampersands Ridge semi-colon trademark symbol ampersands trade semi-colon

35

00:02:46.910  -->  00:02:47.120
.

36

00:02:47.210  -->  00:02:54.900
So if I save and refresh you can see a quick list of all of these very common HTML special characters

37

00:02:54.900  -->  00:02:55.650
.

38

00:02:55.650  -->  00:03:00.960
You can find a more exhaustive list of the common characters in the course materials but there is no

39

00:03:00.960  -->  00:03:03.600
sense in memorizing these all in one sitting.

40

00:03:03.780  -->  00:03:06.390
You can look them up as you need them.

41

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:08.490
I'll see you in the next lesson.
