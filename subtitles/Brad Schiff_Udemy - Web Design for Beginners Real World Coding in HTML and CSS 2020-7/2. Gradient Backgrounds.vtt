00:00:00.290  -->  00:00:06.420
In this lesson we will learn how to create gradient backgrounds in graphic design.

2

00:00:06.420  -->  00:00:12.450
We typically think of a gradient as a gradual or smooth transition between two colors.

3

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:15.740
So let's hop over to an example and give ourselves a goal.

4

00:00:15.850  -->  00:00:17.220
Here is an example page.

5

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:24.510
And let's imagine that we want the sidebar which is currently light green to instead use a gradient

6

00:00:24.510  -->  00:00:25.630
background.

7

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:31.560
And let's pretend that we want the top of the sidebar to start out as this light green color and we

8

00:00:31.560  -->  00:00:38.060
want it to transition vertically so that the bottom of the sidebar uses a white background color.

9

00:00:38.130  -->  00:00:39.800
So we've identified our goal.

10

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:44.470
Now let's hop over to the text editor we are viewing the CSSA file.

11

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:51.140
Here is the rule for the sidebar we can see that it's currently receiving a solid background color.

12

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:55.710
Now instead of a solid color we want to use a gradient so I'm going to delete this line.

13

00:00:55.710  -->  00:01:01.260
But first I'm going to copy this hexadecimal color code to my clipboard so I can paste it in just a

14

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:02.870
moment.

15

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:08.850
So with that line out of the way let's write the code to create a gradient as far as the web browser

16

00:01:08.850  -->  00:01:09.560
is concerned.

17

00:01:09.570  -->  00:01:16.920
Gradients are background images so we use the background image property only unlike last lesson where

18

00:01:16.920  -->  00:01:20.020
we pointed towards graphic files to create a gradient.

19

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:21.630
We just need a bit of code.

20

00:01:21.870  -->  00:01:30.060
So modern web browsers can leverage the linear gradient function and we can pass several values.

21

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:34.440
So first we specify which direction we want the gradient to flow.

22

00:01:34.740  -->  00:01:42.980
So I will say to the bottom to bottom comma we then specify what color we want to begin with.

23

00:01:42.990  -->  00:01:50.190
So I will paste in the hexadecimal color code for that green value comma and then we specify what color

24

00:01:50.190  -->  00:01:51.780
we want to fade to.

25

00:01:51.780  -->  00:01:54.290
So all input white.

26

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:58.230
So if I save and refresh in the browser.

27

00:01:58.230  -->  00:02:04.050
Now because we didn't have to create an actual graphic image file to create this gradient effect it

28

00:02:04.050  -->  00:02:08.830
means we can change the appearance of this gradient with just a few characters.

29

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:13.170
So if we wanted the colors to flow from the left to the right and center from the top to the bottom

30

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:21.690
we could say to the right to right or if we wanted the gradient to flow from the top left to the bottom

31

00:02:21.690  -->  00:02:30.670
right we could say to bottom right and we then have a diagonal gradient.

32

00:02:30.840  -->  00:02:37.350
But I'm going to switch this back to simply to bottom because I think that looks best.

33

00:02:37.350  -->  00:02:43.610
Now this lesson would be complete if the entire world used the most updated web browsers available.

34

00:02:43.830  -->  00:02:45.850
But that's not the world we live in.

35

00:02:45.900  -->  00:02:51.410
So if someone visits our Web site and they're using an outdated web browser that does not support CSSA

36

00:02:51.420  -->  00:02:57.690
gradients at the very least we want the sidebar to have a solid green background.

37

00:02:57.690  -->  00:03:06.600
So in our code directly above our gradient line we can provide fallback code for older browsers background

38

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:11.170
color and we'll paste in that standard green color.

39

00:03:11.190  -->  00:03:17.410
So at the very least even if someone comes to our page using a very old browser they will see this.

40

00:03:17.970  -->  00:03:23.950
We can leave this line of code in as well so if they're using a new browser they will see this.

41

00:03:24.000  -->  00:03:27.710
Now we could stop here but let's go the extra mile.

42

00:03:27.720  -->  00:03:32.340
So if someone's using a brand new web browser this code will work just fine.

43

00:03:32.670  -->  00:03:37.360
If they're using an incredibly outdated browser this will be the fallback.

44

00:03:37.620  -->  00:03:41.800
What if someone uses a web browser that's just a tiny bit outdated.

45

00:03:42.120  -->  00:03:47.630
Well that's where things get messy and that's where you no longer need to worry about remembering this

46

00:03:47.640  -->  00:03:49.050
syntax.

47

00:03:49.050  -->  00:03:54.950
And we as developers resort to desperate spaghetti tangle of code that I'm going to paste in.

48

00:03:55.080  -->  00:03:58.130
So I don't bore both of us to death by typing it in.

49

00:03:58.440  -->  00:04:04.890
So again do not worry about memorizing any of the highlighted lines but I will review them very quickly

50

00:04:04.890  -->  00:04:05.070
.

51

00:04:05.100  -->  00:04:10.290
So this is the very outdated Web Kit way of creating ingredients.

52

00:04:10.290  -->  00:04:14.720
This is the slightly outdated Web Kit way of creating gradients.

53

00:04:14.730  -->  00:04:17.010
This is the outdated Mozilla way.

54

00:04:17.100  -->  00:04:23.220
This is the outdated Microsoft way this is the outdated off-Broadway and obviously this last line is

55

00:04:23.220  -->  00:04:24.770
the line that we created together.

56

00:04:24.810  -->  00:04:30.790
So this is the modern non-browser specific correct way to create a gradient.

57

00:04:31.050  -->  00:04:34.320
Now again don't worry about memorizing these lines.

58

00:04:34.320  -->  00:04:41.070
This is something that you can copy and paste and modify for your own projects but with all of this

59

00:04:41.070  -->  00:04:47.580
code in place we now have a gradient effect that will work in almost every browser and device under

60

00:04:47.580  -->  00:04:48.630
the sun.

61

00:04:48.630  -->  00:04:54.750
And worst case scenario even if someone's browser doesn't support gradients they were at the very least

62

00:04:54.780  -->  00:04:59.570
see the solid green background color that we provided as a fallback.

63

00:04:59.700  -->  00:05:02.310
That's going to bring this lesson to a close.

64

00:05:02.340  -->  00:05:07.150
I encourage you to experiment with gradient backgrounds in your own designs.

65

00:05:07.200  -->  00:05:10.280
Have fun and I will see you in the next lesson.
