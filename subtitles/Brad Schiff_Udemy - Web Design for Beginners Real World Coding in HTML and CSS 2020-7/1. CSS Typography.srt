00:00:00,620  -->  00:00:09,720
In this lesson we will learn about CSSA typography typography is the art of arranging type or text so

2

00:00:09,720  -->  00:00:14,310
that it is easy to read and supports the overall design of a project.

3

00:00:14,310  -->  00:00:21,420
By this point in the course you are fairly familiar with CSS we've seen properties like font size and

4

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:22,890
text align.

5

00:00:23,280  -->  00:00:26,650
So you've had a small taste of manipulating text.

6

00:00:26,910  -->  00:00:33,120
Well in this lesson we will learn about many more tools to style text in the exact way that we want

7

00:00:33,120  -->  00:00:33,790
.

8

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:37,270
Let's get started in front of you is an example page.

9

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:42,960
And let's imagine that we want to change the overall font that the page uses.

10

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:50,640
We know from earlier lessons that we can use the font family property to define a font stack.

11

00:00:50,650  -->  00:00:56,490
If a computer or device does not have the first font that we list it will fall back and use the next

12

00:00:56,490  -->  00:00:57,660
font.

13

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:04,380
Now a key concept in the font stack is to make sure that the last item in your list is not a font in

14

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:07,660
and of itself but is instead a keyword.

15

00:01:07,710  -->  00:01:14,400
So if a device does not have a home installed it will use this key word to use whatever system default

16

00:01:14,530  -->  00:01:17,370
Sanskrit font it wants to use.

17

00:01:17,370  -->  00:01:22,090
So one of the most common fonts stacks is to try and use Helvetica.

18

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:25,050
And if that's not available then we'll use Arial.

19

00:01:25,050  -->  00:01:30,750
And if that's not available then we'll just let the browser use whatever system defaults San Siro font

20

00:01:30,840  -->  00:01:32,700
it wants to use.

21

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:37,390
So if we save we can see that the web page is now using Helvetica.

22

00:01:37,410  -->  00:01:43,440
Now let's imagine that we didn't want to use censor fonts and we instead wanted to use Sarah fonts.

23

00:01:43,500  -->  00:01:46,360
So our first pick would probably be Georgia.

24

00:01:46,650  -->  00:01:49,620
And if that wasn't available use Times New Roman.

25

00:01:49,800  -->  00:01:54,930
And then if that's not available we'll let the browser choose whatever serifs system default font it

26

00:01:54,930  -->  00:01:57,450
would like.

27

00:01:57,450  -->  00:02:03,930
Now if you do not want to limit yourself to fonts that are installed on someone's device you can use

28

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:10,500
a technology named APH font face to use any font that you have license to use.

29

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:12,440
We will cover that in our next lesson.

30

00:02:12,600  -->  00:02:16,370
But for now let's continue reviewing basic types graphy.

31

00:02:16,590  -->  00:02:17,390
Moving on.

32

00:02:17,400  -->  00:02:22,740
We know that we can control the size of text by using the font size property.

33

00:02:22,860  -->  00:02:28,290
Now when it comes to values for this property we have many different units of measurement at our disposal

34

00:02:28,740  -->  00:02:38,490
so we can use percentages or we can use pixels of 17 pixels or we can use keywords so we could say small

35

00:02:39,960  -->  00:02:43,800
or medium.

36

00:02:43,890  -->  00:02:47,590
Now there is no right or wrong method or unit of measurement.

37

00:02:47,610  -->  00:02:53,010
They all have their own strengths and weaknesses but the key concept regardless of which route you choose

38

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:59,670
is that you define a baseline size on either your body or each human element so that it can trickle

39

00:02:59,670  -->  00:03:01,670
down to every element on your page.

40

00:03:01,860  -->  00:03:10,020
So for example if we set the body element to use 15 pixels we can see that that establishes a baseline

41

00:03:10,040  -->  00:03:10,070
.

42

00:03:10,080  -->  00:03:12,810
So that affects the entire page.

43

00:03:12,810  -->  00:03:18,510
Now if we want it to affect the size of this heading it's an H 2 element in the main call them.

44

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:21,260
We can simply select that using CSSA.

45

00:03:21,420  -->  00:03:27,990
And then we can provide a multiplier so we can say that relative to the baseline font size we want that

46

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:35,250
heading level 2 element to be 200 percent and perhaps we decide that paragraph text in the main column

47

00:03:35,460  -->  00:03:42,020
should be just a small bit larger than the baseline so we can target that with this selector.

48

00:03:42,300  -->  00:03:46,710
And then we can say font size 100 an 8 percent.

49

00:03:46,710  -->  00:03:49,400
So just a little bit larger than the baseline.

50

00:03:49,410  -->  00:03:55,590
Now again there is no right or wrong way to size your fonts but the key concept that almost every method

51

00:03:55,590  -->  00:04:01,950
has in common is that you define a baseline size on one of the root elements of the page and then you

52

00:04:01,950  -->  00:04:07,940
multiply or manipulate that baseline size on different elements throughout the page.

53

00:04:07,950  -->  00:04:10,800
That's enough on font size for the moment.

54

00:04:10,800  -->  00:04:19,290
Now let's review other CSSA properties to manage the boldness of text we can use the font weight property

55

00:04:19,310  -->  00:04:19,530
.

56

00:04:19,770  -->  00:04:27,750
So if we didn't want this Heading to be bold we can say bont way normal if we wanted the Heading to

57

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:38,040
be italic we can use a property named font style and provide a value of italic if we want to control

58

00:04:38,040  -->  00:04:42,090
the space between each individual letter.

59

00:04:42,090  -->  00:04:49,080
We can use a property named letter spacing and then we simply specified how much space we want between

60

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:49,840
each letter.

61

00:04:50,040  -->  00:04:57,360
So if I say four pixels there is now four pixels of extra space between each letter on a similar note

62

00:04:57,420  -->  00:05:04,110
if we want to control the spacing between each word there is a property named word spacing.

63

00:05:04,170  -->  00:05:09,760
So if I say 10 pixels there's an extra 10 pixels between each word.

64

00:05:09,990  -->  00:05:18,750
If we want to add a shadow to text we can use a property named text shadow this property except for

65

00:05:18,810  -->  00:05:19,770
values.

66

00:05:19,860  -->  00:05:26,610
The first value controls the horizontal offset of the chateau or in other words how far from the left

67

00:05:26,640  -->  00:05:33,090
of the regular text the shadow text should sit the second volume controls the vertical offset of the

68

00:05:33,090  -->  00:05:34,070
shadow.

69

00:05:34,080  -->  00:05:37,480
The third value controls the blur radius.

70

00:05:37,680  -->  00:05:41,030
If we include a zero The text will not be blurred at all.

71

00:05:41,280  -->  00:05:44,990
And the fourth value controls the color of the shadow.

72

00:05:45,420  -->  00:05:50,250
So I will include a hexadecimal color code for a medium grey.

73

00:05:51,320  -->  00:05:58,410
So if we increase this third value the blur radius value to 3 pixels we can see the text is a bit blurred

74

00:05:58,410  -->  00:05:58,780
.

75

00:05:59,040  -->  00:06:03,180
And if we increase this quite a bit it's very blurred.

76

00:06:03,540  -->  00:06:08,170
We can also use a R-GA color instead of a hexadecimal color code.

77

00:06:08,580  -->  00:06:13,690
So I could use the code for black and then set the transparency to 50 percent.

78

00:06:14,160  -->  00:06:16,700
And we can see if we get a similar effect.

79

00:06:16,860  -->  00:06:22,740
Moving on if we wanted this header to use all capital letters without editing the T.

80

00:06:22,740  -->  00:06:30,780
Now we can use a property named text transform and provide a value of uppercase.

81

00:06:31,050  -->  00:06:39,330
The property also accepts a value of a lower case if we want Tex to have an underline we can use a property

82

00:06:39,390  -->  00:06:43,890
named text decoration and provided a value of underline.

83

00:06:43,890  -->  00:06:50,970
However you should not do this because in the context of web browsers and web pages we automatically

84

00:06:50,970  -->  00:06:54,330
assume that underline means something is a link.

85

00:06:54,480  -->  00:06:58,370
So I recommend not adding that to any elements other than links.

86

00:06:58,380  -->  00:07:06,030
However if you wanted to remove the underline from a link we can simply target link elements on the

87

00:07:06,030  -->  00:07:10,090
page and type in text decoration.

88

00:07:10,590  -->  00:07:11,690
None.

89

00:07:12,090  -->  00:07:15,220
And that will remove underlines from an element.

90

00:07:15,240  -->  00:07:20,080
Now let's focus a bit on styling the paragraphs of our page.

91

00:07:20,130  -->  00:07:24,650
We can control the way that text is aligned using the text align property.

92

00:07:24,840  -->  00:07:33,720
So if we say right text will sit to the right center obviously center the text justify will create almost

93

00:07:33,780  -->  00:07:39,420
a newspaper column effect where the text is perfectly spaced per line to create a hard and clean edge

94

00:07:39,420  -->  00:07:40,210
on the right.

95

00:07:40,470  -->  00:07:44,580
And obviously the default value for text line is left.

96

00:07:44,580  -->  00:07:50,550
If you want to indent the beginning of a paragraph you can use a property named text indent.

97

00:07:50,550  -->  00:07:56,490
Actually you can use this on any element not just a paragraph and then specify how much you would like

98

00:07:56,490  -->  00:07:57,730
to end in.

99

00:07:57,960  -->  00:08:04,740
Now I've saved arguably one of the most vital properties for last one of the most important parts of

100

00:08:04,740  -->  00:08:11,670
typography is creating a vertical rhythm and a very important part of vertical rhythm is line spacing

101

00:08:11,700  -->  00:08:12,680
or letting.

102

00:08:12,840  -->  00:08:17,370
This refers to the space between each line of text.

103

00:08:17,400  -->  00:08:20,800
Now in CSSA there is a property named line height.

104

00:08:21,120  -->  00:08:28,770
So I give this a value of 1.5 you can see that there is extra space between each line.

105

00:08:28,770  -->  00:08:34,950
Now obviously we can target individual elements so this rule targeting paragraphs in the main column

106

00:08:34,950  -->  00:08:35,480
.

107

00:08:35,550  -->  00:08:43,350
Or you can target the HVM our body elements so that this will trickle down to your entire page so that

108

00:08:43,350  -->  00:08:46,980
you can establish a baseline line height.

109

00:08:47,730  -->  00:08:55,230
If we include this here now we can see that even in our Sidebar in our heading everywhere the entire

110

00:08:55,230  -->  00:08:59,350
page now has leading or a line height of 1.5.

111

00:08:59,490  -->  00:09:02,610
We want to increase this a bit we can say 1.7.

112

00:09:03,030  -->  00:09:08,970
It's up to you to choose a value that works with your design and will also provide excellent readability

113

00:09:09,090  -->  00:09:10,730
for your users.

114

00:09:10,770  -->  00:09:14,860
That's going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson.

115

00:09:14,880  -->  00:09:22,020
We will learn how to not be limited by fonts that are installed on a user's device but instead unbought

116

00:09:22,020  -->  00:09:26,790
the potential to use any font that you have the license to use.

117

00:09:26,820  -->  00:09:29,080
I will see you in the next lesson.
