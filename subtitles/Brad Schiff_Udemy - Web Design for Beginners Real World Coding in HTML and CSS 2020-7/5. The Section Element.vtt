00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:06.890
In this lesson we will learn about the H TMLC element named S..

2

00:00:07.170  -->  00:00:14.640
So we know that the div or division element can be used as a generic container and we know that the

3

00:00:14.730  -->  00:00:19.530
article element can be used for a standalone coherent piece of content.

4

00:00:19.530  -->  00:00:23.310
So where does the section element come into play.

5

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:32.040
You can think of sections as chapters or in other words we can break up an overall piece of content

6

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:35.800
into smaller sections or subsections.

7

00:00:36.030  -->  00:00:39.710
So here's an example page and this is the book title.

8

00:00:39.780  -->  00:00:41.930
This is chapter one.

9

00:00:42.060  -->  00:00:45.070
This is chapter two and this is chapter 3.

10

00:00:45.340  -->  00:00:52.830
So as you might expect if we look at the Code Chapter 1 The heading in paragraph element live within

11

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:55.720
a section element.

12

00:00:55.740  -->  00:00:58.890
Now this section element is doing two things for us.

13

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:06.810
Number one it's creating semantic meaning or hierarchy in structure amongst our content and number two

14

00:01:06.930  -->  00:01:13.970
when we eventually learn how to add style to our page with CSS we can target section elements.

15

00:01:14.220  -->  00:01:18.590
So perhaps we can add borders between the different chapters.

16

00:01:18.720  -->  00:01:21.820
So that is the section element in a nutshell.

17

00:01:21.830  -->  00:01:28.980
It's fairly straightforward but I do want to point out that we can nest one section inside another section

18

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:29.490
.

19

00:01:29.490  -->  00:01:36.600
So for example here is Chapter 2 and if we look at the HTL code for this area we can see this is where

20

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:39.760
Chapter 2 begins.

21

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:41.170
This is where it ends.

22

00:01:41.220  -->  00:01:48.810
And within Chapter Two there's an additional subsection and we see that represented here in the browser

23

00:01:48.810  -->  00:01:49.470
.

24

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:56.340
Now the reason that I'm bringing up sections within sections or subsections is because it changes the

25

00:01:56.340  -->  00:02:00.910
way we view the H-1 through age 6 elements.

26

00:02:00.930  -->  00:02:07.170
Now if we look at the headings on this example page at least visually it seems as though this is an

27

00:02:07.170  -->  00:02:09.380
age when this is an age too.

28

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:16.320
This is an age too this is an age 3 and this is an age too but in reality if we look at the age TNL

29

00:02:16.320  -->  00:02:25.170
code we can see that every heading on the page even the heading in this subsection is using the H one

30

00:02:25.170  -->  00:02:26.000
element.

31

00:02:26.370  -->  00:02:33.700
So this means that when we would traditionally use the H1 h to h h four elements to create a structure

32

00:02:33.930  -->  00:02:42.060
or a hierarchy of importance we can alternatively rely on the section element to create that same sense

33

00:02:42.150  -->  00:02:50.430
of structure and hierarchy or in other words an H1 heading that lives within a section is the mathematical

34

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:57.660
equivalent of an H2 element that didn't live in a section or we can say that in each one element that

35

00:02:57.660  -->  00:03:04.530
lives within a section that lives within a section is equivalent to an H three element that doesn't

36

00:03:04.530  -->  00:03:06.750
live in any sections.

37

00:03:06.750  -->  00:03:07.760
So on and so forth.

38

00:03:07.770  -->  00:03:18.850
So we could theoretically create an additional section within this subsection example tie it all here

39

00:03:18.850  -->  00:03:19.600
.

40

00:03:20.070  -->  00:03:29.070
Create a bit of dummy text and we see that this new heading is equivalent to what an H for element would

41

00:03:29.070  -->  00:03:32.430
look like if it wasn't in any sort of section.

42

00:03:32.430  -->  00:03:35.800
Now I realize this is quickly becoming quite confusing.

43

00:03:36.090  -->  00:03:41.910
So I will put an end to this discussion by saying that if you search the web for an answer on whether

44

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:49.170
you should use sections and subsections or whether you should just use H-1 through age 6 you will find

45

00:03:49.170  -->  00:03:51.000
many different answers.

46

00:03:51.300  -->  00:03:57.780
Everyone has a different opinion on how you should structure your page and I've seen excellent arguments

47

00:03:57.960  -->  00:03:59.730
for all different sides.

48

00:03:59.760  -->  00:04:06.360
I will say this as long as you choose a method to create hierarchy amongst your content to create organization

49

00:04:06.360  -->  00:04:10.290
and structure and are consistent with that structure.

50

00:04:10.350  -->  00:04:16.440
I believe that you will be fine at the end of the day all that matters is that your content is accessible

51

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:23.340
has semantic meaning and makes sense from a document outline perspective or a bird's eye view or a table

52

00:04:23.340  -->  00:04:30.020
of contents vantage point because again each DML and web browsers change over time.

53

00:04:30.210  -->  00:04:34.790
But the art of organizing and structuring content is timeless.

54

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:40.910
Which is why I often used metaphors to printed books even if that makes me sound like a dinosaur.

55

00:04:41.040  -->  00:04:44.680
Making sure that our content is easy to digest is very important.

56

00:04:44.970  -->  00:04:47.260
So I will see you in the next lesson.
