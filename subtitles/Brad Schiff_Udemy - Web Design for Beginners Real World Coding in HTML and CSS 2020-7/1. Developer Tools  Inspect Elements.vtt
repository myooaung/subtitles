00:00:00.420  -->  00:00:05.760
In this lesson will be learning about your web browsers developer tools.

2

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:12.570
More specifically we will be taking a look at your browser's ability to inspect elements.

3

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:18.840
By the end of this lesson you will understand how invaluable it is to be able to inspect an element

4

00:00:18.900  -->  00:00:24.360
with your browser's developer tools and you may actually be frustrated that I didn't show you this earlier

5

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:27.300
but trust me there's a method to my madness.

6

00:00:27.300  -->  00:00:33.270
I wanted to make sure that you had a solid understanding of CSSA basics before introducing you to any

7

00:00:33.270  -->  00:00:34.510
new tools.

8

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:38.370
By this point in the course you have more than enough knowledge.

9

00:00:38.400  -->  00:00:40.770
So let's dive right in.

10

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:47.970
In every modern web browser you can right click on any element on the page and select inspect element

11

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:49.230
.

12

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:53.180
This will pool up your developer tools in Inspector mode.

13

00:00:53.190  -->  00:00:56.550
Now this will look a bit different depending on the browser you're using.

14

00:00:56.550  -->  00:01:00.970
I'm using Firefox Google Chromes and Specter is very similar.

15

00:01:01.230  -->  00:01:05.940
You'll see on the left side a bird's eye view of your age TMLC structure.

16

00:01:05.940  -->  00:01:10.140
Now we originally right clicked on the sidebar text and clicked inspect element.

17

00:01:10.140  -->  00:01:16.500
So by default that paragraph is selected and on the right side of our developer to a window we can see

18

00:01:16.620  -->  00:01:23.160
all of the properties of the styles associated with that paragraph of text with the element that's selected

19

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:23.430
.

20

00:01:23.550  -->  00:01:27.870
So we can see that there is a rule targeting the side bar and that's where it's getting its font size

21

00:01:27.870  -->  00:01:28.240
.

22

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:32.710
We can see that it is receiving its font family trickle down from the body element.

23

00:01:32.970  -->  00:01:38.100
We can see that it's receiving its line height or line spacing trickled down from the HVM metal element

24

00:01:38.910  -->  00:01:42.740
and we can override or customize these values on the fly.

25

00:01:43.110  -->  00:01:47.670
So this rule with saying sidebar text should have a font size of 85 percent.

26

00:01:47.790  -->  00:01:52.440
We can simply click on that and use the arrow keys on our keyboard or even just type in a new value

27

00:01:52.490  -->  00:01:52.770
.

28

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:59.580
So I can bump this up to ninety five percent for any value that we want and you can see it's updating

29

00:01:59.580  -->  00:02:02.760
in real time behind the developer tool window.

30

00:02:02.790  -->  00:02:07.200
So let's imagine that we decide 114 percent looks excellent.

31

00:02:07.200  -->  00:02:12.690
Now the developer tools on its own won't save that change for us and as soon as we reload the page it

32

00:02:12.690  -->  00:02:16.620
reverts back to before we even launched developer tools.

33

00:02:16.620  -->  00:02:23.860
But you'll notice that developer tools tells us where in our stylesheet this rule is located.

34

00:02:24.000  -->  00:02:31.670
So it's telling us it's in this file on line number 173 so we can go over to our stylesheet.

35

00:02:31.920  -->  00:02:36.700
Scroll down the line 173 we know the exact line to go to.

36

00:02:36.840  -->  00:02:38.160
Here it is.

37

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:43.650
And we know that 114 percent is what looked perfect in the web browser refresh.

38

00:02:43.650  -->  00:02:44.970
And there you have it.

39

00:02:45.180  -->  00:02:50.310
Now on the surface that may not appear to be very impressive but believe me as your web sites become

40

00:02:50.310  -->  00:02:56.670
more and more complex it's invaluable to be able to trace down where a certain property is trickling

41

00:02:56.670  -->  00:02:57.800
down from.

42

00:02:57.900  -->  00:03:03.600
At times you wonder is this style coming from a direct selector or is it being inherited by a parent

43

00:03:03.600  -->  00:03:04.260
element.

44

00:03:04.320  -->  00:03:10.830
And as you can see the inspector makes it very simple to track down which properties are coming from

45

00:03:10.840  -->  00:03:12.540
which rules.

46

00:03:13.200  -->  00:03:18.630
Another neat feature of the inspector is this left pane that shows you a bird's eye view of your HMO

47

00:03:18.630  -->  00:03:19.680
structure.

48

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:26.220
It can be hovered over with your mouse and they will outline in the browser behind it the element that

49

00:03:26.220  -->  00:03:27.350
you're hovering over.

50

00:03:27.540  -->  00:03:33.310
So if I hoover over body it highlights the entire page if I highlight over header shows it's the header

51

00:03:33.660  -->  00:03:37.360
and then I can click on one of these arrows to drill down inside the header.

52

00:03:37.640  -->  00:03:40.920
So if I hover over the heading there you go there's the paragraph.

53

00:03:41.040  -->  00:03:45.140
We can drill down into the nav drill down into the unordered list.

54

00:03:45.290  -->  00:03:47.730
You can see there's a list item for each link.

55

00:03:47.800  -->  00:03:54.030
We can even drill down into one of the list items to find the actual link element and we can see all

56

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:59.280
of the properties that are assigned to the link elements we can see all of the properties that are trickling

57

00:03:59.280  -->  00:04:01.440
down from ancestor elements.

58

00:04:01.620  -->  00:04:06.540
And if we wanted to any of these properties like padding we can simply click on it and then type in

59

00:04:06.630  -->  00:04:07.530
any value we want.

60

00:04:07.530  -->  00:04:13.260
And it will update on the fly or we can even add new declarations entirely.

61

00:04:13.260  -->  00:04:18.990
So if you click towards the end of a row you can see that it the cursor down here and we can say text

62

00:04:19.080  -->  00:04:22.950
transform uppercase.

63

00:04:23.130  -->  00:04:28.410
You can see updates on the fly in some browsers to add a new declaration on the fly you might need to

64

00:04:28.410  -->  00:04:33.480
right click and click new declaration and others you can click towards the bottom of the room.

65

00:04:33.900  -->  00:04:38.290
Now again as soon as you reload the page all of your changes will be gone.

66

00:04:38.520  -->  00:04:44.850
But when you're trying to experiment or troubleshoot the ability to add things on the fly is completely

67

00:04:44.850  -->  00:04:46.160
invaluable.

68

00:04:46.170  -->  00:04:51.510
So we've established that your browser's inspector tool is amazing for tracking down where properties

69

00:04:51.510  -->  00:04:52.710
are coming from.

70

00:04:52.710  -->  00:04:56.660
It's excellent for experimenting or troubleshooting.

71

00:04:56.760  -->  00:05:02.220
And finally I want to point out how amazing it is for getting inspiration from other sites.

72

00:05:02.370  -->  00:05:08.100
So for example if you visit a Web site and you see an amazing effect they have a really neat layout

73

00:05:08.120  -->  00:05:08.360
.

74

00:05:08.460  -->  00:05:13.530
You see an element that's positioned in a neat way where you see any type of styling that you want to

75

00:05:13.530  -->  00:05:14.860
try and emulate.

76

00:05:14.880  -->  00:05:18.930
You can simply right click anywhere on the page or on a specific element.

77

00:05:18.960  -->  00:05:24.090
Poke around a bit in the inspector and try and get a feel for which properties and values they're using

78

00:05:24.090  -->  00:05:28.470
where they're assigning them how different elements are relating to one another.

79

00:05:28.530  -->  00:05:33.660
The inspector can be one of your biggest allies in learning more and more complex.

80

00:05:35.070  -->  00:05:39.600
I encourage you to play around with some of your favorite Web sites and take a peek under their hoods

81

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:40.180
.

82

00:05:40.590  -->  00:05:43.440
Have fun and I will see you in the next lesson
