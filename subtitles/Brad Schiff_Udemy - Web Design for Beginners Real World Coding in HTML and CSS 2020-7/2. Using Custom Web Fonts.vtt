00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:06.110
In this lesson we will learn how to use custom fonts in our web pages.

2

00:00:06.360  -->  00:00:13.620
So for example we as designers may have fonts installed on our computers that we love and we may want

3

00:00:13.620  -->  00:00:16.430
to use those fonts in our web pages.

4

00:00:16.610  -->  00:00:23.200
However if a visitor of our Web site does not also have that font installed they will not see that font

5

00:00:23.200  -->  00:00:23.220
.

6

00:00:23.220  -->  00:00:27.850
And instead their web browser will fall back to use a system default font.

7

00:00:28.200  -->  00:00:34.860
Well in this lesson we will learn how to sidestep that limitation by embedding font files into our web

8

00:00:34.860  -->  00:00:39.600
pages in a way that browsers can easily download and use.

9

00:00:39.930  -->  00:00:45.780
And this will allow us to use any font in our web pages that we have the proper licensing to use.

10

00:00:46.020  -->  00:00:47.620
Let's get started.

11

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:52.950
There are different approaches to embedding font files into your pages but I think they can all be broken

12

00:00:52.950  -->  00:00:54.900
down into two categories.

13

00:00:54.930  -->  00:00:58.830
The first category we will call hosted solutions.

14

00:00:58.830  -->  00:01:04.560
Examples of this would be Adobe's type kid or Google fonts.

15

00:01:04.590  -->  00:01:10.170
These services will provide you with a code snippet that you can copy and then paste into the header

16

00:01:10.170  -->  00:01:13.010
section of your website.

17

00:01:13.020  -->  00:01:18.000
These services will do all of the heavy lifting and the code that they give you to paste into your head

18

00:01:18.000  -->  00:01:21.450
section will reference files that live on their server.

19

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:28.740
So then literally all that you will need to do is use the font name in your font family CSSA declarations

20

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:29.520
.

21

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:32.820
Now these hosted font solutions are so easy to use.

22

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:36.760
We're not going to cover them in this lesson because really there's nothing to review.

23

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:41.940
Now the second category we will call self-hosted fonts.

24

00:01:41.970  -->  00:01:48.750
This is where the font files live on our server and we need to manage those files and link to those

25

00:01:48.750  -->  00:01:51.070
files in our CSSA code.

26

00:01:51.300  -->  00:01:52.830
It's a little bit more tricky.

27

00:01:52.830  -->  00:01:56.420
So the rest of this lesson is going to be reviewing that process.

28

00:01:56.610  -->  00:01:58.480
Let's dive right in.

29

00:01:58.500  -->  00:02:06.240
There is a font named P-T sans that I enjoy using in my designs is a freely available font and its license

30

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.500
lets anyone use it on their pages.

31

00:02:08.700  -->  00:02:13.500
So I downloaded the P-T Sans font from a Web site named squirrel.

32

00:02:13.500  -->  00:02:20.580
Now typically when you download a font it will include a regular version a bold version and italic version

33

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:23.190
and a bold italic version.

34

00:02:23.280  -->  00:02:27.910
Let's begin with the regular non ball non italic version.

35

00:02:28.380  -->  00:02:33.990
Now you can see that there are four files and you may be wondering why isn't there just one file.

36

00:02:33.990  -->  00:02:40.560
All four of these are the same exact identical font however different web browsers and different devices

37

00:02:40.560  -->  00:02:42.460
need different formats.

38

00:02:42.660  -->  00:02:48.630
So we can see that these four files have the same name Peetie hyphen sand's but this one ends in EOT

39

00:02:49.110  -->  00:02:49.370
.

40

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:54.700
This one ends in Dot SVG dot TTF dot WOFF.

41

00:02:55.020  -->  00:03:00.890
So if you have a font that you're licensed to use and let's imagine that you only have the TTL version

42

00:03:01.260  -->  00:03:07.350
you'll need to find a web font generator that can automatically convert that file into all of these

43

00:03:07.350  -->  00:03:08.870
different formats.

44

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:15.540
I recommend you perform a web search for Fonte squirrel and then look for the web font generator page

45

00:03:15.540  -->  00:03:15.820
.

46

00:03:15.840  -->  00:03:22.440
So once we've chosen a font and we have the four most popular file formats for the font we need to move

47

00:03:22.440  -->  00:03:26.560
these files into the same folder as were our Web page libs.

48

00:03:26.940  -->  00:03:31.690
So this is where our example page lives index dot HTML.

49

00:03:31.710  -->  00:03:37.410
This is the example page we've seen in earlier lessons and we know that we have a CSSA folder with our

50

00:03:37.410  -->  00:03:39.210
CSSA file.

51

00:03:39.210  -->  00:03:46.240
Now in order to stay organized I'm going to create a folder within our CSSA folder named fonts and I'm

52

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:54.660
going to move over the P-T Sans font files in to this newly created fonts folder with these files in

53

00:03:54.660  -->  00:03:55.150
place.

54

00:03:55.170  -->  00:04:01.730
Let's hop over to the text editor and begin writing a bit of CSSA code so I will create a commented

55

00:04:01.760  -->  00:04:03.540
section to stay organized.

56

00:04:03.700  -->  00:04:05.400
Custom fonts

57

00:04:08.250  -->  00:04:12.670
so all of our custom font code will be placed between this line and this line.

58

00:04:12.840  -->  00:04:18.360
So the first thing we're going to do is include the at sign and then font face.

59

00:04:18.360  -->  00:04:23.750
Now this code syntax looks like a typical CSSA rule that we've seen in the course.

60

00:04:23.740  -->  00:04:26.650
However this is not a traditional selector.

61

00:04:26.670  -->  00:04:29.740
We're not selecting anything on the page to style.

62

00:04:29.790  -->  00:04:40.650
Instead we are defining a font so within the brackets will save font family Peetie sans or whatever

63

00:04:40.650  -->  00:04:46.350
the name of your font is on the next line of code source.

64

00:04:46.380  -->  00:04:52.230
This is where we point the web browser to those font files that we just moved in to the newly created

65

00:04:52.230  -->  00:04:53.210
Fonts folder.

66

00:04:54.190  -->  00:05:01.090
The first file that I will link to is the wharf that w o f f extension because it's the most upcoming

67

00:05:01.080  -->  00:05:06.460
emerging fund standard so I'll copy and paste the names that have having to remember the exact spelling

68

00:05:07.260  -->  00:05:09.890
you Arel quotes.

69

00:05:09.950  -->  00:05:13.770
We will begin by typing the name of the folder that we know the file lives in.

70

00:05:13.770  -->  00:05:20.650
We know that it lives in the fonts subfolder so fonts and then forward slash and them will paste in

71

00:05:20.640  -->  00:05:22.230
the name of the file.

72

00:05:22.420  -->  00:05:29.800
Then outside of these parentheses will say format and we know that the format is was.

73

00:05:29.920  -->  00:05:33.330
Finally we know that this is not the bulled or the Italic version.

74

00:05:33.330  -->  00:05:40.590
This is just the normal standard version so will say font weight is normal and font style is not italic

75

00:05:40.620  -->  00:05:48.720
but just normal with this code in place and with the font file in place we can now use this font name

76

00:05:48.750  -->  00:05:56.160
PT Sans in our CSS So our body element is currently telling the page to use the George Afon which we

77

00:05:56.170  -->  00:05:57.250
can see here.

78

00:05:57.570  -->  00:06:03.840
But let's remove this and take our PT Sans font for a spin Peetie Sans.

79

00:06:03.880  -->  00:06:08.560
If that's not available for some reason maybe the download fails we'll use Arial.

80

00:06:08.680  -->  00:06:13.960
If that's not available we use the system default sand Serrefine Now before we see even refresh.

81

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:18.630
I should point out that this code where we're defining the font and pointing to the font files.

82

00:06:18.720  -->  00:06:23.150
This should actually be placed before we reference the font name.

83

00:06:23.170  -->  00:06:27.630
So I'm just going to cut and paste that code to sit at the top of our stylesheet.

84

00:06:27.850  -->  00:06:34.370
So if we save and refresh we can see that the browser is now successfully using the custom font.

85

00:06:34.720  -->  00:06:41.040
However our job is not complete because even though this font will work in the newest version of Firefox

86

00:06:41.110  -->  00:06:47.370
and the newest version of chrome older browsers and other touchscreen devices will not be able to load

87

00:06:47.560  -->  00:06:50.020
the W O F F version.

88

00:06:50.190  -->  00:06:52.660
So this is where the code gets a little bit trickier.

89

00:06:52.650  -->  00:06:56.320
We now need to link to these other three formats as well.

90

00:06:56.400  -->  00:06:57.280
In our code.

91

00:06:57.610  -->  00:07:02.220
So instead of boring you with this code I'm just going to paste it in and explain it.

92

00:07:02.230  -->  00:07:08.710
We now have two source declarations the first simply links to the OT version of the font and this is

93

00:07:08.710  -->  00:07:11.040
for Internet Explorer 9.

94

00:07:11.070  -->  00:07:18.970
Our second source declaration has paths to all four font formats so this will work in older versions

95

00:07:18.970  -->  00:07:20.460
of Internet Explorer.

96

00:07:20.790  -->  00:07:28.080
This is the WAF version that will work in the latest browsers and devices TGF which will work in slightly

97

00:07:28.090  -->  00:07:34.270
older devices and SPG which will work for certain touchscreen or mobile devices.

98

00:07:34.360  -->  00:07:39.900
Now in this second sort declaration where we're linking to multiple formats after we're done pointing

99

00:07:39.900  -->  00:07:45.690
the browser to one file we simply include a comma and then we can link to the next file so on and so

100

00:07:45.690  -->  00:07:46.640
forth.

101

00:07:46.720  -->  00:07:50.240
So we now have rock solid support for this font.

102

00:07:50.250  -->  00:07:54.840
This will work in the widest range of browsers and devices.

103

00:07:54.880  -->  00:07:58.430
However we will only set up the regular version of the fun.

104

00:07:58.600  -->  00:08:02.190
What if we want the font to be bold or italic.

105

00:08:02.380  -->  00:08:07.430
You will see in the page that the web browser is trying to make the text bold here.

106

00:08:07.720  -->  00:08:13.400
It's trying to make the text italic here and it's trying to make the text both bold and italic here

107

00:08:13.930  -->  00:08:19.680
but if you zoom in and look very closely you can tell that it doesn't look quite right.

108

00:08:19.690  -->  00:08:26.860
This is because the web browser is trying to use the base regular font and it's artificially manipulating

109

00:08:26.860  -->  00:08:28.560
the font to be bold or italic.

110

00:08:28.620  -->  00:08:30.240
That's not ideal.

111

00:08:30.250  -->  00:08:36.700
We want to provide a dedicated font file that a font designer has created to appear bold or to appear

112

00:08:36.690  -->  00:08:37.650
italic.

113

00:08:37.770  -->  00:08:44.250
So all we need to do is add additional font face rules in our stylesheet for the different bold and

114

00:08:44.250  -->  00:08:46.060
italic variations.

115

00:08:46.060  -->  00:08:48.500
First let's add the bold font.

116

00:08:48.610  -->  00:08:52.520
So here are our font files that are in the website directory.

117

00:08:52.530  -->  00:08:55.570
Here are all of the font files that we downloaded.

118

00:08:55.570  -->  00:08:57.150
So here's the bold folder.

119

00:08:57.180  -->  00:09:02.040
So I'm just going to move over the bold files and all the different formats.

120

00:09:02.350  -->  00:09:06.320
Now we need a link to those new bulled files in our stylesheet.

121

00:09:06.630  -->  00:09:11.350
So will create a new font face rule font family.

122

00:09:11.350  -->  00:09:17.380
We want to be the exact same name PTSans only. We're going to include different source files.

123

00:09:17.380  -->  00:09:23.940
Now now instead of boring you by typing in all of this code I'm going to paste in a bit of code and

124

00:09:23.940  -->  00:09:29.700
it's simply pointing to the new bold files that we just moved into the folder.

125

00:09:30.150  -->  00:09:36.340
Now the key to our new rule is to make sure that we specify that this is font weight.

126

00:09:36.340  -->  00:09:44.770
Bold and font style normal so this font face rule is very similar to the first one that we created except

127

00:09:44.760  -->  00:09:51.180
for pointing towards different files that are the bold files and then we're specifying that it's bold

128

00:09:51.210  -->  00:09:52.960
but not italic.

129

00:09:53.050  -->  00:09:55.180
So now if we save and refresh.

130

00:09:55.170  -->  00:10:02.530
I want you to look very closely to this text that I'm highlighting now through a video file you may

131

00:10:02.520  -->  00:10:06.870
not be able to see the difference or the change might have been very subtle but believe me if you're

132

00:10:06.880  -->  00:10:11.130
using a high quality screen to view web page you will see the difference.

133

00:10:11.130  -->  00:10:15.120
The font is much smoother and it's a very beautiful board effect.

134

00:10:15.120  -->  00:10:22.480
So all that remains now is that we need to do the same thing for italic and bold italic text so all

135

00:10:22.480  -->  00:10:29.400
that I'm going to do is find the place that we download the files to and I'm just going to move over

136

00:10:29.830  -->  00:10:36.540
the files for italic and move over the files for bold italic.

137

00:10:37.290  -->  00:10:40.080
So this folder is quite messy and clean it up a bit.

138

00:10:40.200  -->  00:10:46.150
So now we're just going to head over to our CSSA and create two additional font based rules one for

139

00:10:46.140  -->  00:10:52.300
italic and one for bold italic font face.

140

00:10:52.330  -->  00:10:57.360
I will paste in the source lines in just a moment but let's get the skeleton set up first.

141

00:10:57.490  -->  00:10:58.740
Font family.

142

00:10:58.920  -->  00:11:10.720
We want the same name PT Sans font weight normal but font style italic and then we want one that is

143

00:11:10.710  -->  00:11:11.730
both font weight.

144

00:11:11.740  -->  00:11:14.870
Bold and font style italic.

145

00:11:14.940  -->  00:11:18.880
So at this point now I will just paste in the relevant source lines.

146

00:11:18.880  -->  00:11:25.360
Here are the lines for the italic and here are the lines for the bold italic.

147

00:11:25.650  -->  00:11:33.770
So if we save and refresh pay attention to this text and this text they look quite a bit better.

148

00:11:34.260  -->  00:11:39.850
And that concludes the process of embedding custom fonts into your style sheets.

149

00:11:39.880  -->  00:11:43.400
Feel free to apply custom fonts however you see fit.

150

00:11:43.410  -->  00:11:49.020
Maybe you want to leave a traditional font like Arial for the base line text and then only use your

151

00:11:49.020  -->  00:11:51.350
custom fonts for headings.

152

00:11:51.370  -->  00:11:53.010
It's up to you.

153

00:11:53.050  -->  00:11:57.880
You are also free to include as many different custom fonts as you would like.

154

00:11:57.880  -->  00:12:02.370
However I will include the two following morning's number one.
