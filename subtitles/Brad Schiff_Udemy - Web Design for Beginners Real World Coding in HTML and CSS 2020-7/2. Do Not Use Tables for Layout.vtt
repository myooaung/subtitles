00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:06.030
In our previous lesson we learned how to create tables with HMO.

2

00:00:06.090  -->  00:00:12.570
Now before our previous lesson all of the content that we had viewed in the web browser simply stacked

3

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:19.530
on top of one another or in other words the table marked the first time that we saw content sitting

4

00:00:19.530  -->  00:00:21.840
side by side one another.

5

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:29.930
So some of you may be salivating thinking to yourself you can use tables to create multi column layouts

6

00:00:29.980  -->  00:00:30.350
.

7

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:33.080
Well let me stop you in your tracks.

8

00:00:33.090  -->  00:00:35.280
Please do not do that.

9

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:40.140
That would be abusing the table element and the storied history of H.

10

00:00:40.170  -->  00:00:47.940
DML has already seen the dark ages where people mis used the table element for layout purposes but don't

11

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:55.680
worry we've moved past the dark ages and now everyone knows that we use C S S to add layout and style

12

00:00:55.680  -->  00:00:56.910
to our pages.

13

00:00:57.270  -->  00:01:01.080
So if you have a list of data and each item has multiple properties.

14

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:03.930
By all means use the table elements.

15

00:01:03.960  -->  00:01:05.570
That's what they're there for.

16

00:01:05.790  -->  00:01:10.620
But if you're simply trying to lay out your content in a particular way and create multiple columns

17

00:01:10.620  -->  00:01:12.730
or add spacing here in there.

18

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:21.030
Know that tables are not the answer but we will begin learning about the answer see SS in the very next

19

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:22.180
lesson.

20

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:29.110
So to review if you use tables for layout the gods of HTML will strike you down dead in your path.

21

00:01:29.140  -->  00:01:34.560
In other news you should give yourself a pat on the back because you've completed the H TMLC portion

22

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:36.870
of the course or in other words.

23

00:01:36.900  -->  00:01:38.930
The fun is about to begin.

24

00:01:38.950  -->  00:01:42.630
C Ss is how we add the design to web design.

25

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:46.280
It's going to be a lot of fun and I will see you in the next lesson.
