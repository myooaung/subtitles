00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:07.530
In this section of the course we will learn about the HTL elements that allow us to add media to our

2

00:00:07.530  -->  00:00:08.960
web pages.

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:14.930
In this particular lesson we will learn how to add an image to a web page.

4

00:00:14.930  -->  00:00:18.520
Here is an example page from an earlier lesson in the course.

5

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:20.080
Let's give ourselves a goal.

6

00:00:20.100  -->  00:00:24.180
Let's imagine that we want to add an image to this page.

7

00:00:24.270  -->  00:00:30.240
I have a jpeg or an image file on my desktop named life on the tracks and here's what it looks like

8

00:00:30.240  -->  00:00:31.840
.

9

00:00:32.280  -->  00:00:38.550
The first thing that I am going to do is move this file the jpeg of the image into the same folder as

10

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:40.790
where are each DML file lives.

11

00:00:41.010  -->  00:00:47.330
So we can see that my index on H DML is in the same directory as the JPEG.

12

00:00:47.370  -->  00:00:53.010
Now that we have selected an image to add to our page and we've made sure that it's in the correct directory

13

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:53.310
.

14

00:00:53.310  -->  00:00:56.040
Let's hop over to our text editor.

15

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:00.320
Let's imagine that we want to include the image after this paragraph.

16

00:01:00.620  -->  00:01:09.240
So we'll create a new element the code for image is I am g now with most other elements in HTML for

17

00:01:09.240  -->  00:01:14.970
the sake of organization we are encouraged to include a closing tag but with the image element we do

18

00:01:14.970  -->  00:01:16.500
not need this at all.

19

00:01:16.500  -->  00:01:20.240
In fact the only thing that we need with an image is a few attributes.

20

00:01:20.400  -->  00:01:23.650
The first attribute is source s r c.

21

00:01:23.880  -->  00:01:29.170
This attribute lets the web browser know where to look to find the image file.

22

00:01:29.250  -->  00:01:35.040
Now because we included the image in the same directory as our HTML file it's as simple as typing in

23

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:38.930
the name of the JPEG. Live on the tracks.

24

00:01:38.950  -->  00:01:41.580
Dot J P. G.

25

00:01:41.580  -->  00:01:47.790
Now if we save and be fresh our page in the web browser we can see that our image has been added to

26

00:01:47.790  -->  00:01:49.040
the page.

27

00:01:49.060  -->  00:01:51.410
However our task is not complete.

28

00:01:51.450  -->  00:01:57.470
We still need to add another attribute named Allt stands for alternative text.

29

00:01:57.540  -->  00:02:00.370
We want to include a text description of the image.

30

00:02:00.480  -->  00:02:06.930
So if someone can visually see the page and there using screen reading software it can read them a description

31

00:02:06.930  -->  00:02:14.250
of the image so we can say squirrel on train tracks.

32

00:02:14.250  -->  00:02:18.970
Now if we save and refresh in our browser we won't see any difference.

33

00:02:18.990  -->  00:02:24.490
But if for some reason the image fails to load certain web browser it will display the text.

34

00:02:24.510  -->  00:02:29.460
Or like I mentioned before if someone's using a screen reading piece of software it will correctly read

35

00:02:29.460  -->  00:02:31.130
that description.

36

00:02:31.170  -->  00:02:36.180
In other words there is no reason to not include an alt attribute for your image.

37

00:02:36.180  -->  00:02:39.480
It makes your web pages far more accessible.

38

00:02:39.690  -->  00:02:45.360
So we have reviewed the all to attribute and we have reviewed the source attribute before we close out

39

00:02:45.360  -->  00:02:45.990
this lesson.

40

00:02:45.990  -->  00:02:51.960
There's one more thing that I want to discuss and that is keeping your image files organized so you

41

00:02:51.960  -->  00:02:58.200
will remember that we included the j peg in the same folder as our h DML file.

42

00:02:58.260  -->  00:03:04.570
In reality you will probably want to create a special images folder to keep things organized.

43

00:03:04.620  -->  00:03:09.420
So let's move our JPEG into the images folder.

44

00:03:09.810  -->  00:03:15.270
Once we have moved the file if we refresh our page obviously the image will not be able to load because

45

00:03:15.270  -->  00:03:21.150
the web browser doesn't know where to look to find the image anymore so we need to update our code from

46

00:03:21.150  -->  00:03:24.840
the source attribute our value needs to reflect that images folder.

47

00:03:24.840  -->  00:03:29.960
It's as simple as typing the name of the folder and then including a forward slash.

48

00:03:30.300  -->  00:03:35.550
So to review the forward slash is how we designate that the text leading up to it is referring to a

49

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:36.500
folder.

50

00:03:36.510  -->  00:03:40.340
So for example we could take things a step further within this images folder.

51

00:03:40.350  -->  00:03:45.780
We could create another folder named animals and then drag our image into that.

52

00:03:46.200  -->  00:03:52.870
And then in our code we could say image is slash animals slash and then the name and the JPEG.

53

00:03:52.920  -->  00:03:56.940
So if we refresh we can see that our image is loading once again.

54

00:03:57.360  -->  00:04:02.540
So we now know how to drill a folder deeper relative from the H to a mail file.

55

00:04:02.550  -->  00:04:05.010
We simply include a forward slash.

56

00:04:05.340  -->  00:04:08.040
But what if we wanted to go in the opposite direction.

57

00:04:08.250  -->  00:04:11.590
So you'll see on my desktop we've been working inside this learn.

58

00:04:11.610  -->  00:04:16.370
H to him l folder and that's where our index dot HTML file lives.

59

00:04:16.740  -->  00:04:20.580
But what if instead of drilling into a folder relative from this file.

60

00:04:20.640  -->  00:04:23.640
What if we wanted to go up a folder.

61

00:04:23.730  -->  00:04:25.130
So here's an image of a cat.

62

00:04:25.140  -->  00:04:26.420
Cat dog egg.

63

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:30.100
And you can see that it leaves one folder up from our HVM file.

64

00:04:30.570  -->  00:04:31.830
All to go in that direction.

65

00:04:31.860  -->  00:04:36.590
Let's create another image as an example and you can see the in the source attribute.

66

00:04:36.830  -->  00:04:44.970
We type dot dot forward slash and this will go up a folder and then we can simply type cat JPEG and

67

00:04:44.970  -->  00:04:49.050
include a bit of descriptive text for the image cat.

68

00:04:49.170  -->  00:04:57.210
So if we refresh we can see that our web page is now going up a folder relative from this file and then

69

00:04:57.240  -->  00:05:03.300
grabbing the cat J pig file for the time being that's enough speaking about going up a folder or down

70

00:05:03.300  -->  00:05:04.110
a folder.

71

00:05:04.110  -->  00:05:09.720
The only way to become truly comfortable with this syntax is to practice it on your own so I encourage

72

00:05:09.720  -->  00:05:15.600
you to set up a sample web page grab a few jpeg from somewhere on your computer and go ahead and experiment

73

00:05:15.600  -->  00:05:21.510
by organizing them into folders and then practicing this syntax in our next lesson and we will learn

74

00:05:21.510  -->  00:05:24.240
how to add an audio file to a page
