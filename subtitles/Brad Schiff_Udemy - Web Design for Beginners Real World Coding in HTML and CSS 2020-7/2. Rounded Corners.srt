00:00:00,350  -->  00:00:07,350
In this lesson we will learn how to apply rounded corners to our elements which would otherwise end

2

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:09,950
with perfect 90 degree corners.

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:13,450
Here we are in the web browser This is an example page.

4

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:18,580
And let's imagine that we want these blue boxes to have rounded corners.

5

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:22,760
The blue boxes are elements which have a class of box A.

6

00:00:22,860  -->  00:00:28,680
So we can simply add new declarations within this rule to target the boxes to give them rounded corners

7

00:00:28,680  -->  00:00:28,850
.

8

00:00:28,920  -->  00:00:33,350
We can use a property named border radius.

9

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:36,480
Let's begin with the value of 10 pixels.

10

00:00:36,510  -->  00:00:43,440
So if I save and refresh we can see that the four corners of the boxes are now rounded.

11

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:49,110
If we decide that they aren't round enough we can simply increase the value so we can bump this up from

12

00:00:49,110  -->  00:00:52,400
10 to 25 pixels.

13

00:00:52,410  -->  00:00:57,480
Now we do not have to have a perfectly uniform curves for all four corners.

14

00:00:57,480  -->  00:01:04,770
So currently we're providing a single value for the border radius property but if we provide two values

15

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:13,260
10 pixels spaced 25 pixels the web browser will use the first value of 10 for the top left and bottom

16

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:20,220
right corners and we use the second value of 25 pixels for the top right and bottom left corners.

17

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:26,500
We can take things a step further and really have fine grained control by providing for values.

18

00:01:26,520  -->  00:01:32,550
So let's imagine we wanted the top two corners to use 10 pixels and we wanted the bottom two corners

19

00:01:32,550  -->  00:01:37,590
to use 25 pixels.

20

00:01:37,590  -->  00:01:40,140
So this works in a clockwise fashion.

21

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:41,570
This is the top left value.

22

00:01:41,580  -->  00:01:45,800
This is the top right value bottom right and bottom left.

23

00:01:45,800  -->  00:01:52,500
So if we save and refresh we can see that the top two corners are using a 10 pixel radius and the bottom

24

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:55,200
two corners are using a 25 pixel radius.

25

00:01:55,350  -->  00:02:00,350
Next I want to talk about the exact shape of our rounded corners.

26

00:02:00,360  -->  00:02:06,000
So for simplicity let's set this back to simply 10 pixels around all four corners.

27

00:02:06,000  -->  00:02:14,340
Now until now we've seen circular rounding but we can also create elliptical rounding.

28

00:02:14,550  -->  00:02:23,270
So if we say 10 pixels forward slash 25 pixels we can see a different shape.

29

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:27,360
So let's dissect how this new code with a forward slash works.

30

00:02:27,510  -->  00:02:34,540
The first value is the horizontal radius and the second value is the vertical radius for our rounding

31

00:02:34,550  -->  00:02:34,830
.

32

00:02:34,980  -->  00:02:37,510
So we can create unique shapes.

33

00:02:37,530  -->  00:02:45,700
Let's imagine that we increase the horizontal to 40 and reduce the vertical to 15.

34

00:02:45,990  -->  00:02:52,980
We can see that our rounded corner now uses 40 pixels horizontally to complete the curve and only 15

35

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:56,520
pixels vertically to complete the curve.

36

00:02:56,520  -->  00:02:59,900
So that is an example of elliptical rounding.

37

00:03:00,120  -->  00:03:02,260
I however prefer circular rounding.

38

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:07,340
So I will change this to simply 10 pixels.

39

00:03:07,350  -->  00:03:14,250
Now speaking of the phrase circular I scroll down a bit we can see a square box with a great background

40

00:03:14,430  -->  00:03:17,750
that reads I wish I was a circle.

41

00:03:17,970  -->  00:03:20,030
So let's try an experiment.

42

00:03:20,040  -->  00:03:23,750
This box has a class of box be assigned to it.

43

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:29,250
And in our style she can see a rule here that corresponds with that element for our experiment.

44

00:03:29,250  -->  00:03:36,050
Let's see if we can use our border radius property to turn this square into a circle.

45

00:03:36,060  -->  00:03:43,440
So in our style sheet we can see that this box B element is receiving a width of 200 pixels and a height

46

00:03:43,500  -->  00:03:45,450
of 200 pixels.

47

00:03:45,450  -->  00:03:51,000
And if we want it to be a circle that means the rounded corners should take up half of the available

48

00:03:51,000  -->  00:03:56,790
width and height half of 200 pixels is obviously 100 pixels.

49

00:03:56,790  -->  00:04:02,910
So if we save and refresh you can see the squares now a circle because the border radius is taking up

50

00:04:02,970  -->  00:04:06,350
exactly half of the size of the element.

51

00:04:06,360  -->  00:04:08,700
So our experiment is complete.

52

00:04:08,700  -->  00:04:12,080
If we scroll down a bit we find an additional experiment.

53

00:04:12,090  -->  00:04:17,790
So here is a dark grey box and it reads I wish I was an oval.

54

00:04:17,850  -->  00:04:20,570
That element has a class of box.

55

00:04:20,570  -->  00:04:22,980
See here is the corresponding rule.

56

00:04:23,070  -->  00:04:30,180
So let's see if we can use the border radius property to turn this rectangle into an oval.

57

00:04:30,180  -->  00:04:38,070
Now in our C Ss we can see that this element is receiving a width of 350 pixels and a height of 200

58

00:04:38,070  -->  00:04:39,010
pixels.

59

00:04:39,270  -->  00:04:45,690
Now we need to calculate a value for the border radius property and I think this is a job for elliptical

60

00:04:45,690  -->  00:04:52,260
rounding not circular rounding because we need a rounded corner to take up more horizontal space than

61

00:04:52,260  -->  00:04:54,180
vertical space.

62

00:04:54,180  -->  00:04:57,970
Now we know to create elliptical rounding we can provide two values.

63

00:04:58,080  -->  00:05:00,300
The first control is the horizontal.

64

00:05:00,300  -->  00:05:05,410
So half of 350 is 175.

65

00:05:05,910  -->  00:05:11,550
And then when it comes to the vertical size of our radius we know that the element is 200 pixels tall

66

00:05:11,820  -->  00:05:14,640
so half of that is a hundred pixels.

67

00:05:14,640  -->  00:05:20,220
So 175 forward slash 100 will create an elliptical rounding effect.

68

00:05:20,220  -->  00:05:23,590
So if we save and refresh we have an oval.

69

00:05:23,700  -->  00:05:29,910
So with just a bit of arithmetic we were able to create an oval and a circle with the border radius

70

00:05:29,910  -->  00:05:30,990
property.

71

00:05:30,990  -->  00:05:34,270
Now before we close out the lesson I'll let you in on a secret.

72

00:05:34,260  -->  00:05:36,620
There's no need to perform that arithmetic.

73

00:05:36,720  -->  00:05:43,200
Instead of finding the perfect half values we can simply provide a value of 50 percent and the browser

74

00:05:43,230  -->  00:05:48,330
will take care of the rest so we can do the same thing for our circle as well.

75

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:52,470
Border radius 50 percent.

76

00:05:52,530  -->  00:05:55,780
Now I recommend using 50 percent for a few reasons.

77

00:05:56,220  -->  00:05:59,700
You don't need to perform any arithmetic and 2.

78

00:05:59,760  -->  00:06:05,520
It keeps things flexible so that way even if in the future your width and height values of the element

79

00:06:05,550  -->  00:06:11,220
change which will happen quite often if you're using responsive web design and media queries.

80

00:06:11,250  -->  00:06:16,650
You won't need to reach crunch the numbers for your border radius value in order to create the circle

81

00:06:16,680  -->  00:06:21,170
or oval effect and that will bring this lesson to a close.

82

00:06:21,270  -->  00:06:28,080
So whether you're looking to create circles and ovals or simply soften the perfect 90 degree edges of

83

00:06:28,080  -->  00:06:32,880
your boxes the border radius property is the tool for the job.

84

00:06:32,880  -->  00:06:38,580
I encourage you to experiment creating your own corner effects and I will see you in the next lesson
