00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:08,370
In this lesson we will learn how to create form fields which let users choose between a set of options

2

00:00:08,370  -->  00:00:09,000
.

3

00:00:09,060  -->  00:00:13,540
There are three different form field types that we will learn about in this lesson.

4

00:00:13,590  -->  00:00:17,510
Number one the select or the drop down box.

5

00:00:17,760  -->  00:00:19,430
So here we can see that in action.

6

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:20,920
What is your favorite color.

7

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:27,110
And if I click on this it's a dropdown menu and I can choose between any of these options.

8

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:31,790
Number two radio inputs so you can see an example here.

9

00:00:31,790  -->  00:00:32,670
Favorite meal.

10

00:00:32,670  -->  00:00:37,390
And then you can choose between only these three options.

11

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:44,400
Number three checkboxes you can see an example here your pets check all that apply.

12

00:00:44,580  -->  00:00:47,470
So here you're allowed to choose more than one.

13

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:53,200
If you have a cat a dog a bird and a fish you can select all four.

14

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:59,640
So these are our three primary tools in our toolbox for letting users choose between a predetermined

15

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:01,230
set of options.

16

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:04,100
Now it's important that we choose the right tool for the job.

17

00:01:04,110  -->  00:01:09,810
So right away we know that if we need a field where users can select more than one option we will use

18

00:01:09,810  -->  00:01:11,500
the checkboxes.

19

00:01:11,970  -->  00:01:17,430
However if we have a situation where we only want the user to be able to select one option how do we

20

00:01:17,430  -->  00:01:21,860
know whether we should use the select or radio inputs.

21

00:01:21,900  -->  00:01:27,330
I recommend using the select field when users already know what they're looking for and they're really

22

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:30,280
just wading through a large list of options.

23

00:01:30,300  -->  00:01:35,670
A common example that you're probably familiar with is seeing the select field used to ask you what

24

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:41,910
state or country you live in the select field is the perfect tool for this job because it's usually

25

00:01:41,910  -->  00:01:46,800
a long list of states or countries that would fill up a lot of screen space.

26

00:01:46,830  -->  00:01:51,960
So if we can hide those options away in a form field that only displays once you Tapper click on it

27

00:01:52,230  -->  00:01:53,600
that's excellent.

28

00:01:53,610  -->  00:02:00,210
Now I recommend using radio inputs when there are fewer choices and you can afford the screen space

29

00:02:00,210  -->  00:02:06,900
to display all of them or if it's a more important decision I recommend using radio inputs because it

30

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:10,510
lets users be fully aware of what they're not choosing.

31

00:02:10,560  -->  00:02:16,380
It lets them see the options that they are excluding by choosing the option that they're choosing.

32

00:02:16,380  -->  00:02:20,760
All right so now that we've reviewed the different field types and we've explained when to use the right

33

00:02:20,760  -->  00:02:21,410
tool.

34

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:23,000
Let's get to the fun part.

35

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:26,510
Let's review the code needed to create these elements.

36

00:02:26,520  -->  00:02:31,400
Here we are in a text editor with a blank web page we can see the body tag is emptied.

37

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:36,200
And first we'll learn how to create the select or dropdown menu.

38

00:02:36,360  -->  00:02:37,660
So its name is select.

39

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:42,240
Obviously the name of the element is select.

40

00:02:42,240  -->  00:02:47,340
Now let's try to recreate the select element that we saw earlier which was asking users what their favorite

41

00:02:47,340  -->  00:02:48,510
color was.

42

00:02:48,510  -->  00:02:52,080
So within the select element we can list the different options.

43

00:02:52,260  -->  00:02:54,040
So the first option would be red.

44

00:02:54,270  -->  00:03:01,740
So we'll create an element named option and within that option field that's where we can type read.

45

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:04,220
So that's what users will see.

46

00:03:04,230  -->  00:03:07,390
Let's create another option named Orange.

47

00:03:08,520  -->  00:03:13,740
And finally we'll create a third option named Yellow.

48

00:03:13,740  -->  00:03:18,960
Now if we save and refresh in the browser we can see there is a select element with the different options

49

00:03:18,960  -->  00:03:19,320
.

50

00:03:19,320  -->  00:03:23,160
Now it's important to point out that this defines what users see.

51

00:03:23,160  -->  00:03:26,160
So these are the options that users can choose from.

52

00:03:26,220  -->  00:03:31,160
But you remember that the whole point of a form is to submit this data to a server.

53

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:34,430
So something actually useful can be done with the data.

54

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:39,570
So we should probably add an attribute of value to each option element.

55

00:03:39,690  -->  00:03:44,640
And this is the data that will actually be passed along if a user chose this option.

56

00:03:44,640  -->  00:03:50,610
So for example we want the user to visually see the phrase red but maybe the data that we want to pass

57

00:03:50,610  -->  00:03:55,200
along to the server is color uppercase are for red.

58

00:03:55,500  -->  00:04:01,140
So let's go ahead and add those values to the different options for orange if Orange is chosen.

59

00:04:01,140  -->  00:04:08,550
We want to pass along a value of color orange if they choose yellow We want to pass along this value

60

00:04:08,550  -->  00:04:09,070
.

61

00:04:09,090  -->  00:04:11,480
Now these values are tied to the select element.

62

00:04:11,490  -->  00:04:17,310
So we want to add a name attribute to the select element just like we did in previous lessons with our

63

00:04:17,310  -->  00:04:18,730
text inputs.

64

00:04:18,810  -->  00:04:20,770
So we will name this field.

65

00:04:21,330  -->  00:04:23,820
Favorite color.

66

00:04:23,820  -->  00:04:25,430
Now this name could have been anything.

67

00:04:25,560  -->  00:04:27,030
Favorite color is not a code.

68

00:04:27,120  -->  00:04:28,790
That's something that I just made up.

69

00:04:28,950  -->  00:04:31,060
So you can make up any name that you would like.

70

00:04:31,080  -->  00:04:34,710
Just make sure that you don't have any spaces in the name.

71

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:41,000
All that remains now is a label we need to have a label associated with this select element.

72

00:04:41,040  -->  00:04:42,630
So you've seen this many times before.

73

00:04:42,630  -->  00:04:44,390
Practice makes perfect.

74

00:04:44,510  -->  00:04:59,060
Label What is your the color we'll give this label an attribute for with a value of favorite color and

75

00:04:59,060  -->  00:05:04,150
then we'll give this select element an idea of favorite color.

76

00:05:04,190  -->  00:05:10,010
So if we save and refresh now we can see that the field is labeled and if we click on the label it automatically

77

00:05:10,010  -->  00:05:11,780
highlights the field.

78

00:05:11,780  -->  00:05:15,450
And with that in place our select element is now complete.

79

00:05:15,470  -->  00:05:22,790
Let's move on to radio inputs now so we can delete this code for the select and let's imagine that we

80

00:05:22,790  -->  00:05:29,510
want to recreate the radio inputs that ask the user what their favorite meal is the code to create a

81

00:05:29,510  -->  00:05:37,190
radio input is simply input and then we add an attribute of type with a value of radio.

82

00:05:37,190  -->  00:05:40,170
Now technically this will create a radio input.

83

00:05:40,160  -->  00:05:46,400
So if I save and refresh we can see there is a radio input but in its current state this is completely

84

00:05:46,400  -->  00:05:47,030
useless.

85

00:05:47,060  -->  00:05:50,560
It's not labeled and it's not associated with a question.

86

00:05:50,690  -->  00:05:57,330
So let's review how to associate this radio input with a value or a question or something useful.

87

00:05:57,590  -->  00:06:02,450
Let's begin by laying out the structure we know that we want to at least three options breakfast brunch

88

00:06:02,450  -->  00:06:03,360
and lunch.

89

00:06:03,590  -->  00:06:07,540
So each radio input represents one of those choices.

90

00:06:07,640  -->  00:06:14,300
Now in order to associate these different dots or radio inputs with each other so that you can only

91

00:06:14,300  -->  00:06:15,750
select one at a time.

92

00:06:15,830  -->  00:06:24,260
We need to give them all a matching name so we use the name attribute and we'll call this favorite meal

93

00:06:24,270  -->  00:06:24,760
.

94

00:06:25,250  -->  00:06:35,090
So what add this name to all of the different options so you can see that now at least in the web browser

95

00:06:36,290  -->  00:06:41,630
it understands that these radio inputs are related to one another and that you should only be able to

96

00:06:41,630  -->  00:06:42,980
choose one at a time.

97

00:06:42,980  -->  00:06:45,760
Now we need to label the different options.

98

00:06:45,860  -->  00:06:52,100
So this first option is breakfast.

99

00:06:52,110  -->  00:06:59,740
Second option is brunch and the final option is lunch.

100

00:07:00,020  -->  00:07:04,630
And let's not forget that we need to associate the label with the input.

101

00:07:04,790  -->  00:07:07,050
So on the label we give it an attribute.

102

00:07:07,130  -->  00:07:12,310
For this is for the breakfast input.

103

00:07:12,310  -->  00:07:20,690
So we need to add an ID on this input of breakfast and we'll do the same for the other two choices so

104

00:07:20,780  -->  00:07:34,880
label for brunch give this input an ID of brunch give this label for lunch for lunch give the input

105

00:07:35,670  -->  00:07:37,790
an ID of lunch.

106

00:07:37,790  -->  00:07:42,830
So now if we save and refresh we can see at least our options are labeled and we can click on the label

107

00:07:42,830  -->  00:07:46,120
itself and it selects the appropriate choice.

108

00:07:46,130  -->  00:07:52,520
However even though our options are labeled We still need to label this question so we need text that

109

00:07:52,520  -->  00:07:55,660
says what is your favorite meal in the code.

110

00:07:55,670  -->  00:08:02,510
We need to wrap all of these different options in a container element named field set.

111

00:08:02,690  -->  00:08:08,760
So theres the start tag Heres the and tag lets go ahead and indent all of these options.

112

00:08:08,870  -->  00:08:12,310
The fields that element is exactly what the name implies.

113

00:08:12,320  -->  00:08:16,520
Its a set of fields that are inherently related to one another.

114

00:08:16,550  -->  00:08:23,060
Now to label the fields as a whole there is an element named legend.

115

00:08:23,060  -->  00:08:29,390
So inside the legend element is where we can label the question or the field set so we can say what

116

00:08:29,450  -->  00:08:32,570
is your favorite meal.

117

00:08:32,640  -->  00:08:39,830
So we save and refresh we can see that the field set drew a border around the associated fields and

118

00:08:39,830  -->  00:08:42,690
here is our legend.

119

00:08:42,800  -->  00:08:43,660
Excellent.

120

00:08:43,670  -->  00:08:49,490
Now there is one final step before our radio inputs are complete just like we did with the select element

121

00:08:49,490  -->  00:08:49,520
.

122

00:08:49,520  -->  00:08:53,610
We need to add a value attribute to each choice.

123

00:08:53,630  -->  00:08:56,780
This is the data that gets passed along to the server.

124

00:08:56,780  -->  00:08:58,540
Once users submit the form.

125

00:08:58,580  -->  00:09:05,300
So for example if a user selects breakfast as their favorite meal we can control what data gets passed

126

00:09:05,300  -->  00:09:13,160
along so we can say value equals meal 1 to if they choose breakfast this is the data that will get passed

127

00:09:13,160  -->  00:09:17,520
along to the server the value of meal 1 will be associated with the name.

128

00:09:17,600  -->  00:09:18,630
Favorite meal.

129

00:09:18,800  -->  00:09:21,380
Let's do the same for the other two inputs.

130

00:09:21,380  -->  00:09:23,090
Here is the second input.

131

00:09:23,270  -->  00:09:30,820
It will receive the value of meal 2 and the final input see the value of meal 3.

132

00:09:30,830  -->  00:09:34,950
So with that in place our radio inputs are now complete.

133

00:09:35,150  -->  00:09:36,220
So we've covered select.

134

00:09:36,230  -->  00:09:43,700
We've covered radio inputs that leaves checkboxes the code to create checkboxes is essentially identical

135

00:09:43,700  -->  00:09:46,560
to the code that you use to create radio inputs.

136

00:09:46,730  -->  00:09:53,600
So let's just make a few adjustments to this radio input set to make it be a checkbox set instead.

137

00:09:53,690  -->  00:10:00,040
So instead of asking What is your favorite meal which meals do you enjoy.

138

00:10:00,740  -->  00:10:02,690
Check all that apply.

139

00:10:02,840  -->  00:10:09,770
And then for each importer each option instead of the type attribute having a value of radio will change

140

00:10:09,770  -->  00:10:14,070
this two checkbox type equals checkbox.

141

00:10:14,150  -->  00:10:16,630
We'll do that for all three choices.
