00:00:00.500  -->  00:00:05.730
In this lesson we will take a step back and look at a bird's eye view of the code that makes up a web

2

00:00:05.730  -->  00:00:06.510
page.

3

00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:12.230
In previous lessons we've been simplifying things a bit by only examining actual content.

4

00:00:12.300  -->  00:00:17.970
So things like headings and paragraphs and bulleted lists in this lesson will learn that there's more

5

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:19.100
to a web page.

6

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:24.590
There's things that take place behind the scenes or under the hood that's enough speaking for now.

7

00:00:24.600  -->  00:00:26.490
Let's start looking at a bit of code.

8

00:00:26.670  -->  00:00:30.730
Here we are in a text editor with a blank canvas.

9

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:38.670
The first thing I'm going to do is create the h t M-L element when we discuss h HTML document structure

10

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:43.410
everything essentially begins and ends with the H UML element.

11

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:46.480
If you recall the Russian stocking doll analogy.

12

00:00:46.710  -->  00:00:53.330
Every web page that you ever create will always have this HMO element as the root ancestor.

13

00:00:53.340  -->  00:00:55.750
This is always going to be the root of our document.

14

00:00:55.770  -->  00:01:01.690
The root of our Web page within this element we want to create two additional elements.

15

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:06.210
The first is head and the second is body.

16

00:01:06.510  -->  00:01:13.080
In previous lessons we've only dealt with things like content headings paragraphs lists content goes

17

00:01:13.080  -->  00:01:14.810
inside the body element.

18

00:01:14.820  -->  00:01:23.550
So for example we can include the header here that says sample page and then we can include a brief

19

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:28.290
paragraph with only one sentence here.

20

00:01:29.010  -->  00:01:34.560
So if I save and refresh the browser we can see our content just like we've seen in previous lessons

21

00:01:34.570  -->  00:01:34.800
.

22

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:38.460
So we already have a firm grasp on the body element.

23

00:01:38.500  -->  00:01:42.580
It's where the content goes but what about the head element.

24

00:01:42.600  -->  00:01:47.270
This is where we include information about our document about our page.

25

00:01:47.280  -->  00:01:49.690
So for example let's give our page a title

26

00:01:53.860  -->  00:01:58.220
let's just call this page example page.

27

00:01:58.260  -->  00:02:03.930
So now if I save and if I go back to my browser I want you to pay attention to the tab label for this

28

00:02:03.930  -->  00:02:04.490
page.

29

00:02:04.530  -->  00:02:08.200
If I refresh you can see it then says example page.

30

00:02:08.250  -->  00:02:13.260
So the title of your document the title of your page is very important and things like that go in the

31

00:02:13.380  -->  00:02:15.360
head element.

32

00:02:15.360  -->  00:02:20.700
Another example of something that we would include in the head element is the character encoding information

33

00:02:20.760  -->  00:02:22.720
or the character set.

34

00:02:22.890  -->  00:02:28.830
So medder character set equals UTF 8.

35

00:02:28.830  -->  00:02:33.900
Now this may not make sense at first glance it may not be the most intuitive bit of code but essentially

36

00:02:33.900  -->  00:02:40.130
we're just telling the web browser what set of characters we want to have access to on our page.

37

00:02:40.140  -->  00:02:46.420
Most of the pages that I create or for English speaking audiences so I use the UTF 8 character set.

38

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:51.600
But if you're using a language that has vastly different characters you would likely need to use a different

39

00:02:51.600  -->  00:02:52.680
character set.

40

00:02:52.710  -->  00:02:57.480
I will include a link in the description for this lesson where you can find a list of all of the major

41

00:02:57.480  -->  00:02:59.190
character set options.

42

00:02:59.220  -->  00:03:00.460
A quick side note.

43

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:04.590
This marks the first time that you've seen an h m l attribute.

44

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:09.660
In other words this is the first time you've seen the equal sign in quotes and then a value.

45

00:03:09.690  -->  00:03:12.060
And this is not something we've done before in the course.

46

00:03:12.120  -->  00:03:16.320
So if this line of code does not make sense you are A-OK that's fine.

47

00:03:16.320  -->  00:03:19.750
This is something that we're going to review in our very next lesson.

48

00:03:19.770  -->  00:03:26.010
The concept of assigning an attribute to an element but for now please ignore this line of code and

49

00:03:26.010  -->  00:03:28.100
let's stay focused on the topic at hand.

50

00:03:28.140  -->  00:03:29.010
HVM.

51

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:30.540
Document structure.

52

00:03:30.540  -->  00:03:31.950
We are nearly complete.

53

00:03:31.950  -->  00:03:38.010
There is one final cherry on top that we need to add and it's actually a very important cherry. so up

54

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:44.910
at the very top line of our code we're going to type less than symbol exclamation and then doc type

55

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:50.410
in all caps and then HTHML and then the greater than symbol to close out this tag.

56

00:03:50.520  -->  00:03:56.940
This line of code is simply telling the web browser that we would like to use modern code modern HMO

57

00:03:57.510  -->  00:04:02.280
HMO has a storied history and has gone through different iterations and this code is just laying the

58

00:04:02.280  -->  00:04:08.610
web browser know that it's OK to use the most recent version of the HTML language and that's actually

59

00:04:08.610  -->  00:04:10.840
going to bring this lesson to a close.

60

00:04:10.860  -->  00:04:17.720
We now have a valid HTL document that will run properly in all modern web browsers.

61

00:04:17.840  -->  00:04:22.950
Now I must admit that this is probably one of the least exciting lessons in the entire course but at

62

00:04:22.950  -->  00:04:25.640
the same time it's also one of the most important.

63

00:04:25.890  -->  00:04:33.120
This is the basic template the basic skeleton that all of your web pages will use in our next lesson

64

00:04:33.120  -->  00:04:33.180
.

65

00:04:33.180  -->  00:04:35.670
We'll head back to where the fun takes place.

66

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:39.440
The body element will learn how to add a link that you can click on.

67

00:04:39.480  -->  00:04:41.810
That would take you from one page to another.

68

00:04:42.060  -->  00:04:44.390
So we'll create a mini website of sorts.

69

00:04:44.460  -->  00:04:49.120
I think it's going to be a lot of fun because linking is really the essence of the entire web.

70

00:04:49.350  -->  00:04:51.270
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
