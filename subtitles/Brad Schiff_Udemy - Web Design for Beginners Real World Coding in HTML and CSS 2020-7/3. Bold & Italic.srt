1

00:00:00,350  -->  00:00:07,830
In this lesson we will learn how to make certain text appear important or emphasized Or to phrase things

2

00:00:07,830  -->  00:00:09,560
in a less academic way.

3

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:13,080
We'll learn how to make text appear bold or italic.

4

00:00:13,080  -->  00:00:19,590
This is a quick disclaimer that this lesson is perhaps a bit pedantic for a topic as simple as bold

5

00:00:19,590  -->  00:00:20,800
and italics.

6

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:27,630
So if you want the quick answer you can simply wrap a strong element around text to make it bold and

7

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:32,410
you can wrap and E-M element around text to make it italic.

8

00:00:32,440  -->  00:00:37,860
However if you'd like to learn more about the semantic reason behind why we do these things then by

9

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:40,830
all means go ahead and view the entire lesson.

10

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:43,920
Otherwise you are free to skip to the next lesson.

11

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:51,540
We will begin with an element named strong in front of you is a text editor and here is a sentence when

12

00:00:51,600  -->  00:00:59,970
eating it is imperative that you chew so we've wrapped the word imperative in the HDMI element named

13

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:07,740
strong the strong element is a tool that we can use to give strong importance to a certain bit of text

14

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:08,520
.

15

00:01:08,520  -->  00:01:16,080
Typically web browsers will render content inside the strong element in a bold typeface and indeed here

16

00:01:16,080  -->  00:01:21,510
we are in a web browser and we can see that the word imperative is bold now to throw a quick wrench

17

00:01:21,510  -->  00:01:22,500
in the lesson.

18

00:01:22,680  -->  00:01:28,660
What if I let you know that there was an additional element in HTML named simply b.

19

00:01:29,130  -->  00:01:37,020
So if I save and refresh we can see literally no change in the web browser which means the B tag which

20

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:40,870
stands for bold will also make text bold.

21

00:01:40,870  -->  00:01:46,800
However even though I want you to be aware of the element I don't want you to ever use it.

22

00:01:46,800  -->  00:01:53,040
So let's change this back to strong and let's briefly discuss why most web developers will encourage

23

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:55,830
you to use the strong tag instead of the tag.

24

00:01:56,100  -->  00:02:02,150
The strong tag simply implies that its contents have strong importance.

25

00:02:02,370  -->  00:02:09,360
Now while it's true that most web browsers by default will render strong in bold typeface the element

26

00:02:09,360  -->  00:02:13,740
itself does not have an intrinsic relation to being bold.

27

00:02:13,770  -->  00:02:21,540
So let's say for example a year from now we revisit this page and we decide that important words should

28

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:26,210
be normal font weight so not bold but instead should be read.

29

00:02:26,250  -->  00:02:33,330
If we use the strong element it is very simple to use CSSA to target all strong elements and tell them

30

00:02:33,330  -->  00:02:34,600
to be a certain color.

31

00:02:34,860  -->  00:02:42,390
But if we used the BE tag that intrinsically implies that this context should be bold it's not implying

32

00:02:42,390  -->  00:02:47,640
importance it's simply implying a presentational preference boldness.

33

00:02:47,760  -->  00:02:55,280
So it would be a bit awkward to use CSSA to target the bold tag and tell it to not be bold.

34

00:02:55,320  -->  00:03:03,240
So in an effort to keep content and semantic meaning separate from presentational preferences I recommend

35

00:03:03,240  -->  00:03:05,080
using the strong tag.

36

00:03:05,610  -->  00:03:08,440
Now let's move on to our next topic.

37

00:03:08,460  -->  00:03:10,950
Making certain text italic.

38

00:03:11,010  -->  00:03:18,190
So let's imagine that we have a new sentence which reads that cat did not like the dog.

39

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:22,500
And let's imagine that we want to emphasize the word not.

40

00:03:22,620  -->  00:03:29,550
There is a tag or an element in h t animal named E. M. which stands for emphasis.

41

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:37,110
So if I save and refresh in the web browser we can see that the word not has been italicized.

42

00:03:37,140  -->  00:03:43,740
Now the semantic meaning behind the E-M element is that a person reading this sentence or a bit of screen

43

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:47,100
reading software should pronounce the word differently.

44

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:50,240
The cat did not like the dog.

45

00:03:50,820  -->  00:03:58,050
However there are instances where we want to make certain text italic but we do not want to add emphasis

46

00:03:58,050  -->  00:03:59,150
to the word.

47

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:06,840
So let's imagine that we have another sentence which reads the word tree is typically used as a noun

48

00:04:06,840  -->  00:04:07,330
.

49

00:04:07,560  -->  00:04:11,170
In this case we want the word tree to be italic.

50

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:16,350
We do not want to add emphasis to the word we simply want to designate that we're not using the literal

51

00:04:16,350  -->  00:04:21,790
meaning of the word tree but were instead referring to the technical properties of the word.

52

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:27,240
So in a case like this we can use the A element which stands for italic.

53

00:04:27,240  -->  00:04:32,020
If we were fresh in the web browser we can see that the word tree has been italicized.

54

00:04:32,130  -->  00:04:36,090
However for the same reason that I recommend you don't use the tag.

55

00:04:36,090  -->  00:04:40,120
I will also recommend that you do not use the IDE tag if possible.

56

00:04:40,230  -->  00:04:45,690
So for example the eye tag is a quick fix and it's adding nothing but presentational preference.

57

00:04:45,750  -->  00:04:51,120
So instead we could use the DFA an element which stands for definition.

58

00:04:51,330  -->  00:04:55,210
So if we save and refresh we can see that the word still remains italic sized.

59

00:04:55,410  -->  00:05:00,170
And this indicates that we're dealing with the definition or the technical properties of the word.

60

00:05:00,660  -->  00:05:06,630
But there are only so many elements in HTML and there will come a time when you don't have the perfect

61

00:05:06,660  -->  00:05:08,280
element at your disposal.

62

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:15,210
In a case like that it's OK to use the element but ideally in a situation like that you should add an

63

00:05:15,210  -->  00:05:22,440
attribute named class and then give the attribute a value for this particular use of the element.

64

00:05:22,560  -->  00:05:28,230
So we're using this element to refer to a term but you could come up with any name that you would like

65

00:05:28,620  -->  00:05:30,800
for this unique use case.

66

00:05:30,900  -->  00:05:38,400
That way in the future we can use a language like CSSA to target all elements with a clause of term

67

00:05:38,610  -->  00:05:40,490
and style them a certain way.

68

00:05:40,500  -->  00:05:46,320
Also this is very helpful when translating a website from one language to another because certain languages

69

00:05:46,320  -->  00:05:50,130
don't treat italics the same way that English does.

70

00:05:50,130  -->  00:05:56,340
So to review we've learnt how to mark text as important which will also consequently make the text bold

71

00:05:56,340  -->  00:05:57,260
by default.

72

00:05:57,450  -->  00:06:01,500
And we've learned how to make text appear emphasized or italic.

73

00:06:01,500  -->  00:06:05,330
Now there's one final point that I want to include Before we close out this video.

74

00:06:05,700  -->  00:06:11,500
And that is if you have a web page with a significant amount of text.

75

00:06:11,690  -->  00:06:18,920
Let's say two large paragraphs and you decide that you want all of this text to appear bold.

76

00:06:19,020  -->  00:06:23,970
Not for any semantic reason but simply from a design perspective you like the way that bulled appears

77

00:06:23,970  -->  00:06:24,350
.

78

00:06:24,360  -->  00:06:27,020
Please do not do something like this.

79

00:06:27,360  -->  00:06:36,780
Do not use the strong tag to make entire sections of your page bold unless you actually want to designate

80

00:06:36,780  -->  00:06:37,000
that.

81

00:06:37,020  -->  00:06:39,440
All of this text is important.

82

00:06:39,510  -->  00:06:47,790
Also do not use the E-M tag to make all of your body text italic simply because you liked the way that

83

00:06:47,790  -->  00:06:48,740
it looks.

84

00:06:48,750  -->  00:06:51,090
Please please do not do this.

85

00:06:51,180  -->  00:06:57,930
You will learn that there is a another language named C S S and that's where you can make design decisions

86

00:06:57,980  -->  00:06:58,240
.

87

00:06:58,280  -->  00:07:03,070
But HTML is where we make content description decisions.

88

00:07:03,210  -->  00:07:08,820
So HVM else is not the place to be defining how entire sections of text should appear.

89

00:07:08,850  -->  00:07:12,980
For design reasons I will see you in the next lesson.
