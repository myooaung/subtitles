00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:09,060
In this section of the course we will learn about CSSA special effects now special effects is not an

2

00:00:09,060  -->  00:00:10,090
official name.

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:11,530
I just made it up.

4

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:17,100
We could also call this section of the course non essential CSSA properties.

5

00:00:17,400  -->  00:00:21,960
In this particular lesson we will learn about Bach's shadow.

6

00:00:22,090  -->  00:00:27,640
So earlier in the course we learned how to add chateaus to text in this lesson.

7

00:00:27,660  -->  00:00:32,900
We will learn how to add shadows to block level elements like a div or an article.

8

00:00:32,910  -->  00:00:36,390
Here we are in the web browser viewing an example page.

9

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:41,570
And let's imagine that we want to add shadows to these four blue boxes.

10

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:45,660
So those elements are divs with a class of box A.

11

00:00:45,900  -->  00:00:50,040
So we can simply tack on new CSSA properties within this rule.

12

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:59,070
So to add a shadow to an element we can use a properly named box shadow this property except for values

13

00:00:59,070  -->  00:00:59,310
.

14

00:00:59,370  -->  00:01:03,140
The first two values control the positioning of the shadow.

15

00:01:03,480  -->  00:01:09,130
So the very first value controls the horizontal positioning or the horizontal offset of the shadow.

16

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:13,310
So I wanted to say two pixels from the real content.

17

00:01:13,440  -->  00:01:17,710
The second value controls the vertical positioning or the vertical offset.

18

00:01:17,730  -->  00:01:22,790
So if we include a larger value here the shadow will sit further down from the real content.

19

00:01:22,950  -->  00:01:27,010
The third value controls the blur radius of the shadow.

20

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:33,060
So if we want the shadow to appear blurred you can include a larger value or if we want the shadow to

21

00:01:33,060  -->  00:01:36,950
be razor sharp we can include 0 or 1 pixel.

22

00:01:37,020  -->  00:01:41,190
So let's include an average value like five pixels.

23

00:01:41,190  -->  00:01:45,730
And finally the fourth value controls the color of the shadow.

24

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:48,700
So let's begin with a black shadow.

25

00:01:48,720  -->  00:01:54,210
So if I save and refresh we can see that the Shadows have been applied.

26

00:01:54,210  -->  00:02:00,480
Now let's imagine that we actually wanted the shadow to not sit so far down from the original content

27

00:02:00,570  -->  00:02:03,780
and instead be pushed more to the side horizontally.

28

00:02:04,050  -->  00:02:11,480
So we can reduce the vertical offset value to two and we can increase the horizontal offset to 10.

29

00:02:12,210  -->  00:02:19,100
Now by default these offset values push the shadow down into the right.

30

00:02:19,290  -->  00:02:25,440
But if we wanted our shadow to be placed above or to the left of the original content we can use negative

31

00:02:25,440  -->  00:02:31,920
values so negative 10 pixels for the horizontal offset will position the shadow to the left.

32

00:02:32,430  -->  00:02:38,400
And if we use a negative value for the vertical offset it will be placed above the original content

33

00:02:38,400  -->  00:02:39,130
.

34

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:45,090
However I prefer my chateaus to the bottom right of the content so I will remove these negative values

35

00:02:45,110  -->  00:02:45,560
.

36

00:02:45,990  -->  00:02:48,720
Now let's adjust the color of the shadow.

37

00:02:48,930  -->  00:02:56,820
So currently we're using a hexadecimal color code but we can also use an RGA color to achieve transparency

38

00:02:56,820  -->  00:02:58,280
with our shadows.

39

00:02:58,290  -->  00:03:06,690
So for example black in RGBA is 0 0 0 and the fourth value control the transparency or the opacity.

40

00:03:06,690  -->  00:03:12,360
So if I set this to point five you can see that the Shadows are transparent.

41

00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:17,880
And if I lower this to point to five the shadows look a bit better.

42

00:03:17,930  -->  00:03:22,550
Now I'm actually going to lower it to perhaps 15 percent or point 15.

43

00:03:22,560  -->  00:03:27,840
Now I think they could afford to be even a bit more subtle but because I want the shadows to clearly

44

00:03:27,840  -->  00:03:32,740
show up in this video recording I will leave them at 15 percent.

45

00:03:33,030  -->  00:03:38,190
Let's change gears and talk a little bit more about the positioning of the shadows.

46

00:03:38,460  -->  00:03:43,650
So we learned that the horizontal and vertical offset can push the shadow to the right or to the bottom

47

00:03:43,650  -->  00:03:43,740
.

48

00:03:43,740  -->  00:03:49,170
If we use negative values to the top or to the left but in all of those scenarios the shadow was always

49

00:03:49,410  -->  00:03:53,990
on the outside of the original content or an outer shadow.

50

00:03:54,210  -->  00:04:03,060
What if we want an inner shadow we can include the word inset within our box shadow value and if we

51

00:04:03,060  -->  00:04:08,790
see even refresh we can see that that pushes the shadow to live within the content.

52

00:04:08,790  -->  00:04:12,530
In design we typically call this an inner shadow.

53

00:04:12,540  -->  00:04:18,360
Now let's imagine we wanted to combine this inner shadow effect with the regular shadow that we had

54

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:19,980
previously.

55

00:04:19,980  -->  00:04:28,680
Now your first instinct might be to copy this line of code pasted simply remove the word inset but we

56

00:04:28,680  -->  00:04:30,530
can see that that does not work.

57

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:33,530
So only the external or drop shadow is appearing.

58

00:04:33,660  -->  00:04:38,060
And that's because this declaration comes last in the stylesheet.

59

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:41,940
So it simply overriding this declaration.

60

00:04:41,940  -->  00:04:49,650
So if we want to combine our two shadows we need to combine them to live within one value or within

61

00:04:49,650  -->  00:04:52,860
one declaration and we can do this with a comma.

62

00:04:53,080  -->  00:05:00,210
So after we've defined this shadow we can include a comma and then let's just copy and paste this exact

63

00:05:00,210  -->  00:05:04,510
same code and then we can apply the word inset to one of them.

64

00:05:05,070  -->  00:05:08,400
So this is one shadow comma.

65

00:05:08,760  -->  00:05:10,050
This is another châteaux.

66

00:05:10,190  -->  00:05:17,070
So if we save and refresh we can see that we now have both shadows and we are free to adjust a particular

67

00:05:17,070  -->  00:05:19,370
shadow and it won't affect the other one.

68

00:05:19,380  -->  00:05:20,920
So they're independent of each other.

69

00:05:21,090  -->  00:05:27,990
So if we want to adjust the inner châteaux to use a smaller horizontal and vertical offset and perhaps

70

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:34,560
raise the transparency or the opacity a bit we can do just that and it doesn't have any effect on the

71

00:05:34,560  -->  00:05:36,190
external drop shadow.

72

00:05:36,330  -->  00:05:43,380
So feel free to use commas to lay around as many different shadows as you need to create your desired

73

00:05:43,380  -->  00:05:44,640
effect.

74

00:05:44,640  -->  00:05:51,000
That's going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will learn how to add rounded corners

75

00:05:51,000  -->  00:05:52,400
to our boxes.

76

00:05:52,740  -->  00:05:54,590
I will see you in the next lesson
