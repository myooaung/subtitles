00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:08.640
In this lesson we will learn how to style navigation menu of links in front of you is an example page

2

00:00:08.640  -->  00:00:10.850
that we created in an earlier lesson.

3

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:15.350
And in this lesson we're going to add a navigation menu in the header.

4

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:20.940
So let's get started by hopping over to our text editor and we know from an earlier lesson that the

5

00:00:20.970  -->  00:00:29.280
HVM else created navigation menu begins with an element named Nav. within the nav element will create

6

00:00:29.370  -->  00:00:35.310
an own ordered list and then obviously within the unordered list we'll create one list item for each

7

00:00:35.310  -->  00:00:43.470
link within the list item will add a anchor or a link element and then let's copy and paste this several

8

00:00:43.470  -->  00:00:44.210
times.

9

00:00:44.310  -->  00:00:44.770
OK.

10

00:00:44.940  -->  00:00:53.760
So we'll have one link that reads home another that reads about portfolio and contact us.

11

00:00:53.860  -->  00:00:58.830
So if we save and refresh we can see that our header now has a series of links.

12

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:05.210
And our goal for this lesson is to style these links so that they look like a well-designed menu bar

13

00:01:05.220  -->  00:01:05.910
.

14

00:01:05.910  -->  00:01:13.680
Our first two tasks will be to a remove the bullets from each list item and B get the links to sit side

15

00:01:13.680  -->  00:01:19.200
by side one another all on one horizontal line instead of stacking one per line.

16

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:21.160
So we'll begin by removing the bullets.

17

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:28.020
Let's add a class to this nav element so that it's easy to target with our CSA s site now.

18

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:31.680
Now in our CSSA let's create a new section.

19

00:01:31.680  -->  00:01:39.930
We use a CSSA comment site navigation to create a comment and CSSA you include a forward slash and then

20

00:01:39.930  -->  00:01:42.470
an asterisk to close the comment.

21

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:49.750
You include an asterisk and a forwards lodge and site navigation.

22

00:01:49.900  -->  00:01:54.660
So now we can include RC SS between these two lines and we will stay very organized.

23

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:02.650
So will say site nav target the list items and we want their list style to be none.

24

00:02:02.700  -->  00:02:05.050
So this will remove the bullets.

25

00:02:05.790  -->  00:02:10.140
So our next step is to get the length to sit side by side one another.

26

00:02:10.140  -->  00:02:13.430
We can use the float property to achieve this.

27

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:18.900
So while we're still targeting the list items we'll add a new declaration float and we'll float all

28

00:02:18.900  -->  00:02:24.750
of the links or excuse me in all the list items to the left and we learned in an earlier lesson that

29

00:02:24.750  -->  00:02:30.900
when you float a series of elements you need to clear the floats because currently if all of these list

30

00:02:30.900  -->  00:02:37.320
items are floated there's parent element of UL has no idea that it has any content within it.

31

00:02:37.320  -->  00:02:43.320
So for legal purposes we really need to clear our floats and we created a utility class named group

32

00:02:43.390  -->  00:02:46.170
in an earlier lesson that we can reuse.

33

00:02:46.170  -->  00:02:52.050
So by adding this class this element will now automatically clear the floats of its children.

34

00:02:52.050  -->  00:02:57.930
So if we save and refresh we can see that all the links now sit on one line.

35

00:02:57.930  -->  00:03:02.280
Next we can see that there is a bit of space on the left side of the navigation.

36

00:03:02.400  -->  00:03:07.680
So to remove that we need to target the owner ordered list element because by default it has padding

37

00:03:07.710  -->  00:03:10.170
and perhaps margin in certain browsers.

38

00:03:10.170  -->  00:03:15.720
So we go into the site nav and then we target the unordered list element and we just want to remove

39

00:03:16.170  -->  00:03:21.930
any default padding and margin that the browser might be trying to apply much better.

40

00:03:21.930  -->  00:03:29.520
Next let's add a bit of space between the slogan and our navigation so to do that in our CSSA we will

41

00:03:29.520  -->  00:03:36.960
target the nav element that has a class of site now and we'll give it a bit of top margin and top 20

42

00:03:36.960  -->  00:03:40.230
pixels much better.

43

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:43.550
Now let's focus on styling the links themselves.

44

00:03:43.740  -->  00:03:51.090
So we will begin by removing their underline to do that will jump inside the site nav element and then

45

00:03:51.090  -->  00:03:55.550
target the A or the anchor element text decoration.

46

00:03:55.680  -->  00:03:57.130
None.

47

00:03:57.990  -->  00:03:59.100
Excellent.

48

00:03:59.100  -->  00:04:01.840
Now let's customize the color of the links.

49

00:04:01.860  -->  00:04:05.060
Let's override the default blue ink color.

50

00:04:05.130  -->  00:04:11.190
So I like this green that we're using for the other header or text while we're targeting the A or the

51

00:04:11.190  -->  00:04:16.260
link element in our success will add a new property of color and then we'll paste in that hexadecimal

52

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:24.660
color code so we can see the links from now green next letter and spacing around each link and also

53

00:04:24.660  -->  00:04:29.940
give them a subtle border so that they begin to look like buttons that you're encouraged to tap or click

54

00:04:29.940  -->  00:04:31.110
.

55

00:04:31.110  -->  00:04:38.940
So while we are targeting the link elements we will add a property of padding 10 pixels vertical and

56

00:04:38.940  -->  00:04:40.710
20 pixels horizontal.

57

00:04:40.710  -->  00:04:42.490
And let's also give them a border.

58

00:04:42.660  -->  00:04:46.330
Let's make their border the same color as the sidebar background.

59

00:04:46.410  -->  00:04:53.640
And these subtle borders that we already see in the layout border three pixels solid and then the subtle

60

00:04:53.640  -->  00:04:54.730
green color.

61

00:04:54.750  -->  00:04:58.240
So if we see even refresh we can see a few things.

62

00:04:58.380  -->  00:05:03.810
The first thing that we see is that the links themselves did receive the vertical padding so we can

63

00:05:03.810  -->  00:05:08.830
see that they do have 10 pixels of padding on the top and 10 pixels of padding on the bottom.

64

00:05:08.850  -->  00:05:13.810
However the content above and below the links is not aware of this padding.

65

00:05:13.980  -->  00:05:21.150
So for example if I set this to 40 pixels vertical padding we can see that the links are overlapping

66

00:05:21.150  -->  00:05:22.860
the content surrounding them.

67

00:05:23.040  -->  00:05:30.660
And that's because by default link elements or elements are in line elements instead of block level

68

00:05:30.690  -->  00:05:31.800
elements.

69

00:05:31.830  -->  00:05:39.360
So all this means that by default the browser has this property display in line associated with an element

70

00:05:39.960  -->  00:05:42.060
we want to override that default behavior.

71

00:05:42.090  -->  00:05:44.670
We want a link to be a block level element.

72

00:05:44.940  -->  00:05:50.490
So once the element is a block level element it can receive vertical padding and the content around

73

00:05:50.490  -->  00:05:52.690
it will be aware of that padding.

74

00:05:52.740  -->  00:05:56.180
So let's set this back to a reasonable value of 10.

75

00:05:57.120  -->  00:06:01.380
And next let's add horizontal space between each link.

76

00:06:01.620  -->  00:06:06.340
So to do that will target the list items and we'll add a bit of margin right.

77

00:06:06.360  -->  00:06:10.140
Each list item 5 pixels next.

78

00:06:10.170  -->  00:06:15.030
I think it would look neat if the links sat directly on this border line between the header and the

79

00:06:15.030  -->  00:06:16.320
body content.

80

00:06:16.320  -->  00:06:21.360
So let's remove that spacing on the header element we can see that it was receiving 20 pixels of bottom

81

00:06:21.360  -->  00:06:22.260
padding.

82

00:06:22.590  -->  00:06:26.180
If we remove that we can see that the spacing is gone.

83

00:06:26.190  -->  00:06:32.200
But now there appears to be double thick borders where the buttons touch the existing border line.

84

00:06:32.550  -->  00:06:37.110
So to remedy that we can simply remove the bottom border of Arlene's.

85

00:06:37.380  -->  00:06:41.630
So here we are selecting the link elements we've already added a border.

86

00:06:41.700  -->  00:06:46.080
We can just add a new property border bottom none.

87

00:06:46.230  -->  00:06:52.710
If we were fresh we can see that the links now sit flush on this full borderline.

88

00:06:52.770  -->  00:06:59.550
Finally let's add a hover effect so that when the user hovers over a particular link it changes its

89

00:06:59.550  -->  00:07:01.240
style.

90

00:07:01.320  -->  00:07:05.630
So to do that will create a new rule site.

91

00:07:05.650  -->  00:07:09.780
Now a hover.

92

00:07:09.880  -->  00:07:12.320
This is known as a pseudo selector.

93

00:07:12.440  -->  00:07:14.380
We are targeting the A element.

94

00:07:14.400  -->  00:07:18.750
But unlike this rule we are adding a pseudo selector of hover.

95

00:07:19.230  -->  00:07:21.600
So now we can include styles in this rule.

96

00:07:21.600  -->  00:07:23.660
We can say background color.

97

00:07:24.150  -->  00:07:27.760
Use that subtle green.

98

00:07:27.840  -->  00:07:34.770
So now if we save an refresh and hover over a league we can see that it lights up and that will bring

99

00:07:34.770  -->  00:07:41.590
this lesson to a close just to show how powerful CSSA is really quickly let's remove all of the CSSA

100

00:07:41.620  -->  00:07:44.180
we wrote in this lesson and then I'll add it back in.

101

00:07:44.250  -->  00:07:50.520
But without it we were dealing with a simple bulleted list and with just a little bit of C Ss we were

102

00:07:50.520  -->  00:07:53.450
able to transform it into this.

103

00:07:54.150  -->  00:08:00.480
I hope this encourages you to believe that with CSS we can create any layout we imagine I will see you

104

00:08:00.540  -->  00:08:01.570
in the next lesson
