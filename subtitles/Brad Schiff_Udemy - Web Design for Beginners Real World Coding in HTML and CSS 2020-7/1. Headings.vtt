00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:06.690
In this lesson we will learn about heading elements and the role that they play in giving our web pages

2

00:00:06.710  -->  00:00:13.740
structure and creating hierarchy amongst our content in front of you is an example page that I've created

3

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:18.540
for this lesson for just a moment let's pretend that this is not a web page.

4

00:00:18.630  -->  00:00:21.400
Let's pretend that it isn't written in HVM.

5

00:00:21.450  -->  00:00:25.850
And let's instead just pretend that this is a printed page in a book.

6

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:32.580
Now let's give ourselves an exercise let's try to identify the different sections that make up this

7

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:33.600
page.

8

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:38.730
And let's really pay attention to the contextual clues that headings give us when trying to identify

9

00:00:38.730  -->  00:00:39.640
sections.

10

00:00:39.810  -->  00:00:44.630
So for example the first section that I would identify would be this paragraph.

11

00:00:44.640  -->  00:00:50.310
This seems like the intro section because it sits directly under the largest heading if we scroll down

12

00:00:50.310  -->  00:00:57.450
a bit I would then say the next overall section is all of this content because we can see that the next

13

00:00:57.450  -->  00:01:02.120
set of largest headings on the page are key point and key point.

14

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:03.910
And this is the end of the page.

15

00:01:03.930  -->  00:01:12.060
So to me this seems like a section that is made up of a subsection and a subsection and then this is

16

00:01:12.060  -->  00:01:13.930
the other main section.

17

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:16.730
Very quickly let's review the entire page again.

18

00:01:16.770  -->  00:01:22.770
So I would say that this is the intro section I would say that this is a main section and I would say

19

00:01:22.770  -->  00:01:25.520
that this is another main section.

20

00:01:25.560  -->  00:01:30.720
Now the only clue that I'm going off of when trying to determine what's a section is the headings.

21

00:01:30.870  -->  00:01:33.330
Authors of physical books do this all the time.

22

00:01:33.330  -->  00:01:39.360
They use different levels of headings to create hierarchy to keep the content organized so it's easier

23

00:01:39.360  -->  00:01:41.490
to digest and understand.

24

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:43.560
Well web pages are no different.

25

00:01:43.590  -->  00:01:46.730
Web developers use headings to keep content organized.

26

00:01:46.950  -->  00:01:52.650
So let's take a jump into our text editor and you can see that our page begins with a heading level

27

00:01:52.650  -->  00:01:53.710
1.

28

00:01:53.760  -->  00:02:00.900
So that's this and we've covered this in earlier lessons you've seen H-1 many times but I want to talk

29

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:02.670
about the way that we create hierarchy.

30

00:02:02.820  -->  00:02:08.010
So you'll also remember from one of our earliest lessons that I mentioned that H-2 is a slightly less

31

00:02:08.010  -->  00:02:11.520
important heading than in H-1 and we can see that reflected.

32

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:16.440
Key point is smaller than this age one subject heading.

33

00:02:16.800  -->  00:02:24.420
But then if we go down a bit we can see that minor point is using an H-3 which is right here and we

34

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:32.880
can see that very minor point is using an H for which is here and then obviously if this key point used

35

00:02:32.880  -->  00:02:37.190
in H-2 down at the bottom this key point also uses an H2.

36

00:02:37.380  -->  00:02:41.820
Overall this page has used four different heading levels.

37

00:02:41.820  -->  00:02:45.890
One two three and four.

38

00:02:45.900  -->  00:02:52.810
Now you may recall that in an earlier lesson I mentioned that HTML offers H-1 all the way to eight six

39

00:02:52.990  -->  00:02:59.600
six different heading levels that you can use to create structure and organization in your pages.

40

00:02:59.670  -->  00:03:05.940
Now even though H M L offers H-1 all the way through age 6 that doesn't mean we need to use all six

41

00:03:05.940  -->  00:03:07.660
different heading levels.

42

00:03:07.740  -->  00:03:14.580
In fact we will learn in future lessons that the most recent version of HTML h team L5 encourages us

43

00:03:14.580  -->  00:03:20.700
to structure our pages in a way that we will probably only ever use H-1 elements but we will cross that

44

00:03:20.700  -->  00:03:22.220
bridge when we come to it.

45

00:03:22.410  -->  00:03:28.140
So until we learn about different ways to organize sections in our pages I want you to use as many different

46

00:03:28.140  -->  00:03:34.780
heading levels as your content demands because coding patterns and best practices change over time.

47

00:03:35.070  -->  00:03:38.640
But using headings to organize content that's timeless.

48

00:03:38.640  -->  00:03:42.280
That's why I encourage you earlier to think of this as a printed page in a book.

49

00:03:42.480  -->  00:03:46.740
The key is to simply create organized easy to digest content.

50

00:03:46.740  -->  00:03:48.130
I'll see you in the next lesson
