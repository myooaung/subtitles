00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:09.300
In this lesson we will learn about the HTML element named nav nav stands for navigation and we can use

2

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:16.110
the navigation element to Houghs a major block of navigation links which allow users to hop around from

3

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:22.920
page to page within a web site in front of you is an example page from an earlier lesson in the course

4

00:00:23.460  -->  00:00:24.520
for this lesson.

5

00:00:24.540  -->  00:00:31.950
Our goal is to use the nav element to add a set of links towards the bottom of this header area.

6

00:00:31.950  -->  00:00:34.250
So let's dive right in.

7

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:39.280
We'll jump over to our text editor and here is the header section that we were just pointing out.

8

00:00:39.450  -->  00:00:46.560
So underneath these two elements will create a nav element.

9

00:00:46.560  -->  00:00:51.570
Now let's take a look at the industry standard way of including links in the nav element.

10

00:00:51.570  -->  00:00:59.400
The most common structure is to use an unordered list and then use a list item for each link within

11

00:00:59.400  -->  00:01:06.330
the list item will create an anchor or a link which is the element and the first link will be a link

12

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:07.710
to the home page.

13

00:01:07.710  -->  00:01:14.490
Now the file that we're currently editing in our text editor is the home page and the name of this file

14

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:16.930
is indexed but h t l.

15

00:01:17.070  -->  00:01:25.020
So that's what we want to include inside the ref attribute for this link index dot HTML.

16

00:01:25.020  -->  00:01:29.100
So that's it take a look at the folder where that file lives indexed on HTML.

17

00:01:29.200  -->  00:01:33.720
We can see that there are also files named about incontact.

18

00:01:33.750  -->  00:01:37.230
So those are the other links that we want to include in our navigation.

19

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:48.420
So it will create a nother list item and within that we'll create a link to the about h TNL file or

20

00:01:48.420  -->  00:01:49.020
page

21

00:01:52.080  -->  00:01:57.990
within the Start Tag and the end tag of the anchor element is where we include the text that users can

22

00:01:57.990  -->  00:01:59.920
click on to follow the link.

23

00:02:00.330  -->  00:02:10.680
And finally we'll create a third list item to link to the Contact Us page and then close out the anchor

24

00:02:10.680  -->  00:02:11.970
element.

25

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:18.270
And if I save and refresh in the web browser we can see that we now have a navigation section in our

26

00:02:18.270  -->  00:02:19.310
header.

27

00:02:19.350  -->  00:02:23.960
If I click on the About Us link it takes us to the About Us page.

28

00:02:24.090  -->  00:02:27.980
If I click back and click on Contact Us it takes us to that page.

29

00:02:28.050  -->  00:02:34.200
However you'll notice that on the about us and contact us page the navigation is not appearing we need

30

00:02:34.200  -->  00:02:38.710
to manually copy and paste that into those pages.

31

00:02:38.760  -->  00:02:45.770
So let me open up the about that each TNL file and we'll paste in our navigation into the header element

32

00:02:45.780  -->  00:02:46.410
.

33

00:02:46.700  -->  00:02:49.280
And let's do the same thing for the contact.

34

00:02:49.330  -->  00:02:51.370
But each to your mail page here's the letter.

35

00:02:51.660  -->  00:02:55.170
So within that we'll paste in our now element.

36

00:02:55.200  -->  00:03:00.240
Now if we refresh in the browser we can see that we can click and very quickly navigate between the

37

00:03:00.240  -->  00:03:02.360
three pages in our Web site.

38

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:06.580
And this is the entire purpose of the Nav element.

39

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:10.680
You don't need to wrap every single link within your page in a nav element.

40

00:03:10.680  -->  00:03:16.380
So for example if we had a link in one of our articles they don't need to be in an AB element and even

41

00:03:16.380  -->  00:03:22.060
if we had a link or two in the footer they don't necessarily need to be in an AB element either.

42

00:03:22.200  -->  00:03:26.470
We use the Gnab element for primary blocks of navigation links.

43

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:31.260
So if in the footer we have five links two very important pages throughout the Web site.

44

00:03:31.350  -->  00:03:35.520
Maybe that does qualify as a nav element.

45

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:41.520
However if it's only two links to your privacy policy and your terms and conditions then that isn't

46

00:03:41.580  -->  00:03:44.080
really a way to navigate the Web site.

47

00:03:44.100  -->  00:03:47.040
So really the name of the element is self-explanatory.

48

00:03:47.130  -->  00:03:52.790
Whenever you have a menu that is used for navigating you can use the nav element.

49

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:58.980
It's another tool to increase the accessibility and semantic richness of your web pages.

50

00:03:58.980  -->  00:04:00.740
I'll see you in the next lesson.
