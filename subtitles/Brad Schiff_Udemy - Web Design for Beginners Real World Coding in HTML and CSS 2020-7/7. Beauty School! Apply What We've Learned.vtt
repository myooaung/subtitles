00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:07.050
In this lesson we will combine everything that we have learned about CSSA so far and use it in a real

2

00:00:07.050  -->  00:00:09.070
world application.

3

00:00:09.090  -->  00:00:13.350
So this means there are no new topics in this lesson for you to wrap your mind around.

4

00:00:13.350  -->  00:00:19.840
Instead we're going to work together to style this example web page to look something like this.

5

00:00:20.250  -->  00:00:24.450
I think we can all agree that this page looks better than this.

6

00:00:24.480  -->  00:00:28.970
Now you already have all of the tools and knowledge necessary to do this.

7

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:31.690
I'm going to write all of the code together as a team.

8

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:33.810
So let's get started.

9

00:00:33.810  -->  00:00:38.830
The first thing that we will do is assigned a different background color to the overall page.

10

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:42.890
So instead of white Let's choose a green color.

11

00:00:43.410  -->  00:00:45.840
I'm using Adobe Photoshop color picker.

12

00:00:45.840  -->  00:00:47.880
If you don't have photoshop that's OK.

13

00:00:47.970  -->  00:00:52.650
Simply perform a web search for H TNL color picker.

14

00:00:52.650  -->  00:01:00.240
So I've chosen this shade of green so I will copy and paste this 6 character hexadecimal color code

15

00:01:03.600  -->  00:01:11.790
and in our CSS I will target the H TNL element that is the ultimate container of our entire page.

16

00:01:11.790  -->  00:01:14.370
It's one level up even from the body tag.

17

00:01:14.430  -->  00:01:19.660
So we're selecting HVM now and then we'll just assign it a background color.

18

00:01:19.710  -->  00:01:24.050
So this is your first time in the course seeing hexadecimal color codes.

19

00:01:24.090  -->  00:01:28.540
Usually we've been typing in simple keywords for colors.

20

00:01:28.620  -->  00:01:34.800
So when you have a hexadecimal color code it's six characters long and you include a pound symbol before

21

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:35.430
it.

22

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:36.590
It's that simple.

23

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:42.490
So this character code represents a very specific unique shade of green.

24

00:01:42.710  -->  00:01:47.370
So if I save and refresh we can see that it's been applied.

25

00:01:47.370  -->  00:01:52.330
Next let's give the container for our web site's content a background color of white.

26

00:01:52.740  -->  00:01:54.830
So you will remember that in the HMO.

27

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:58.800
All of our content lives within a div with a class of container.

28

00:01:58.820  -->  00:02:02.760
So in our C Ss we already have a rule for container.

29

00:02:02.760  -->  00:02:11.100
Simply say background color or use the hexadecimal color code for white which is six F's but you can

30

00:02:11.100  -->  00:02:13.190
shorten it to just three F's.

31

00:02:13.680  -->  00:02:17.080
So if we save and refresh we can see that that's taken place.

32

00:02:17.130  -->  00:02:22.350
Next let's add padding on the left and right of our container so that the content doesn't sit right

33

00:02:22.350  -->  00:02:34.480
up against the edge container padding left we'll say 40 pixels padding right 40 pixels.

34

00:02:35.160  -->  00:02:36.120
That looks excellent.

35

00:02:36.120  -->  00:02:39.410
However it changed the overall width of the container.

36

00:02:39.600  -->  00:02:44.260
So now instead of having a width of 940 our container is over 1000 pixels wide.

37

00:02:44.490  -->  00:02:51.870
So you remember from an earlier lesson we can simply say box sizing border box and then the padding

38

00:02:51.870  -->  00:02:52.460
will remain.

39

00:02:52.470  -->  00:02:56.280
But it doesn't change the overall calculated width of the element.

40

00:02:56.280  -->  00:02:57.860
So this looks good.

41

00:02:57.930  -->  00:03:03.480
However by adding padding to the container element that reduced the available space for our column so

42

00:03:03.500  -->  00:03:06.060
we can see that they no longer fit side by side.

43

00:03:06.330  -->  00:03:11.890
So we need to adjust there with values instead of using pixels we used percentages.

44

00:03:12.060  -->  00:03:18.470
The main column will be 66 percent of the available width and the sidebar will take up 34 percent.

45

00:03:18.660  -->  00:03:21.950
So we can see that our columns are in place once again.

46

00:03:21.950  -->  00:03:26.500
Next let's add a bit of space between the main column and the side bar.

47

00:03:26.730  -->  00:03:30.700
We just added 40 pixels of padding to the container here.

48

00:03:30.720  -->  00:03:33.920
So I think 40 pixels between the two columns would look good.

49

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:40.250
So in our code I will target the main column and I will give it a bit of padding right.

50

00:03:40.560  -->  00:03:41.720
Forty pixels.

51

00:03:41.730  -->  00:03:48.150
Now if we save this we'll break the layout because the main column is now trying to take up 66 percent

52

00:03:48.150  -->  00:03:51.620
of the width and add 40 pixels of padding on the right.

53

00:03:51.750  -->  00:03:57.230
So we remember that in order to stop the padding from adding to the overall calculated with we can say

54

00:03:57.240  -->  00:04:01.330
box sizing border box.

55

00:04:01.410  -->  00:04:01.920
Excellent.

56

00:04:01.920  -->  00:04:06.450
Now just a quick detail I noticed that there's more text in the sidebar than the main area which is

57

00:04:06.450  -->  00:04:09.420
completely backwards so let's fix that very quickly.

58

00:04:09.750  -->  00:04:19.170
So I'll paste in a bit a new text into the main column and paste into a new text for the sidebar and

59

00:04:19.170  -->  00:04:20.640
that looks much better.

60

00:04:20.970  -->  00:04:28.230
Next I think I'll change the font for the overall page so to do that will target the body element and

61

00:04:28.230  -->  00:04:33.280
we use the font family property or use a font name to Houma.

62

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:40.170
And if someone's device doesn't have that font installed we will fall back to use any Sans of fun.

63

00:04:40.290  -->  00:04:46.050
Now don't worry too much about this line we will cover CSSA typography in an entire detailed lesson

64

00:04:46.050  -->  00:04:51.720
later on the course but for now this should do the trick so we can see that that changed the font but

65

00:04:51.720  -->  00:04:54.440
the font overall looks a bit too large now.

66

00:04:54.750  -->  00:05:00.330
So I will include another property targeting the body element font size.

67

00:05:00.330  -->  00:05:05.880
Bring it down to 87 percent overall that looks much better.

68

00:05:05.920  -->  00:05:11.400
That was a great example of how powerful the cascade and inheritance are by simply targeting the one

69

00:05:11.410  -->  00:05:12.400
body element.

70

00:05:12.460  -->  00:05:17.770
These font properties are inherited and are cascaded down to the entire page.

71

00:05:18.100  -->  00:05:21.630
Next let's adjust the spacing in the header.

72

00:05:21.630  -->  00:05:27.190
I think there should be less space between this line and this line and there should be more space above

73

00:05:27.190  -->  00:05:28.410
the first line.

74

00:05:28.440  -->  00:05:31.440
First we'll address the space between the two lines.

75

00:05:31.560  -->  00:05:37.600
To do that we'll create a new rule in our CSSA file will target the heading level one element within

76

00:05:37.600  -->  00:05:45.760
the header and remove the margin and then will also select the paragraph element in the header and remove

77

00:05:45.750  -->  00:05:48.190
its margin as well.

78

00:05:48.190  -->  00:05:56.340
Now let's add a bit of space above the main title to do that will simply target the header itself and

79

00:05:56.350  -->  00:05:59.900
say padding top 20 pixels.

80

00:06:00.370  -->  00:06:01.980
It's also about a bit of space on the bottom

81

00:06:04.810  -->  00:06:08.390
so the spacing of the header looks a lot better now.

82

00:06:08.470  -->  00:06:11.690
Next let's adjust the color of the text in the header.

83

00:06:11.980  -->  00:06:19.360
So let's choose a slightly darker green shade and picking a darker color and you can see the hexadecimal

84

00:06:19.360  -->  00:06:21.120
color code is different now.

85

00:06:21.220  -->  00:06:25.750
So we'll say all elements that live inside the header element.

86

00:06:26.410  -->  00:06:35.670
So all of this content should have a color of this shade of green that looks nice.

87

00:06:35.680  -->  00:06:39.610
Let's make this heading level one element not be bold.

88

00:06:40.540  -->  00:06:44.720
Here's the rule for that font weight normal.

89

00:06:44.740  -->  00:06:48.730
And also let's actually give it a smaller font size as well.

90

00:06:49.120  -->  00:06:51.000
That looks a lot better.

91

00:06:51.100  -->  00:06:58.240
Next let's choose a better color or a more subtle color for these border lines.

92

00:06:58.330  -->  00:06:59.840
Hop over to our color picker.

93

00:07:00.040  -->  00:07:04.860
And I want to choose a very light green about that.

94

00:07:05.130  -->  00:07:07.660
So we'll copy that color code.

95

00:07:08.250  -->  00:07:14.560
We'll find the content area that has the top and bottom borders and instead of black or paste and our

96

00:07:14.560  -->  00:07:19.200
color code that looks much better.

97

00:07:19.450  -->  00:07:27.250
Next let's give this sidebar area a background color that matches these new subtle borders.

98

00:07:27.320  -->  00:07:29.040
We'll find the rule for our Sidebar.

99

00:07:29.050  -->  00:07:34.850
Here it is background color paste in the light green.

100

00:07:35.000  -->  00:07:40.840
OK we can see that we need a bit of padding on this so that the text doesn't sit right up against the

101

00:07:40.840  -->  00:07:46.070
edges padding left 40 pixels padding right.

102

00:07:46.420  -->  00:07:52.920
Forty pixels and we can see that once again by adding horizontal padding we've broken the layout because

103

00:07:52.930  -->  00:07:58.630
the sidebar is now trying to use up 34 percent of the width plus this extra room for padding.

104

00:07:58.870  -->  00:08:05.650
So we know to fix that box sizing border box much better.

105

00:08:05.920  -->  00:08:13.380
Let's go ahead and make the sidebar use a slightly smaller font size than the main column side bar font

106

00:08:13.380  -->  00:08:18.160
size to go with 85 percent.

107

00:08:18.160  -->  00:08:19.520
That looks great.

108

00:08:19.550  -->  00:08:22.390
Next let's give the footer a bit of attention.

109

00:08:22.690  -->  00:08:25.610
So I think this will look better if it was horizontally centered.

110

00:08:25.620  -->  00:08:27.790
So Target the foot or in the style sheet.

111

00:08:28.140  -->  00:08:33.420
Text the line center much better now because this is fuller text.

112

00:08:33.420  -->  00:08:35.430
We don't want to draw the human eye to it.

113

00:08:35.470  -->  00:08:44.530
So let's make it a bit smaller and also use a color that's more subtle to font size 85 percent and color

114

00:08:44.550  -->  00:08:45.020
.

115

00:08:45.540  -->  00:08:47.390
I'll go with a lighter gray.

116

00:08:47.450  -->  00:08:49.400
Nine nine nine.

117

00:08:49.620  -->  00:08:50.420
That looks great.

118

00:08:50.500  -->  00:08:59.650
Let's add a bit of space below the footer padding bottom 20 pixels and also give an extra bit of space

119

00:08:59.640  -->  00:09:05.550
on top so padding top 20 pixels that looks much better.

120

00:09:05.560  -->  00:09:07.290
Our layout is almost complete.

121

00:09:07.300  -->  00:09:09.530
Let's make a few minor adjustments.

122

00:09:09.550  -->  00:09:13.980
I think the sidebar would look better if they had a bit of vertical padding above and below the text

123

00:09:14.730  -->  00:09:16.960
so it will find the sidebar.

124

00:09:17.320  -->  00:09:25.680
We will add a few new declarations padding top 20 pixels padding bottom 20 pixels.

125

00:09:25.840  -->  00:09:27.530
I think that looks a lot better.

126

00:09:27.630  -->  00:09:31.440
Now I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't show you a quick tip to write cleaner code.

127

00:09:31.720  -->  00:09:39.760
So you can see that we have four declarations just to control padding on this one element.

128

00:09:39.750  -->  00:09:45.180
Now there's something named CSSA shorthand which will allow us to write much cleaner code.

129

00:09:45.280  -->  00:09:54.010
So all we wanted is 40 pixels of padding horizontally and 20 pixels of padding vertically.

130

00:09:54.580  -->  00:09:56.890
So we can say padding.

131

00:09:56.940  -->  00:10:02.730
And then we can include four values so the top value comes first goes in a clockwise fashion.

132

00:10:02.740  -->  00:10:05.120
If you think of a clock moving its hand around.

133

00:10:05.230  -->  00:10:09.540
So we start at the top 20 then on the right we want 40 pixels.

134

00:10:09.630  -->  00:10:13.310
Then on the bottom we want 20 and then on the left we want 40.

135

00:10:13.330  -->  00:10:16.050
So if we save in C nothing changes.

136

00:10:16.140  -->  00:10:21.850
It's the exact same as if we still had four different declarations for padding top padding right padding

137

00:10:21.850  -->  00:10:22.980
bottom.

138

00:10:23.020  -->  00:10:29.040
Now with CSS shorthand for padding we can take this even a step further instead of having all four values

139

00:10:29.050  -->  00:10:30.780
in a clockwise fashion.

140

00:10:30.820  -->  00:10:37.310
We can simply include one value for vertical up and down and one value for horizontal.

141

00:10:37.380  -->  00:10:40.900
So this will achieve the same thing as well.

142

00:10:40.960  -->  00:10:43.640
So that's your first taste of CSF shorthand.

143

00:10:43.750  -->  00:10:48.490
We will be finding out that there is different shorthand for different properties throughout the remainder

144

00:10:48.490  -->  00:10:53.900
of this course and it will allow you to write much cleaner more succinct code.

145

00:10:53.910  -->  00:11:00.040
Now that's going to bring this lesson to a close I will mention that I'm aware this layout looks a bit

146

00:11:00.040  -->  00:11:01.470
dated.

147

00:11:01.840  -->  00:11:08.430
So this does not look like the most modern beautifully visually pleasing Web site but you need to walk

148

00:11:08.430  -->  00:11:09.730
before you can run.

149

00:11:09.930  -->  00:11:15.660
So in future lessons we will be learning how to create more modern flexible looking layouts but I think

150

00:11:15.660  -->  00:11:21.070
this was a good first step and a good exercise in combining all of your existing knowledge and applying

151

00:11:21.070  -->  00:11:22.440
it to a real example.

152

00:11:22.440  -->  00:11:26.790
Just a quick heads up that if you have a spare moment or two I would really appreciate it if you could

153

00:11:26.800  -->  00:11:29.580
go and rate and review this course.

154

00:11:29.590  -->  00:11:32.170
I hope you're enjoying the course and finding it helpful.

155

00:11:32.230  -->  00:11:36.620
But even if you're not above all else an honest review is the best review.

156
