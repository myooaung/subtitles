00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:05,780
If you've made it to this lesson it's safe to assume that you are now familiar with H.

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:06,880
TNL.

3

00:00:07,380  -->  00:00:11,010
Well congratulations you've made it to the fun part of the Course.

4

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:19,200
This is where we learn about C S S S S stands for cascading style sheets and it's the way that we add

5

00:00:19,440  -->  00:00:24,190
color and layout and style and design to our web pages.

6

00:00:24,270  -->  00:00:29,080
In other words each TMF is how we describe our content.

7

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:32,990
CSSA is how we describe our presentation.

8

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:35,060
That's enough for an introduction.

9

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:39,990
I'm excited to get started because this is one of the most exciting parts of becoming a web developer

10

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:40,270
.

11

00:00:40,320  -->  00:00:42,930
Your first taste of CSX.

12

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:49,440
So in front of you is an example page and let's immediately hop over to our text editor and let's learn

13

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:53,960
how to attach a bit of CSSA code to a web page.

14

00:00:53,970  -->  00:01:01,110
Now we know that the content for a web page lives within the body element and we know that information

15

00:01:01,200  -->  00:01:04,650
about the page is stored in the head element.

16

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:08,310
So currently we have the character set and the overall title of the page.

17

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:14,390
Let's include a new line of code in the head section to attach a bit of CSSA link.

18

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:20,070
We're going to link to another file with CSSA code will give you an attribute of raÃºl which stands for

19

00:01:20,070  -->  00:01:25,430
relationship the relationship of what we're linking to is a stylesheet.

20

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:28,620
Hence the name Cascading Style Sheet.

21

00:01:28,980  -->  00:01:31,870
And then we include an additional attribute named A-Trak.

22

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:38,130
And this is where we point to where the new CSSA file will live in the same folder as where the web

23

00:01:38,130  -->  00:01:40,280
page lives indexed or HMO.

24

00:01:40,440  -->  00:01:44,930
I'm going to create a new folder to stay organized and I'm going to name this new folder.

25

00:01:45,310  -->  00:01:52,170
SS Now let's create a new file within this new CSSA folder new file in the CSSA folder and you could

26

00:01:52,170  -->  00:01:54,170
name the file anything that you would like.

27

00:01:54,240  -->  00:01:57,910
You just want to make sure that it ends with an extension of dot CSS.

28

00:01:58,080  -->  00:02:00,500
So I'll name it screen.

29

00:02:01,170  -->  00:02:03,620
So we now have a blank CSSA file.

30

00:02:03,630  -->  00:02:09,380
Now back in index that HVM now we want to point to that file inside this Atra if attribute.

31

00:02:09,450  -->  00:02:13,280
So we want to dig into the CSSA for them and then forward slash.

32

00:02:13,320  -->  00:02:19,680
Once we're in the field there and then we'll type the name of the new CSSA file screen CSX.

33

00:02:19,830  -->  00:02:23,100
Now we've successfully added a link to an empty stylesheet.

34

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:29,280
Let's hop over to that empty style sheet and write our first ever bit of CSSA code.

35

00:02:29,460  -->  00:02:31,040
So we'll give ourselves a goal.

36

00:02:31,050  -->  00:02:36,390
Our goal is that we want this text example Heading to be orange.

37

00:02:36,390  -->  00:02:38,120
So enter a new blank file.

38

00:02:38,160  -->  00:02:44,710
We will write each one curly brackets color orange.

39

00:02:44,900  -->  00:02:50,130
So if I save refresh in the web browser Whyalla we can see the heading is orange.

40

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:54,160
So let's review the syntax that we just used to make that happen.

41

00:02:54,360  -->  00:03:01,660
This entire bit of code is known as a CSSA rule the siestas rule begins with a selector.

42

00:03:01,770  -->  00:03:04,710
In this case we used H-1 as our selector.

43

00:03:04,710  -->  00:03:10,770
And this is simply letting the web browser know which element we want to select to begin styling.

44

00:03:10,770  -->  00:03:19,050
So we selected the one element which lives here on the web page and it says example heading then within

45

00:03:19,050  -->  00:03:24,570
the curly brackets we can specify how we want to style the element that we selected.

46

00:03:24,570  -->  00:03:29,420
So color is a property and we're giving it a value of orange.

47

00:03:29,520  -->  00:03:36,030
When we combine a property with a value it's known as a declaration and we can have as many declarations

48

00:03:36,330  -->  00:03:38,690
in a siestas rule as we would like.

49

00:03:38,730  -->  00:03:45,840
So if we want to center the text you can say text a line which is the property and then give it a value

50

00:03:45,900  -->  00:03:47,760
of center.

51

00:03:47,760  -->  00:03:52,590
So if I save and refresh I can see that that changes taking place.

52

00:03:52,590  -->  00:03:58,880
Let's give ourselves another goal let's style the paragraph elements on the page to be green.

53

00:03:58,980  -->  00:04:03,740
So that would include this element this element and this element.

54

00:04:03,870  -->  00:04:08,680
So we hop over to our style sheet and we'll create a new rule.

55

00:04:09,210  -->  00:04:14,840
The first step is a selector we want to select the p or paragraph elements.

56

00:04:15,060  -->  00:04:21,750
Open up our curly brackets the properties color and we'll give it a value of green.

57

00:04:21,790  -->  00:04:23,010
So this is our declaration.

58

00:04:23,010  -->  00:04:28,290
We include a colon after the property and a semi-colon after the value.

59

00:04:28,290  -->  00:04:32,960
So I'll save and refresh and we can see that the paragraphs are now green.

60

00:04:32,970  -->  00:04:37,470
That's it for this lesson you've learned a great deal of new material so let's review.

61

00:04:37,770  -->  00:04:43,860
We learned that a style sheet is a simple text file that anyone can create and then we simply link to

62

00:04:43,860  -->  00:04:47,520
it from our HVM file in the head section.

63

00:04:47,520  -->  00:04:54,780
We learn that style sheets are made up of different rules and a rule is made up of a selector and declarations

64

00:04:54,790  -->  00:04:55,010
.

65

00:04:55,320  -->  00:05:01,440
And we learned that a declaration is nothing more than a property and the value in our next lesson we

66

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:05,070
will learn that there are all sorts of different types of selectors.

67

00:05:05,190  -->  00:05:10,050
So there are different ways to target very specific or unique elements on your page.

68

00:05:10,050  -->  00:05:15,070
So we'll delve into the wide world of selectors in our next lesson and that should be a lot of fun.

69

00:05:15,090  -->  00:05:16,880
I'll see you in the next lesson.
