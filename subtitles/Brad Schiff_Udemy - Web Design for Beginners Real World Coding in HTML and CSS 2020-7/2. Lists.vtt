00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:07.980
A key factor in writing clean semantically rich h tim now is choosing the correct element to describe

2

00:00:07.980  -->  00:00:10.160
a particular bit of content.

3

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:15.450
So for example in an earlier lesson we learned how to create a bullet list.

4

00:00:15.480  -->  00:00:21.420
But in this lesson we will learn that HTML offers many different list types and sometimes it's a bit

5

00:00:21.420  -->  00:00:25.880
tricky knowing which list type to use to describe your list content.

6

00:00:26.220  -->  00:00:32.250
However by the end of this lesson you will have a firm grasp of the three most common list types.

7

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:34.050
So let's get started.

8

00:00:34.050  -->  00:00:39.030
We will begin with a list type that you've already seen in action from an earlier lesson.

9

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:40.770
The Unordered list.

10

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:45.930
We choose the unordered list when the ordering of the list items do not matter.

11

00:00:45.930  -->  00:00:51.270
This means by changing the order of the list items we're not changing the meaning of the list as a whole

12

00:00:51.270  -->  00:00:51.630
.

13

00:00:51.630  -->  00:00:59.520
So a good example of this would be a grocery list unordered list list item.

14

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:03.060
Milk bread

15

00:01:05.540  -->  00:01:06.980
carrots.

16

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:11.970
So if we save and refreshing the browser receive bulleted list and the key point here is that it doesn't

17

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:14.400
matter if carrots came first.

18

00:01:14.430  -->  00:01:20.400
That doesn't change the inherent meaning of this grocery list to clearly illustrate this point.

19

00:01:20.400  -->  00:01:22.100
Let's look at something different.

20

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:25.340
Let's look at an ordered list.

21

00:01:25.380  -->  00:01:29.120
So in the text editor will create a new list instead of UL.

22

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:35.100
We use o l which stands for ordered list.

23

00:01:35.460  -->  00:01:44.630
It also accepts list item like elements as children and will create a list of our morning routine.

24

00:01:45.090  -->  00:01:49.740
So the first list item is wake up.

25

00:01:49.740  -->  00:02:01.110
Then brush teeth then shower then eat breakfast.

26

00:02:01.140  -->  00:02:08.490
If I save and refresh the browser we see that instead of a bulleted list we receive a numbered list

27

00:02:08.990  -->  00:02:12.900
and this is because the ordering matters with an ordered list.

28

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:16.890
The ordering is changing the meaning of the list as a whole.

29

00:02:16.890  -->  00:02:23.130
So if I'm showing you my morning routine it matters that these items are in a specific order to remember

30

00:02:23.130  -->  00:02:24.480
with the unordered list.

31

00:02:24.480  -->  00:02:27.560
We said that it doesn't matter if Carrots was moved to the top.

32

00:02:27.570  -->  00:02:31.510
It's still the same grocery list but with our ordered list.

33

00:02:31.590  -->  00:02:32.380
What if I moved.

34

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:39.450
Eat breakfast to sit before wake up all of a sudden this numbered list or this ordered list doesn't

35

00:02:39.450  -->  00:02:40.710
make any sense.

36

00:02:40.740  -->  00:02:43.750
How can you eat breakfast if you didn't first wake up.

37

00:02:44.010  -->  00:02:47.350
So let's go ahead and revert that back to the original order.

38

00:02:47.580  -->  00:02:52.240
And this was all just a long winded way of saying that if the ordering of your items doesn't matter

39

00:02:52.250  -->  00:02:52.280
.

40

00:02:52.290  -->  00:02:54.420
Use an unordered list.

41

00:02:54.550  -->  00:02:56.740
You will and if the ordering does matter.

42

00:02:56.760  -->  00:02:59.790
Use an oh well ordered list.

43

00:02:59.790  -->  00:03:02.370
Now let's talk about the third type of list.

44

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:05.050
The description list.

45

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:09.020
I think the name is self-explanatory but let's see it in action.

46

00:03:09.150  -->  00:03:10.470
Let's give ourselves a goal.

47

00:03:10.620  -->  00:03:16.290
Let's imagine that we want to describe a book so this would include mentioning things like the title

48

00:03:16.410  -->  00:03:17.670
the name of the author.

49

00:03:17.700  -->  00:03:25.860
The number of pages the code for the description list element is simply DL.

50

00:03:25.860  -->  00:03:30.920
Now let's begin with the title of this imaginary book inside a DL element.

51

00:03:30.930  -->  00:03:32.620
We begin with the DTL element.

52

00:03:32.640  -->  00:03:35.270
The stands for description term.

53

00:03:35.490  -->  00:03:42.000
So the first term that we're describing is the title of the book directly following the ditty element

54

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:42.110
.

55

00:03:42.150  -->  00:03:43.680
We add a DD.

56

00:03:43.710  -->  00:03:46.120
This is simply the actual description.

57

00:03:46.260  -->  00:03:51.910
So the title of the book is an imaginary book title.

58

00:03:52.320  -->  00:03:55.590
Let's go ahead and add a colon after title.

59

00:03:55.740  -->  00:03:58.440
Next let's include the author.

60

00:03:58.440  -->  00:04:08.060
So we'll create a another DC element author that may include a DD element.

61

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:13.270
Brad Schiff is the author of this imaginary book let's include the number of pages.

62

00:04:13.290  -->  00:04:23.250
So when you get the description term term is pages actually number of pages and the description will

63

00:04:23.250  -->  00:04:26.570
say that this book has 500 pages.

64

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:32.550
Now if we save and then view this in our web browser you can see here is our description list.

65

00:04:32.700  -->  00:04:40.980
Let's review the code structure for creating description lists for each item or thing that we are describing

66

00:04:40.980  -->  00:04:41.010
.

67

00:04:41.010  -->  00:04:48.660
We create one overall description list and then within that we create pairings of terms and descriptions

68

00:04:48.660  -->  00:04:49.320
.

69

00:04:49.320  -->  00:04:55.400
Now it's important to point out that a term can have multiple descriptions associated with it.

70

00:04:55.410  -->  00:05:02.070
So for example if the book had multiple authors we can simply include a another DD element associated

71

00:05:02.070  -->  00:05:11.970
with this term with the ditty so we could say John Doe is the second author of the book the description

72

00:05:11.970  -->  00:05:13.480
list is very versatile.

73

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:19.860
So here we've used that as an example to describe a book but we could also use it as a glossary of terms

74

00:05:19.950  -->  00:05:23.840
if we were writing an article and we use phrases or terms that aren't commonly known.

75

00:05:24.030  -->  00:05:29.700
We would simply include the word in the element and then a definition or description of the word in

76

00:05:29.700  -->  00:05:34.320
the Deedy element that's going to bring this lesson to a close to review.

77

00:05:34.320  -->  00:05:38.040
We can use an unordered list when the ordering doesn't matter.

78

00:05:38.220  -->  00:05:43.750
We can use an ordered list when the ordering does matter and we can use a description list and we're

79

00:05:43.770  -->  00:05:45.780
describing something.

80

00:05:45.780  -->  00:05:47.600
I'll see you in the next lesson.
