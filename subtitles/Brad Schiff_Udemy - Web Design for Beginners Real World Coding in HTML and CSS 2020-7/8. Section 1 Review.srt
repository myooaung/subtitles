00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:07,220
Before we move on here's a quick review of what we've learned in the first section of this course.

2

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:11,540
Number one we've learned that HVM mail is incredibly ubiquitous.

3

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:12,920
It's everywhere.

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:16,240
Obviously every web page is made up of HMO.

5

00:00:16,350  -->  00:00:21,850
But even beyond that once we start talking about device native apps on your smartphone or tablet.

6

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:27,630
Many of these apps have some sort of HTL rendering engine embedded in them.

7

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:32,410
So there are many times when you probably don't even realize you're viewing HVM content.

8

00:00:32,580  -->  00:00:34,110
It's everywhere.

9

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:40,200
Number two we learned that web pages are made up of elements and creating an element is like making

10

00:00:40,200  -->  00:00:41,510
a sandwich.

11

00:00:41,540  -->  00:00:43,640
The first piece of bread is the Start Tag.

12

00:00:43,740  -->  00:00:48,300
Then you include the peanut butter and jelly or the meat the content and then you include a second piece

13

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:48,760
of bread.

14

00:00:48,780  -->  00:00:56,640
The closing tag number three we've learned that elements can nest or stack inside one another much like

15

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:59,820
the example of a set of Russian stacking dolls.

16

00:00:59,820  -->  00:01:07,890
So to create a bullet list an HMO we take multiple list item like elements and we nest them inside an

17

00:01:07,980  -->  00:01:10,020
unordered list element.

18

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:13,130
Number four we learned about document structure.

19

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:20,010
So we learned that all of our web pages have the root element of HTL and then inside that element we

20

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:26,160
have the head section and the body section in the body section where we include content while the head

21

00:01:26,160  -->  00:01:30,200
section is where we include information about the page.

22

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:35,220
Finally number five we learned about HTML attributes.

23

00:01:35,220  -->  00:01:41,160
We learned that we can assign attributes to certain age TNL elements to make them come alive.

24

00:01:41,160  -->  00:01:47,940
In particular we learned how to use the ref attribute on the link element to make our link fully functional

25

00:01:47,960  -->  00:01:48,210
.

26

00:01:48,510  -->  00:01:53,220
And we discussed that in future lessons we'll learn how to use different attributes on other elements

27

00:01:53,220  -->  00:01:53,580
.

28

00:01:53,580  -->  00:01:57,930
Just a quick heads up that if you have a spare moment or two I would really appreciate it if you could

29

00:01:57,930  -->  00:02:00,720
go and rate and review this course.

30

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:03,290
I hope you're enjoying the course and finding it helpful.

31

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:07,760
But even if you're not above all else an honest review is the best review.

32

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:12,960
And I would love for prospective students to be able to see honest impressions of the course.

33

00:02:13,200  -->  00:02:17,050
That concludes this quick review for the first section of the course.

34

00:02:17,050  -->  00:02:18,650
I'll see you in the next section.
