00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:05.510
In this lesson we will learn about each TMLC comments.

2

00:00:05.610  -->  00:00:12.780
A comment is simply a bit of text that we include in our age DMO code that will not be rendered or displayed

3

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:14.090
by the web browser.

4

00:00:14.130  -->  00:00:19.780
So that means we can include text in a comment to explain our code for ourselves.

5

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:25.160
A comment is basically in line documentation for your own code.

6

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:27.240
Let's take a look at a quick example.

7

00:00:27.240  -->  00:00:32.010
Here we are in a text editor and I'm looking at the code for this example page that we've seen in earlier

8

00:00:32.010  -->  00:00:32.910
lessons.

9

00:00:32.910  -->  00:00:39.480
And let's imagine that I want to leave a comment for myself to stay organized to begin the comment.

10

00:00:39.570  -->  00:00:48.000
You use the less than symbol and then the exclamation mark and then two dashes then go ahead and space

11

00:00:48.060  -->  00:00:50.030
and then you can begin typing your comment.

12

00:00:50.160  -->  00:00:57.750
So I will say this is where the main text of the article begins.

13

00:00:57.750  -->  00:01:03.450
Then to close your comment go ahead in space and then include two more dashes and then obviously at

14

00:01:03.450  -->  00:01:06.720
the end is the greater than symbol.

15

00:01:06.750  -->  00:01:12.070
Now if I save and refresh the browser we can see that that text is not appearing.

16

00:01:12.180  -->  00:01:16.050
If it was going to appear it would show about right here.

17

00:01:16.050  -->  00:01:22.200
So this means we can include comments anywhere in our HMO in order to explain the structure of our code

18

00:01:22.210  -->  00:01:22.340
.

19

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:28.260
So that way if we revisit the Page Six months from now the comments will help explain things.

20

00:01:28.410  -->  00:01:34.170
Or if a different developer needs to pick up our page and work on it they will be very grateful for

21

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:35.570
our comments.

22

00:01:35.580  -->  00:01:39.630
I will let you decide where it makes the most sense to include comments in your code.

23

00:01:39.750  -->  00:01:45.450
But I will point out that one of the most standard practices in the industry is to include a comment

24

00:01:45.750  -->  00:01:52.890
when a div ends because as the complexity of your code grows more elements will be nested inside one

25

00:01:52.890  -->  00:01:58.800
another and you will not believe how helpful it is to have a bit of a marker of where an element clearly

26

00:01:58.800  -->  00:01:59.490
ends.

27

00:01:59.490  -->  00:02:09.090
So for example we can include a comment here that says this is where the article body div ends or to

28

00:02:09.090  -->  00:02:11.860
be a little bit less verbose.

29

00:02:11.910  -->  00:02:16.500
What I do is just include a forward slash and then the name of the div.

30

00:02:16.500  -->  00:02:20.000
So if we gave it a class of article body I simply type article body.

31

00:02:20.010  -->  00:02:25.320
Now the structure of this particular code is simple enough that we probably don't need this comment

32

00:02:25.530  -->  00:02:30.510
but believe me this is a good practice to get into because like I said is the complexity of your pages

33

00:02:30.510  -->  00:02:32.130
grow ending div.

34

00:02:32.130  -->  00:02:34.320
Comments are a true lifesaver.

35

00:02:34.650  -->  00:02:41.410
So please feel free to use HMO comments wherever you see fit and I will see you in the next lesson.
