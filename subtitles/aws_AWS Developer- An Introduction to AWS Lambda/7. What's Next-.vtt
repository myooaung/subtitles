00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.560
So we did a lot inside of this course.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.000
We worked with a variety of AWS services and tools,

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.570
including SES, the Simple Email Service, DynamoDB, and the AWS API Gateway.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.670
Now, all of this, of course,

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.240
is on top of using AWS Lambda and things like CloudWatch to trigger AWS

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.260
Lambda. From there, we learned about how we use the Boto 3 SDK inside of

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.270
the AWS Lambda runtime. Learning these core skills helped us to build a

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.880
variety of different projects,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.130
from a Lambda canary to Sparrow for our Twitter bot to Cuckoo for our

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.320
alerting notification system, and to our Users API where we learned how to

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.300
create an entire HTTP API with the Serverless Framework.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.030
So what might be next for us?

13
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.220
Well,

14
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.550
you could take my course on the Serverless Framework here on

15
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.680
Pluralsight, and you could learn more about how you could

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.440
develop with Node.js instead of Python.

17
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.900
You could also try using more AWS services in combination with AWS Lambda.

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.910
There's a lot more to learn, and I want to wish you the best of luck on your

19
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.720
journey and say thank you for taking this course.

20
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.080
Feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter or ask me more

21
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.960
about this course in the comments section.

22
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.860
I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the course and

23
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.000
resolve any issues that you might experience. Thanks, and I hope to see you in another course soon.
