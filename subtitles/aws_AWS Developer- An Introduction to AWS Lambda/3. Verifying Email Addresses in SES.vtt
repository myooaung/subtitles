00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.120
Back in the AWS Console, let's navigate to the Simple Email Service.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.510
You can also find this in the Services dropâ€‘down. From here, we'll

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.240
need to verify some email addresses so we can send and receive

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.500
email using the Simple Email Service.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.310
So let's click Verify a New Email Address and then

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.570
enter in some email addresses.

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.250
Now we're going to need to do more than one email verification here.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.340
Now, that's because we can't send and receive email from the same

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.180
email, because that'll start to look weird to our email provider, like

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.800
we're faking a letter to ourselves, basically.

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.540
So in order to get around this,

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.270
I've included a few different email addresses that I'll be

13
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.930
verifying inside of the sparrow.py file.

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.280
Now, in order to get around this,

15
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.180
I've included a few different email addresses, inside of the

16
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.970
cuckoo.py file, that I'll be verifying.

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.020
So if I scroll down,

18
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.780
you'll see that there's a FROM_ADDRESS and a REPLY_TO_ADDRESS. Now,

19
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.980
this address is going to need to be the same.

20
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.980
So whatever you use for this address,

21
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.170
make sure it's one that you can access because you'll need to check it

22
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.170
for a verification email from SES. So I'm going to go back with this

23
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370
email address and paste that in here into SES and click Verify This

24
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.940
Email Address. And then it's going to send me an email, and it'll say

25
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.750
pending verification until I log into that email address and click the

26
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.960
Verify link.

27
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.010
Now I'll also need to send a verification email to a few other addresses,

28
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.710
specifically the ones for my clients.

29
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.360
In this case, I just have one client,

30
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.640
which is me, to a Yahoo address that I just created.

31
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.480
And then I also have an employee of Springfield Homer at yahoo.com.

32
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.740
Now, Homer Simpson is going to be taking care of my puppy,

33
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.540
so I hope he does well. So I'll need to verify both of these email addresses.

34
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.140
Let's go back and click Verify a New Email Address, paste one of

35
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.710
these email addresses in, and then go back again and grab

36
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.570
Homer's address and paste it in here.

37
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.590
Now make sure that every time you do this these are email addresses that

38
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.650
you control and you can access. So over in Homer's email,

39
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.920
we can open up the email I just received to verify this address to be

40
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.100
able to receive messages from SES, and I can scroll down and click on

41
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.870
this link for the verification. Now, once I see this,

42
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.660
I should be able to close this link out and then go back

43
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.810
to the SES Management Console here.

44
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.960
Now,

45
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.070
I'm going to refresh this page, and you'll see that

46
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.640
springfield.homer is now verified.

47
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.410
Keep in mind that you can't use these email addresses, as these are mine,

48
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.170
and I have control over them, and you'll need to use your own email addresses

49
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.400
and verify them in your own AWS account. Also, then make sure that you update

50
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.640
those in the cuckoo.py file. So I'm going to do the exact same thing with the

51
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.340
other two emails without making you wait.

52
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.000
So now that I've verified all these addresses, I should be able to start testing code locally.
