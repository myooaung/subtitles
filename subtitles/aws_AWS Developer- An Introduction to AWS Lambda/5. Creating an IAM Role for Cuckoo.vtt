00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.670
In the AWS Management Console, we can go to the IAM section for

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.970
Identity and Access Management and then click on Roles.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.800
And from here, we'll need to create a new role for our Lambda function. Because

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.730
we want the trusted entity to be a Lambda function, we'll click Lambda here and

5
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.360
then click Next: Permissions. From there, we'll need to specify what policies we

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.630
want attached to our Lambda function.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.450
So I'm going to search for some premade manage policies from

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.210
AWS for the Simple Email Service, SES.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.580
I'm going to use the FullAccess policy in this case. Though, if we wanted to,

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.640
we could go in here and create a new policy that was specifying

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.140
only the methods that we need to send email.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.520
This will just be a little bit easier for right now.

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.790
So after I've checked this off,

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.080
I can go back to filter for more policies, and let's

15
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.310
look for the S3 policies that we need.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.270
Now, I could use either the S3FullAccess policy or the S3ReadOnlyAccess policy.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.800
In this case,

18
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.270
I'm going to stick with FullAccess so that if later on you

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.080
want to update your function to do more,

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.330
like write to S3, you'll be able to do that as well.

21
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.420
So, after I check this off, I should be able to go back and find one more policy.

22
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.350
I'm going to look for LambdaBasicExecutionRole,

23
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.720
and you'll see this as a managed policy, as well as other policies

24
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.190
that are associated with particular functions.

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.340
If you wanted to, you could compare these two different policies,

26
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.770
scroll down and see what the permissions are in each of those. Now

27
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.510
in the specific policy for one specific function, it's specifically

28
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.210
allocated to the function's name and the resources that are

29
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.940
affiliated with that function.

30
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.520
But in this case,

31
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.740
we haven't created the function yet, so we're going to need to stick with

32
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.730
this managed policy of AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole,

33
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.230
and that should have broad enough for permissions to allow

34
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.830
us to put logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

35
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.260
So once we've checked that off too, we can click Next:

36
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.590
Tags and Next: Review. Just on this page,

37
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.910
make sure that you're looking at the policies that are associated with this

38
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.610
role and that they include the SESFullAccess policy, the S3FullAccess

39
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.940
policy, and the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy.

40
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.410
Once you're sure that those are there, go ahead and click the Role name.

41
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.550
And I'm going to be really particular with how a title my role

42
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.890
because later on I'm going to use this inside of the AWS CLI and need

43
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.800
to be able to refer to it by name. So I'm going to use gpc, for

44
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.530
Globomantics Pet Care, _cuckoo_role.

45
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.820
Now, if you're not using this name,

46
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.410
just make sure that you copy down the exact name that you're

47
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.860
using so you can replace this value later on in some of the

48
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.440
commands that we'll be running.

49
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.010
So now I'm going to click Create role.

50
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.500
And now that this role is created,

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.650
we should be able to use it later on to create our Lambda function and

52
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:50.000
configure it to access those services. So let's go ahead and test out our function code now, back over in VS Code.
