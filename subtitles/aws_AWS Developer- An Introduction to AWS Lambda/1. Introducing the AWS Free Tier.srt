00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome to this module of my AWS Developer course,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,900
An Introduction to AWS Lambda.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,630
My name is Fernando Medina Corey,

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,850
and I'm excited to get you up and running with Amazon Web Services. In this

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,510
module, you'll start by creating an AWS free tier account.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,900
First, you'll learn what the AWS free tier is,

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,240
and then I'll walk you through the signâ€‘up process for an AWS account.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,150
After that,

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,510
you'll also learn how to stick to 100% free services by using the AWS free tier.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,260
But keep in mind that to really get the most out of this course

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,930
and out of AWS, you'll need to be willing to spend a few bucks

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,970
in the modules of this course.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,270
If you're worried about that though,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,860
you can follow along with some of these projects and then

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,530
immediately remove the resources associated with these projects

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,570
right after you create them and you're done with this course, and

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,140
then should keep your costs pretty limited.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,510
Now, after we walk through this whole process,

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,885
we're going to look at navigating the AWS console.

20
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,450
Specifically, we'll highlight the service areas and menus

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,160
that will interact within the course,

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,380
and we'll take a look at the particular AWS services that we'll be using.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,400
Lastly, we'll look at AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,610
We'll learn the basics of roles and policies and set up IAM

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,220
policies that we'll be using later on in the course using

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,040
something called the AWS policy generator.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,890
So let's get to it.

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,350
The AWS free tier is the single best way to get up and running with managed

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,330
infrastructure with little to no cost. With free tier,

30
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,270
you have access to a selection of AWS services at no charge as long as you

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,010
stay within certain usage thresholds. You can spin up a virtual machine on

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,410
Amazon EC2 or execute your code in Lambda functions.

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,460
You could also take advantage of Amazon's managed databases with either the

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,340
managed NoSQL DynamoDB database or a managed relational database running

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,700
inside of Amazon's RDS, or Relational Database Service.

36
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,840
This could be anything from MySQL to PosgreSQL or another of the

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
hosted database options that Amazon offers.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,600
You could also take advantage of other services like the Simple

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,300
Email Service to build an email functionality to your applications

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,770
or Amazon's Simple Storage Service, S3, to easily store files and

41
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,440
other objects in the cloud.

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,670
Now, the best part of each of these services is that for the

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,440
first 12 months of using AWS with the free tier,

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,470
you get substantial utility at no cost.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,340
That's not to say you can do anything with any of

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,140
these services for those 12 months,

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,910
but you're going to get a pretty substantial amount.

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,580
So let's take a look at some examples of using the AWS free tier.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,900
We could run an EC2 instance for 750 hours a month.

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,380
Now, this instance would have to be of a particular size,

51
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,790
and it happens to be one of the smaller ones, but that would be

52
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,160
enough to let us use it for 24 hours a day,

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,570
7 days a week.

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,650
We could also execute up to 1 million Lambda functions a month or use 25 GB of

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,290
DynamoDB storage or 20 GB of a relational database storage.

56
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,500
You could also store up to 5 GB worth of files and other objects in S3,

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,790
and all of this would be included in the free tear,

58
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,300
along with a lot of other usage from different services and a few

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,040
aspects of these services like DynamoDB provisioned read and write

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
capacity that would be included in these examples.

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,880
Now, in this course,

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll be trying to stick to the limitations of the AWS free

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,510
tier at the time this course is published.

64
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,110
But when we're using a service that isn't explicitly free,

65
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,230
I'll let you know so you can decide if you'd like to use it or not.

66
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,500
Keep in mind that you'll need to manage your own billing for

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,090
AWS, so be sure to read the service details and charges in

68
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,290
depth if you're concerned about costs,

69
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,400
especially because the free tier could change over time, and I can't guarantee

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,790
that what I'm showing you right now will always be the case.

71
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,530
So, what projects could you actually build with these

72
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,740
services and the AWS free tier?

73
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,280
Well, you could set up a static website without a custom domain name on S3,

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,620
and you can host this on the web for anyone to access. As long as you didn't

75
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,200
need to go to www.fernando.com in order to access the site,

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,840
you could have it hosted and available for anybody to access up in S3.

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,770
You can also create and use a relational database or a virtual

78
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,610
machine instance, and either one of these would let you do some

79
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,490
pretty cool stuff with your applications without having to pay

80
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,540
anything within that first year.

81
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,520
But for most of this course, we'll be taking advantage of the 1

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,490
million free Lambda function invocations that AWS provides, and

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,990
we'll also be taking advantage, in the later sections of this

84
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,910
course, of the free tier of API Gateway,

85
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:27,000
another service that AWS includes within that free tier. So enough talking about the AWS free tier. Let's go ahead and sign up ourselves.
