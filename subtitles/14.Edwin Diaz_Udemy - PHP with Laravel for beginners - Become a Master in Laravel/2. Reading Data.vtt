00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.790
All right.

2

00:00:00.790  -->  00:00:03.450
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:03.600  -->  00:00:08.270
So on this lecture here we are going to be learning about eloquent.

4

00:00:08.310  -->  00:00:14.220
All right which is the functionality of Claribel there is actually one of the most popular ones because

5

00:00:14.220  -->  00:00:22.960
it allows us to do a lot of database queries in a very easy easy format a lot easier than raw as well

6

00:00:22.970  -->  00:00:23.020
.

7

00:00:23.050  -->  00:00:26.250
OK so now how does it work.

8

00:00:26.250  -->  00:00:31.890
This is the part where it gets most confusing in our and I want you to pay very close attention because

9

00:00:31.890  -->  00:00:32.930
you need to get this.

10

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:33.600
OK.

11

00:00:33.870  -->  00:00:40.560
So let's start with this real quick and using routes from the beginning of this course.

12

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:44.690
We could however use a controller and display the information on The View.

13

00:00:44.720  -->  00:00:45.410
OK.

14

00:00:45.900  -->  00:00:50.970
I'm using routes because it's a lot easier to show you this information here now and then later on that

15

00:00:50.970  -->  00:00:52.900
will apply to a project.

16

00:00:52.900  -->  00:00:53.650
All right.

17

00:00:54.060  -->  00:00:58.210
So what is a model.

18

00:00:58.270  -->  00:01:04.290
In our bill how do we control the model how do we access the information from the model how we actually

19

00:01:04.290  -->  00:01:05.780
use it right.

20

00:01:05.910  -->  00:01:07.520
How can we what is a model right.

21

00:01:07.550  -->  00:01:11.540
Well I already explained to you that the model is a class that deals with databases.

22

00:01:11.540  -->  00:01:16.080
Right but that doesn't help much right to understand exactly what a model is right.

23

00:01:16.080  -->  00:01:17.360
Let me show you.

24

00:01:17.370  -->  00:01:22.950
So let's go to a terminal real quick and let's create one in order for us to access information from

25

00:01:22.950  -->  00:01:29.490
the database using eloquent which is that that functionality or Clarabell that deals with the queries

26

00:01:29.640  -->  00:01:35.820
in a very easy format in order for me to access that all those functions that we have to create a model

27

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:37.190
that's a class.

28

00:01:37.350  -->  00:01:41.800
So BHB when I use this command write a command tool areason.

29

00:01:42.030  -->  00:01:48.850
So BHB artisan make call and model and now we give it a name.

30

00:01:48.870  -->  00:01:51.720
I'm going to create a model called post.

31

00:01:51.730  -->  00:01:52.660
So ACAP it all.

32

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:56.170
That's a first lady who will be in an uppercase right post.

33

00:01:56.370  -->  00:01:56.970
Right.

34

00:01:57.000  -->  00:02:04.030
And then if I flagged this like this with a name it would create a migration.

35

00:02:04.050  -->  00:02:04.990
All right Alisyn.

36

00:02:05.090  -->  00:02:05.830
Time.

37

00:02:05.910  -->  00:02:09.910
Remember when we started creating migrations so that way we can define our tables.

38

00:02:10.200  -->  00:02:12.350
Well if I do this it would create a migration.

39

00:02:12.360  -->  00:02:14.700
If I do it without it it would create a model.

40

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:18.170
So let's do it without a first let's click enter.

41

00:02:18.420  -->  00:02:19.790
So nice created.

42

00:02:19.800  -->  00:02:26.760
Now remember that toys or models were going to be right here in the same root as app.

43

00:02:27.210  -->  00:02:27.680
Right.

44

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:34.110
So you know one second I'll show you right now not the same route not the same level as her app but

45

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:36.870
inside app and models should be right here.

46

00:02:36.870  -->  00:02:43.290
Now I have to synchronize my app folder because there we go.

47

00:02:43.680  -->  00:02:45.630
So now is available here if I double click it.

48

00:02:45.630  -->  00:02:50.190
Now you could see that he just creates this file name post.

49

00:02:50.190  -->  00:02:51.250
We are importing.

50

00:02:51.270  -->  00:02:53.290
We have this name name space.

51

00:02:53.320  -->  00:02:57.650
She has me call app so we can access this from somewhere else.

52

00:02:57.690  -->  00:03:00.270
We can use use somewhere else.

53

00:03:00.360  -->  00:03:06.060
So we are importing the model and we of course that's how we are extending it here.

54

00:03:06.070  -->  00:03:10.030
Right we are standing post from here.

55

00:03:10.200  -->  00:03:10.870
Right.

56

00:03:11.250  -->  00:03:17.490
So if you click if you have I think it will it works like this on Windows if you have windows or you

57

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:24.510
click control click if you use an HP storm you can see why the model class does.

58

00:03:24.510  -->  00:03:32.020
I can see all the stuff the has all the properties that we can play around with.

59

00:03:32.040  -->  00:03:33.370
All right.

60

00:03:34.200  -->  00:03:38.000
And it's has a bunch of methods here.

61

00:03:38.010  -->  00:03:38.740
All right.

62

00:03:38.970  -->  00:03:41.350
Let's go back to post.

63

00:03:41.500  -->  00:03:47.940
So so now that we have this post class this model we can access it.

64

00:03:47.940  -->  00:03:50.080
We can now play around with eloquent.

65

00:03:50.130  -->  00:03:51.040
Right.

66

00:03:51.060  -->  00:03:52.230
All right use me.

67

00:03:52.770  -->  00:03:59.460
So one of the first things that you've got to understand here is that by default when we create a migration

68

00:04:00.140  -->  00:04:03.190
is called the name of the model.

69

00:04:03.240  -->  00:04:06.200
Is has the same name on the model in all lowercase.

70

00:04:06.210  -->  00:04:08.900
So we created this post.

71

00:04:08.910  -->  00:04:11.330
This model by itself right now.

72

00:04:11.380  -->  00:04:12.280
All right.

73

00:04:12.330  -->  00:04:13.060
We didn't create it.

74

00:04:13.070  -->  00:04:14.670
Migration what are we going to do then a minute.

75

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:23.340
Right now this this model here things that a table name that we have in our database is called polls

76

00:04:23.400  -->  00:04:29.190
like this because it converts this into all lowercase and then plural all the time.

77

00:04:29.190  -->  00:04:34.210
So if we had an article this was already gone that table would be articles.

78

00:04:34.230  -->  00:04:35.930
So now we have access.

79

00:04:35.940  -->  00:04:39.620
I know you don't understand it right now but I want you to keep an open mind.

80

00:04:39.630  -->  00:04:47.070
We have access to all tables to a stable from this class is thinking we have a pool stable in the age

81

00:04:47.070  -->  00:04:47.420
right.

82

00:04:47.430  -->  00:04:49.090
We do have one.

83

00:04:49.110  -->  00:04:49.870
All right.

84

00:04:50.340  -->  00:04:55.830
So it just in case in the future you had this model named differently like you and I don't know why

85

00:04:55.830  -->  00:05:00.890
would you do that but just in case your model was named post.

86

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:01.820
I don't know.

87

00:05:01.830  -->  00:05:03.620
Admiral or something like that.

88

00:05:03.870  -->  00:05:12.690
Then you have to come here and tell Clarabell to know that the table is not Polsce admins because it's

89

00:05:12.680  -->  00:05:13.950
going I think you have a table like this.

90

00:05:13.960  -->  00:05:15.940
Adman's right.

91

00:05:16.050  -->  00:05:25.210
So you're going to have to come here and ryot protect the property within with a variable table and

92

00:05:25.220  -->  00:05:32.560
just define it right here and you say listen Lavell I might say it was not named post adman's but his

93

00:05:32.560  -->  00:05:33.790
name posts.

94

00:05:33.800  -->  00:05:40.820
So now you're able to use this class to do all the methods and properties and then access all the stuff

95

00:05:41.030  -->  00:05:41.690
from eloquent.

96

00:05:41.690  -->  00:05:42.590
Right.

97

00:05:43.120  -->  00:05:43.470
All right.

98

00:05:43.490  -->  00:05:51.830
So now another thing that you also have to know is that by default this model here things that your

99

00:05:51.830  -->  00:05:54.830
table has a column name ID.

100

00:05:54.960  -->  00:05:57.070
All right like this.

101

00:05:57.080  -->  00:06:05.650
So he has a cold primary primary key name ID by default.

102

00:06:06.190  -->  00:06:06.790
OK.

103

00:06:07.000  -->  00:06:09.330
So you can access that and you're going to see that later on.

104

00:06:09.350  -->  00:06:17.840
But if for some reason your column name your primary key is not name ID is name something like post

105

00:06:17.840  -->  00:06:21.890
Id make sure that you come here and you write it down.

106

00:06:21.880  -->  00:06:28.370
Here you define it so that when we you are using eloquent Danos that your primary keys name different

107

00:06:28.490  -->  00:06:33.510
than the default one which is this which you really don't have to write it down.

108

00:06:33.620  -->  00:06:34.380
OK.

109

00:06:34.850  -->  00:06:38.720
It just takes a has those columns name like that.

110

00:06:38.720  -->  00:06:40.770
I was just letting you know that that's how you do it.

111

00:06:40.790  -->  00:06:45.770
If you have a totally different name for your table or for your ID.

112

00:06:46.280  -->  00:06:47.420
OK.

113

00:06:48.050  -->  00:06:51.220
So anyway let's get to this.

114

00:06:51.230  -->  00:06:59.930
I'm going to comment this out and I'm going to use the poles model right there so I know that you didn't

115

00:06:59.960  -->  00:07:01.190
understand much in this lecture.

116

00:07:01.190  -->  00:07:04.970
But the world is going to become very clearly clear later on.

117

00:07:04.970  -->  00:07:08.870
So now let's go back to routes.

118

00:07:08.870  -->  00:07:15.470
All right so let's go to HDTV and then routes and here we're going to make a comment so I'm going to

119

00:07:15.620  -->  00:07:21.740
take some comment block from here and I'm pasting here.

120

00:07:21.760  -->  00:07:24.830
I'm going to call this eloquent

121

00:07:27.200  -->  00:07:30.760
or of the relational model right.

122

00:07:31.190  -->  00:07:34.790
That's the name all for our AM.

123

00:07:34.880  -->  00:07:35.970
All right.

124

00:07:36.620  -->  00:07:39.470
Choose me.

125

00:07:39.470  -->  00:07:41.990
All right so let's create a route.

126

00:07:41.990  -->  00:07:45.160
Real quick.

127

00:07:45.160  -->  00:07:46.570
All right.

128

00:07:46.850  -->  00:07:52.070
This is going to make a lot more sense once we get into the application later on the course.

129

00:07:52.070  -->  00:07:56.160
So we're going to we're going to read some information already.

130

00:07:56.180  -->  00:08:03.770
We already have this comment that we can or we can actually name it find and we're going to have a closure

131

00:08:03.760  -->  00:08:04.400
function.

132

00:08:04.420  -->  00:08:09.530
And like I said we can use this in a control if we wanted to I'm just want to use it like this now and

133

00:08:09.530  -->  00:08:15.940
then later on when we build application we use it and we use the controllers in our application.

134

00:08:16.490  -->  00:08:20.370
We're using router right now to show you everything how everything works.

135

00:08:20.380  -->  00:08:30.260
So let's say for example that I want to access information I want to retrieve information from the database

136

00:08:30.590  -->  00:08:31.640
using eloquence.

137

00:08:31.700  -->  00:08:32.680
How do we do it.

138

00:08:32.780  -->  00:08:33.760
Let me show you.

139

00:08:34.150  -->  00:08:44.050
So now I'm going to go like this pose create a variable and I'm going to do this app and you see the

140

00:08:44.480  -->  00:08:51.370
this is backslash not a forward slash like this backslash like in the Windows machine.

141

00:08:51.380  -->  00:08:56.430
And then I would name I would go and refer to that post.

142

00:08:56.920  -->  00:08:58.430
You see that.

143

00:08:58.460  -->  00:09:01.370
So what I'm doing here is referring to this namespace.

144

00:09:01.370  -->  00:09:04.070
Remember that everything's right here on their app.

145

00:09:04.340  -->  00:09:13.430
And then the class is right here so I'm referring to that there but I know I can do that.

146

00:09:13.490  -->  00:09:14.620
I don't have to do that here.

147

00:09:14.620  -->  00:09:21.260
I can go ahead and take that off and go all the way to my application on top here and do this use in

148

00:09:21.280  -->  00:09:22.310
place there.

149

00:09:22.420  -->  00:09:29.310
And now I'm importing this class this functionality this post class right here this model.

150

00:09:29.620  -->  00:09:35.660
Now you don't see it but we have a lot of methods and properties available to us from this because we

151

00:09:35.650  -->  00:09:36.650
are extending the model.

152

00:09:36.640  -->  00:09:38.340
Remember this is a parent.

153

00:09:38.650  -->  00:09:43.300
So automatically Polsce is going to have all these methods like safe they destroy.

154

00:09:43.300  -->  00:09:47.410
I mean a whole bunch of different methods that there are there are so many of them that I don't even

155

00:09:47.410  -->  00:09:48.300
know them by heart.

156

00:09:48.380  -->  00:09:49.190
OK.

157

00:09:49.180  -->  00:09:54.060
So you'll learn this you know I asked you to go along in the course of course.

158

00:09:54.320  -->  00:09:55.140
So posts.

159

00:09:55.250  -->  00:09:56.250
So how do we find it.

160

00:09:56.270  -->  00:10:02.830
Well we say post we write the name and because this is going to be a static method that would put our

161

00:10:02.840  -->  00:10:06.560
call in and we say all that.

162

00:10:06.800  -->  00:10:16.630
Now this is pulling all the records right and saving it right here on this pulse variable.

163

00:10:17.270  -->  00:10:18.760
So now if we want to see it.

164

00:10:18.910  -->  00:10:21.940
So percentile for each.

165

00:10:21.940  -->  00:10:22.670
We look through it

166

00:10:25.830  -->  00:10:27.650
right.

167

00:10:29.000  -->  00:10:30.050
As opposed

168

00:10:34.120  -->  00:10:35.440
to how we go.

169

00:10:35.440  -->  00:10:38.210
Let's return that and see that in the browser.

170

00:10:39.320  -->  00:10:41.530
Actually this is called fine.

171

00:10:41.790  -->  00:10:44.480
I'm just going to name or rename it to read.

172

00:10:44.480  -->  00:10:45.330
All right.

173

00:10:46.000  -->  00:10:50.500
So let's go here and see what we can do.

174

00:10:50.600  -->  00:10:52.000
Read Antar.

175

00:10:52.490  -->  00:10:53.890
OK.

176

00:10:54.670  -->  00:10:59.670
Oh you know why we don't have a record in our database so that's why we don't see anything less just

177

00:10:59.680  -->  00:11:10.580
inserted because I think that one of the last lecture was to be HP is this alarm bill so I'm inserting

178

00:11:10.580  -->  00:11:14.660
some Recker that where we have some information.

179

00:11:15.130  -->  00:11:16.130
OK.

180

00:11:16.340  -->  00:11:23.670
You should be doing the same thing and you're going to a certain time stamp or whatever.

181

00:11:23.940  -->  00:11:25.190
Hopefully give me an error.

182

00:11:25.180  -->  00:11:26.100
There we go.

183

00:11:26.570  -->  00:11:28.790
Now we go and check it out real quick.

184

00:11:28.790  -->  00:11:29.740
See a mess.

185

00:11:29.780  -->  00:11:32.070
Read Antar.

186

00:11:32.270  -->  00:11:36.020
As you can see we are echoing the title.

187

00:11:36.180  -->  00:11:38.280
All right.

188

00:11:38.300  -->  00:11:39.570
Beautiful.

189

00:11:40.250  -->  00:11:42.450
So now you can also.

190

00:11:43.000  -->  00:11:44.060
All right.

191

00:11:44.680  -->  00:11:46.010
We can also find the record.

192

00:11:46.000  -->  00:11:48.400
So now we know that we have a record there less.

193

00:11:48.400  -->  00:11:55.320
Take a look to see was the ideal of it right.

194

00:11:56.140  -->  00:11:59.100
We have a record I did on number two.

195

00:11:59.110  -->  00:12:00.250
Cool.

196

00:12:00.430  -->  00:12:01.070
All right.

197

00:12:01.390  -->  00:12:04.190
So let me show you.

198

00:12:04.180  -->  00:12:06.340
So now let's just comment all this out.

199

00:12:06.380  -->  00:12:09.860
And for time's sake I'm going to paste it right guys.

200

00:12:09.880  -->  00:12:10.340
Don't do it.

201

00:12:10.340  -->  00:12:19.040
I want you to write it down but I'm going to get at it from round and say find and come here.

202

00:12:19.040  -->  00:12:23.350
And then I say pause find one.

203

00:12:23.350  -->  00:12:24.100
All right.

204

00:12:24.430  -->  00:12:29.640
And if we go here come back here we say find an author.

205

00:12:29.770  -->  00:12:31.870
We'll pass on.

206

00:12:32.210  -->  00:12:36.230
Oh you know what we would have to look through because it's finding one post.

207

00:12:36.230  -->  00:12:39.890
So with this comment is out and let's just return it

208

00:12:42.640  -->  00:12:46.720
fool's title and just take the s out of it.

209

00:12:47.050  -->  00:12:49.690
OK let's come back here.

210

00:12:49.880  -->  00:12:52.360
Antar Whoops.

211

00:12:52.370  -->  00:12:54.980
All right we have a narrow there we don't forgot the semi-colon

212

00:13:02.060  -->  00:13:04.410
polls find.

213

00:13:04.580  -->  00:13:07.760
Let's do it.

214

00:13:10.280  -->  00:13:10.740
OK.

215

00:13:10.850  -->  00:13:11.390
Get.

216

00:13:11.410  -->  00:13:12.490
There we go.

217

00:13:12.500  -->  00:13:16.210
That should bring out the No.

218

00:13:16.250  -->  00:13:17.900
Oh you know why he's not returning.

219

00:13:17.890  -->  00:13:19.140
Sorry about that guys.

220

00:13:19.170  -->  00:13:23.280
We're now looking for the number one we're looking for the number two.

221

00:13:23.300  -->  00:13:23.920
All right.

222

00:13:23.990  -->  00:13:25.510
Cool Antar.

223

00:13:25.610  -->  00:13:26.510
There we go.

224

00:13:26.540  -->  00:13:32.690
Now we find on the record that the number two when we bring out the title and remember this is coming

225

00:13:32.750  -->  00:13:34.920
like an object now.

226

00:13:34.930  -->  00:13:41.340
All right so we're pulling out all that if we have multiple ones then we will get in find.

227

00:13:41.330  -->  00:13:45.340
All right we will pull everything from here.

228

00:13:45.350  -->  00:13:45.700
All right.

229

00:13:45.710  -->  00:13:50.050
But you were the one finding the record ID number two.

230

00:13:50.120  -->  00:13:51.390
Beautiful right.

231

00:13:51.400  -->  00:13:56.180
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you're liking how to use eloquent how easy

232

00:13:56.170  -->  00:13:57.190
it is right.

233

00:13:57.530  -->  00:14:04.920
And remember that we can also use this anywhere we want as long as we import.

234

00:14:04.930  -->  00:14:05.320
All right.

235

00:14:05.330  -->  00:14:06.250
The motto.

236

00:14:06.530  -->  00:14:07.440
All right.

237

00:14:07.850  -->  00:14:13.910
So this fine med is available in the model in the pairing class.

238

00:14:13.930  -->  00:14:15.010
All right.

239

00:14:15.670  -->  00:14:19.050
In every way you imported You can use it just like I'm using it right now.

240

00:14:19.120  -->  00:14:24.110
Roadstar BHB thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

241
