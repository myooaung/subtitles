1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:02,220
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,250  -->  00:00:09,620
So we have finish setting up zap we have finished setting up an editor composer good.

3

00:00:09,620  -->  00:00:13,310
We even create a new project and set up some virtual holds.

4

00:00:13,350  -->  00:00:14,490
We're doing very good.

5

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:16,770
Now it's time for us to wopping our project.

6

00:00:16,770  -->  00:00:19,810
See how it looks inside right now.

7

00:00:19,830  -->  00:00:24,900
We're going to finish this section here because this is the section of doing this with Windows I'm going

8

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:27,700
about to jump in a section where we can do it with a Macintosh.

9

00:00:27,700  -->  00:00:28,310
All right.

10

00:00:28,350  -->  00:00:35,560
So I just want to see I want you to see how we can do this how we can open this project using BHB storm

11

00:00:35,600  -->  00:00:37,300
or any other order to Ed..

12

00:00:37,320  -->  00:00:38,660
It's super easy right.

13

00:00:38,850  -->  00:00:43,310
So let's click on whatever editor you're using.

14

00:00:43,420  -->  00:00:43,930
Right.

15

00:00:43,950  -->  00:00:46,440
And then I don't want to import anything.

16

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:52,710
So I'm going to click OK and I'm going to evaluate this for 30 days and go into a set.

17

00:00:52,710  -->  00:01:00,060
All right this is for PHP storm right after we create this app I create this video and I'll show you

18

00:01:00,060  -->  00:01:01,250
how this is done.

19

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:06,000
Then if you using a Macintosh or whatever other computer everything would be the same.

20

00:01:06,030  -->  00:01:06,800
All right.

21

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:13,130
I just want the Windows users to you know set everything up so that when I jump into a Macintosh there

22

00:01:13,130  -->  00:01:15,030
is no problem everything will be the same.

23

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:15,590
All right.

24

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:21,650
So I'm going to click OK and then I'm going to click open and then I'm going to look for that project

25

00:01:21,650  -->  00:01:24,120
or write in whatever that directory I put it on.

26

00:01:24,120  -->  00:01:29,090
So isn't zap HD docs and see a mess.

27

00:01:29,140  -->  00:01:33,820
I am going to click OK super easy right.

28

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:35,430
All right.

29

00:01:35,820  -->  00:01:36,900
That's it.

30

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:44,580
The projects here and we can start our we can jump into any operating system any computer as long as

31

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:47,250
we have this and everything will be the same.

32

00:01:47,250  -->  00:01:47,790
All right.

33

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:53,780
What I mean with everything being the same is that now if I switch to a Macintosh and I open Pietsch

34

00:01:53,790  -->  00:02:01,710
be still in there and I open the project we can start working on our application and everything else

35

00:02:01,800  -->  00:02:06,100
that I do here will be where we apply to Windows computer as well.

36

00:02:06,120  -->  00:02:11,670
All right so now that you know how to do this how to install this in a Windows computer.

37

00:02:11,700  -->  00:02:18,490
I'm going to go and help our Macintosh users in the next section and started doing this in Mac.

38

00:02:18,510  -->  00:02:19,190
All right.

39

00:02:19,200  -->  00:02:25,770
But if anything happens if anything is a little different in a Macintosh I would let Windows users know

40

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:26,650
immediately.

41

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:27,260
All right.

42

00:02:27,450  -->  00:02:28,570
So don't worry about that.

43

00:02:28,590  -->  00:02:29,740
We are doing very good.

44

00:02:29,730  -->  00:02:30,110
You can.

45

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:32,210
You're welcome to explore the documents here.

46

00:02:32,220  -->  00:02:41,550
But in the lectures after this in the section where we start inspecting our files I will start explaining

47

00:02:41,550  -->  00:02:41,840
it.

48

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:42,510
All right.

49

00:02:42,510  -->  00:02:49,890
So for those Windows users you can jump the whole section of Macintosh if you like and you can start

50

00:02:49,890  -->  00:02:52,540
the project on the next section with me.

51

00:02:52,560  -->  00:02:53,020
All right.

52

00:02:53,130  -->  00:02:58,610
Well you're also welcome to watch how he's done in a Macintosh so that way you can still have that knowledge

53

00:02:58,620  -->  00:03:01,230
just in case in the future you have a Macintosh.

54

00:03:01,230  -->  00:03:02,090
All right.

55

00:03:02,130  -->  00:03:04,990
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
