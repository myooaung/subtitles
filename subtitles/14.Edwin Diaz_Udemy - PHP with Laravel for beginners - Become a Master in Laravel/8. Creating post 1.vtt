00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:06.750
All righty Welcome back many students so hopefully you got it down the last video you were able to create

2

00:00:06.750  -->  00:00:08.880
a post from this forum here.

3

00:00:08.880  -->  00:00:11.040
If not don't worry I got your back.

4

00:00:11.040  -->  00:00:12.350
Let's get to it right away.

5

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:13.210
All right cool.

6

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:14.970
So this is where I left it on the last video.

7

00:00:14.970  -->  00:00:16.700
You can check out the end of the video.

8

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:17.160
All right.

9

00:00:17.160  -->  00:00:20.590
So we got to pull in the user the logged in user.

10

00:00:20.820  -->  00:00:25.890
We also are going to be assigning the requests

11

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:32.340
right here.

12

00:00:32.760  -->  00:00:33.410
Beautiful.

13

00:00:33.510  -->  00:00:34.080
All right.

14

00:00:34.170  -->  00:00:39.900
So one of the first one of the things that we got to do here is check for a picture right for a file

15

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:44.900
to see if a file is present and that either send time I'm going to assign a variable to it right.

16

00:00:44.910  -->  00:00:47.460
So let's get the requests

17

00:00:51.840  -->  00:00:55.380
and we got a check for the little guy right here called Forder I.D..

18

00:00:55.530  -->  00:00:57.220
We've got to make sure that he's there.

19

00:00:57.360  -->  00:01:01.140
If you want to go ahead him you know return Sunday night you're welcome to do that just to make sure

20

00:01:01.140  -->  00:01:03.190
that you are getting this down.

21

00:01:03.200  -->  00:01:03.410
All right.

22

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:06.930
So you might do something like this return it works or something like that.

23

00:01:07.500  -->  00:01:08.780
If you have a file.

24

00:01:09.150  -->  00:01:09.870
OK.

25

00:01:10.200  -->  00:01:15.420
So that way you know that it's working because it might not be working.

26

00:01:15.540  -->  00:01:15.990
All right.

27

00:01:16.060  -->  00:01:17.640
So if I got this here

28

00:01:21.450  -->  00:01:22.000
let's see.

29

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:24.560
Let's check it out real quick.

30

00:01:24.610  -->  00:01:25.360
All right.

31

00:01:25.980  -->  00:01:29.410
Let's get to see if we can get a file here.

32

00:01:29.980  -->  00:01:32.410
Who's out.

33

00:01:32.660  -->  00:01:35.920
We get to see me the rest of the fields.

34

00:01:36.100  -->  00:01:40.010
This is not going to work like this.

35

00:01:40.680  -->  00:01:43.920
It's taking that category as well.

36

00:01:44.160  -->  00:01:46.790
It's no value there so that's why the form.

37

00:01:46.800  -->  00:01:48.270
It's not going to work.

38

00:01:48.270  -->  00:01:55.110
But anyway what we can do is we can go to the requests real quick and make it a little looser.

39

00:01:55.410  -->  00:01:56.560
All right.

40

00:01:57.110  -->  00:02:01.840
Let's just comment all these out analysts.

41

00:02:01.840  -->  00:02:04.000
You see right now if we can do that.

42

00:02:04.520  -->  00:02:05.030
OK.

43

00:02:05.100  -->  00:02:08.950
It's amendable we don't have anything we need to show a picture.

44

00:02:09.630  -->  00:02:12.200
OK here we go.

45

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:14.840
You see that it works so we are receiving the picture.

46

00:02:15.210  -->  00:02:20.540
Ok cool let's go back and comment that.

47

00:02:20.550  -->  00:02:21.360
All right.

48

00:02:21.930  -->  00:02:23.260
So this works.

49

00:02:23.280  -->  00:02:23.700
All right.

50

00:02:23.700  -->  00:02:29.220
Sometimes it's better to check step by step just to make sure that you're now writing code and then

51

00:02:29.460  -->  00:02:33.870
you know that you are writing a whole bunch of code and you have to go back and then check every part

52

00:02:33.870  -->  00:02:34.430
of it.

53

00:02:34.430  -->  00:02:37.080
Just make sure that you are correct.

54

00:02:37.080  -->  00:02:44.100
All right so we're going to get the name of the file right here.

55

00:02:44.100  -->  00:02:46.750
Get original name cool.

56

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:51.640
Then we're going to be moving.

57

00:02:51.670  -->  00:02:56.230
We've done this many times you guys know this I don't have to tell you.

58

00:02:56.400  -->  00:02:57.110
All right.

59

00:02:57.360  -->  00:02:59.460
All right so that's one thing to do.

60

00:03:00.000  -->  00:03:05.760
Then we've got to do a photo with sign with creative photo here

61

00:03:08.820  -->  00:03:09.450
and

62

00:03:14.070  -->  00:03:18.510
file name.

63

00:03:19.830  -->  00:03:23.150
OK.

64

00:03:25.030  -->  00:03:31.220
The photo ID and we assigned the photo.

65

00:03:31.380  -->  00:03:33.250
We've done this we users guys.

66

00:03:33.270  -->  00:03:33.890
All right.

67

00:03:34.090  -->  00:03:40.150
Just to let recap real quickly we are signing all the requests to the import logging user getting the

68

00:03:40.160  -->  00:03:42.850
logged in user because we're going to use it later.

69

00:03:43.170  -->  00:03:44.890
We're checking to see if we have a file.

70

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:49.110
If we do we're going to get we're going to do all these processing We're going to get the original name

71

00:03:49.110  -->  00:03:57.240
in this variable moved the name and the file to images then create a photo.

72

00:03:57.660  -->  00:04:03.070
And then in this field of post in the in the post we're going to insert the photo ID.

73

00:04:03.090  -->  00:04:05.460
But let's actually point this for a quick.

74

00:04:05.480  -->  00:04:06.220
All right cool.

75

00:04:06.270  -->  00:04:10.100
OK I think we're done with the first part on the next lecture we're going to continue with this.

76

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:11.400
Thank you so much for watching.

77

00:04:11.400  -->  00:04:12.700
I'll see you in the next lecture
