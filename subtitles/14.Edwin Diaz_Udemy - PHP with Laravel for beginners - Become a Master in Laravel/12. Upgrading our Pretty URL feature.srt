00:00:00,450  -->  00:00:05,520
Welcome back to the students in this lecture here we are going to be updating our pretty or else we're

2

00:00:05,520  -->  00:00:09,570
going to make it work right because in the new version we've got to change a couple of things just to

3

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:10,380
make this work.

4

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:14,150
So I found some documentation right here on hub actually.

5

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:18,450
And it's in this you are.

6

00:00:18,780  -->  00:00:26,460
And it talks about a new version if we go back to our project here you can see that we have version

7

00:00:26,470  -->  00:00:27,150
3.1.

8

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:32,420
So they did kind of upgrade it will not kind of they did a great upgrade upgraded to 4.0.

9

00:00:32,640  -->  00:00:33,630
So that's what we need.

10

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:36,370
Let's see if he has the same name he says Rock.

11

00:00:37,050  -->  00:00:38,770
Hello quants luggable OK.

12

00:00:38,850  -->  00:00:47,700
So all we have to do here is just I guess change it to 4.00 and the composer of the I don't know that

13

00:00:47,700  -->  00:00:51,610
would work NIXEY this.

14

00:00:52,340  -->  00:00:52,740
All right.

15

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:58,380
I think it might fail because I think they have a new class that we have to think this class in the

16

00:00:58,380  -->  00:01:00,080
class we got is not the same.

17

00:01:00,080  -->  00:01:01,490
Let's just double check it.

18

00:01:01,720  -->  00:01:03,690
Whoops I think I got an error already.

19

00:01:04,080  -->  00:01:06,030
Let's see.

20

00:01:06,900  -->  00:01:09,860
Yeah you see there's a different class.

21

00:01:09,930  -->  00:01:21,240
So let's go back to app providers noise nothing apparatus.

22

00:01:21,260  -->  00:01:22,120
Sorry about that.

23

00:01:22,120  -->  00:01:24,180
In Conficker actually there we go.

24

00:01:24,180  -->  00:01:28,240
So this class is now the same.

25

00:01:28,620  -->  00:01:35,760
Let's take this off and let's try with this new class.

26

00:01:35,980  -->  00:01:36,930
Copy that.

27

00:01:37,100  -->  00:01:44,900
So this and let's see if it works b doesn't work we just require the whole thing guys.

28

00:01:44,920  -->  00:01:46,040
Right.

29

00:01:46,080  -->  00:01:49,460
No biggie worked.

30

00:01:49,470  -->  00:01:53,750
All right so let's go and check out our composite Jason.

31

00:01:53,970  -->  00:01:54,530
Beautiful.

32

00:01:54,530  -->  00:01:55,680
It looks like it worked.

33

00:01:55,680  -->  00:02:02,610
So what is the next change in the next change is OK publishing this from here.

34

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:04,840
All right let's see what what this does.

35

00:02:04,890  -->  00:02:10,050
I guess this is going to publish a package that we need a file class.

36

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:12,360
So let's just say here let's do this.

37

00:02:12,390  -->  00:02:16,740
OK I see it's a copy from this from the vendor folder.

38

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:21,030
This class here to this can fix luggable.

39

00:02:21,060  -->  00:02:23,800
All right.

40

00:02:23,850  -->  00:02:26,800
Let's go.

41

00:02:26,900  -->  00:02:29,580
There we go.

42

00:02:29,580  -->  00:02:29,940
All right.

43

00:02:29,940  -->  00:02:32,060
So we got some.

44

00:02:32,130  -->  00:02:36,960
I like this a lot better than what we have before because we can set our options here.

45

00:02:36,960  -->  00:02:38,280
Pretty cool.

46

00:02:39,030  -->  00:02:39,590
Look at this.

47

00:02:39,630  -->  00:02:41,540
Has an option on update.

48

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:47,860
So let's set this to true because we know we know we need this update reserved.

49

00:02:47,910  -->  00:02:53,830
If you are doing some of the leads and stuff like that you might want to do that unique.

50

00:02:53,970  -->  00:02:54,630
That's true.

51

00:02:54,660  -->  00:02:55,590
OK.

52

00:02:56,130  -->  00:03:01,400
Matt lenth it's up to you but I'll go with what we got right now what else will we need.

53

00:03:01,700  -->  00:03:06,660
All right so we need to use this guy here in order for this to work in our model.

54

00:03:06,900  -->  00:03:12,780
So let's go to our post model whatever model you have you're using.

55

00:03:13,590  -->  00:03:15,720
Let's go right here and

56

00:03:18,790  -->  00:03:20,960
let's just replace those two there.

57

00:03:21,210  -->  00:03:22,660
Let's take this implement out

58

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:26,010
and

59

00:03:28,980  -->  00:03:30,940
we've got to use it right here.

60

00:03:31,240  -->  00:03:33,400
Oh very cool.

61

00:03:34,910  -->  00:03:42,220
And I guess this is not there anymore because I see that they have a method and we just use this method

62

00:03:42,620  -->  00:03:44,530
.

63

00:03:48,360  -->  00:03:49,870
Based the right there.

64

00:03:49,870  -->  00:03:55,590
So I guess this is a log the source is the title if you want of this source that is something else you

65

00:03:55,590  -->  00:03:57,060
put it right here.

66

00:03:57,060  -->  00:03:59,490
I guess this is falling from the column name.

67

00:03:59,540  -->  00:04:00,540
All right.

68

00:04:01,170  -->  00:04:04,730
So this looks good.

69

00:04:04,890  -->  00:04:06,270
What else we need here

70

00:04:07,650  -->  00:04:11,690
.

71

00:04:16,130  -->  00:04:20,380
Vince.

72

00:04:20,580  -->  00:04:22,290
All right.

73

00:04:23,790  -->  00:04:24,500
So this is good.

74

00:04:24,500  -->  00:04:25,820
Let's check it out.

75

00:04:25,920  -->  00:04:27,050
All right.

76

00:04:28,050  -->  00:04:30,000
Let's see our application

77

00:04:32,770  -->  00:04:36,680
and let's see if we can get this going.

78

00:04:36,700  -->  00:04:38,910
Real quick.

79

00:04:38,980  -->  00:04:51,670
Man is created post created polls so let's go here and this is created.

80

00:04:51,930  -->  00:04:59,010
And let's just say that when Laro though course

81

00:05:04,850  -->  00:05:07,670
recording faculty who

82

00:05:10,440  -->  00:05:13,010
create.

83

00:05:13,010  -->  00:05:13,480
All right.

84

00:05:13,480  -->  00:05:17,220
So now this is where we see if it works.

85

00:05:17,250  -->  00:05:21,150
And I see how it works cause is pulling from the slug.

86

00:05:21,660  -->  00:05:24,350
But we have a problem here.

87

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:25,020
All right

88

00:05:28,280  -->  00:05:30,330
fine by Sluggy is having an issue.

89

00:05:30,390  -->  00:05:32,250
Let's see if we can find this into the communication.

90

00:05:32,250  -->  00:05:32,820
Real quick

91

00:05:35,630  -->  00:05:42,970
command fine fine by slug rice.

92

00:05:43,010  -->  00:05:47,680
It looks like we need to add a tray a tray to it.

93

00:05:47,730  -->  00:05:53,450
All right so let's come here and open this file here to see what it says.

94

00:05:54,720  -->  00:05:56,310
I see.

95

00:05:56,490  -->  00:06:00,180
So we need to add a tray to a less at it.

96

00:06:00,180  -->  00:06:03,030
One of the sculp helpers.

97

00:06:04,810  -->  00:06:11,850
Let's go to our models right here and we need to use it of course.

98

00:06:11,850  -->  00:06:17,200
And just below here.

99

00:06:17,310  -->  00:06:17,730
All right.

100

00:06:17,730  -->  00:06:22,710
And then we need to use Let's just try.

101

00:06:23,370  -->  00:06:26,300
All right refresh.

102

00:06:27,150  -->  00:06:29,330
And this looks like it worked.

103

00:06:29,370  -->  00:06:36,870
Now the reason why we're getting this problem is because we don't have an image in our.

104

00:06:37,270  -->  00:06:40,230
Let's look at the post.

105

00:06:40,730  -->  00:06:50,550
Go to your HPR I'm using sequel Prawle for Mac which is a pretty cool client for database software as

106

00:06:50,550  -->  00:06:54,980
you can see here trying to pool forward those who have one.

107

00:06:54,990  -->  00:07:05,790
So we need to kind of play around with that and set some if condition so that if he doesn't find a if

108

00:07:05,790  -->  00:07:10,680
he doesn't find a photo or doesn't find a category we wanted to do something else if we haven't done

109

00:07:10,680  -->  00:07:12,100
that you need to do that.

110

00:07:12,690  -->  00:07:20,490
All right so let's come here let's do refresh as you can see it's working now.

111

00:07:20,490  -->  00:07:21,030
All right.

112

00:07:21,090  -->  00:07:22,030
So forget that.

113

00:07:22,140  -->  00:07:27,360
You know try to get from a known object type of thing is because you're missing one of those fields

114

00:07:27,360  -->  00:07:28,560
here.

115

00:07:29,460  -->  00:07:35,020
I think he might be the category or the four to one of those in your index.

116

00:07:35,040  -->  00:07:38,110
Let me show you for that.

117

00:07:38,280  -->  00:07:43,430
That's the post we have.

118

00:07:43,440  -->  00:07:50,430
Let's go to our control real quick and we have a controller for that.

119

00:07:50,560  -->  00:07:56,600
Man pulls I think is this guy right here.

120

00:07:56,840  -->  00:07:58,270
View Post.

121

00:07:58,410  -->  00:07:59,240
All right.

122

00:07:59,720  -->  00:08:01,500
So let's go to resources

123

00:08:05,280  -->  00:08:08,530
views and then post

124

00:08:20,940  -->  00:08:23,040
his other comments down here.

125

00:08:23,040  -->  00:08:25,110
So this is the pulls up here.

126

00:08:25,390  -->  00:08:29,080
It's full in the polls username post created for the file.

127

00:08:29,180  -->  00:08:31,330
It might be a photo.

128

00:08:32,280  -->  00:08:32,800
All right.

129

00:08:32,850  -->  00:08:33,900
A photo file there.

130

00:08:33,920  -->  00:08:36,840
If it doesn't find it then they might give you that.

131

00:08:36,880  -->  00:08:41,240
I'm trying to pull from a non object type of error there.

132

00:08:41,250  -->  00:08:43,120
So you might want to put a condition here.

133

00:08:43,140  -->  00:08:46,840
If it doesn't have a photo file then replace it with this.

134

00:08:46,860  -->  00:08:53,970
You know that's one thing that you can do or you can go to your database and make sure that this field

135

00:08:53,970  -->  00:08:55,570
is not level.

136

00:08:55,620  -->  00:08:58,410
All right this column.

137

00:08:58,410  -->  00:09:02,250
So anyway so we got a pretty Oriel's working.

138

00:09:02,280  -->  00:09:03,090
Pretty cool stuff.

139

00:09:03,090  -->  00:09:05,530
Now our projects back to normal again.

140

00:09:05,570  -->  00:09:11,600
There is nothing else that there is not back to how we had it before now because we have a lot of the

141

00:09:11,620  -->  00:09:13,730
5.3 is actually a lot better right.

142

00:09:13,950  -->  00:09:20,310
So we still need to create some more features in the cores and then you know I'm open for suggestions

143

00:09:20,850  -->  00:09:27,210
we could refactor some code right now that we have created this project we got the major thing out of

144

00:09:27,210  -->  00:09:28,090
the way right.

145

00:09:28,260  -->  00:09:32,670
So anyway thank you so much for watching this course guys and this lecture and I'll see you in the next

146

00:09:32,670  -->  00:09:32,850
one.

147

00:09:32,850  -->  00:09:34,500
Take care.
