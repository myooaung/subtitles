00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.620
All right.

2

00:00:00.620  -->  00:00:01.900
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01.930  -->  00:00:06.120
STUDENT So it's time for us to start actually editing our polls.

4

00:00:06.120  -->  00:00:09.360
It's going to be a pretty fun lecture and you've got to learn a bunch from this one here.

5

00:00:09.420  -->  00:00:15.090
Even though you we my you might know a couple of things that we're doing in this lecture.

6

00:00:15.270  -->  00:00:18.720
But you're going to find now a new way of doing things is going to be pretty awesome.

7

00:00:18.720  -->  00:00:19.050
All right.

8

00:00:19.080  -->  00:00:20.230
Let's let's look at it.

9

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:21.150
Let's do this.

10

00:00:21.150  -->  00:00:21.540
All right.

11

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:24.720
So we got our end form set up.

12

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:28.790
All right ready for us to start editing.

13

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:32.630
Let's just change this to of the post.

14

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:34.670
All right.

15

00:00:35.430  -->  00:00:36.950
That's fine.

16

00:00:36.960  -->  00:00:40.860
All right cool let's go to the impulse controller here and start working from here.

17

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:46.350
Now remember when I told you the first thing that you that I recommend for you to do is try to do the

18

00:00:46.350  -->  00:00:49.710
return all here just just to find out if you're getting anything OK.

19

00:00:49.710  -->  00:00:53.280
I'm not going to do that because I know that this is working for me.

20

00:00:53.430  -->  00:00:54.010
OK.

21

00:00:54.240  -->  00:00:56.110
All right so what is the first thing that we're going to do here.

22

00:00:56.130  -->  00:01:00.000
Well I'm going to do this a little differently just a little bit.

23

00:01:00.630  -->  00:01:02.430
I just want to show you a new way of doing things.

24

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:04.590
All right.

25

00:01:04.590  -->  00:01:08.000
I'm going to find out when I go up and copy these guys.

26

00:01:08.010  -->  00:01:09.360
All right.

27

00:01:10.560  -->  00:01:12.730
I know I'm not supposed to be doing that.

28

00:01:12.750  -->  00:01:14.380
You're not supposed to be doing that.

29

00:01:14.520  -->  00:01:16.080
I already know this stuff.

30

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:16.880
All right.

31

00:01:17.430  -->  00:01:20.260
So we're checking to see if we have a picture of we don't.

32

00:01:20.710  -->  00:01:21.240
All right.

33

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:25.970
As you can see guys this is something that we have to repeat all the time.

34

00:01:26.010  -->  00:01:34.890
It will be nice to put this in and in a method right now we can fight it we can say if you find a picture

35

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:38.230
you know give us this and give us that.

36

00:01:38.250  -->  00:01:39.200
That would be nice.

37

00:01:39.310  -->  00:01:45.090
So if you want to go ahead and refactor that into a method you can I'm just showing you the long way

38

00:01:45.090  -->  00:01:46.990
of doing things so that way.

39

00:01:47.040  -->  00:01:54.540
And sometimes I show you the short way but this way showing you the long way makes you think wow you

40

00:01:54.540  -->  00:01:56.100
can do to make it better.

41

00:01:56.160  -->  00:01:56.910
Remember that.

42

00:01:56.910  -->  00:01:58.190
All right cool.

43

00:01:58.890  -->  00:02:07.660
All right so now what I want to do is we're going to find the user first of all right.

44

00:02:07.860  -->  00:02:12.430
The guys are slow then and then we want to find the users posts.

45

00:02:12.450  -->  00:02:21.100
All right and then we want to find out where the IDS is same marae we're going to find out post.

46

00:02:21.200  -->  00:02:25.230
Once you put the WHERE statement here is checking for the user's pause.

47

00:02:25.260  -->  00:02:26.280
All right.

48

00:02:26.290  -->  00:02:31.180
Once we find out how we want to for the first one that we find right because there's only one that we

49

00:02:31.180  -->  00:02:32.880
are editing of the time.

50

00:02:32.940  -->  00:02:39.780
And then after we do that we just say ok once you find the first one I want you to update it and we're

51

00:02:39.780  -->  00:02:40.810
going to update it.

52

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:42.300
And what are we going to update.

53

00:02:42.420  -->  00:02:44.330
The input.

54

00:02:44.330  -->  00:02:45.610
All right.

55

00:02:45.790  -->  00:02:46.290
And here we go.

56

00:02:46.290  -->  00:02:47.810
Here we don't have that much different.

57

00:02:47.940  -->  00:02:49.240
Well actually it is different.

58

00:02:49.250  -->  00:02:52.650
Zoom one line will we are eliminating this line here.

59

00:02:52.650  -->  00:02:54.910
We eliminating this line right here.

60

00:02:54.960  -->  00:02:55.950
All right.

61

00:02:56.550  -->  00:02:58.390
Ok cool.

62

00:02:58.500  -->  00:03:00.990
So once we do that we can go ahead and return

63

00:03:04.060  -->  00:03:07.480
redirect.

64

00:03:07.550  -->  00:03:16.050
All right men pose Let's see we're forgetting something here.

65

00:03:16.380  -->  00:03:19.740
We're not we're good.

66

00:03:21.710  -->  00:03:23.270
OK.

67

00:03:24.320  -->  00:03:25.430
It is like is good guys.

68

00:03:25.440  -->  00:03:26.380
Let's check it out.

69

00:03:26.460  -->  00:03:28.690
All right cool.

70

00:03:30.210  -->  00:03:30.740
All right.

71

00:03:30.750  -->  00:03:33.720
The bomb and just in a put here.

72

00:03:33.990  -->  00:03:39.850
Did it just to know that this it is of dating.

73

00:03:40.500  -->  00:03:44.900
And and this is Bull's number four.

74

00:03:45.480  -->  00:03:49.590
I love love he makes because it makes it easy for me.

75

00:03:50.370  -->  00:03:54.400
Did it.

76

00:03:55.650  -->  00:04:03.730
As you can see updated updated and updated and updated.

77

00:04:04.350  -->  00:04:06.320
Working like a charm guys.

78

00:04:06.420  -->  00:04:07.350
Beautiful.

79

00:04:07.350  -->  00:04:08.610
All right.

80

00:04:08.620  -->  00:04:13.170
So another thing that I want to also let you guys know is that later on we're going to be doing pagination

81

00:04:13.200  -->  00:04:18.540
but that's extra features you might now want to have the body here.

82

00:04:18.540  -->  00:04:19.090
All right.

83

00:04:19.110  -->  00:04:20.760
So they are functions.

84

00:04:20.760  -->  00:04:28.200
There are methods that you can actually use from Claribel to actually shrink this to make it you know

85

00:04:28.740  -->  00:04:29.150
shorter.

86

00:04:29.160  -->  00:04:33.170
And there are of course methods from PH a native THP right.

87

00:04:33.360  -->  00:04:38.090
But if you go and let's say you search Clarabelle

88

00:04:40.560  -->  00:04:41.650
helper.

89

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:43.980
Actually let me just put it right here so you can see.

90

00:04:43.980  -->  00:04:46.370
Sorry hoper functions.

91

00:04:46.460  -->  00:04:49.400
Hoper string functions.

92

00:04:49.400  -->  00:04:52.000
Watch this.

93

00:04:52.110  -->  00:04:57.300
Actually I think just with the first one helper functions you could the first key was you can find the

94

00:04:57.300  -->  00:05:05.880
rest and then you go here and you say strings and you go you got Kim K's I mean your name is here.

95

00:05:05.880  -->  00:05:10.060
We may have a string limit right here so we can apply this trend limit over there.

96

00:05:10.620  -->  00:05:11.830
OK.

97

00:05:13.170  -->  00:05:17.650
So you can come to your index.

98

00:05:17.670  -->  00:05:20.770
Let's go to this right here and right here on body.

99

00:05:20.770  -->  00:05:21.120
All right.

100

00:05:21.120  -->  00:05:24.600
You can call that let's just do it right now.

101

00:05:24.600  -->  00:05:31.930
So show you and we will just say this to your limit we go.

102

00:05:31.950  -->  00:05:37.980
And then when you play this here and then we say to why we want to limit to we want to limit to seven

103

00:05:38.790  -->  00:05:40.060
characters for example.

104

00:05:40.100  -->  00:05:42.130
Just give you an example answer.

105

00:05:42.360  -->  00:05:47.680
And as you can see is the body's being limited to seven characters right.

106

00:05:47.700  -->  00:05:52.900
You might want to do something like maybe 20 characters or 30.

107

00:05:52.980  -->  00:05:53.800
All right.

108

00:05:54.180  -->  00:05:59.370
So there is a bunch of helper functions out there to help you make your application lot better.

109

00:05:59.370  -->  00:06:01.810
So look at up play around with it.

110

00:06:01.840  -->  00:06:03.810
You know whatever you need is here.

111

00:06:03.960  -->  00:06:06.510
We got a raise with a bunch of arrays too.

112

00:06:06.640  -->  00:06:11.310
We can use if you need them a bunch.

113

00:06:11.310  -->  00:06:12.200
All right.

114

00:06:12.250  -->  00:06:15.900
Anyway thank you so much guys for watching this lecture was pretty awesome right.

115

00:06:16.050  -->  00:06:18.160
We were able to weather this even on time.

116

00:06:18.180  -->  00:06:22.380
It was pretty easy and we just our applications just taking form right.

117

00:06:22.380  -->  00:06:25.250
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
