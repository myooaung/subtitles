00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:04,030
Welcome welcome back my dear student.

2

00:00:04,050  -->  00:00:11,030
So now we have created the many many to many relationship we have created this pivot table we can't

3

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:14,500
where we can relate two tables together right.

4

00:00:14,550  -->  00:00:16,040
Really cool stuff.

5

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:21,090
Make sure that you understand each of them before jumping into another one right before jumping to the

6

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:22,410
next lectures.

7

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:23,160
All right.

8

00:00:23,670  -->  00:00:26,170
So let's just come in all of this out.

9

00:00:26,640  -->  00:00:28,790
And one thing that I wanted to point out.

10

00:00:28,860  -->  00:00:30,080
All right.

11

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:40,500
Remember here we have in every med that we are also can have multiple parameters to customize the columns

12

00:00:40,500  -->  00:00:40,810
.

13

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:41,320
All right.

14

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:43,720
Just in case you have different column names right.

15

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:53,460
So right here you can join two of the tables let's say for example and I do not join the table.

16

00:00:53,460  -->  00:01:00,150
Right now you're saying in this many to many relationship let's say in this rules method here you want

17

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:02,140
to define the table name.

18

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:03,050
All right.

19

00:01:03,450  -->  00:01:05,890
And you have let's say you have a different table name.

20

00:01:05,910  -->  00:01:14,490
Let's say your team was now all user like we have in the migration right here you can find the name

21

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:16,950
of that table that you have customized.

22

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:20,670
So let's say for example your table is use or rolls.

23

00:01:20,900  -->  00:01:22,600
OK this is where you find that.

24

00:01:22,780  -->  00:01:27,420
All right the third parameter is going to be the key or the following key.

25

00:01:27,420  -->  00:01:29,810
So we're going to say User ID.

26

00:01:30,230  -->  00:01:32,350
OK.

27

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:38,590
And here you can see the roll ID.

28

00:01:38,600  -->  00:01:42,090
All right I hope you see how useful this is.

29

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:42,770
All right.

30

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:51,250
So this is the foreign key are-I of the user user's table.

31

00:01:51,250  -->  00:01:51,590
All right.

32

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:55,420
And this is the foreign key of the roles table.

33

00:01:55,660  -->  00:02:00,600
Well here we find the name of that custom table that we can create.

34

00:02:00,600  -->  00:02:03,900
Now we don't have we were following convention.

35

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:06,600
I told you the best the best way to follow.

36

00:02:06,600  -->  00:02:12,570
The best way to do this is by doing roll user so that way we don't have to come here and create these

37

00:02:12,580  -->  00:02:14,430
extra parameters right.

38

00:02:14,430  -->  00:02:16,550
That's why we don't have to do this anymore.

39

00:02:16,550  -->  00:02:17,100
All right.

40

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:19,710
And let's actually I'm going to comment this out.

41

00:02:19,720  -->  00:02:29,530
So if you have any and you know what they are I'm going to come in this hour real quick here.

42

00:02:29,920  -->  00:02:30,300
All right.

43

00:02:30,350  -->  00:02:33,940
And a comment that out right here.

44

00:02:34,800  -->  00:02:38,580
We don't have we don't need those extra parameters because we are following convention.

45

00:02:38,610  -->  00:02:44,070
If not well we're using a different table and then migration different table name we would have to do

46

00:02:44,070  -->  00:02:45,010
this.

47

00:02:45,210  -->  00:02:46,580
All right.

48

00:02:46,770  -->  00:02:51,300
So you can put a little comment here to customize

49

00:02:53,640  -->  00:03:00,380
customize table names and columns.

50

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:08,600
Follow follow the format below.

51

00:03:09,120  -->  00:03:09,590
All right.

52

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:11,160
You could do something like that.

53

00:03:11,400  -->  00:03:13,910
All right I just wanted to give you that tip now.

54

00:03:14,130  -->  00:03:20,130
Another tip that I want to also bring up is that we can also do the inverse of this relationship just

55

00:03:20,130  -->  00:03:23,920
like we did before with a user right.

56

00:03:24,110  -->  00:03:26,990
The user we have.

57

00:03:27,440  -->  00:03:32,460
We came here with posts and we created this inverse relationship right.

58

00:03:32,490  -->  00:03:45,630
So all I have to do is go to roll right here and I could create a user's method of public function users

59

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:47,340
like this.

60

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:51,030
All right there we go.

61

00:03:51,070  -->  00:03:54,050
And now I just do this return.

62

00:03:54,060  -->  00:04:03,990
This belongs to many and user that's all.

63

00:04:04,200  -->  00:04:09,690
So if I want to return the owner of that specific role I just come here and create this relationship

64

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:10,310
right here.

65

00:04:10,350  -->  00:04:12,130
You see how easy this is.

66

00:04:12,360  -->  00:04:14,330
I live this the way it is right here.

67

00:04:14,340  -->  00:04:17,610
But just know that is super easy to do the inverse on that.

68

00:04:17,620  -->  00:04:27,150
Now another thing that I want you to learn here and this is just me maybe a a a tape lecture.

69

00:04:27,480  -->  00:04:31,190
Now if you want to access the intermediate table.

70

00:04:31,230  -->  00:04:32,000
All right.

71

00:04:32,220  -->  00:04:39,720
Well you can do is you can go to let's say the routes Let's go to route real quick and I'll show you

72

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:40,710
right now.

73

00:04:40,710  -->  00:04:43,010
This is what his lecture is mainly about.

74

00:04:43,020  -->  00:04:50,340
But I took my eye to the freedom the liberty of giving you a couple of tips before.

75

00:04:50,340  -->  00:04:50,950
OK.

76

00:04:51,030  -->  00:05:01,090
So you could say this thing says in the intermediate table in the intermediate table here.

77

00:05:01,200  -->  00:05:03,790
It's the pivot table.

78

00:05:05,190  -->  00:05:05,610
OK.

79

00:05:05,610  -->  00:05:12,930
So you can say pivot or some of you may have pronouns as private or look up table or something like

80

00:05:13,100  -->  00:05:21,010
Does searcing and write beautiful spell check right.

81

00:05:21,000  -->  00:05:27,250
So now if you want to add is that pivot table we first need to find the user right.

82

00:05:27,270  -->  00:05:28,190
Or let's create a route.

83

00:05:28,200  -->  00:05:29,710
Right.

84

00:05:29,930  -->  00:05:32,740
Makes no sense if we don't create a route.

85

00:05:33,530  -->  00:05:42,850
Well let's just say use or pivot like this.

86

00:05:42,880  -->  00:05:44,300
OK.

87

00:05:45,440  -->  00:05:46,990
And function

88

00:05:49,780  -->  00:05:51,240
oops.

89

00:05:51,270  -->  00:05:54,710
What am I doing here guys.

90

00:05:55,200  -->  00:05:58,320
They're missing all this stuff.

91

00:05:58,670  -->  00:06:00,520
We go.

92

00:06:01,420  -->  00:06:02,380
What is is it.

93

00:06:02,400  -->  00:06:04,520
What do they do.

94

00:06:05,470  -->  00:06:10,000
We go to this right.

95

00:06:10,060  -->  00:06:12,450
I turn myself into a mess there for a minute.

96

00:06:12,450  -->  00:06:12,970
All right.

97

00:06:13,120  -->  00:06:15,630
So now we we find the user.

98

00:06:15,960  -->  00:06:21,060
This is what happens when you cold too many hours straight.

99

00:06:21,120  -->  00:06:21,570
Right.

100

00:06:21,570  -->  00:06:28,960
You start doing things in your head before you even do it in the code and you get mixed up.

101

00:06:28,950  -->  00:06:31,270
So we find the user array will find user 1.

102

00:06:31,260  -->  00:06:42,570
Then we get out for each loop here and we say user roles as role.

103

00:06:42,610  -->  00:06:43,510
Watch this.

104

00:06:43,500  -->  00:06:45,120
It's going to be pretty fun.

105

00:06:45,510  -->  00:06:49,050
And you can say Go roll

106

00:06:52,060  -->  00:06:57,790
it or pivot create it.

107

00:06:58,830  -->  00:07:01,730
Whoops.

108

00:07:01,940  -->  00:07:03,120
Here we go.

109

00:07:03,120  -->  00:07:03,960
Let's find out.

110

00:07:03,960  -->  00:07:06,510
They created for this intermediate.

111

00:07:06,530  -->  00:07:07,360
Right.

112

00:07:07,780  -->  00:07:13,230
Let's it's this is like this.

113

00:07:13,240  -->  00:07:14,050
So

114

00:07:17,070  -->  00:07:17,700
these are

115

00:07:23,410  -->  00:07:29,110
PI that enter and created it and it's not available.

116

00:07:29,160  -->  00:07:35,530
And the reason we created it might now be available is because we have to let it know to give it to

117

00:07:35,520  -->  00:07:36,140
us.

118

00:07:36,300  -->  00:07:43,380
Actually we misspelled misspelled or something let's just find out real quick user rules.

119

00:07:43,620  -->  00:07:49,060
Because we don't have a created at all awry.

120

00:07:49,560  -->  00:07:50,250
So

121

00:07:53,120  -->  00:08:01,720
what's what's going on with my table roll user and

122

00:08:03,930  -->  00:08:06,140
created.

123

00:08:07,180  -->  00:08:11,570
We go and just do this one too.

124

00:08:11,580  -->  00:08:14,260
Real quick way now.

125

00:08:16,440  -->  00:08:18,290
And now we go back.

126

00:08:19,050  -->  00:08:21,480
Let's see if we can find that browsers were

127

00:08:26,310  -->  00:08:27,130
created a

128

00:08:29,790  -->  00:08:36,190
user pivot it right.

129

00:08:36,180  -->  00:08:38,270
It's making me look really bad guys.

130

00:08:38,280  -->  00:08:47,100
User rules for all pivot created at home.

131

00:08:48,450  -->  00:08:49,290
That's weird

132

00:08:56,180  -->  00:09:03,210
.

133

00:09:03,370  -->  00:09:08,080
Let's actually do this real quick return.

134

00:09:09,630  -->  00:09:14,340
All right let's see if we can get something out of an answer.

135

00:09:14,350  -->  00:09:15,570
There we go.

136

00:09:16,240  -->  00:09:16,550
All right.

137

00:09:16,550  -->  00:09:21,440
We only see the private pivot table but for some reason we don't get to create it.

138

00:09:21,450  -->  00:09:21,840
But

139

00:09:28,360  -->  00:09:29,860
we're supposed to get created.

140

00:09:29,880  -->  00:09:33,790
Let's see if we can put a time somewhere.

141

00:09:35,040  -->  00:09:39,510
Twelve five.

142

00:09:40,870  -->  00:09:44,870
Let's see that works was

143

00:09:48,040  -->  00:09:51,040
created at.

144

00:09:53,120  -->  00:09:55,760
OK.

145

00:09:56,970  -->  00:10:03,510
What about all the that's supposed to come out what is something there preventing us from seeing this

146

00:10:03,510  -->  00:10:03,980
.

147

00:10:04,140  -->  00:10:05,760
And I forgot.

148

00:10:05,810  -->  00:10:10,330
Is has to be in the model somewhere where.

149

00:10:10,590  -->  00:10:12,740
Actually hold on.

150

00:10:12,850  -->  00:10:15,550
Let's go to the model real quick.

151

00:10:17,080  -->  00:10:20,770
And this belongs to evil.

152

00:10:20,830  -->  00:10:24,590
Let's use the pivot.

153

00:10:24,720  -->  00:10:29,870
I think we have to let in all the columns that we want to pull out.

154

00:10:29,880  -->  00:10:35,180
So we wanted to pull out the create it out and what was the other one.

155

00:10:36,100  -->  00:10:38,220
Let's go to router real quick.

156

00:10:38,830  -->  00:10:40,830
Yeah that's just for now.

157

00:10:41,280  -->  00:10:43,360
I think that's all we got to do.

158

00:10:43,360  -->  00:10:44,310
All right.

159

00:10:44,880  -->  00:10:47,110
Let's go and enter.

160

00:10:47,290  -->  00:10:52,440
No I think I mean spelling it right here.

161

00:10:52,440  -->  00:10:54,370
Pivot.

162

00:10:56,130  -->  00:10:57,810
Oh I'm doing the wrong place.

163

00:10:57,820  -->  00:10:59,330
Guys I'm sorry.

164

00:10:59,970  -->  00:11:11,130
All right let's go to user right here and there we go.

165

00:11:11,130  -->  00:11:12,210
All right.

166

00:11:13,090  -->  00:11:13,830
Let's see.

167

00:11:13,840  -->  00:11:14,740
There we go.

168

00:11:14,790  -->  00:11:17,860
We got to create it out.

169

00:11:18,280  -->  00:11:19,770
Call them informational.

170

00:11:19,820  -->  00:11:21,180
They are for the intermediate.

171

00:11:21,180  -->  00:11:21,870
Right.

172

00:11:21,900  -->  00:11:23,030
So that's pretty cool.

173

00:11:23,080  -->  00:11:29,640
Make sure that you let the model know that you want to pull out that intermediate table from a column

174

00:11:29,640  -->  00:11:29,690
.

175

00:11:29,690  -->  00:11:36,120
All right with is met the right he almost forgot sometimes you know when I'm not used to writing with

176

00:11:36,570  -->  00:11:45,120
the before Clarabelle versions you know like point lour before and other versions of four and then let

177

00:11:45,120  -->  00:11:50,060
go of a 5.0 and five point one five point two and so on.

178

00:11:50,110  -->  00:11:50,840
All right.

179

00:11:50,920  -->  00:11:57,430
So time changes and make sure that you read the documentation make sure that you subscribe to the labo

180

00:11:57,450  -->  00:11:58,120
news.

181

00:11:58,140  -->  00:12:03,180
That way you can get up today with what's going on with different function idea every time they release

182

00:12:03,180  -->  00:12:03,920
a new version.

183

00:12:03,930  -->  00:12:04,560
Right.

184

00:12:04,600  -->  00:12:06,580
So that's why it's always good to keep updated.

185

00:12:06,610  -->  00:12:09,190
All right so I guess I got to read a little bit more.

186

00:12:09,470  -->  00:12:12,770
And I don't Birley used as much.

187

00:12:12,780  -->  00:12:22,470
So that's why I don't remember and I remember that the model itself has so many different functionalities

188

00:12:22,460  -->  00:12:28,020
so many different methods and properties that you cannot even imagine to learn them all.

189

00:12:28,090  -->  00:12:32,020
It's almost impossible right now to go through them all.

190

00:12:32,020  -->  00:12:34,840
It is not impossible but to remember them all.

191

00:12:34,890  -->  00:12:40,530
It is so if you don't use this much you're going to forget and that's why you need to do it one time

192

00:12:40,530  -->  00:12:43,970
so that way you know that something is wrong and you can look it up.

193

00:12:44,130  -->  00:12:44,660
All right.

194

00:12:44,760  -->  00:12:46,610
But anyway thank you so much for watching.

195

00:12:46,630  -->  00:12:52,770
And I hope this was very informative for you and I'll see you in the next lectures.

196

00:12:52,770  -->  00:12:53,750
Bye bye.
