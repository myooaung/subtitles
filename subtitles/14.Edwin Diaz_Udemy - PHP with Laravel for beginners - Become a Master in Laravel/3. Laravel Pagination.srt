00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:02,690
Hi welcome back Maria students.

2

00:00:02,730  -->  00:00:07,160
This is Edwin Diaz from courting faculty in dot com or for Edwin Diaz.

3

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:08,000
Come.

4

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:08,700
All right.

5

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:14,700
Anyway so we we have been having a lot of fun in this course and we created one of the cool feet coolest

6

00:00:14,700  -->  00:00:16,790
feature in this course pretty you or else.

7

00:00:16,800  -->  00:00:17,600
Right.

8

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:24,000
And I probably blew a lot of minds out there from a lot of my ex my students from the courses right

9

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:33,660
from PH before beginners or you know from my BHP Olby course or my call igniter corps or and so on and

10

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:34,080
so on.

11

00:00:34,080  -->  00:00:34,620
Right.

12

00:00:34,650  -->  00:00:39,770
It's you know it's been very hard for us to implement prove to you or else in those courses right.

13

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:44,380
We probably have never done it because it does complicate.

14

00:00:44,550  -->  00:00:46,160
They are so complicated to do right.

15

00:00:46,170  -->  00:00:48,470
These vans features all over the place.

16

00:00:48,560  -->  00:00:54,780
You saw how easy it was for us to had pretty you or else to in Arabic right.

17

00:00:54,870  -->  00:00:59,590
Well I'm going to blow your mind in this lecture because we are going to be adding pagination.

18

00:00:59,640  -->  00:01:00,220
All right.

19

00:01:00,390  -->  00:01:05,490
And in some of my courses and especially that piece before begin as we added pagination but it was actually

20

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:06,540
a little complicated.

21

00:01:06,540  -->  00:01:07,340
All right.

22

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:14,500
I'm going to show you how easy it is with Clarabell right how easy it is to you know they already created

23

00:01:15,530  -->  00:01:16,530
the code for us.

24

00:01:16,530  -->  00:01:18,720
We just have to use it right.

25

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:19,580
All right cool.

26

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:24,840
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to our controller and actually they are now odd impulse

27

00:01:24,980  -->  00:01:28,810
control are going to take that off.

28

00:01:28,860  -->  00:01:32,330
So our admen post controller.

29

00:01:32,520  -->  00:01:36,640
All right and we're going to go to our end that's right here we're going to work on that.

30

00:01:36,640  -->  00:01:36,950
All right.

31

00:01:36,950  -->  00:01:45,300
So how about open but what we've got to be paginate ing here is folks anes Georgia to paginate whatever

32

00:01:45,300  -->  00:01:50,550
you want in your application are not going to go through you users to categories or media or anything

33

00:01:50,550  -->  00:01:52,830
like that to paginate the rest of their application.

34

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:53,850
That's your job.

35

00:01:53,850  -->  00:01:58,210
I'm going to show you how to do it and your job to apply to your own application.

36

00:01:58,470  -->  00:02:03,300
All right so we're going to be paginate ing for every two results because we don't have a lot of data

37

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:09,480
but if we have a lot of data if we had a lot of data for example like 100 pools I would paginate it

38

00:02:09,480  -->  00:02:11,460
probably every 25 results.

39

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:14,970
All right every 25 items or something like that every 25 pools.

40

00:02:15,210  -->  00:02:25,530
So let's create another pause here and say another cool pulls by Edwin D.S. from coring faculty dot

41

00:02:25,530  -->  00:02:29,550
com for doing the dot com.

42

00:02:29,580  -->  00:02:31,480
All right.

43

00:02:31,500  -->  00:02:39,510
We're going to do a little category there are going to put my bootstrap picture course there and we're

44

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:45,180
going to say I love this pause from my Sensei

45

00:02:50,160  -->  00:02:52,890
from my Ph.D. sensate create Polsce great.

46

00:02:52,890  -->  00:02:53,870
We have three books.

47

00:02:54,000  -->  00:02:58,260
So now we can paginate it right so we only going to be able to see two results here and on the next

48

00:02:58,260  -->  00:03:01,050
page we're going to see the next result.

49

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:01,860
All right cool.

50

00:03:02,010  -->  00:03:05,100
So let's go to him that's right here on this method.

51

00:03:05,110  -->  00:03:09,840
In that thing at me impuls controller and right here what we're going to do going to change this all

52

00:03:09,840  -->  00:03:12,490
for another Mentha called paginate.

53

00:03:13,230  -->  00:03:16,510
And if I can't spell it correctly I don't even know what I spell there.

54

00:03:16,740  -->  00:03:17,700
Paginate.

55

00:03:17,760  -->  00:03:18,860
There we go.

56

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:22,050
And we're going to paginate every two results.

57

00:03:22,080  -->  00:03:22,610
That's it.

58

00:03:22,620  -->  00:03:24,530
That's all you've got to do for there.

59

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:34,350
But now of course if I go here and refresh you can see now that we don't see the other last results

60

00:03:34,350  -->  00:03:34,790
right.

61

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:42,060
Because we are kind of putting our restriction here saying only show the tuples and then the next balls

62

00:03:42,180  -->  00:03:45,580
you're going to show would be in the second page right.

63

00:03:45,780  -->  00:03:49,920
So now let's go to our control our views.

64

00:03:50,790  -->  00:03:54,470
So let's actually minimize all this would you have this mass.

65

00:03:54,840  -->  00:04:00,270
And we are going to add polls.

66

00:04:00,300  -->  00:04:02,550
And that's.

67

00:04:02,610  -->  00:04:04,310
And let's do it right below here.

68

00:04:04,380  -->  00:04:13,830
Let's create a diff with a class or a row and inside there let's create another div where the class

69

00:04:13,830  -->  00:04:27,750
of call and it would be s am sets another class of let's give it an offset and of said we'd be I say

70

00:04:27,750  -->  00:04:29,680
5.

71

00:04:30,410  -->  00:04:32,580
All right cool.

72

00:04:32,670  -->  00:04:34,830
I think that's about right.

73

00:04:34,860  -->  00:04:41,370
And here we're going to use Belaid and we're going to say we can use the whole array.

74

00:04:41,580  -->  00:04:44,260
The whole collection right pools.

75

00:04:45,150  -->  00:04:53,490
And we're going to use another global function your call render we're going to use render like this

76

00:04:53,500  -->  00:04:53,700
.

77

00:04:53,830  -->  00:04:57,020
And now we go back here.

78

00:04:58,000  -->  00:05:00,860
Voila there we go.

79

00:05:01,130  -->  00:05:10,940
I pagination guys look at this page number two baby food pagination right there guys.

80

00:05:10,960  -->  00:05:11,830
Right.

81

00:05:11,970  -->  00:05:14,660
I hope I just blew your mind.

82

00:05:14,730  -->  00:05:22,500
If discours does does not serve a five star for this feature long right now guys I don't know what does

83

00:05:22,500  -->  00:05:22,990
.

84

00:05:22,990  -->  00:05:23,560
All right.

85

00:05:23,760  -->  00:05:28,350
So if you have not given this corps a five star review go ahead and do it now.

86

00:05:28,350  -->  00:05:29,080
All right.

87

00:05:29,100  -->  00:05:34,370
Anyway that was just I'm just joking but really if you haven't given it you go ahead and do it right

88

00:05:34,600  -->  00:05:34,970
.

89

00:05:35,130  -->  00:05:40,050
But anyway this is the simplest thing ever right at this time so far.

90

00:05:40,050  -->  00:05:40,660
All right.

91

00:05:40,690  -->  00:05:42,260
Super powerful guys.

92

00:05:42,360  -->  00:05:47,640
Anyway I'm going to see you in the next extra features for this course and I hope you have a lot of

93

00:05:47,640  -->  00:05:48,580
fun.

94

00:05:48,600  -->  00:05:50,150
Keep a keep coding.

95

00:05:50,160  -->  00:05:50,970
Do it every day.

96

00:05:50,970  -->  00:05:53,920
Practice practice practice because if you're new to this.

97

00:05:54,000  -->  00:05:58,560
This is going to be very easy to forget if you don't call for a couple of weeks.

98

00:05:58,560  -->  00:05:58,980
OK.

99

00:05:58,980  -->  00:06:05,130
So actually this will now be easy to forget but some of the stuff that we have been learning will be

100

00:06:05,130  -->  00:06:05,680
forgetful.

101

00:06:05,700  -->  00:06:09,980
So I mean we'll be lost in memory anyway.

102

00:06:09,990  -->  00:06:10,990
Thank you so much guys.

103

00:06:11,040  -->  00:06:13,360
I'll see you in the next lecture
