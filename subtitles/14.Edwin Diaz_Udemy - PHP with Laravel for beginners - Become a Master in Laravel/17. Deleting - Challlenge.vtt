00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.350
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:05.130
My hair stood and so I took the liberty of actually changing my picture.

3

00:00:05.160  -->  00:00:05.440
All right.

4

00:00:05.440  -->  00:00:10.360
The one that I had for was very very small so it just changes for the change that for this placeholder

5

00:00:10.380  -->  00:00:10.940
right here.

6

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:11.430
OK.

7

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:12.980
But anyway.

8

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:17.890
All right so it's time for us to start deleting this array and that's super easy.

9

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:27.090
Let's go back here and let's go to our end it and I think in the last one of those lectures there we

10

00:00:27.090  -->  00:00:36.150
actually went and created a I did a class here somewhere to one of these and made it a column of small

11

00:00:37.680  -->  00:00:42.500
sets and we just made this this way.

12

00:00:42.570  -->  00:00:43.180
OK.

13

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:48.800
And now what we did in the after that is that we added another form down here.

14

00:00:48.870  -->  00:00:54.950
Let me see whoops whole form.

15

00:00:56.610  -->  00:00:59.270
And we're going to just go here and just say

16

00:01:02.530  -->  00:01:04.070
destroy.

17

00:01:05.010  -->  00:01:07.690
OK.

18

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:16.410
And here delete Of course we don't need a title for this

19

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:24.440
post.

20

00:01:24.540  -->  00:01:29.060
And let's also create a class here.

21

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:38.090
Call us sets and make this danger.

22

00:01:38.170  -->  00:01:47.900
All right let's go back here whoops and define action.

23

00:01:48.720  -->  00:01:51.280
Oh.

24

00:01:51.450  -->  00:01:57.870
Admin pools controller wouldn't need to change this to admin but is cool.

25

00:01:57.870  -->  00:02:02.280
After a while guys you gonna start noticing what's missing in your application.

26

00:02:02.340  -->  00:02:08.310
These errors might look very intimidating at first but once you get to know them I mean once you you

27

00:02:08.310  -->  00:02:14.960
make a couple mistakes you know how they are which one they are OK.

28

00:02:15.430  -->  00:02:15.900
So

29

00:02:19.390  -->  00:02:24.810
as you can see there every time that I go back in I find the error I know exactly what it is and just

30

00:02:24.810  -->  00:02:27.760
because it happened to me many times in the past OK.

31

00:02:27.810  -->  00:02:28.470
All right cool.

32

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:31.670
So we have this working here and this looks pretty awesome the way it is.

33

00:02:31.680  -->  00:02:33.090
I think they don't.

34

00:02:33.090  -->  00:02:38.460
Guys we're going to you know keep adding or adding facial features to it once we finish our application

35

00:02:38.470  -->  00:02:38.800
.

36

00:02:39.030  -->  00:02:43.260
But we first have to get the foundation get this thing working properly.

37

00:02:43.410  -->  00:02:44.500
Right.

38

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:45.100
All right cool.

39

00:02:45.120  -->  00:02:51.990
So what I'm going to do is I want you to go to your the controller I mean controller and write the logic

40

00:02:51.990  -->  00:02:55.880
here to destroy the post.

41

00:02:55.920  -->  00:03:00.360
And at the same time the images from the server.

42

00:03:00.470  -->  00:03:01.350
Right.

43

00:03:01.590  -->  00:03:06.500
So do that and I'll see you in the next lecture lecture.

44

00:03:06.880  -->  00:03:08.510
I say lecture.

45

00:03:08.530  -->  00:03:11.480
She's my English is getting worse by every lecture guys
