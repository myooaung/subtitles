00:00:00.800  -->  00:00:03.130
Are welcome back by the A-student.

2

00:00:03.210  -->  00:00:08.730
So it's time for us to start playing around with our application a little bit right learning how to

3

00:00:08.730  -->  00:00:15.300
create stuff how to read data and all that good stuff from the many to many relationship right.

4

00:00:15.300  -->  00:00:16.220
All right cool.

5

00:00:16.410  -->  00:00:18.330
So let's get going.

6

00:00:18.330  -->  00:00:23.100
Let's go to the HP storm editor or to your editor.

7

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:26.510
Actually this is an idea guys get used to calling it a night.

8

00:00:26.520  -->  00:00:30.830
Powell for I.D. one of the most powerful storm IDs.

9

00:00:30.990  -->  00:00:37.500
Now if Giedd brains which is the company behind B-tree story wants to give me you know some money for

10

00:00:37.500  -->  00:00:41.600
advertising their product that's OK I can I'll take something awry.

11

00:00:41.940  -->  00:00:47.130
You know I mean I love PSAP story but if I get something from it I'm good.

12

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:50.040
Actually no they don't give me anything.

13

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:50.880
That's OK.

14

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:51.720
I don't want that.

15

00:00:51.750  -->  00:00:53.150
I don't want anything.

16

00:00:53.550  -->  00:00:56.620
I just recommend what's best for my students anyway.

17

00:00:56.780  -->  00:01:00.510
So let's go ahead and create.

18

00:01:01.670  -->  00:01:04.350
Let's see we actually need a user guys.

19

00:01:04.370  -->  00:01:09.510
Right so let's go back to the PSP ad man.

20

00:01:09.530  -->  00:01:13.750
PSP Kathman is create a user real quick actually.

21

00:01:13.880  -->  00:01:15.770
Now that's one too many.

22

00:01:16.320  -->  00:01:20.060
I mean literally that's the database table.

23

00:01:20.160  -->  00:01:24.870
We've got to go too many too many if we can find it.

24

00:01:24.870  -->  00:01:25.880
There we go.

25

00:01:26.130  -->  00:01:39.330
It's create a user real quick and the user of course is going to be Edwin D.S. and coding faculty and

26

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:43.430
password 2:59 I don't recommend that we might change that later.

27

00:01:43.880  -->  00:01:47.410
And I remember talking and I want you to remember me yet.

28

00:01:47.520  -->  00:01:53.700
Maybe we'll talk about that when we go to the logon section of our course in when we're building a really

29

00:01:53.700  -->  00:01:55.670
awesome application right guys.

30

00:01:55.680  -->  00:01:56.790
All right.

31

00:01:56.790  -->  00:01:59.140
So we gather user.

32

00:01:59.220  -->  00:02:05.460
Let's go real quick to our routes because that's what we were using to just learn this stuff for now

33

00:02:05.460  -->  00:02:06.000
.

34

00:02:06.090  -->  00:02:09.380
Later on we're going to be using other cool things.

35

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:16.200
But right now we've got to go to route and we've got to create something right away.

36

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:18.360
Let's go ahead and create something.

37

00:02:18.360  -->  00:02:19.500
I love creating.

38

00:02:19.500  -->  00:02:21.080
All right cool.

39

00:02:21.180  -->  00:02:21.930
Let's do.

40

00:02:21.930  -->  00:02:25.140
Let's create a royal descent time attached.

41

00:02:25.650  -->  00:02:29.210
Assign a user to that rule or assign a role to a user right.

42

00:02:29.460  -->  00:02:30.900
So we're going to say create

43

00:02:32.790  -->  00:02:37.680
function with a little closure there.

44

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:38.660
All right cool.

45

00:02:38.700  -->  00:02:41.890
So I'm going to say we're going to hold this in a variable of course.

46

00:02:41.890  -->  00:02:47.520
We got to find the user first and the user's name and all that stuff.

47

00:02:47.520  -->  00:02:49.260
What would we have to find the user's name.

48

00:02:49.350  -->  00:02:54.510
But we find the user by each ID and we can do the apps the namespace guys.

49

00:02:54.520  -->  00:02:55.740
We're not going to do the namespace.

50

00:02:55.740  -->  00:03:02.490
We're going to imported from the top we go imported right here.

51

00:03:02.490  -->  00:03:03.170
Cool.

52

00:03:03.510  -->  00:03:04.110
All right.

53

00:03:04.410  -->  00:03:05.790
So how do we do this.

54

00:03:05.790  -->  00:03:12.030
Well first of all we create the role right instantiated in this is very similar to one that we did already

55

00:03:12.030  -->  00:03:12.600
.

56

00:03:12.600  -->  00:03:15.490
So we could say new role.

57

00:03:15.690  -->  00:03:17.070
This is the class.

58

00:03:17.160  -->  00:03:18.360
Sometimes you leave it like this.

59

00:03:18.360  -->  00:03:25.020
But if you have anything that you want to inject injected with we could in this case when injected with

60

00:03:26.100  -->  00:03:31.470
an array and associative array that's going to have the role in there.

61

00:03:31.760  -->  00:03:34.190
I hope you see what we're doing.

62

00:03:34.260  -->  00:03:34.880
OK.

63

00:03:35.130  -->  00:03:44.140
And then we say OK user I want you to grab your rolls and save this roll.

64

00:03:44.200  -->  00:03:48.180
It would go awry.

65

00:03:48.580  -->  00:03:48.840
OK.

66

00:03:48.840  -->  00:03:50.430
Everything looks really good here.

67

00:03:50.430  -->  00:03:55.410
Remember we can put this whole thing just to save.

68

00:03:56.220  -->  00:04:02.240
We can pull this whole thing here and save a line of code about that.

69

00:04:02.370  -->  00:04:03.680
Does it look better to you.

70

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:08.790
Make sure that you import these role model as well on top.

71

00:04:08.790  -->  00:04:11.850
That looks good to me guys in two lines of code.

72

00:04:11.910  -->  00:04:17.850
Look all we're doing with finding a user We're checking for it's relationship where we saving our relationship

73

00:04:17.860  -->  00:04:18.400
.

74

00:04:18.930  -->  00:04:19.500
Wow.

75

00:04:19.530  -->  00:04:20.160
Unbelievable.

76

00:04:20.160  -->  00:04:21.040
All right.

77

00:04:21.480  -->  00:04:25.050
Let's go to create real quick and see if we get some type of error.

78

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:31.000
We didn't get any error guys love errors anyway.

79

00:04:31.380  -->  00:04:38.170
Rowse we gather all insert it with the Create ing of day date time stamps.

80

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:39.190
Wow.

81

00:04:39.210  -->  00:04:43.180
Well columns and they are type time stamps.

82

00:04:43.500  -->  00:04:44.490
Wow guys.

83

00:04:44.490  -->  00:04:45.730
Beautiful right.

84

00:04:46.000  -->  00:04:52.570
Let's go to this let's go to the roll user and look at this.

85

00:04:52.680  -->  00:05:03.870
We created the roll that we put it data in here the id the user id one in roll one we assign this user

86

00:05:03.930  -->  00:05:08.400
a rule that it's beautiful eyes Ray.

87

00:05:09.090  -->  00:05:14.150
Wow I'm amazed right amazed.

88

00:05:14.220  -->  00:05:14.980
Beautiful.

89

00:05:15.000  -->  00:05:25.200
So now you know how to create in a many to many relationship how to insert a role and how to to a user

90

00:05:25.200  -->  00:05:26.960
already beautiful.

91

00:05:26.990  -->  00:05:29.430
You can't you really cannot get better than this.

92

00:05:29.430  -->  00:05:30.300
Thank you so much guys.

93

00:05:30.300  -->  00:05:31.080
You are learning a lot.

94

00:05:31.110  -->  00:05:35.560
I'm learning a lot by teaching you because the more I do this stuff the better.

95

00:05:35.580  -->  00:05:36.870
It's in great in my brain.

96

00:05:36.930  -->  00:05:37.290
All right.

97

00:05:37.290  -->  00:05:40.640
So that's why I always tell you keep practicing practicing practicing.

98

00:05:40.860  -->  00:05:46.660
Well I already know this stuff but the more I write it the more ideas I get about the things.

99

00:05:46.680  -->  00:05:50.760
Anyway thank you so much for watching guys and I see you in that lecture
