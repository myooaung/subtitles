00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.010
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:08.010
So before you go to the next section I want to actually let you know that we can also find out about

3

00:00:08.010  -->  00:00:09.510
relationships with thinker.

4

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:10.110
OK.

5

00:00:10.170  -->  00:00:16.260
So just in case you want to find out if your relationship is working you can come to tinker and just

6

00:00:16.260  -->  00:00:19.730
try it out pulao the object and find out if he has a relationship.

7

00:00:19.730  -->  00:00:28.130
For example let's say we are trying to pulao the post tags or the photos or the even the user of the

8

00:00:28.210  -->  00:00:34.560
pools or we want to go to a user and find out it's photos or it's rolls we can find that out.

9

00:00:34.780  -->  00:00:37.260
All right all you have to do is go to a thinker and try it out.

10

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:44.520
So for example user we can find out they use as many posts if we have set up our relationship correctly

11

00:00:44.520  -->  00:00:44.740
.

12

00:00:44.880  -->  00:00:51.040
So let's find out real quick let's say it's good to think real quick and let's just say post that fun

13

00:00:51.040  -->  00:00:52.990
the other user right.

14

00:00:53.880  -->  00:00:57.570
So I'm going to find other user ID number one because that's the only user we have.

15

00:00:57.570  -->  00:01:00.600
So let's type in the name space.

16

00:01:00.600  -->  00:01:04.710
All right let's find the user would ID one.

17

00:01:04.770  -->  00:01:12.240
Once we have the user which is you can see right here that when D.S. we can grab the user object and

18

00:01:12.240  -->  00:01:16.380
say user Polsce enter.

19

00:01:16.450  -->  00:01:18.070
Whoops.

20

00:01:18.890  -->  00:01:23.130
All right so he can now find the user because he has not been set up.

21

00:01:23.130  -->  00:01:30.750
So he's looking for the user id and post so if you go to the your polls table you can see that we come

22

00:01:30.750  -->  00:01:36.410
into this now because we are trying now another relationship so he can now find the user.

23

00:01:36.420  -->  00:01:40.110
And this is how you learn what each relationship is actually doing.

24

00:01:40.120  -->  00:01:45.640
And so you can see this relationship is looking for user id impose a does not find it.

25

00:01:45.840  -->  00:01:46.650
All right.

26

00:01:46.920  -->  00:01:51.690
So that's that's what it does that's what his polls method does in the model.

27

00:01:51.750  -->  00:01:56.870
He goes out there and tries to look for user ID and that's why you have to come to the model.

28

00:01:57.790  -->  00:01:58.890
OK.

29

00:01:59.470  -->  00:02:05.090
And the user actually and fine if you have a differing ID in the second parameter.

30

00:02:05.090  -->  00:02:10.060
Remember Like I said because right now by the fall he's looking for user ID.

31

00:02:10.430  -->  00:02:10.810
OK.

32

00:02:10.920  -->  00:02:16.400
So now he doesn't have a pose for let's check to see if he has rules.

33

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:18.160
Let's see if we have that working.

34

00:02:18.160  -->  00:02:24.360
So let's say user roles answer.

35

00:02:24.420  -->  00:02:25.420
And he does have a role.

36

00:02:25.450  -->  00:02:28.630
He has a roll of over of a minute.

37

00:02:29.100  -->  00:02:32.770
OK as you can see right here.

38

00:02:32.940  -->  00:02:34.590
All right.

39

00:02:34.590  -->  00:02:35.610
Pretty cool stuff right.

40

00:02:35.640  -->  00:02:41.580
So you can play around even with your relationships and you can pulao your relationship and update them

41

00:02:41.920  -->  00:02:43.780
delete them do whatever you want with them.

42

00:02:43.790  -->  00:02:49.770
Just as we do with routes I just wanted to give you this a little tip before you go onto the next section

43

00:02:49.770  -->  00:02:50.180
.

44

00:02:50.190  -->  00:02:54.540
All right we are going to be playing too much around anymore we think because we've got to focus on

45

00:02:55.290  -->  00:02:59.130
finishing this course and building this awesome application that we're going to build here.

46

00:02:59.310  -->  00:03:01.690
That is going to take you to further heights.

47

00:03:01.710  -->  00:03:02.360
All right.

48

00:03:02.370  -->  00:03:04.350
So anyway thank you so much for watching this.

49

00:03:04.350  -->  00:03:05.700
And I'll see you in the next lecture
