00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:00.690
All right.

2

00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:02.320
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.370  -->  00:00:07.150
So if you guys haven't done so already I suggest for you to make a repository.

4

00:00:07.170  -->  00:00:11.330
All right now we are saving these changes in our computer and that's OK.

5

00:00:11.400  -->  00:00:17.000
We can roll back time and you go back to work a a time where things were better.

6

00:00:17.030  -->  00:00:18.210
And just in case we get stuck.

7

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:21.260
What is it about time that you create a new repository.

8

00:00:21.540  -->  00:00:29.940
That way you guys can actually push this to an online cloud like get hub or some type of repository

9

00:00:30.330  -->  00:00:35.790
hosting company out there and you can pull it from anywhere in the world the way you always have you

10

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:36.630
probably you're somewhere else.

11

00:00:36.630  -->  00:00:39.130
But anyway I'm going to do that right now.

12

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:40.790
As you can see I got my.

13

00:00:40.800  -->  00:00:43.420
Well you can't see it yet but I'm going to show it.

14

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:48.960
I got my good side into your good harp account.

15

00:00:48.960  -->  00:00:50.820
I'm going to create a repository here.

16

00:00:50.820  -->  00:00:53.000
You guys should know how to do that already showed you.

17

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:58.860
I'm going to call this cold hacking called hacking.

18

00:00:58.860  -->  00:01:00.020
There we go.

19

00:01:00.600  -->  00:01:08.660
And for me it's going to be private because I'm paying for it but for you guys should be free to the

20

00:01:08.670  -->  00:01:09.540
public.

21

00:01:09.540  -->  00:01:10.580
All right.

22

00:01:11.310  -->  00:01:15.650
And don't worry for that people can copy a cold unless it's a really fancy application.

23

00:01:15.810  -->  00:01:17.120
Do not worry about it.

24

00:01:17.250  -->  00:01:17.840
All right.

25

00:01:18.150  -->  00:01:20.140
There are millions of projects here and there.

26

00:01:20.220  -->  00:01:22.310
So I'm going to create that.

27

00:01:22.350  -->  00:01:29.130
And just because we already have an existing project we're going to choose this option right here so

28

00:01:29.130  -->  00:01:34.900
we're going to copy that and make sure that you have everything commit committed already.

29

00:01:34.900  -->  00:01:37.140
Or let's just say get status.

30

00:01:37.140  -->  00:01:40.080
We have some modified files that we need to add.

31

00:01:40.620  -->  00:01:48.060
So let's just say I'm good at everything.

32

00:01:48.480  -->  00:01:53.040
And then get commit and we're going to say

33

00:01:55.740  -->  00:02:06.930
able to create tools with dynamic categories or something like that.

34

00:02:06.930  -->  00:02:07.870
All right.

35

00:02:08.460  -->  00:02:12.750
Good knowledge do good push actually.

36

00:02:12.810  -->  00:02:14.660
We've got to do this.

37

00:02:14.940  -->  00:02:16.510
We paid Dagget remote.

38

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:27.960
We can add it to our remote right and then we got to do a good push with a good push you for user origin

39

00:02:29.910  -->  00:02:30.750
from Master

40

00:02:33.510  -->  00:02:34.850
enter user name

41

00:02:37.680  -->  00:02:43.650
for me and the password we go.

42

00:02:43.650  -->  00:02:47.310
Now let's come back here and refresh.

43

00:02:48.140  -->  00:02:50.630
And now you Prodgers and get help.

44

00:02:50.640  -->  00:02:51.070
All right.

45

00:02:51.150  -->  00:02:56.590
So you can come back here and you know you you see all your comments.

46

00:02:57.090  -->  00:03:00.620
You can check your files.

47

00:03:01.740  -->  00:03:02.390
Right.

48

00:03:02.520  -->  00:03:04.620
You can even get to them if you want.

49

00:03:05.190  -->  00:03:06.260
Right from here.

50

00:03:06.540  -->  00:03:08.760
OK.

51

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:12.750
Say that and you can even committer from here if you want to do that.

52

00:03:12.770  -->  00:03:14.880
So a little interface there for you to do.

53

00:03:14.880  -->  00:03:18.490
All right cool stuff right.

54

00:03:18.490  -->  00:03:24.590
Anyway so now every time you make a comment if you want to push it push it to good get help.

55

00:03:24.600  -->  00:03:25.740
You're welcome to do that.

56

00:03:25.740  -->  00:03:29.220
All right I just wanted to make this a little lecture here just to remind you to do that.

57

00:03:29.220  -->  00:03:30.510
Very important guys.

58

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:31.080
All right.

59

00:03:31.320  -->  00:03:38.270
There you have you probably you're somewhere else and you're also doing you get comments continuously

60

00:03:38.490  -->  00:03:39.070

61

00:03:39.500  -->  00:03:45.740
Yes that is really cool.

62

00:03:45.740  -->  00:03:46.680
