00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.620
All right.

2

00:00:00.620  -->  00:00:06.020
Welcome back I'm a student so it's tough for us to go to the controller.

3

00:00:06.080  -->  00:00:08.610
We're going to started doing some stuff here first.

4

00:00:08.610  -->  00:00:10.350
We're got to display the categories here.

5

00:00:10.350  -->  00:00:10.970
Right.

6

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:13.580
So of the guys having a good day.

7

00:00:13.580  -->  00:00:14.820
Right.

8

00:00:16.440  -->  00:00:23.870
It's a beautiful day to be courting and to be doing what you love.

9

00:00:23.970  -->  00:00:27.400
This should be getting pretty easy for you.

10

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:28.730
The more we do it.

11

00:00:29.470  -->  00:00:31.320
I don't want you to fall asleep here OK.

12

00:00:31.320  -->  00:00:35.620
You can learn something any time of the day.

13

00:00:35.940  -->  00:00:41.970
And any part of any lecture that I make even though it might be look similar to the rest you might learn

14

00:00:41.970  -->  00:00:42.620
something OK.

15

00:00:42.620  -->  00:00:45.070
So always pay attention.

16

00:00:45.070  -->  00:00:47.460
Don't go to sleep.

17

00:00:47.520  -->  00:00:50.550
I know you're tired but keep it going OK.

18

00:00:50.550  -->  00:00:50.850
All right.

19

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:56.100
Let's go to this real quick here and we can't explain the categories here.

20

00:00:56.100  -->  00:01:03.000
All right now we're going to actually develop this a little bit in between columns so let's use to do

21

00:01:03.100  -->  00:01:05.010
small sets.

22

00:01:05.070  -->  00:01:06.210
Let's do two of these

23

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:09.810
and

24

00:01:12.770  -->  00:01:15.480
you can get a small table.

25

00:01:15.480  -->  00:01:21.400
So this play them or we can use a small table.

26

00:01:21.470  -->  00:01:22.020
Oops.

27

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:26.460
That's a big table.

28

00:01:27.340  -->  00:01:30.910
Well let's just display the idea here.

29

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:32.520
And the name

30

00:01:43.920  -->  00:01:48.460
380 create it.

31

00:01:48.540  -->  00:01:52.110
That's fine.

32

00:01:52.690  -->  00:01:54.600
That's just three things there.

33

00:01:54.720  -->  00:01:56.670
Come back here.

34

00:01:56.730  -->  00:02:00.760
All right we're now going to display them unless we have some rhyme.

35

00:02:01.500  -->  00:02:07.620
So if categories then display them

36

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:14.310
and if.

37

00:02:14.550  -->  00:02:19.030
All right let's do that for each right here so we can loop through it

38

00:02:24.180  -->  00:02:26.920
category.

39

00:02:27.120  -->  00:02:27.870
Let's

40

00:02:30.330  -->  00:02:32.590
eliminate it for each row.

41

00:02:32.610  -->  00:02:35.730
Here are my

42

00:02:38.670  -->  00:02:41.520
category ID

43

00:02:48.160  -->  00:02:49.830
or you name

44

00:03:04.230  -->  00:03:05.070
created

45

00:03:11.610  -->  00:03:14.190
to for humans

46

00:03:17.810  -->  00:03:27.310
.

47

00:03:29.040  -->  00:03:30.000
Check it out real quick

48

00:03:31.300  -->  00:03:35.350
.

49

00:03:41.910  -->  00:03:42.720
Let's look.

50

00:03:42.840  -->  00:03:43.910
This doesn't have a.

51

00:03:44.040  -->  00:03:46.070
OK that's because it doesn't have a date.

52

00:03:46.140  -->  00:03:47.120
OK that's fine.

53

00:03:47.370  -->  00:03:50.170
Let's just do this here.

54

00:03:50.190  -->  00:04:00.000
If he doesn't have a if he has a day with this play it would be nice if we had this one too.

55

00:04:02.670  -->  00:04:05.520
If he doesn't display no date.

56

00:04:06.090  -->  00:04:07.150
OK.

57

00:04:08.100  -->  00:04:11.540
There we go.

58

00:04:12.060  -->  00:04:14.000
All right.

59

00:04:15.540  -->  00:04:19.190
So let's go back to end it real quick.

60

00:04:19.230  -->  00:04:28.470
Actually we are in in this sorry about race so this last year is not working properly.

61

00:04:28.470  -->  00:04:30.710
There we go.

62

00:04:31.140  -->  00:04:32.060
We should actually be.

63

00:04:32.060  -->  00:04:33.630
Explain this one.

64

00:04:33.660  -->  00:04:34.890
Let's just do this one

65

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:42.410
in this table here.

66

00:04:43.680  -->  00:04:45.230
OK.

67

00:04:46.320  -->  00:04:49.730
And then we're going to create the categories and this one here.

68

00:04:49.770  -->  00:04:53.570
All right let's do the form right here.

69

00:04:53.570  -->  00:04:54.940
All right.

70

00:04:55.560  -->  00:05:09.010
Post actually we are good with that man category's controller post.

71

00:05:09.030  -->  00:05:12.150
We just need that title and that's that's that's good.

72

00:05:12.150  -->  00:05:16.050
Actually almost almost there we just need to change that

73

00:05:21.250  -->  00:05:21.780
so that

74

00:05:27.260  -->  00:05:27.750
we

75

00:05:31.230  -->  00:05:34.060
can even come back here.

76

00:05:34.380  -->  00:05:35.420
We see that.

77

00:05:35.970  -->  00:05:37.650
That's beautiful isn't it.

78

00:05:37.650  -->  00:05:39.690
Let's try to do everything one step.

79

00:05:39.690  -->  00:05:40.770
Guys.

80

00:05:40.850  -->  00:05:41.740
All right.

81

00:05:41.860  -->  00:05:42.660
We'll be beautiful.

82

00:05:42.660  -->  00:05:43.580
We can do that.

83

00:05:43.580  -->  00:05:44.760
And let's see.

84

00:05:44.990  -->  00:05:47.040
In one lecture I mean.

85

00:05:47.660  -->  00:05:48.630
And we are not

86

00:05:51.990  -->  00:05:53.000
snus not here.

87

00:05:53.220  -->  00:05:55.040
This is not it.

88

00:05:55.200  -->  00:05:56.980
This is the guy right here.

89

00:05:57.600  -->  00:06:06.720
I was wondering where my request was and we don't need this right here yes we already have an array

90

00:06:06.720  -->  00:06:08.400
with requests.

91

00:06:08.730  -->  00:06:12.480
Let's return that right

92

00:06:17.760  -->  00:06:24.210
to demand categories.

93

00:06:24.620  -->  00:06:25.970
All right.

94

00:06:26.670  -->  00:06:29.420
Let's check it out.

95

00:06:31.230  -->  00:06:31.810
All right.

96

00:06:31.930  -->  00:06:34.350
What can we put here.

97

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:35.550
Let's do Java.

98

00:06:35.550  -->  00:06:37.290
Even though that has nothing to do with jouster.

99

00:06:37.290  -->  00:06:38.250
Don't confuse it.

100

00:06:38.250  -->  00:06:39.870
There we go.

101

00:06:39.900  -->  00:06:40.570
All right.

102

00:06:40.710  -->  00:06:42.360
That's working.

103

00:06:42.660  -->  00:06:44.780
BHB on steroids.

104

00:06:44.970  -->  00:06:45.400
OK.

105

00:06:45.450  -->  00:06:46.810
Let's just do this.

106

00:06:46.980  -->  00:06:52.840
Lavell is BHP on steroids.

107

00:06:52.890  -->  00:06:55.680
That's a good title for us and Tupperware say.

108

00:06:55.710  -->  00:06:59.490
There we go see that beautiful.

109

00:06:59.640  -->  00:07:06.540
You can of course put the updated time here when you when you guys put the updated version page right

110

00:07:07.700  -->  00:07:08.970
when we get to that.

111

00:07:09.360  -->  00:07:10.440
We'll do that.

112

00:07:10.470  -->  00:07:11.240
All right perfect.

113

00:07:11.250  -->  00:07:13.720
So we got a lot done.

114

00:07:13.770  -->  00:07:18.050
You see how easy it starts getting after you complete the first.

115

00:07:18.500  -->  00:07:20.730
A user is opposing everything.

116

00:07:20.730  -->  00:07:22.950
Everything else after that is very similar.

117

00:07:22.950  -->  00:07:27.730
So thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you in the next lecture
