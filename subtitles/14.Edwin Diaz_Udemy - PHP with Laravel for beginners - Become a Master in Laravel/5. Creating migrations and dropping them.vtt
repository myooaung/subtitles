00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:02.280
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.440  -->  00:00:09.000
I wanted to start this video with his view so that way you can you know feel this refreshment in your

3

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:12.300
mind and get ready to learn some really cool stuff with migrations.

4

00:00:12.300  -->  00:00:12.750
Right.

5

00:00:12.900  -->  00:00:15.970
So let's open our editor.

6

00:00:16.330  -->  00:00:22.230
All right whatever it is it doesn't matter which other editor you use even though I would love you to

7

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:27.700
use BHB song which is really cool guys is one of the best ideas out there.

8

00:00:27.720  -->  00:00:29.740
It's not an editor is just an ID.

9

00:00:29.970  -->  00:00:31.640
Integrated Development Environment.

10

00:00:31.720  -->  00:00:35.130
We have a whole bunch of features here and are really cool.

11

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:42.390
But anyway so now that you know how to migrate our migration files and I wanted to start this video

12

00:00:42.450  -->  00:00:44.130
away from the migration file.

13

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:46.620
So the way you learn where it is.

14

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:52.910
So remember we open our folder we go to database make sense right and then we go to migrations and then

15

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:54.740
we find the right here we just double click on it.

16

00:00:54.740  -->  00:00:59.270
And this is where we have our files right or glasses.

17

00:00:59.280  -->  00:00:59.820
Right.

18

00:01:00.000  -->  00:01:06.210
So like I said now that you know how to migrate Let's actually create a migration from scratch which

19

00:01:06.210  -->  00:01:07.930
is really cool I think right.

20

00:01:08.130  -->  00:01:13.260
Let's just come here and clear answer right.

21

00:01:13.740  -->  00:01:17.490
And then let's create a migration So how do we create a migration I remember when I told you how to

22

00:01:17.490  -->  00:01:21.780
use this tool BHB artisan and how to get information out of it.

23

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:28.230
Just type BHB already sending enter and then you can see everything that you can all the commands and

24

00:01:28.230  -->  00:01:34.450
we're going to be using this command migrate and we create the command are like this.

25

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:39.810
You write the command migrate and then a colon and then after you tell it what you want to do.

26

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:45.070
So in the case of migration we just say migrate any we migrate to database.

27

00:01:45.270  -->  00:01:52.600
But if we want to make a migration we're going to have to use the make command right here.

28

00:01:52.620  -->  00:01:54.250
And we can make whatever we want.

29

00:01:54.270  -->  00:01:58.070
So we're going to make a migration right guys and ladies of course.

30

00:01:58.200  -->  00:02:01.470
So let's clear this again clear enter.

31

00:02:01.650  -->  00:02:09.570
And now let's say BHP artisan right make call in migration.

32

00:02:09.850  -->  00:02:13.510
Right now I want you to pay very close attention to this.

33

00:02:13.560  -->  00:02:15.140
We have the name of that migration.

34

00:02:15.150  -->  00:02:20.340
I want you to follow this convention because this is the convention that Larabee uses right Largo developers

35

00:02:20.340  -->  00:02:28.840
uses all lowercase and we separate each word by a underscore or dash y.

36

00:02:29.250  -->  00:02:35.460
So we're going to make a migration we're going to call this we've got to we've got to use this create

37

00:02:35.880  -->  00:02:37.830
pools table.

38

00:02:37.860  -->  00:02:44.590
You see that all right now we've got to use a flag.

39

00:02:45.030  -->  00:02:45.760
All right.

40

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:54.270
We're going to say two hyphens there and we're going to say create and then we're going to do this equal

41

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:59.880
symbol and then whatever we want so I'm going to put in double cords and we can say I'm going to create

42

00:02:59.880  -->  00:03:02.170
a table name pause.

43

00:03:02.370  -->  00:03:09.840
So I hope you see the convention the way this is created bitchery artisan make call it migration.

44

00:03:09.870  -->  00:03:17.460
And then the name or the actual description or how you want your migrations to be named are-I create

45

00:03:17.460  -->  00:03:22.510
Post table a little flag here to tell Claribel to take a toll.

46

00:03:22.530  -->  00:03:28.880
This command line tool that we want to create a table name pools then we click enter.

47

00:03:29.850  -->  00:03:36.630
And now all we have to do is click back here and you should see that migration there very soon.

48

00:03:36.630  -->  00:03:39.570
In your case it might be just there right now.

49

00:03:39.600  -->  00:03:41.370
For some reason the mining

50

00:03:44.150  -->  00:03:46.080
is taking a little bit of time in my

51

00:03:49.170  -->  00:03:49.770
right here.

52

00:03:49.770  -->  00:03:50.430
There we go.

53

00:03:50.670  -->  00:03:51.260
I'm having a.

54

00:03:51.270  -->  00:03:56.550
I have a lot of monitors around me and a lot of things running so it takes a little bit for this to

55

00:03:56.550  -->  00:04:01.090
work in depends on the memory that you're using and how fast your computer is on times.

56

00:04:01.110  -->  00:04:05.640
But anyway did you see that migration right here and we click double click it out of the box.

57

00:04:05.670  -->  00:04:09.340
We have we have some boilerplate try we have some information already.

58

00:04:09.540  -->  00:04:15.720
We have the USB meant that the down meant that we have the name of the table we have the column we have

59

00:04:15.720  -->  00:04:21.450
an incremental ID column automatically and we have some time stamp that created and updated at right

60

00:04:21.440  -->  00:04:22.040
.

61

00:04:22.050  -->  00:04:23.350
Pretty cool stuff right.

62

00:04:23.550  -->  00:04:29.260
So now I'm going to use the object right dependency injection.

63

00:04:29.580  -->  00:04:36.120
Right here you see that this object just like I explain to you a video or two years ago.

64

00:04:36.820  -->  00:04:47.550
Table and then what you did that I want on the next column I want to have a string named what title

65

00:04:48.360  -->  00:04:50.640
because I'm creating a pool table.

66

00:04:50.640  -->  00:04:53.980
Then I want another one on one.

67

00:04:54.850  -->  00:05:02.910
Whoops I want to create a body of my polls and I'm going to use tetch for this.

68

00:05:02.910  -->  00:05:03.810
All right.

69

00:05:03.870  -->  00:05:06.760
Because that would mean that I am going to have a rock.

70

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:09.860
I'm going to write a lot of tats.

71

00:05:09.900  -->  00:05:11.670
So that could be the body.

72

00:05:11.670  -->  00:05:12.360
Right.

73

00:05:12.780  -->  00:05:19.100
And if I wanted the title to be unique I'd just do this unique and use right.

74

00:05:19.710  -->  00:05:20.940
I could do that.

75

00:05:20.940  -->  00:05:26.800
There's a lot of things there are little functions that you can use there's another function call all

76

00:05:26.820  -->  00:05:33.030
of all there are many of them and you can look it up on the beach be not happy to be dot net on the

77

00:05:33.030  -->  00:05:38.110
Lero Bill dot com Web site an honorable are-I we have default.

78

00:05:38.110  -->  00:05:42.910
So if you wanted the full value on it you can do that.

79

00:05:43.120  -->  00:05:44.920
All right.

80

00:05:44.970  -->  00:05:48.360
You can do and sign for integers.

81

00:05:48.360  -->  00:05:50.320
I mean you name it they have it.

82

00:05:50.370  -->  00:05:51.470
Pretty cool stuff.

83

00:05:51.480  -->  00:05:55.090
So now that I have my definition here for the table.

84

00:05:55.520  -->  00:05:56.130
All right.

85

00:05:56.340  -->  00:06:05.630
I'm going to I'm going to migrate it so BHB areason migrate enter.

86

00:06:05.760  -->  00:06:06.330
There we go.

87

00:06:06.330  -->  00:06:06.950
Now migrate.

88

00:06:07.020  -->  00:06:10.930
Oh I have to do is go back to BHB my admin and find they there.

89

00:06:10.980  -->  00:06:11.510
All right.

90

00:06:11.730  -->  00:06:17.530
So now I want you to go to BICI my admin and make sure that that was there.

91

00:06:17.580  -->  00:06:18.870
All right.

92

00:06:19.770  -->  00:06:20.430
All right.

93

00:06:20.760  -->  00:06:26.700
So I'm going to actually traveling there myself well not traveling.

94

00:06:27.090  -->  00:06:29.370
Let's go and find it right here.

95

00:06:29.370  -->  00:06:30.650
Claribel see a mess.

96

00:06:30.760  -->  00:06:36.090
And as you can see we've got the pool table where of all these fields which is pretty cool.

97

00:06:36.090  -->  00:06:37.050
Hey guys.

98

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:38.810
Now let's say I won.

99

00:06:38.850  -->  00:06:41.490
I change my mind and want to edit this table.

100

00:06:41.490  -->  00:06:44.610
I don't have to come here to structure and change it.

101

00:06:44.940  -->  00:06:46.910
I don't have to do that with my Laro bell.

102

00:06:46.920  -->  00:06:49.010
Awesome framework.

103

00:06:49.140  -->  00:06:53.630
What I got to do is I go BHP Moriarty's Arrison.

104

00:06:54.720  -->  00:06:55.230
All right.

105

00:06:55.230  -->  00:06:59.600
Migrate Kallen roll back.

106

00:07:00.300  -->  00:07:02.820
Enter now we roll back the post.

107

00:07:02.880  -->  00:07:04.620
That was the last one we did.

108

00:07:04.620  -->  00:07:11.180
So this rolls back or it deletes that table that leads to the last migration that you did.

109

00:07:11.430  -->  00:07:21.630
So now if I go to PHM my admin and I refresh this let's go to Claribel see a mess and you can see the

110

00:07:21.630  -->  00:07:24.730
post table was not is nowhere to be found.

111

00:07:24.750  -->  00:07:26.040
Pretty cool right.

112

00:07:26.520  -->  00:07:29.550
I can also do.

113

00:07:29.550  -->  00:07:34.220
Now we can edit this and you call this content.

114

00:07:34.260  -->  00:07:35.830
All right.

115

00:07:36.650  -->  00:07:44.520
And now I can press my upkeep my keyboard and BHB autism migrate again Antar.

116

00:07:45.210  -->  00:07:52.240
Now if I refresh we can see that we have the pool table again with new change.

117

00:07:52.740  -->  00:07:53.180
Right.

118

00:07:53.190  -->  00:07:54.890
Pretty cool guys.

119

00:07:54.990  -->  00:07:57.060
Pretty pretty cool.

120

00:07:57.060  -->  00:07:57.540
All right.

121

00:07:57.540  -->  00:08:01.320
So in the next lecture we're going to learn some more stuff about migration and I hope you have a lot

122

00:08:01.320  -->  00:08:02.020
of fun here.

123

00:08:02.020  -->  00:08:06.440
I hope you see the usefulness how useful it is to use migrations are I.

124

00:08:06.560  -->  00:08:11.580
You don't have to travel back and forth and you know if you are working with a team is very easy for

125

00:08:11.580  -->  00:08:18.300
you to give them the application and let them create it you know put it in their projects migrate the

126

00:08:18.300  -->  00:08:24.570
tables instead of creating the tables from Peachtree my admin or manually having to configure that right

127

00:08:24.580  -->  00:08:24.840
.

128

00:08:25.080  -->  00:08:29.970
You already defined that here in the application and once you give it to them they can just migrate

129

00:08:29.990  -->  00:08:31.590
in they have their tables.

130

00:08:31.740  -->  00:08:32.650
Pretty cool.

131

00:08:32.650  -->  00:08:34.430
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

132

00:08:34.450  -->  00:08:37.760
Next lecture we are going to be learning some more cool stuff all right.

133

00:08:37.800  -->  00:08:39.060
So keep active.

134

00:08:39.060  -->  00:08:40.260
Get your coffee.

135

00:08:40.320  -->  00:08:44.680
If you don't drink coffee get a natural energy drink and keep it up you learning really good stuff here

136

00:08:44.710  -->  00:08:44.800
.

137

00:08:44.880  -->  00:08:46.120
Guys feel proud.

138

00:08:46.260  -->  00:08:46.690
Take care
