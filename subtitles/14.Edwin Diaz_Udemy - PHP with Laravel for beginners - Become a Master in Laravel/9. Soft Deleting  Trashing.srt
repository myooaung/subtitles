1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:01,980
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:07,560
So in the last lecture we learned how to delete data using eloquent on this lecture here.

3

00:00:07,620  -->  00:00:11,730
We are also going to learn how to delete data but in a different way.

4

00:00:11,760  -->  00:00:18,690
Right so I'm going to ask you Have you ever use a feature in some of the CMAs programs out there like

5

00:00:18,690  -->  00:00:24,650
Wordpress Drupal where you actually delete the item any put in the same as puts it in the trash page

6

00:00:24,650  -->  00:00:24,700
.

7

00:00:24,720  -->  00:00:25,100
Right.

8

00:00:25,120  -->  00:00:29,680
And then you go to that trash page and then you can delete the item from there permanently.

9

00:00:29,700  -->  00:00:33,840
That's exactly what we are going to be learning here on this lecture today.

10

00:00:33,940  -->  00:00:39,360
We're going to now only the lead item we're going to put it on the trash Aspasia our application right

11

00:00:39,380  -->  00:00:39,410
.

12

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:43,800
Well not in this case is not going to be our application yet but we're going to put it.

13

00:00:43,800  -->  00:00:47,120
We've got to Larrabee know that it's not the leader 100 percent.

14

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:48,810
But it is a softer lead.

15

00:00:48,840  -->  00:00:53,670
So he's going to put a time stamp on a new column that we are going to be creating called the need to

16

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:54,720
act.

17

00:00:54,750  -->  00:00:58,470
So with that time stamp we let Larabee know listen is not deleted.

18

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:01,620
Do I tell you to force it to delete.

19

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:08,700
So anyway without explaining too much because sometimes we don't understand good explanations as much

20

00:01:08,700  -->  00:01:09,840
as we understand we code.

21

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:10,890
Let me show you.

22

00:01:10,920  -->  00:01:16,180
So the first thing that we are going to do that we have to do is we've got to import the database.

23

00:01:16,280  -->  00:01:18,000
The class of the leads.

24

00:01:18,090  -->  00:01:18,730
OK.

25

00:01:18,930  -->  00:01:24,130
So let's actually import in this use you use it from here.

26

00:01:24,140  -->  00:01:34,110
You illuminate then database Boob's database then after database is eloquent because we're going to

27

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:37,180
be using that and then it's called soft deletes.

28

00:01:37,290  -->  00:01:37,990
There we go.

29

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:41,630
And then we want to use it.

30

00:01:41,970  -->  00:01:46,520
So we just say use of delete here.

31

00:01:47,370  -->  00:01:47,980
OK.

32

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:49,000
Beautiful.

33

00:01:49,140  -->  00:01:53,340
After this what we also need is to set up protected property

34

00:01:56,220  -->  00:01:57,060
called dates.

35

00:01:57,060  -->  00:02:04,560
And the reason why we do this is because we let our vote know to treat this column as a date time stamp

36

00:02:04,560  -->  00:02:06,270
column column.

37

00:02:06,300  -->  00:02:08,050
So it's going to be called the lead it.

38

00:02:08,070  -->  00:02:12,470
We haven't created it yet but it's going to be called the it at.

39

00:02:12,720  -->  00:02:13,370
OK.

40

00:02:13,680  -->  00:02:15,520
And make sure that you put it here.

41

00:02:15,570  -->  00:02:20,760
All right remember this property is already set we Clarabelle internally.

42

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:25,800
So we already have these properties available from the model when we send extend all these classes or

43

00:02:25,800  -->  00:02:28,380
if you go here you should see all of this

44

00:02:31,400  -->  00:02:32,990
or these properties here.

45

00:02:32,990  -->  00:02:35,550
Can you see dates right here.

46

00:02:35,650  -->  00:02:41,470
OK and I did that by pressing control control click or command click on iMac.

47

00:02:41,520  -->  00:02:43,340
Ok cool.

48

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:49,440
So now let's create a migration and let's just clear this out and let's just say BHP areason

49

00:02:51,990  -->  00:03:08,150
and make migration add the lead it column actually delete it at column 2 pulls through.

50

00:03:09,090  -->  00:03:09,950
OK.

51

00:03:10,530  -->  00:03:12,000
And and that's it.

52

00:03:12,090  -->  00:03:16,630
Oh actually we do a flag here table and we save pools.

53

00:03:16,680  -->  00:03:21,570
I do it without all the cords this time.

54

00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:22,060
All right.

55

00:03:22,140  -->  00:03:24,430
Whoops.

56

00:03:25,040  -->  00:03:26,910
I misspelled that oops sorry.

57

00:03:27,010  -->  00:03:34,200
It's now be Orge P H O P I'm creating a new web programming language here.

58

00:03:34,200  -->  00:03:34,680
Antar.

59

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:35,570
There we go.

60

00:03:35,910  -->  00:03:37,370
So that's complete I'm going to do.

61

00:03:37,370  -->  00:03:42,390
Right click and I and I synchronize this I don't have that problem that I used to have before with this

62

00:03:42,390  -->  00:03:44,530
not appearing here.

63

00:03:44,620  -->  00:03:46,640
All right there we go.

64

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:47,430
Double click on it.

65

00:03:47,430  -->  00:03:49,090
That's where we are.

66

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:57,370
If so now I'm going to show you a new trick here which allows us to create this in a faster way.

67

00:03:57,570  -->  00:04:03,570
They will solve the leads I'm going to use this function to create a column with a tag stamping everything

68

00:04:03,570  -->  00:04:04,380
in there.

69

00:04:04,380  -->  00:04:05,800
All right.

70

00:04:05,820  -->  00:04:15,300
So I'm going to also use the object table to drop it just in case we need to roll it back delete it

71

00:04:15,650  -->  00:04:16,890
.

72

00:04:17,570  -->  00:04:18,980
There we go.

73

00:04:18,990  -->  00:04:19,840
All right.

74

00:04:20,490  -->  00:04:27,870
So this is just when we run that migrate rollback or reset or whatever he allows it let's Lauber know

75

00:04:27,870  -->  00:04:31,120
that that it could he can drop it if we want to.

76

00:04:31,410  -->  00:04:36,780
So anyway let's go back and let's learn how to do this let's go two routes.

77

00:04:36,810  -->  00:04:42,860
And if you click imag shift twice you can navigate.

78

00:04:42,860  -->  00:04:45,200
I believe Windows you can also do the same thing.

79

00:04:45,390  -->  00:04:47,720
I'm not 100 percent sure.

80

00:04:47,730  -->  00:04:48,150
All right.

81

00:04:48,300  -->  00:04:58,540
So let's create a roll real quick around and let's call this soft delete.

82

00:04:58,860  -->  00:05:07,290
Now I also have to create some data because I deleted my data before and you guys probably don't know

83

00:05:07,290  -->  00:05:07,310
.

84

00:05:07,320  -->  00:05:13,650
But what happens is that I got to tell you right now sometimes when you are creating migrations like

85

00:05:13,650  -->  00:05:17,420
this and if you come here and you try to be.

86

00:05:18,010  -->  00:05:22,230
And you just try to delete one of these files manually like right clicking or whatever.

87

00:05:22,370  -->  00:05:29,520
Or from termino you got to have a problem because you does migrations are going to be recorded in the

88

00:05:29,520  -->  00:05:32,600
migrations table inside your database.

89

00:05:32,610  -->  00:05:33,080
Right.

90

00:05:33,090  -->  00:05:35,380
This is how it keeps track of the migrations.

91

00:05:35,400  -->  00:05:41,760
So when you delete it here is going to have it in the in the in the table and he's going to create a

92

00:05:41,760  -->  00:05:44,080
problem is going to have it in the database.

93

00:05:44,250  -->  00:05:48,220
So what you need to do is do my PH BE Adisa migrate reset.

94

00:05:48,330  -->  00:05:53,750
So that way you reset the migrations table and then you can go ahead and delete this item from here

95

00:05:53,790  -->  00:05:56,680
and then do BHB artist and migrate again.

96

00:05:56,820  -->  00:05:57,290
OK.

97

00:05:57,480  -->  00:06:01,800
So if you have any issues migrate we said could we solve it.

98

00:06:01,860  -->  00:06:02,440
All right.

99

00:06:02,610  -->  00:06:07,520
So we can solve the lead this item so what we're going to do is let's put some data first.

100

00:06:07,530  -->  00:06:17,910
I'm going to come here and look for this create functionality right here and see if we can create some

101

00:06:17,910  -->  00:06:18,210
data.

102

00:06:18,210  -->  00:06:19,770
Real quick.

103

00:06:19,770  -->  00:06:21,030
There we go.

104

00:06:21,920  -->  00:06:23,700
Whoops.

105

00:06:23,790  -->  00:06:25,830
Oh you know what I need to do.

106

00:06:25,830  -->  00:06:33,490
Peachtree migration migrate actually BHB artisan migrate we go.

107

00:06:33,900  -->  00:06:35,530
Now let's do it.

108

00:06:36,330  -->  00:06:39,440
And that's because I did a migraine reset.

109

00:06:39,450  -->  00:06:42,820
So that's why you probably don't have to do that guys.

110

00:06:43,950  -->  00:06:49,110
All right so now you see this this is the table where records are the migration.

111

00:06:49,110  -->  00:06:53,230
So if you delete it in the Claribel application it doesn't get the data here.

112

00:06:53,310  -->  00:06:55,110
So make sure that you do the reset.

113

00:06:55,110  -->  00:06:58,210
So let's go to the polls and we how we see that we have a new post here.

114

00:06:58,320  -->  00:07:00,420
And let's say I want to delete it you see the column here.

115

00:07:00,450  -->  00:07:02,690
It's said to know automatically.

116

00:07:02,850  -->  00:07:12,630
So now when we we call the method on this let's say we will look for it find and I think he has I.D.

117

00:07:12,630  -->  00:07:16,720
one find is and the leading

118

00:07:19,410  -->  00:07:20,360
thinker.

119

00:07:20,820  -->  00:07:22,760
See how easy that is right.

120

00:07:23,370  -->  00:07:29,460
And we're just going to do of the lead Real quick up here Antar.

121

00:07:29,490  -->  00:07:34,220
All right now we go back here and we refresh a look at this column watch.

122

00:07:34,710  -->  00:07:37,240
You see that we get a date there.

123

00:07:37,900  -->  00:07:40,850
All right.

124

00:07:40,860  -->  00:07:41,780
So that's how he knows.

125

00:07:41,790  -->  00:07:47,010
But in the next lecture I'm going to show you how to pour this information out because we can actually

126

00:07:48,150  -->  00:07:55,620
run a query through this and pull it out like we normally do when we have a record.

127

00:07:55,680  -->  00:07:59,870
Now we have to force it to actually give us the lead items.

128

00:08:00,060  -->  00:08:00,810
All right.

129

00:08:00,810  -->  00:08:05,630
Because we won't by default we will not show this when you try to read it.

130

00:08:05,730  -->  00:08:06,030
All right.

131

00:08:06,030  -->  00:08:10,440
By default will not show you the record because he has just deleted this time stamp here.

132

00:08:10,440  -->  00:08:13,000
If it was no then he will come out.

133

00:08:13,090  -->  00:08:17,940
They will come like a regular polls like a regular Recker not on the leader record.

134

00:08:17,940  -->  00:08:20,270
All right so every time he has his stamp is deleted.

135

00:08:20,640  -->  00:08:27,590
So we won't show you when you do a fine or OK or or when you try to just pull the information out.

136

00:08:27,630  -->  00:08:32,130
But anyway on to the next election going to show you how to do that in a couple more really cool things

137

00:08:32,130  -->  00:08:32,670
from our.

138

00:08:32,680  -->  00:08:35,200
Laura Bell thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
