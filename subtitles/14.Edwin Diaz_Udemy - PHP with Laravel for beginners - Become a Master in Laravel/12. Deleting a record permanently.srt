1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:01,890
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:06,930
It's time for us to find out how to actually delete something permanently.

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:09,140
So now we have converged converter.

4

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:12,230
This application is now really an application.

5

00:00:12,230  -->  00:00:14,760
Yeah but let's say for example it is right.

6

00:00:14,910  -->  00:00:18,780
So we in our application we can actually delete an item anymore right.

7

00:00:18,810  -->  00:00:25,380
Because every time we hit that the method is going to actually trash it instead of the leading it permanently

8

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:25,680
.

9

00:00:25,680  -->  00:00:30,100
So how do we delete these items permanently take it off from the database immediately.

10

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:33,290
Well we need to use another method.

11

00:00:33,330  -->  00:00:37,850
I'm not gonna tell you until I get there so I'll wait for me to finish writing.

12

00:00:37,870  -->  00:00:38,670
Right.

13

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:39,600
And I.

14

00:00:39,690  -->  00:00:44,010
I wish you can guess the name of this method.

15

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:45,220
You guessed it.

16

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:47,750
What is it.

17

00:00:47,760  -->  00:00:53,530
No that's not it does not it is code for the league.

18

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:54,420
You're right.

19

00:00:54,510  -->  00:00:55,460
Yeah you're right.

20

00:00:55,500  -->  00:00:56,510
He is not.

21

00:00:56,670  -->  00:00:57,110
All right.

22

00:00:57,190  -->  00:01:04,380
But anyway so all we got to do right now is do the same thing with the here.

23

00:01:04,640  -->  00:01:05,390
Right.

24

00:01:05,430  -->  00:01:12,270
I'm just going to this time I'm really going to to do it like this guys.

25

00:01:12,300  -->  00:01:21,380
And then all we have to cold is this guy right here for us the lead.

26

00:01:21,390  -->  00:01:22,620
All right.

27

00:01:22,990  -->  00:01:29,190
So let's do it.

28

00:01:29,650  -->  00:01:38,070
Fours the lead Antar right there.

29

00:01:38,240  -->  00:01:39,560
Why la.

30

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:42,500
Oops I forgot my worst.

31

00:01:42,560  -->  00:01:44,730
Guys I'm so sorry.

32

00:01:44,730  -->  00:01:53,640
I deleted everything that was is admen so it not only deleted the ones that were deleted but deleted

33

00:01:53,650  -->  00:01:53,740
.

34

00:01:53,750  -->  00:01:56,680
What's with with the is out of me is 0.

35

00:01:56,730  -->  00:01:57,760
Oops.

36

00:01:57,780  -->  00:02:03,930
All right so as you can see if you make one simple mistake and you don't pull that worst you can delete

37

00:02:03,930  -->  00:02:05,790
all your data from the database.

38

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:07,620
Right cool.

39

00:02:07,700  -->  00:02:13,190
Anyway you must be like pulling your hair right now because you had a lot of data and I mess you up

40

00:02:13,190  -->  00:02:13,790
the night.

41

00:02:14,100  -->  00:02:16,940
Well that's cool so that way you can write more stuff right.

42

00:02:17,010  -->  00:02:18,780
Don't complain please.

43

00:02:18,860  -->  00:02:20,480
All right.

44

00:02:21,210  -->  00:02:23,440
Let's go ahead and create some data real quick.

45

00:02:23,520  -->  00:02:24,180
Super easy.

46

00:02:24,180  -->  00:02:25,550
We already have those met the guys.

47

00:02:25,560  -->  00:02:28,110
Come on don't get lazy we create it.

48

00:02:28,530  -->  00:02:31,530
And let's actually put a different one here.

49

00:02:31,710  -->  00:02:34,910
Let's just put a number in front of it guys whatever number it doesn't matter.

50

00:02:34,910  -->  00:02:36,610
Don't be picky right.

51

00:02:37,120  -->  00:02:37,970
All right.

52

00:02:38,150  -->  00:02:40,710
And then enter again refresh.

53

00:02:41,070  -->  00:02:48,520
Right now all we've got to do is deleted delete one of them.

54

00:02:49,320  -->  00:02:51,640
Super easy guys don't complain so much.

55

00:02:51,640  -->  00:02:55,950
Please actually let's find number

56

00:03:00,830  -->  00:03:03,450
that's fine we can do use of the leave method doesn't matter.

57

00:03:03,690  -->  00:03:06,840
As you can see that solved the lead and this the lead is the same.

58

00:03:06,850  -->  00:03:08,370
That's just fine number four.

59

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:17,890
In my case number four I don't know what it is in your case and delete enter refresh.

60

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:20,310
And of course is not really deleted.

61

00:03:20,730  -->  00:03:21,450
So now

62

00:03:27,210  -->  00:03:29,940
this forcedly is going to be used differently.

63

00:03:30,150  -->  00:03:32,580
While we're going to do this we're going to say only

64

00:03:35,250  -->  00:03:40,180
only trash items yes.

65

00:03:40,530  -->  00:03:40,950
OK

66

00:03:48,490  -->  00:03:49,050
Antar

67

00:03:51,750  -->  00:03:58,710
and refresh as you can see only that the Leidy items that trash items were deleted.

68

00:03:58,770  -->  00:04:02,150
So cool re.

69

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:07,980
Anyway I want to thank you so much for watching the series of the leading stuff were eloquent which

70

00:04:07,980  -->  00:04:11,520
is pretty cool I think and I'm just going to show you some more stuff.

71

00:04:11,520  -->  00:04:13,710
All right so in the next.

72

00:04:13,710  -->  00:04:16,420
Stay tuned for the next lecture is going to have a lot more fun right.

73

00:04:16,470  -->  00:04:18,830
Take care and I'll see you in the next lectures.
