00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:05,280
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture you learned how to create a controller in different

2

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:05,680
ways.

3

00:00:05,680  -->  00:00:08,680
You will learn how to create a controller manually.

4

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:14,580
And we also learn it by using the BHB command line tool BHB artisan.

5

00:00:14,580  -->  00:00:20,660
Now before we go anywhere else let me show you how to find some more commands and BHB artisan right

6

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:26,820
BHB areason enter an issue as you can see here.

7

00:00:27,060  -->  00:00:32,940
There's a bunch of other commands that we can do with Beechfield addition.

8

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:33,470
All right.

9

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:37,890
Even though most of most of them you don't know them now but you will know them later.

10

00:00:37,950  -->  00:00:41,660
And if you look at some of this you could tell what they do.

11

00:00:42,180  -->  00:00:42,560
All right.

12

00:00:42,570  -->  00:00:44,730
This deal with databases.

13

00:00:44,790  -->  00:00:46,820
This is the route.

14

00:00:46,870  -->  00:00:52,710
All right this would give me controllers models you name it we can make it with BHP Orison.

15

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:53,300
All right.

16

00:00:53,320  -->  00:00:54,690
I don't know how it is.

17

00:00:54,700  -->  00:00:56,550
I sure am going to bring it down a little bit.

18

00:00:56,550  -->  00:00:59,910
I like to always have my terminal of the table close to me.

19

00:00:59,910  -->  00:01:00,450
All right.

20

00:01:00,570  -->  00:01:03,900
So I just told you that we are going to be learning how to use a controller.

21

00:01:03,900  -->  00:01:06,860
So we're going to use a pulse controller here.

22

00:01:07,110  -->  00:01:08,270
All right.

23

00:01:08,790  -->  00:01:12,450
To give you an example.

24

00:01:12,450  -->  00:01:18,290
So let's go to route's because that's where we start to build everything in our application.

25

00:01:18,300  -->  00:01:19,090
All right.

26

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:23,490
And let's actually comment on this

27

00:01:26,290  -->  00:01:29,160
when I come in everything now and I'm going to leave

28

00:01:33,270  -->  00:01:34,030
this one here.

29

00:01:34,050  -->  00:01:35,330
That's fine.

30

00:01:36,140  -->  00:01:37,150
OK.

31

00:01:37,700  -->  00:01:38,970
And then bring down a little bit.

32

00:01:38,970  -->  00:01:40,230
I'm going to create another

33

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:50,890
GET request right here and this one is going to be name post.

34

00:01:50,900  -->  00:01:51,300
All right.

35

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:53,410
Remember what I told you about that.

36

00:01:53,460  -->  00:01:55,240
All right.

37

00:01:56,400  -->  00:02:02,000
And then the second parameter instead of being of a closure function is going to be a controller.

38

00:02:02,010  -->  00:02:04,500
So here we just type in the name of the controller.

39

00:02:04,500  -->  00:02:08,230
So polls this is the same name we got right here.

40

00:02:08,600  -->  00:02:12,320
OK has to be the same controller.

41

00:02:12,350  -->  00:02:13,130
All right.

42

00:02:13,470  -->  00:02:15,510
So let's say for that.

43

00:02:15,510  -->  00:02:21,340
So now every time we try to make a request to post it's going to have this controller right here.

44

00:02:21,510  -->  00:02:25,560
But guess while we also have to tell it what type of method is going to hit.

45

00:02:25,740  -->  00:02:26,270
Right.

46

00:02:26,280  -->  00:02:32,880
I want to access the end it's so I'm going to say post controllers at symbol and then the index method

47

00:02:32,960  -->  00:02:33,880
.

48

00:02:34,290  -->  00:02:35,200
Right.

49

00:02:35,820  -->  00:02:41,850
So once I do that then every time I click on post it is going to go to the post controller is going

50

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:44,730
to look for that's met it beautiful.

51

00:02:44,730  -->  00:02:51,500
So now if I do like this the way it is right now what you think is going to happen let's go see a mass

52

00:02:51,510  -->  00:02:56,400
that the flash polls enter.

53

00:02:56,690  -->  00:03:00,550
Nothing's going to happen is going to be blank but at least we didn't get any arrows right.

54

00:03:00,550  -->  00:03:02,660
So we know that it is working.

55

00:03:03,030  -->  00:03:04,770
So let's go back here.

56

00:03:05,280  -->  00:03:06,500
Let's go to the controller.

57

00:03:06,520  -->  00:03:11,940
This double clicking and typing something here and it's good this is what he's hitting right now.

58

00:03:11,940  -->  00:03:12,990
All right.

59

00:03:12,990  -->  00:03:15,290
This is the root directory.

60

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:19,080
That's what we tell he were telling it to hit right in it.

61

00:03:19,110  -->  00:03:21,850
So we're going to return some data used to find out if it's working.

62

00:03:22,230  -->  00:03:27,020
So we're going to say it's working well some string actually.

63

00:03:27,090  -->  00:03:30,300
So let's go and enter here.

64

00:03:30,360  -->  00:03:35,310
And as you can see we are returning data so we know the control is working.

65

00:03:35,310  -->  00:03:36,800
Beautiful.

66

00:03:36,800  -->  00:03:37,540
All right.

67

00:03:37,860  -->  00:03:41,230
Let's go back to it now.

68

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:45,870
Remember that we can passing data Ashwell to the controller.

69

00:03:46,200  -->  00:03:46,910
OK.

70

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:51,050
So without me doing anything I want you to guess.

71

00:03:51,120  -->  00:03:56,160
So I wanted to go around and guess how we can pass data to this controller right here.

72

00:03:56,980  -->  00:03:59,580
And in this method.

73

00:03:59,920  -->  00:04:00,240
Right.

74

00:04:00,240  -->  00:04:05,580
So I want you to guess and try to do it yourself even if you have to spend 20 minutes doing it you learn

75

00:04:05,580  -->  00:04:09,750
a bunch in the next lecture I'm going to show you how to pass data to the controller.

76

00:04:09,750  -->  00:04:10,320
All right.

77

00:04:10,560  -->  00:04:13,770
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
