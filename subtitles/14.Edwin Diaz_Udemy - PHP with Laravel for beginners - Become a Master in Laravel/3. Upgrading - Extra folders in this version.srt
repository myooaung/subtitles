1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,500
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,510  -->  00:00:06,600
I'm a student in this lecture here we're going to be jumping right to the cold and find out exactly

3

00:00:06,600  -->  00:00:09,090
what it takes to upgrade to 5.3.

4

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:14,730
First of all I want to show you some of the major components that are actually breaking our application

5

00:00:14,800  -->  00:00:15,480
right.

6

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:21,060
So let me see let me come here and let's open up our project.

7

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:24,990
I've got my project open in BHB storm.

8

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:25,730
All right.

9

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:28,900
So this is the old application.

10

00:00:28,960  -->  00:00:37,800
This is the old one I'm going to open up another one a 5.3 installation so that where you can see the

11

00:00:37,800  -->  00:00:38,590
difference.

12

00:00:38,790  -->  00:00:39,060
All right.

13

00:00:39,090  -->  00:00:42,150
I'm going to open up and

14

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:49,420
you have a one here.

15

00:00:49,420  -->  00:00:53,970
All right one thing that I don't want you to take a look too much I don't want you to be paying attention

16

00:00:53,970  -->  00:00:57,030
is where I have my code.

17

00:00:57,060  -->  00:01:04,020
My my applications because I'm using a different computer so you know from the last time from the last

18

00:01:04,020  -->  00:01:05,640
lectures to this one.

19

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:11,160
All right before this section I was using on a different computer and all my files were somewhere else

20

00:01:11,160  -->  00:01:11,630
.

21

00:01:11,640  -->  00:01:12,230
All right.

22

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:18,900
So if you see my application that is a little in my file structure well where I keep my files usually

23

00:01:18,900  -->  00:01:21,510
in this folder here Colden that stuff.

24

00:01:21,630  -->  00:01:27,380
This is from another computer or I remember that in the last section I was keeping everything in HD

25

00:01:27,430  -->  00:01:27,840
dogs.

26

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:32,550
I'm using another a different computer and doing everything in it in a different environment.

27

00:01:32,570  -->  00:01:32,780
Right.

28

00:01:32,840  -->  00:01:36,080
But everything else you apply to it.

29

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:40,180
You know like the everything that we're doing the application the same thing.

30

00:01:40,180  -->  00:01:41,670
Are we using the same application.

31

00:01:41,670  -->  00:01:44,640
I just got it in a different directory in my computer.

32

00:01:44,700  -->  00:01:45,310
That's all.

33

00:01:45,510  -->  00:01:46,080
All right.

34

00:01:46,080  -->  00:01:50,480
So let's go to the application real quick we know that our application is working.

35

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:55,800
All right so if we go to call hacking and then by the way I'm also using a different extension so don't

36

00:01:55,800  -->  00:01:57,000
worry about that.

37

00:01:57,330  -->  00:01:59,600
I know you're using the Wii.

38

00:01:59,730  -->  00:02:01,770
That's why we were using before.

39

00:02:01,770  -->  00:02:07,390
I'm using dot AP AP which is just the extension guys is the same thing right.

40

00:02:07,680  -->  00:02:08,370
All right.

41

00:02:08,520  -->  00:02:10,410
So our application is working.

42

00:02:10,500  -->  00:02:11,470
This is 5.2.

43

00:02:11,470  -->  00:02:12,450
We still 5.2.

44

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:21,300
So if we go this is the new version but if we go to our version the one we were using we were a terminal

45

00:02:23,010  -->  00:02:25,640
and we type in ph priorities.

46

00:02:25,670  -->  00:02:29,260
And I feel high inversion.

47

00:02:29,610  -->  00:02:31,190
We can see that this is 5.2.

48

00:02:31,260  -->  00:02:31,630
All right.

49

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:32,780
We know that.

50

00:02:33,390  -->  00:02:37,770
So let me make this a little small here because I want to show you the difference that Major where our

51

00:02:37,770  -->  00:02:40,720
application where our application is breaking.

52

00:02:40,720  -->  00:02:41,490
All right.

53

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:44,840
And why is breaking I'll say.

54

00:02:45,040  -->  00:02:45,650
All right.

55

00:02:45,780  -->  00:02:48,810
Right we'll take this off.

56

00:02:48,810  -->  00:02:50,230
We don't need it anymore.

57

00:02:50,670  -->  00:02:51,250
All right.

58

00:02:51,480  -->  00:02:55,200
So this is the new Lavell right here.

59

00:02:55,230  -->  00:02:57,940
All right have you noticed something different in this one.

60

00:02:58,920  -->  00:03:02,530
While going to tell you right now drought's folder.

61

00:03:02,640  -->  00:03:04,100
Yes.

62

00:03:04,230  -->  00:03:11,640
Now we have a route's folder here in these routes folder in the new Lavell version has three different

63

00:03:11,640  -->  00:03:18,390
files API that BHP cancels that BHP and that BHP went up BHP is where we're going to be keeping our

64

00:03:18,390  -->  00:03:19,750
routes from now on.

65

00:03:19,770  -->  00:03:28,380
There's no more HTP routes BHP there's no more class that does that is only the controllers the middle

66

00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:30,990
when the colonel here nothing else.

67

00:03:30,990  -->  00:03:37,430
And as you'll notice also they Apfel this seems very small right.

68

00:03:37,460  -->  00:03:44,530
Look at this apple right here we have what is a listener's policies a bunch of other things.

69

00:03:44,530  -->  00:03:53,490
Jobs does classes here are only created when we need them so in the new version 5.3 if we need a policy

70

00:03:53,490  -->  00:03:58,710
we wouldn't we would create we would create it would appear to be artist in command and that piece Pre-OT's

71

00:03:58,710  -->  00:04:01,940
in command is going to also create a folder as we need it.

72

00:04:02,190  -->  00:04:06,690
So none of this stuff that we're really not needing here and this is actually empty.

73

00:04:06,690  -->  00:04:07,480
You see that.

74

00:04:07,680  -->  00:04:09,540
So we don't have any of the stuff here.

75

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:12,060
Only less is needed in 5.3.

76

00:04:12,060  -->  00:04:12,580
All right.

77

00:04:12,720  -->  00:04:16,810
So the major thing that's breaking out application is this route folder here.

78

00:04:16,800  -->  00:04:18,830
These are basically our routes.

79

00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:19,790
All right.

80

00:04:20,220  -->  00:04:23,730
So we're going to we're going to do that right now we're going to fix this.

81

00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:29,480
So let's go to our application and I'm going to go into this area by error.

82

00:04:29,550  -->  00:04:33,480
All right just like you doing it yourself or you don't know what you're doing but then you got me behind

83

00:04:33,480  -->  00:04:40,220
your back showing you to make it basically teaching you how to make it work.

84

00:04:40,230  -->  00:04:40,960
All right.

85

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:48,750
So I'm going to be you and you're going to have me behind you telling you what's going on.

86

00:04:48,750  -->  00:04:49,220
All right.

87

00:04:49,410  -->  00:04:50,480
All right let's do it.

88

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:59,190
So let's go to compel composer composer Jason and we can see that here we have the 5.2.

89

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:00,070
Right.

90

00:05:00,600  -->  00:05:04,290
Well actually right here 5.2 Lex Cheniere to 5.3.

91

00:05:04,890  -->  00:05:08,020
And let's encounter our first error.

92

00:05:08,100  -->  00:05:10,700
So composer of date that's what you got to do.

93

00:05:11,140  -->  00:05:11,390
Right.

94

00:05:11,400  -->  00:05:12,750
Now this is going to take a little bit.

95

00:05:12,750  -->  00:05:18,190
So my puzzle video and you're not going to notice it but I just wanted to let you know that if it takes

96

00:05:18,190  -->  00:05:21,960
you a while for you is taking me a while for me as well.

97

00:05:21,990  -->  00:05:22,930
All right.

98

00:05:25,330  -->  00:05:27,920
It took it took probably like 10 15 seconds.

99

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:30,950
But anyway you see the first arrow that we got here.

100

00:05:30,990  -->  00:05:37,780
All right we got this script PH BE already saying optimize whatever and it's event service provider

101

00:05:37,780  -->  00:05:37,800
.

102

00:05:37,800  -->  00:05:39,920
All right let's go to event service provider.

103

00:05:39,930  -->  00:05:41,230
Let's go to app.

104

00:05:41,340  -->  00:05:42,200
That's where it is right.

105

00:05:42,210  -->  00:05:44,840
Let's check it out in app and provider.

106

00:05:44,850  -->  00:05:45,610
All right.

107

00:05:46,020  -->  00:05:51,670
So let's go there now app providers event service provider.

108

00:05:51,660  -->  00:05:52,210
All right.

109

00:05:52,380  -->  00:05:58,770
So the first problem that we got here is that we have parameters right here in the booth.

110

00:05:58,840  -->  00:06:00,610
We need to take that off.

111

00:06:00,620  -->  00:06:01,280
All right.

112

00:06:01,650  -->  00:06:12,690
And this is actually in the in the guy from Laro News where he Eric the creator of Lavoe gives some

113

00:06:12,690  -->  00:06:16,660
examples here on what to do from when we are upgrading.

114

00:06:16,700  -->  00:06:17,030
All right.

115

00:06:17,060  -->  00:06:21,160
To 5.3 he says take of the parameters that we're now using those anymore like that.

116

00:06:21,360  -->  00:06:22,530
So we take them off.

117

00:06:22,530  -->  00:06:22,830
All right.

118

00:06:22,830  -->  00:06:23,320
Great.

119

00:06:23,460  -->  00:06:28,800
So we just took him over let's see what happens and let's try again compose or update

120

00:06:33,630  -->  00:06:33,920
us.

121

00:06:34,020  -->  00:06:35,790
My post video again.

122

00:06:35,790  -->  00:06:40,400
It took a couple seconds and now you see that we have another arrow here Rao's service provider.

123

00:06:40,410  -->  00:06:42,970
The first error was event service provider.

124

00:06:43,140  -->  00:06:48,540
So he also tells us to take the parameters of this file here as well.

125

00:06:48,540  -->  00:06:49,980
We now need those.

126

00:06:50,310  -->  00:06:53,990
So we're not actually using the router here.

127

00:06:54,780  -->  00:07:00,900
We go we take them off take this off and because we are taking this off now we don't have this object

128

00:07:00,900  -->  00:07:04,500
right here so we need to actually call this startingly.

129

00:07:04,530  -->  00:07:05,430
All right.

130

00:07:05,430  -->  00:07:06,940
Play this.

131

00:07:06,960  -->  00:07:10,310
All right cool.

132

00:07:10,310  -->  00:07:12,690
All right.

133

00:07:13,230  -->  00:07:17,130
Now I can see a problem here already.

134

00:07:17,160  -->  00:07:23,580
Let's go up a little bit and here.

135

00:07:24,330  -->  00:07:24,870
All right.

136

00:07:24,930  -->  00:07:30,240
Since we using this route here we need to include it.

137

00:07:30,270  -->  00:07:30,790
All right.

138

00:07:30,810  -->  00:07:34,000
So let's see if BHB storm is going to help me out.

139

00:07:34,390  -->  00:07:40,170
It looks like he's helping me out telling me which one do you one we want included illuminates a poor

140

00:07:40,290  -->  00:07:42,400
facade route.

141

00:07:42,410  -->  00:07:44,810
All right cool.

142

00:07:44,880  -->  00:07:45,500
So he's there.

143

00:07:45,510  -->  00:07:47,090
Now we don't need this one.

144

00:07:47,100  -->  00:07:47,940
Take that off.

145

00:07:47,940  -->  00:07:50,610
All right cool.

146

00:07:50,650  -->  00:07:57,040
I know that I see here is that we have this.

147

00:07:57,120  -->  00:08:01,240
This right here so this app path is telling.

148

00:08:01,410  -->  00:08:07,680
Hey listen I want you to map all the routes to this class here and that's this class doesn't exist so

149

00:08:07,710  -->  00:08:10,940
we can't really map anything there.

150

00:08:10,950  -->  00:08:11,760
All right.

151

00:08:12,060  -->  00:08:14,410
So what do we do when we map it.

152

00:08:14,430  -->  00:08:16,530
That's the question.

153

00:08:17,050  -->  00:08:22,550
I told you that all the routes are going to be now in the new folder right coal route.

154

00:08:22,590  -->  00:08:23,890
So that's where we need to map.

155

00:08:23,910  -->  00:08:26,190
Well we don't have the For that we need to include that for them.

156

00:08:26,310  -->  00:08:31,440
As a matter of fact go ahead and download the folder in this lecture or I'm going to give you a folder

157

00:08:31,440  -->  00:08:32,790
with the three files.

158

00:08:32,790  -->  00:08:38,760
Go ahead and download it even though you can actually create a new lovely installation and copy the

159

00:08:38,760  -->  00:08:40,080
files from there if you want.

160

00:08:40,080  -->  00:08:40,600
All right.

161

00:08:40,860  -->  00:08:43,660
But I'm going to give you the folder for the 5.3.

162

00:08:43,680  -->  00:08:49,290
It's going to be on this lecture so download it and then copy those files to your project right here

163

00:08:49,290  -->  00:08:50,900
to the root of course.

164

00:08:50,930  -->  00:08:55,800
Right because the router is going to be right on their app actually not on the road map.

165

00:08:55,990  -->  00:08:56,470
Right.

166

00:08:56,520  -->  00:09:03,630
If we look at this installation right here we can see that route's is right actually not inside app

167

00:09:03,630  -->  00:09:06,810
is actually outside sound the route that was right the first time.

168

00:09:06,930  -->  00:09:07,680
Right.

169

00:09:08,100  -->  00:09:09,930
So we're going to copy that right now.

170

00:09:10,010  -->  00:09:10,620
I'm going to do it.

171

00:09:10,620  -->  00:09:18,270
But let's actually come here and crowds

172

00:09:21,240  -->  00:09:24,990
and this is going to be web BHB.

173

00:09:25,080  -->  00:09:25,830
All right.

174

00:09:26,310  -->  00:09:35,540
So now I'm going to go and try to find this in my installation somewhere.

175

00:09:35,540  -->  00:09:36,210
So we got.

176

00:09:36,450  -->  00:09:36,720
OK.

177

00:09:36,720  -->  00:09:37,730
This is the one that needs it.

178

00:09:37,740  -->  00:09:38,940
This is the one that has it.

179

00:09:39,100  -->  00:09:39,970
All right.

180

00:09:40,440  -->  00:09:48,120
So I come here I'm going to grab routes and Angle and to put it into a project that I'm working on.

181

00:09:48,120  -->  00:09:50,580
All right cool.

182

00:09:50,730  -->  00:09:54,650
So we should be here in a moment.

183

00:09:54,660  -->  00:09:55,380
All right.

184

00:09:55,660  -->  00:09:59,280
Still something wrong here with my provider files on thing.

185

00:09:59,730  -->  00:10:02,240
OK I'm messing this up here.

186

00:10:02,340  -->  00:10:03,470
Fix that.

187

00:10:03,750  -->  00:10:06,080
All right let me synchronize this.

188

00:10:06,390  -->  00:10:12,810
And yours might synchronize automatically but mine doesn't do it sometimes.

189

00:10:12,810  -->  00:10:14,570
Actually right here ready.

190

00:10:14,580  -->  00:10:15,800
All right.

191

00:10:16,800  -->  00:10:21,870
All right so we have this file here and let's see right now what we get.

192

00:10:21,870  -->  00:10:22,900
All right.

193

00:10:23,220  -->  00:10:29,350
So let's a composer update again.

194

00:10:30,870  -->  00:10:32,600
And that's where a little bit.

195

00:10:32,620  -->  00:10:34,930
Ooh we got a big one here.

196

00:10:35,490  -->  00:10:40,570
This one says listen answers fill opening routes that way.

197

00:10:40,640  -->  00:10:41,740
Which path.

198

00:10:41,760  -->  00:10:44,660
Let's look at the path real quick.

199

00:10:44,990  -->  00:10:46,470
We probably made a mistake here.

200

00:10:46,470  -->  00:10:48,340
OK we made it we didn't make a mistake.

201

00:10:48,360  -->  00:10:51,590
This is supposed to be base.

202

00:10:51,980  -->  00:10:57,670
All right let's try it again.

203

00:10:58,890  -->  00:11:01,270
Right.

204

00:11:03,390  -->  00:11:03,780
There we go.

205

00:11:03,780  -->  00:11:05,220
Looks like it worked.

206

00:11:05,550  -->  00:11:07,610
Let's go to a composer there Jason.

207

00:11:08,040  -->  00:11:12,400
And is there 5.3 is there.

208

00:11:12,900  -->  00:11:13,680
All right.

209

00:11:14,130  -->  00:11:17,200
So let's actually check the version right here.

210

00:11:17,320  -->  00:11:20,850
Beechfield is some version 5.3.

211

00:11:20,850  -->  00:11:21,690
All right.

212

00:11:21,690  -->  00:11:27,690
So we were able to upgrade it on the next lecture we are going to take a look at our application to

213

00:11:27,690  -->  00:11:28,980
see how it looks OK.

214

00:11:28,980  -->  00:11:33,680
Right now I'm going to go to the front end real quick and see.

215

00:11:33,810  -->  00:11:34,310
All right.

216

00:11:34,560  -->  00:11:36,780
So it looks good from here.

217

00:11:37,250  -->  00:11:43,970
All right fine or let's try to go to admin and it says of course that page is not available.

218

00:11:44,150  -->  00:11:47,410
Logon that page is not available.

219

00:11:47,710  -->  00:11:48,140
OK

220

00:11:50,820  -->  00:11:53,140
let's try.

221

00:11:54,360  -->  00:11:58,130
All right slogan something there let's go to our route.

222

00:11:58,200  -->  00:12:02,170
Let's go to the Web here that feeds file.

223

00:12:02,190  -->  00:12:05,490
And let's just do something here to see if it works.

224

00:12:05,820  -->  00:12:07,700
Whatever and save it.

225

00:12:07,800  -->  00:12:12,150
Well you don't have to save that year and BHB storm and refresh it.

226

00:12:12,330  -->  00:12:13,230
OK it's working.

227

00:12:13,290  -->  00:12:13,710
All right.

228

00:12:13,710  -->  00:12:16,610
We just had to figure out why are admins now working.

229

00:12:16,740  -->  00:12:19,260
Well we already know we don't have a router right.

230

00:12:19,260  -->  00:12:20,730
We don't have routes for it.

231

00:12:21,060  -->  00:12:31,680
Well the problem with the routes now is that I know for for a fact that I'm going to show you right

232

00:12:31,680  -->  00:12:36,770
now ph isn't let's just do it on this lecture thing we've got time.

233

00:12:36,880  -->  00:12:41,370
We're out less without making this lecture 20 minutes.

234

00:12:41,370  -->  00:12:42,810
All right.

235

00:12:43,560  -->  00:12:49,130
So we don't have the routes here that we can go to route stop BHP and.

236

00:12:49,170  -->  00:12:53,680
Well we still have our route so we can play around with here.

237

00:12:53,730  -->  00:12:56,400
Let's try to go to adenine real quick

238

00:12:59,400  -->  00:12:59,760
right here.

239

00:12:59,760  -->  00:13:01,380
Let's create this route.

240

00:13:01,710  -->  00:13:04,080
Let's go back here.

241

00:13:04,110  -->  00:13:06,810
All right.

242

00:13:06,810  -->  00:13:09,950
So now if we try to go to admen.

243

00:13:11,280  -->  00:13:12,380
All right.

244

00:13:13,440  -->  00:13:14,770
Or are we getting errors here.

245

00:13:14,770  -->  00:13:19,440
Well these are easily fixed and I'm going to show you how to do this in the next lecture I'm going to

246

00:13:19,440  -->  00:13:22,080
show you how to set our route.

247

00:13:22,080  -->  00:13:26,830
So in the next lecture we're going to be setting our routes and we're going to make this work ok.

248

00:13:27,150  -->  00:13:31,500
I just wanted to do the most I can on this first lecture without boring you without making this lecture

249

00:13:31,500  -->  00:13:33,850
30 minutes which some of you don't like.

250

00:13:33,900  -->  00:13:35,400
Anyway thank you so much guys.

251

00:13:35,530  -->  00:13:37,930
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
