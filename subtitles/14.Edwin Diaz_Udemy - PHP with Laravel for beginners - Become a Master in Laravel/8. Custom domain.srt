1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,540
All right.

2

00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:02,030
Welcome back my dear sir.

3

00:00:02,030  -->  00:00:07,900
And so in this lecture you're just going to show you real quick or tell you real quick how to add a

4

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:12,010
custom domain to your application for mail gun.

5

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:12,560
Right.

6

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:18,360
So let's say for example one at the faculty or I are not going to do it because this is super simple

7

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:21,170
and we don't have a problem sending email in the last lecture.

8

00:00:21,450  -->  00:00:24,810
But just in case you want your custom domain this is super simple.

9

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:26,240
Would we do this.

10

00:00:26,280  -->  00:00:27,790
And then here.

11

00:00:27,870  -->  00:00:29,090
All right.

12

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:30,790
Where is it.

13

00:00:31,420  -->  00:00:32,230
OK.

14

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:36,760
So you've got to go to your DNS section of your domain register.

15

00:00:36,780  -->  00:00:45,660
So if you're using Go Daddy you can go to domain's click on your domain manage your DNS and then there

16

00:00:45,750  -->  00:00:50,670
you're going to go to our page which says domain details and then you can add a record.

17

00:00:50,730  -->  00:00:55,450
So you click and record should be on the left side somewhere in Go Daddy ad wrecker and you're going

18

00:00:55,450  -->  00:01:01,140
to add a techo record your horse name is going to be your wife's name and the value is going to be this

19

00:01:01,380  -->  00:01:03,150
guy right here for the first tÃªtes.

20

00:01:03,150  -->  00:01:04,570
You're going to get two records.

21

00:01:04,650  -->  00:01:06,570
So then you click Save or click.

22

00:01:06,630  -->  00:01:08,040
I want to add another.

23

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:12,750
And then you other than that that's one you got another tetch Recker you got to put this as a host name

24

00:01:13,140  -->  00:01:17,390
and then you're going to put this key this RSA key.

25

00:01:17,390  -->  00:01:17,750
All right.

26

00:01:17,820  -->  00:01:18,810
As a value.

27

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:20,690
And once you do that you're good to go.

28

00:01:20,690  -->  00:01:22,790
OK you don't need anything else.

29

00:01:22,790  -->  00:01:27,110
And now if you want the ad tracking you you add a name for it.

30

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:30,030
I mean these are auction of stuff if you want to do that.

31

00:01:30,030  -->  00:01:31,330
OK.

32

00:01:31,680  -->  00:01:33,570
I would add a C name if I were you.

33

00:01:33,600  -->  00:01:39,390
I went to these values just to keep to track e-mails opened it clicks on subscriber fees and all of

34

00:01:39,390  -->  00:01:39,900
that.

35

00:01:40,230  -->  00:01:47,100
And now after that you click on continue to the main overview and there you can check to see when you

36

00:01:47,100  -->  00:01:48,010
go to the next screen.

37

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:55,020
Not going to do that because this my coding faculty DNS is now hosted in GoDaddy sources somewhere else

38

00:01:55,990  -->  00:02:01,570
because I have Amazon a W-S instance so I hosted with them.

39

00:02:01,650  -->  00:02:09,360
So but anyway once you click here you're going to take it to a page where you can check your DNS to

40

00:02:09,360  -->  00:02:10,700
see if he has propagated.

41

00:02:10,700  -->  00:02:15,050
Now this thing can take from 24 to 48 hours.

42

00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:20,480
I think all that it takes an hour or two more sometimes if it takes longer than two hours.

43

00:02:20,480  -->  00:02:25,560
That's OK guys just give it a couple hours and then you should be good to go OK just keep checking on

44

00:02:25,570  -->  00:02:26,440
that next page.

45

00:02:26,460  -->  00:02:28,890
Let me see if I can go to the next page here.

46

00:02:28,890  -->  00:02:29,250
All right.

47

00:02:29,250  -->  00:02:34,710
So right now it says on varify and all you have to do is keep checking this and this will be agreeing

48

00:02:34,710  -->  00:02:34,810
.

49

00:02:34,820  -->  00:02:36,850
Believe me.

50

00:02:37,020  -->  00:02:42,660
Please keep checking this every couple hours and when everything is good is going to give you the current

51

00:02:42,660  -->  00:02:45,650
value on your DNS server right here.

52

00:02:45,660  -->  00:02:50,170
Both of them are I should be the same as this and they should be green.

53

00:02:50,170  -->  00:02:50,630
All right.

54

00:02:50,640  -->  00:02:51,990
This should tell you.

55

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:54,870
But anyway thank you so much guys for watching this.

56

00:02:54,880  -->  00:02:56,810
A couple of lectures is being a pleasure.

57

00:02:57,000  -->  00:02:58,440
And I'll see you in the next lectures.

58

00:02:58,440  -->  00:02:58,990
Take care.

59

00:02:58,990  -->  00:03:00,920
Have fun cold practice.

60

00:03:01,020  -->  00:03:02,090

61

00:03:02,100  -->  00:03:02,960

62
