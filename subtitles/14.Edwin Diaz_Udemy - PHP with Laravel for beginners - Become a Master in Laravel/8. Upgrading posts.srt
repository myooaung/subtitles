1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:07,530
All right welcome back I'm a student so it's tough for us to start exploring the pool speech.

2

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:09,270
All right what do we have here.

3

00:00:09,270  -->  00:00:11,640
Well first of all we have a role here.

4

00:00:11,640  -->  00:00:13,420
Looks like we have some custom route.

5

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:14,460
All right.

6

00:00:14,640  -->  00:00:19,920
It's been a while since I checked the routes so let's check the routes he or.

7

00:00:19,950  -->  00:00:22,040
OK look we have a custom route here.

8

00:00:22,040  -->  00:00:29,940
Let's put that back here to web that BHP and we have a group here.

9

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:40,130
This is supposed to be the ad men group and it is can we put this year's software which is close to

10

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:40,940
polls.

11

00:00:40,970  -->  00:00:42,990
Let's check this out right here.

12

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:47,730
All right let's come back here and refresh.

13

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:52,280
All right now it says Listen you've got something with comments right right.

14

00:00:52,790  -->  00:00:54,840
That's fits the comments.

15

00:00:54,900  -->  00:00:56,740
Good.

16

00:00:58,260  -->  00:01:01,600
All right.

17

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:13,890
Meant that comments that show that should fit in law.

18

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:17,010
All right so we got polls working and we even got pagination.

19

00:01:17,010  -->  00:01:20,140
I think we need to make some adjustments.

20

00:01:20,160  -->  00:01:21,800
Pagination has a lot more.

21

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:24,970
It's a lot more manageable in this version of.

22

00:01:24,980  -->  00:01:32,250
But we can actually even change it in the first version the 5.2 version actually we are not able to

23

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:37,840
do much with pagination But now we are able to to actually modify this more.

24

00:01:37,840  -->  00:01:38,090
All right.

25

00:01:38,100  -->  00:01:43,320
For those of you that you know we're asking how can we modify that well with this new version we can

26

00:01:43,310  -->  00:01:43,420
.

27

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:43,670
Right.

28

00:01:43,680  -->  00:01:49,890
But that would be probably some extra lectures for you know like cosmetic stuff.

29

00:01:49,890  -->  00:01:54,300
But right now we need to make this work all right when we make this work on your percent then you guys

30

00:01:54,300  -->  00:01:57,830
make your requests and then we start playing around with it a little bit more.

31

00:01:57,840  -->  00:01:59,990
But you guys should be masters of radio this.

32

00:02:00,140  -->  00:02:01,300
But anyway.

33

00:02:01,680  -->  00:02:06,350
So let's go to polls and of course yes we have the same problem.

34

00:02:06,630  -->  00:02:16,630
Let's go back to oddment posts and then we need to pluck a couple of things here and we've got to end

35

00:02:16,630  -->  00:02:16,940
it.

36

00:02:16,950  -->  00:02:27,440
We need to block and believe create it.

37

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:34,340
All right let's come back here and be fresh.

38

00:02:35,280  -->  00:02:36,820
We'll we'll we'll.

39

00:02:36,880  -->  00:02:39,190
Everything lose good here.

40

00:02:40,050  -->  00:02:42,410
Can we update the polls.

41

00:02:42,420  -->  00:02:43,870
No we cannot.

42

00:02:44,460  -->  00:02:45,260
All right.

43

00:02:45,720  -->  00:02:49,350
Let's create a new polls.

44

00:02:49,350  -->  00:02:51,220
New polls.

45

00:02:52,810  -->  00:02:56,100
And OK we have a problem with this now

46

00:02:59,100  -->  00:02:59,930
too.

47

00:03:00,000  -->  00:03:13,740
We don't have any less here any more I believe and we have a problem with storing stuff here.

48

00:03:13,980  -->  00:03:17,000
But we don't how any of this matters here.

49

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:19,290
All right let's do a

50

00:03:22,620  -->  00:03:29,850
what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a dump right here of this little guy here users push.

51

00:03:29,880  -->  00:03:30,950
See what I get.

52

00:03:31,110  -->  00:03:35,730
If this works he's our Creator meant to mess up.

53

00:03:35,730  -->  00:03:40,250
All right we fresh air.

54

00:03:40,260  -->  00:03:47,900
All right so that works we're getting a collection of nothing but that's working.

55

00:03:48,030  -->  00:03:49,680
So that create is messed up.

56

00:03:49,680  -->  00:03:51,520
I think I have an idea what it is.

57

00:03:51,870  -->  00:03:57,670
All right let's go to composer Jason real quick.

58

00:03:57,810  -->  00:03:59,790
And let's look at what we have here.

59

00:03:59,790  -->  00:04:00,540
OK.

60

00:04:00,570  -->  00:04:02,370
I see a problem.

61

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:06,100
First of all this is now being updated to 5.3.

62

00:04:06,110  -->  00:04:08,380
We're going to do a composer all day on that.

63

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:13,240
This little guy here could be a problem right.

64

00:04:13,730  -->  00:04:16,590
If Let's go to the polls

65

00:04:19,350  -->  00:04:21,970
and actually not polls.

66

00:04:22,710  -->  00:04:25,830
Let's go to the model.

67

00:04:26,230  -->  00:04:27,640
And ooh

68

00:04:30,360  -->  00:04:32,790
we need to eliminate this guy.

69

00:04:32,790  -->  00:04:36,350
We're going out to work on this.

70

00:04:36,960  -->  00:04:38,340
Our Aslaug.

71

00:04:38,370  -->  00:04:39,790
There are more than a pretty you are.

72

00:04:39,830  -->  00:04:42,440
Later on but I think this is a problem.

73

00:04:42,450  -->  00:04:44,670
I don't think they have upgraded their version

74

00:04:47,220  -->  00:04:53,850
so we can go and do a little search for a quick log of all

75

00:04:56,880  -->  00:04:59,880
this just for Larralde real quick.

76

00:04:59,880  -->  00:05:00,990
I know I'm misspelling it.

77

00:05:00,990  -->  00:05:01,650
I know that.

78

00:05:01,650  -->  00:05:03,460
All right this is the guy right here.

79

00:05:03,480  -->  00:05:07,230
Let's just look at what's going on.

80

00:05:07,940  -->  00:05:08,820
Right.

81

00:05:09,220  -->  00:05:17,280
It's over five doesn't say that version.

82

00:05:25,140  -->  00:05:30,530
Let's just put test that I usually find things when it's just tested.

83

00:05:30,800  -->  00:05:31,730
Oh there you go.

84

00:05:31,740  -->  00:05:32,410
We found it.

85

00:05:32,490  -->  00:05:32,910
OK.

86

00:05:32,910  -->  00:05:39,180
So a test against larger 5.1 5.2 right disguising causing really updated is not good.

87

00:05:39,210  -->  00:05:40,620
Good not good.

88

00:05:40,620  -->  00:05:42,390
I think this is this might be a problem.

89

00:05:42,380  -->  00:05:46,910
Let's actually comment all this out and let's just take how

90

00:05:49,740  -->  00:05:53,580
this implement from here.

91

00:05:53,580  -->  00:05:55,800
And I think we are.

92

00:05:56,400  -->  00:05:59,210
All right let's just do that and see what happens.

93

00:05:59,230  -->  00:06:01,240
Right.

94

00:06:01,800  -->  00:06:04,060
Because we want to.

95

00:06:04,920  -->  00:06:05,390
All right.

96

00:06:05,430  -->  00:06:11,860
New posts and I think it worked.

97

00:06:12,750  -->  00:06:16,120
Yeah I worked for a second too.

98

00:06:16,500  -->  00:06:20,890
Let's create another one.

99

00:06:21,780  -->  00:06:27,040
Wow this is working.

100

00:06:27,120  -->  00:06:29,630
All right let's put a picture here.

101

00:06:29,640  -->  00:06:30,100
Why not.

102

00:06:30,120  -->  00:06:32,430
Right.

103

00:06:34,490  -->  00:06:37,550
What do we get to page 3 haha.

104

00:06:37,560  -->  00:06:38,700
Yeah.

105

00:06:38,730  -->  00:06:41,590
So yeah that is a problem.

106

00:06:41,600  -->  00:06:49,790
Let's try to upgrade to the computer that Jason because we have this Lauber collective feel.

107

00:06:49,960  -->  00:06:57,960
Lauber collective actually is has all graded allowable collective

108

00:07:01,410  -->  00:07:02,580
collective

109

00:07:05,550  -->  00:07:07,160
right.

110

00:07:07,770  -->  00:07:09,890
And a male here.

111

00:07:10,350  -->  00:07:10,920
Yeah.

112

00:07:11,000  -->  00:07:23,920
And they have let's do a little dot here and a multiplication symbol or believe you call this star.

113

00:07:23,930  -->  00:07:29,550
So they forgot the name of it guys I'm sorry my language is not English.

114

00:07:29,550  -->  00:07:30,510
All right.

115

00:07:31,020  -->  00:07:37,350
Composer update I think that's quite an asterix.

116

00:07:37,350  -->  00:07:40,260
Dante Astras I forgot the name.

117

00:07:40,260  -->  00:07:49,210
All right we got involved version number five point three.

118

00:07:50,830  -->  00:07:51,390
Oh OK.

119

00:07:51,400  -->  00:07:53,560
Let's take this out.

120

00:07:53,790  -->  00:07:54,990
Let's make it happen again.

121

00:07:55,080  -->  00:07:57,240
Let's see.

122

00:07:58,920  -->  00:07:59,270
All right.

123

00:07:59,280  -->  00:08:00,880
Doing something now hopefully.

124

00:08:00,900  -->  00:08:02,190
Let's cross our fingers.

125

00:08:02,280  -->  00:08:05,550
We don't get another area that we spend 20 minutes trying to fix.

126

00:08:05,550  -->  00:08:06,250
All right guys.

127

00:08:06,270  -->  00:08:08,220
Please don't fall asleep all right.

128

00:08:08,620  -->  00:08:14,430
If you're falling asleep I want you to post his video and I want you to get a really really good energy

129

00:08:14,430  -->  00:08:16,720
drink natural energy drink OK.

130

00:08:17,220  -->  00:08:19,780
All right Buzzer.

131

00:08:19,800  -->  00:08:22,440
Because he kind of it took like 30 seconds or more.

132

00:08:22,440  -->  00:08:23,060
All right.

133

00:08:23,280  -->  00:08:28,980
But anyway let's make sure that our application did not break and we don't have to come back here and

134

00:08:28,980  -->  00:08:29,910
go crazy about it.

135

00:08:29,970  -->  00:08:31,360
All right.

136

00:08:31,920  -->  00:08:34,260
A lot of our collective is pretty cool anyway.

137

00:08:34,590  -->  00:08:43,790
Let's just say Wow another pose is gone this is for this description.

138

00:08:43,910  -->  00:08:45,240
Let's do this

139

00:08:47,400  -->  00:08:50,970
and let's pull some javascript guys.

140

00:08:50,970  -->  00:08:56,280
If you have not brushed up on Javascript you need to do a javascript is booming right now.

141

00:08:56,460  -->  00:08:56,850
All right.

142

00:08:56,860  -->  00:08:59,990
And I have a couple of courses there that can help you with it.

143

00:09:00,000  -->  00:09:00,420
All right.

144

00:09:00,420  -->  00:09:05,490
Now there are many other courses you don't have to take my courses but I'm just letting you know right

145

00:09:05,490  -->  00:09:08,770
now if you want to be a complete developer you need to take jobs courses.

146

00:09:08,770  -->  00:09:10,230
All right.

147

00:09:10,320  -->  00:09:13,350
So anyway let's just do this let's go back.

148

00:09:13,380  -->  00:09:14,890
There we go another place.

149

00:09:14,970  -->  00:09:16,230
So he's working.

150

00:09:16,320  -->  00:09:17,590
All right cool.

151

00:09:17,610  -->  00:09:18,480
So we got this working.

152

00:09:18,480  -->  00:09:20,040
