00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:03.510
All right welcome back my sister and so we got the day for working here.

2

00:00:03.510  -->  00:00:05.210
Now let's see to see.

3

00:00:05.280  -->  00:00:11.240
Let's find out first if this is actually sending data as if they are sending the post values re the

4

00:00:11.240  -->  00:00:15.350
poor super global values so let's go to our store method.

5

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:19.920
This is actually going to post to our admin users controller App Store met and as you can see right

6

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:23.330
here and it's going to take in the title.

7

00:00:23.370  -->  00:00:29.890
All right we don't want that title I actually want to change this for name but that's ok.

8

00:00:29.890  -->  00:00:32.960
I mean we're going to change this later.

9

00:00:32.970  -->  00:00:38.920
But this is a name it should be right here and they should be of value.

10

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:39.680
OK.

11

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:48.930
So it's more if there's a little Let's go to our controller and you can do this if you're using a Mac

12

00:00:50.070  -->  00:00:51.660
I think Windows is the same thing.

13

00:00:51.660  -->  00:00:56.040
If you press shift twice you can look for that controller.

14

00:00:56.100  -->  00:00:57.760
All right.

15

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:01.980
Well let's actually look at this the old fashioned way.

16

00:01:02.170  -->  00:01:07.920
I ME users guys and what we have this this work in this form.

17

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:10.360
Let's actually do a comment if you want.

18

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:14.500
If you want to go ahead and do a commit now and see if what you have you can write.

19

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:18.660
I actually do comments when I really have some working OK.

20

00:01:18.850  -->  00:01:19.740
All right.

21

00:01:19.890  -->  00:01:21.990
So this is this tormented here.

22

00:01:21.990  -->  00:01:31.670
I just want to return all the data from the requests just to make sure that we receiving stuff.

23

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:33.390
We're saving all that.

24

00:01:33.510  -->  00:01:39.840
So if we refresh here and we just type in whatever you can see out there whatever they just typed then

25

00:01:39.900  -->  00:01:40.700
gets returned.

26

00:01:40.710  -->  00:01:43.180
So it is working.

27

00:01:43.490  -->  00:01:44.300
All right.

28

00:01:45.090  -->  00:01:45.540
All right.

29

00:01:45.540  -->  00:01:51.000
So let's go back and work on that form right here.

30

00:01:51.420  -->  00:01:58.530
Let's move down here and let's go and make another Tatz feel that I believe that's why we named it before

31

00:01:58.530  -->  00:02:00.100
to get a shortcut.

32

00:02:00.370  -->  00:02:05.100
All right Anderson Live Templi guys arrive feeling watch I'll let you go watch it just a little review

33

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:05.310
.

34

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:08.030
All right live templates.

35

00:02:08.040  -->  00:02:12.340
And when we type in tetch field we get all of that.

36

00:02:12.360  -->  00:02:13.610
All right.

37

00:02:14.430  -->  00:02:16.080
OK.

38

00:02:17.430  -->  00:02:21.240
All right so we got the name of the user that we want to update what else we want to update from the

39

00:02:21.240  -->  00:02:23.280
user.

40

00:02:23.910  -->  00:02:27.290
We want to update the e-mail

41

00:02:27.310  -->  00:02:34.440
.

42

00:02:38.790  -->  00:02:46.160
And what else let's go back and check it out.

43

00:02:48.630  -->  00:02:49.170
All right.

44

00:02:49.410  -->  00:02:55.830
We got the e-mail the role and the status and that's what we got to actually change here.

45

00:02:55.860  -->  00:02:59.640
Make it so he says Status Status.

46

00:02:59.640  -->  00:03:00.620
All right.

47

00:03:01.290  -->  00:03:02.500
Let's go back to that.

48

00:03:02.530  -->  00:03:11.010
I mean the users in that and let's just change this to status.

49

00:03:11.010  -->  00:03:13.600
All right.

50

00:03:14.910  -->  00:03:18.980
All right.

51

00:03:20.850  -->  00:03:22.750
So role and status.

52

00:03:22.760  -->  00:03:24.030
Ok cool.

53

00:03:24.570  -->  00:03:25.580
It's field

54

00:03:28.370  -->  00:03:32.080
.

55

00:03:32.880  -->  00:03:34.040
It is

56

00:03:39.620  -->  00:03:42.580
all

57

00:03:44.010  -->  00:03:46.220
right and wrong.

58

00:03:46.380  -->  00:03:47.980
He's going to copy paste real quick

59

00:03:51.010  -->  00:03:54.950
move that I just select that I am press tab OK.

60

00:03:55.470  -->  00:04:01.490
This is wrong here as a matter of we need to name this Real ID by the way is

61

00:04:06.280  -->  00:04:09.420
remember that the names here are the names of the columns.

62

00:04:09.420  -->  00:04:13.720
All right all ID right here.

63

00:04:14.220  -->  00:04:16.480
OK.

64

00:04:18.210  -->  00:04:24.170
Now this is going to be a type of email field.

65

00:04:24.200  -->  00:04:25.230
All right.

66

00:04:25.680  -->  00:04:30.850
And this is going to be a select.

67

00:04:31.370  -->  00:04:33.250
We're going to work on down the next lecture.

68

00:04:33.480  -->  00:04:33.920
OK.

69

00:04:33.930  -->  00:04:35.040
Going to be a little longer.

70

00:04:35.040  -->  00:04:35.490
So

71

00:04:38.700  -->  00:04:41.270
create going to have.

72

00:04:41.290  -->  00:04:42.330
There we go.

73

00:04:42.330  -->  00:04:49.050
So he's taking form which he was getting there but we need to make this a select.

74

00:04:49.050  -->  00:04:57.380
And here we also as a matter of fact every use of that we create should be by default.

75

00:04:57.940  -->  00:05:03.590
It should be not active but if we want to create a user right away make him active.

76

00:05:03.630  -->  00:05:05.380
It would be nice to have the chance to.

77

00:05:05.490  -->  00:05:10.200
So we've got to leave this like this so let's make this a select so that we can choose from active and

78

00:05:10.290  -->  00:05:11.170
active.

79

00:05:11.430  -->  00:05:13.610
And here we can also make this a select.

80

00:05:13.620  -->  00:05:14.820
OK.

81

00:05:14.820  -->  00:05:17.410
All right so we're going to continue with this form on the next lecture.

82

00:05:17.460  -->  00:05:18.780
Thank you so much for watching.

83

00:05:18.820  -->  00:05:19.080
Buh-Bye
