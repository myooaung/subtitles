00:00:00.620  -->  00:00:05.250
All right welcome back my students so I decided to add another lecture here and we're probably going

2

00:00:05.250  -->  00:00:07.280
to have more lectures on this section.

3

00:00:07.420  -->  00:00:14.400
But all right if you go to your admin users controller OK and this is from the future guys so if you

4

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:22.140
have if you see some files here that are not included in yours and your application Don't worry about

5

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:22.400
it.

6

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:27.910
Just go to where I told you to go and in this case I want you to go to our main user's controller.

7

00:00:27.930  -->  00:00:28.320
All right.

8

00:00:28.320  -->  00:00:34.920
And then here in this case we are actually deleting the user from the database where we are actually

9

00:00:34.920  -->  00:00:35.880
deleting the image.

10

00:00:35.880  -->  00:00:44.780
So if you go back to Pawlick images here we have a whole bunch of images here and if we add let's add

11

00:00:44.790  -->  00:00:50.330
another one real quick let's go to admin users and you can see and then add one.

12

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:52.780
I'm going to call these guides them form.

13

00:00:53.670  -->  00:00:59.070
Let's just call them let's just make up another person here

14

00:01:02.900  -->  00:01:11.890
to scriber and active let's just give that person a nice side.

15

00:01:11.940  -->  00:01:14.730
This looks like a lease or here that's OK.

16

00:01:15.450  -->  00:01:15.950
All right.

17

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:22.260
So I'm going to come here I'm going to click create user and you're going to see this here.

18

00:01:22.260  -->  00:01:27.890
Well you're not going to see it in my psi because I've got to synchronize but maybe we will.

19

00:01:27.890  -->  00:01:29.370
Let's see.

20

00:01:29.370  -->  00:01:30.080
All right.

21

00:01:30.180  -->  00:01:34.750
We're not we only got one two three four five six seven us here.

22

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:42.170
So if I synchronize with you have a new file somewhere.

23

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:46.130
All right.

24

00:01:46.950  -->  00:01:47.970
There we go.

25

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:52.470
WOMAN 2 We click on it we can see that absolument All right there.

26

00:01:52.470  -->  00:01:52.960
All right.

27

00:01:53.070  -->  00:01:58.170
So now the problem is every time with the lead that we tried to THE LEAD die we go to Lisa and we try

28

00:01:58.170  -->  00:01:58.950
to delete it.

29

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:02.270
That's going to stay there because we're now removing the file itself.

30

00:02:02.460  -->  00:02:09.230
So let's go to our users controller and let's do something here to make sure that that's good.

31

00:02:09.240  -->  00:02:10.320
All right.

32

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:17.640
So let's actually change this logic a little bit.

33

00:02:17.640  -->  00:02:26.370
Analysts say user here and then we can actually put all this together if we wanted to burn and just

34

00:02:27.080  -->  00:02:29.930
do it separately here so you understand how I'm doing this.

35

00:02:29.970  -->  00:02:38.700
So we're going to use our own link function from BHB and we're going to give it the public path.

36

00:02:38.730  -->  00:02:50.000
We have another function for that whole public path and we're going to concatenate the images folder

37

00:02:50.970  -->  00:02:59.190
and then we're going to give it an ID and it's going to be the user ID actually

38

00:03:03.500  -->  00:03:05.310
we got to give the user

39

00:03:08.100  -->  00:03:09.620
for our name actually.

40

00:03:09.630  -->  00:03:11.240
Sorry about that.

41

00:03:11.250  -->  00:03:17.350
So user photo on file.

42

00:03:17.370  -->  00:03:18.220
There we go.

43

00:03:18.610  -->  00:03:18.940
And

44

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:24.960
Kimberly we actually named it like this.

45

00:03:24.960  -->  00:03:28.760
We should have named it something else guys maybe path or something.

46

00:03:28.770  -->  00:03:30.180
But anyway that doesn't matter.

47

00:03:30.180  -->  00:03:32.270
At least you are learning how to do this right.

48

00:03:32.670  -->  00:03:38.320
And let's go ahead and delete this now.

49

00:03:39.330  -->  00:03:43.040
All right.

50

00:03:46.230  -->  00:03:46.510
All right.

51

00:03:46.520  -->  00:03:51.590
I think this is going to work good.

52

00:03:51.870  -->  00:03:53.810
So we're going on linked this file here.

53

00:03:53.820  -->  00:04:01.420
Let's let's check it out real quick and we should see this woman to the leader from here let's jus refresh

54

00:04:01.420  -->  00:04:06.750
here let's go and this is huge.

55

00:04:07.100  -->  00:04:10.940
My screen is huge.

56

00:04:10.990  -->  00:04:19.880
We go this click delete and it's saying that no such file or directory is looking for.

57

00:04:19.890  -->  00:04:24.300
Ninety seven.

58

00:04:24.690  -->  00:04:25.670
WOMAN 2.

59

00:04:25.770  -->  00:04:27.260
So we got this part right.

60

00:04:27.330  -->  00:04:29.640
Well we didn't get right is this 90.

61

00:04:29.730  -->  00:04:32.730
Actually it is looking for this.

62

00:04:33.540  -->  00:04:35.670
Let's see we have it.

63

00:04:36.780  -->  00:04:40.140
While 4 6 1 4 4 1 2 9 7

64

00:04:42.930  -->  00:04:47.890
that's exactly the file ID.

65

00:04:49.110  -->  00:05:03.240
While 4 6 1 4 4 1 2 9 7 0 0 link no such file or their right to that is just super weird.

66

00:05:03.240  -->  00:05:04.680
All right.

67

00:05:06.130  -->  00:05:09.070
Let's find out what it is.

68

00:05:11.180  -->  00:05:16.530
Or you know what we are actually.

69

00:05:17.460  -->  00:05:23.430
We have to follow slushes right young images so we don't have to actually include images here guys because

70

00:05:23.430  -->  00:05:25.410
we already including images from the

71

00:05:28.520  -->  00:05:30.310
Access accessor.

72

00:05:30.520  -->  00:05:36.570
OK if you go to the address or you can find out that we are including that images directory.

73

00:05:36.570  -->  00:05:37.100
All right.

74

00:05:37.350  -->  00:05:43.100
So we have to give is the name and that to do it.

75

00:05:43.170  -->  00:05:44.680
Let's go back here.

76

00:05:45.060  -->  00:05:45.600
Refresh.

77

00:05:45.600  -->  00:05:47.310
And now we do this.

78

00:05:47.310  -->  00:05:53.130
You can see that the user has been deleted and if we go back here when I synchronize my side you can

79

00:05:53.130  -->  00:05:54.720
see that woman file.

80

00:05:54.870  -->  00:05:56.810
WOMAN 2 They need it from here.

81

00:05:56.800  -->  00:05:57.520
There's way for it.

82

00:05:57.540  -->  00:05:58.680
Let's wait for it.

83

00:05:58.870  -->  00:06:00.490
Well all right.

84

00:06:00.720  -->  00:06:02.560
So that's one way of the lead in the images.

85

00:06:02.570  -->  00:06:04.040
There are other ways of doing it.

86

00:06:04.050  -->  00:06:08.680
But this is the simplest way that I could show you how to do for now.

87

00:06:08.760  -->  00:06:12.880
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
