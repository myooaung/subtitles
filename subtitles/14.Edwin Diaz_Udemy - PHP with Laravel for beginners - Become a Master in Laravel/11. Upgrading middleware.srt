00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:04,920
All right welcome back my students so on this lecture here which kind of Contini you some of the things

2

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:08,280
that is suggested in the upgrade guide.

3

00:00:08,310  -->  00:00:08,870
Right.

4

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:15,550
So one of the first things that we are going to be changing is just go to the kernel real quick here

5

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:20,970
in the kernel we're going to have this error here just because we need to change this to another class

6

00:00:21,360  -->  00:00:23,580
and I'm going to show you you can follow the guy guys.

7

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:25,650
We already got the application working.

8

00:00:25,650  -->  00:00:28,830
It's just a matter of following the guy and changing the rest of the stuff.

9

00:00:28,830  -->  00:00:29,460
All right.

10

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:34,140
My major goal for this section here was to make the application work.

11

00:00:34,140  -->  00:00:35,030
All right.

12

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:37,110
So what's application work.

13

00:00:37,140  -->  00:00:40,410
And then all we have to do is just do some cosmetic stuff.

14

00:00:40,410  -->  00:00:41,460
All right.

15

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:46,730
So here is telling us that we need to change the can middleweights namespace.

16

00:00:46,740  -->  00:00:52,660
So we need to go here to our kernel and do this change right here.

17

00:00:53,120  -->  00:00:54,270
There we go.

18

00:00:54,270  -->  00:00:56,010
All right.

19

00:00:56,070  -->  00:01:06,880
Another thing that we need to change is the bindings and saying that we need to do this.

20

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:15,390
So let's go and do this and this should be the bind that should be re.

21

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:20,150
They should be in the middle where is

22

00:01:23,830  -->  00:01:26,140
the middle where groups and middleware.

23

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:29,100
Let's go back here let's check it out exactly where it is

24

00:01:34,230  -->  00:01:39,660
made aware group in your kernel to your weap made aware group.

25

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:43,830
This is my web made aware group.

26

00:01:43,860  -->  00:01:48,120
All right let's just add it here.

27

00:01:48,120  -->  00:01:52,880
This shows actually that those and go there.

28

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:56,530
Sorry about that.

29

00:01:58,150  -->  00:02:03,940
Let's go back here.

30

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:07,670
Sometimes you've got to double check this stuff.

31

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:10,320
All right.

32

00:02:13,060  -->  00:02:14,630
There we go.

33

00:02:15,690  -->  00:02:23,220
Let's have this here and let's see these two the route me to where

34

00:02:27,190  -->  00:02:30,540
I would go and make sure it has that single call there.

35

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:31,770
All right what else.

36

00:02:31,800  -->  00:02:35,190
And then it says are you to add this to you A.P.M. in a way.

37

00:02:35,240  -->  00:02:36,840
All right bindings.

38

00:02:37,090  -->  00:02:39,150
It's this little one here.

39

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:44,970
And here we go.

40

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:46,430
All right cool.

41

00:02:46,470  -->  00:02:48,330
I think we're good here.

42

00:02:48,960  -->  00:02:49,680
Let's see

43

00:02:55,960  -->  00:02:58,380
all

44

00:03:02,480  -->  00:03:05,990
right now Dorise would change that already.

45

00:03:06,320  -->  00:03:12,590
And she's telling us what it does by Indian substitution.

46

00:03:12,600  -->  00:03:13,800
I think we're good to go here.

47

00:03:13,800  -->  00:03:14,290
Guys you are.

48

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:21,450
You're welcome to keep playing around with this and making it work a little better for you.

49

00:03:21,450  -->  00:03:22,290
All right.

50

00:03:22,740  -->  00:03:25,050
So anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

51

00:03:25,050  -->  00:03:28,470
I hope we will get you up and running with your application.

52

00:03:28,470  -->  00:03:34,140
We're going to keep adjusting some things in the in the application if you're able to fix some of the

53

00:03:34,140  -->  00:03:38,060
bugs if we have any bugs posted in the discussion.

54

00:03:38,070  -->  00:03:40,440
Help you a classmate to help the course.

55

00:03:40,590  -->  00:03:43,940
And I'll see you in the next lectures.
