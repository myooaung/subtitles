Welcome back my students in this section we're going to be learning how to send e-mail with Meribel

2

00:00:05,550  -->  00:00:09,020
now sending email with Meribel is super easy.

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:14,040
Now the problem is that if we use the native BHB function to do it we're going to have a problem our

4

00:00:14,040  -->  00:00:18,990
e-mails are going to be sent to the spam folder on that recipient right.

5

00:00:18,990  -->  00:00:26,290
So what we wanted to write is use an API to make sure that our emails get sent to the bots instead.

6

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:26,840
All right.

7

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:29,940
So we're going to be using a company called Melgar.

8

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:30,600
All right.

9

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:35,830
So we're going to use Mail gone right to their API to send e-mails.

10

00:00:35,850  -->  00:00:40,860
Now Melgen is free up to like I think is like 10000 e-mails or something a month.

11

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:44,250
So don't worry about it you're not going to have to spend any money out of your pocket.

12

00:00:44,400  -->  00:00:47,880
But we're going to make sure that our e-mails get sent to the right place.

13

00:00:47,880  -->  00:00:48,640
All right.

14

00:00:48,640  -->  00:00:54,300
I remember that I know the course courses we use BHB malfunction that caused a lot of problems and we

15

00:00:54,300  -->  00:00:55,410
don't want that we don't want that.

16

00:00:55,410  -->  00:00:58,110
So you're going to enjoy the sexual one last saw.

17

00:00:58,110  -->  00:01:01,770
Pay very close attention you're going to learn something that you're going to be able to use with a

18

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:02,970
lot of new applications.

19

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:03,610
Right.

20

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:07,390
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures below.

21

00:01:07,440  -->  00:01:07,850
