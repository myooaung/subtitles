1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,830
All right.

2

00:00:00,870  -->  00:00:03,180
Welcome back my district.

3

00:00:03,210  -->  00:00:05,940
So let's get going here.

4

00:00:05,940  -->  00:00:10,790
We're going to pull out information from the database and populate this field here.

5

00:00:11,150  -->  00:00:11,710
All right.

6

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:22,730
So first things first we got to make this a select.

7

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:29,370
We gather all idea right here and we know that we're going to have an array right here right whatever

8

00:00:29,370  -->  00:00:30,330
that is.

9

00:00:30,600  -->  00:00:33,720
So we could right now make it empty and we can say something like

10

00:00:37,230  -->  00:00:42,070
choose options.

11

00:00:42,070  -->  00:00:43,190
All right.

12

00:00:44,130  -->  00:00:47,620
Let's go back here and see what we got.

13

00:00:47,640  -->  00:00:48,370
There we go.

14

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:54,000
But now what we want to do is we're going to use a new method here.

15

00:00:54,030  -->  00:00:58,560
We're going to concatenate another array coming from the database right here.

16

00:00:58,560  -->  00:00:59,580
All right.

17

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:05,310
So let's actually well is we've got to convert that into an array.

18

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:08,580
I'll show you how do we do that.

19

00:01:08,880  -->  00:01:12,380
Let's go to our controller actually right here.

20

00:01:12,400  -->  00:01:19,980
I mean user's controller and he's going into being our creator right here.

21

00:01:20,980  -->  00:01:21,810
OK.

22

00:01:22,410  -->  00:01:31,100
So first of all let's pulao rolls by this rule.

23

00:01:31,190  -->  00:01:31,620
All right.

24

00:01:31,690  -->  00:01:36,870
Now instead of using all because all is going to bring that collection which we don't one there we want

25

00:01:36,870  -->  00:01:38,250
an array.

26

00:01:38,250  -->  00:01:40,750
We had to convert that into an array.

27

00:01:40,800  -->  00:01:44,160
We're going to be pulling out just specific data from there.

28

00:01:44,160  -->  00:01:48,680
All right first of all make sure that you include this on top this namespace so that where you can pour

29

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:54,210
that class and I do this and import it on top.

30

00:01:54,600  -->  00:02:04,260
And we're going to be pulling out the title and the ID into a likely in a array.

31

00:02:04,260  -->  00:02:08,270
Now if you want to actually find out exactly what you're pulling out how this works.

32

00:02:08,270  -->  00:02:11,370
Make sure that you do a return or I or or die.

33

00:02:11,370  -->  00:02:14,590
Dump this so that way you can check check it out.

34

00:02:14,780  -->  00:02:16,530
All right but that's what we are doing here.

35

00:02:16,860  -->  00:02:24,980
And then we'll take that in with ticketing as it rolls.

36

00:02:25,460  -->  00:02:31,830
OK let's go back here and here what we're going to do is we're going to call Kartini and we can do this

37

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:32,530
here.

38

00:02:32,590  -->  00:02:36,840
We're going to concatenate roles like this.

39

00:02:36,840  -->  00:02:37,850
All right.

40

00:02:38,640  -->  00:02:41,420
Let's go back let's check it out.

41

00:02:41,760  -->  00:02:44,650
Enter and and column title.

42

00:02:44,670  -->  00:02:45,230
OK.

43

00:02:45,240  -->  00:02:51,840
That's because it's not title is actually names or name actually.

44

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:52,470
There we go

45

00:02:55,410  -->  00:02:58,590
.

46

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:02,970
I think there's something here.

47

00:03:04,810  -->  00:03:09,610
Oh I forgot the method to actually bring it down.

48

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:10,790
We've got to bring it out.

49

00:03:10,800  -->  00:03:12,110
We're going to bring it down OK.

50

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:20,880
We could use all here because this is just getting an array but we have to bring it back right after

51

00:03:21,000  -->  00:03:21,620
.

52

00:03:21,900  -->  00:03:23,650
And still not working.

53

00:03:23,940  -->  00:03:31,890
Constant rolls and he's on to find custom rules

54

00:03:35,190  -->  00:03:39,920
.

55

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:50,300
The rule.

56

00:03:50,370  -->  00:03:53,200
Let's go back to the users create real quick.

57

00:03:53,430  -->  00:04:00,390
And the reason why because we don't have the dollar sign of course and are as you can see the arrow

58

00:04:00,390  -->  00:04:02,550
is in create Antar.

59

00:04:02,550  -->  00:04:03,860
There we go.

60

00:04:04,320  -->  00:04:09,150
And now we have a minute trader author and subscriber.

61

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:15,470
So let's actually speak there real quick real quick just to make sure that we're getting the right value

62

00:04:15,480  -->  00:04:21,170
so we see that we've got one for me initiated two for author and three for subscriber.

63

00:04:21,180  -->  00:04:21,750
OK.

64

00:04:21,990  -->  00:04:27,900
Make sure that you have this in the correct order because when you bring it down if you have this idea

65

00:04:27,900  -->  00:04:32,350
first and your name the second it will not work the same.

66

00:04:32,370  -->  00:04:41,460
So let's say for example here and here if we go back here you see that everything changes now is backwards

67

00:04:41,480  -->  00:04:41,540
.

68

00:04:41,580  -->  00:04:43,060
OK.

69

00:04:43,060  -->  00:04:45,510
We don't want to do that.

70

00:04:47,090  -->  00:04:48,240
All right cool.

71

00:04:48,250  -->  00:04:53,220
Anyway so we are done with this on the next lecture we're going to continue and work more on the controller

72

00:04:53,910  -->  00:04:55,000
area.

73

00:04:55,020  -->  00:04:57,240
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you then.

74

00:04:57,300  -->  00:04:57,690
Take care.

75

00:04:57,690  -->  00:04:59,150
It was fun right.

76

00:04:59,550  -->  00:05:01,500
All right I thought so.
