1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:06,360
All right welcome back my students so we have we have accomplished a couple of things right.

2

00:00:06,660  -->  00:00:09,300
We are setting in certain data.

3

00:00:09,300  -->  00:00:13,220
We are updating data and we are forgetting about reading data.

4

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:13,610
All right.

5

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:15,860
But that's super simple right guys.

6

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:21,240
Super simple so we're going to be reading the data before we delete it.

7

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:24,460
All right so let's do that.

8

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:31,560
Let's do that now and let's create a rule for that.

9

00:00:32,620  -->  00:00:34,450
OK.

10

00:00:35,290  -->  00:00:41,030
And let's just read it before we delete it because I don't want to enter it again.

11

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:47,070
All right so that was we are laughter right.

12

00:00:48,100  -->  00:00:50,580
Well don't laugh at me OK.

13

00:00:50,670  -->  00:00:52,310
All right so cool.

14

00:00:52,440  -->  00:00:57,510
They are super easy to pulao just fine or fail.

15

00:00:57,510  -->  00:00:58,590
Come on guys.

16

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:00,080
Do I have to really show you this.

17

00:01:00,090  -->  00:01:04,020
I have to do it because I just put it in the in the course.

18

00:01:04,230  -->  00:01:06,290
I already did this user.

19

00:01:06,940  -->  00:01:08,600
Yes.

20

00:01:08,820  -->  00:01:09,520
All right.

21

00:01:09,750  -->  00:01:11,830
And the name.

22

00:01:12,290  -->  00:01:16,740
That's it.

23

00:01:16,920  -->  00:01:19,590
We can do echo if we want to.

24

00:01:19,590  -->  00:01:20,320
All right.

25

00:01:20,790  -->  00:01:23,640
So let's go and check this out

26

00:01:26,390  -->  00:01:28,240
read.

27

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:29,980
And guess what.

28

00:01:30,000  -->  00:01:31,980
Let's actually delete it as well here.

29

00:01:31,980  -->  00:01:36,100
And I'm going to name this lecture like delete and read.

30

00:01:36,270  -->  00:01:37,550
Ooh that rhymes.

31

00:01:37,740  -->  00:01:38,690
All right cool.

32

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:44,940
So now that we know we find the data there's actually let's try it from scratch guys get used to it

33

00:01:44,940  -->  00:01:50,770
please let's delete it.

34

00:01:50,790  -->  00:01:52,310
There we go.

35

00:01:53,070  -->  00:01:59,400
And here is to function.

36

00:01:59,400  -->  00:02:01,890
And let's just find the user again.

37

00:02:01,900  -->  00:02:08,330
All we're doing here is always finding the user find or fail one.

38

00:02:08,370  -->  00:02:11,860
And then right here we can just say delete it right.

39

00:02:12,270  -->  00:02:18,570
But remember we're not just finding the user we're finding the address of the user.

40

00:02:18,580  -->  00:02:19,380
All right.

41

00:02:19,680  -->  00:02:26,000
So we find or fail and then we pull out the address.

42

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:34,650
So we say yes and now you have to use the method here if you want to use some method for this method

43

00:02:34,650  -->  00:02:35,490
.

44

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:38,740
Just like the safe we just use delete here.

45

00:02:39,230  -->  00:02:41,370
Ok cool.

46

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:44,940
So we're going to find the user's address is indeed it.

47

00:02:45,270  -->  00:02:55,860
That's what we're going to be doing here is going to be a pretty fun and why law and if you want to

48

00:02:55,860  -->  00:02:58,930
know if this went through just to this.

49

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:02,760
Always done.

50

00:03:02,760  -->  00:03:09,610
Remember that we can also do this and we already or whatever we're doing here is sending in PSP artisan

51

00:03:10,080  -->  00:03:11,230
.

52

00:03:12,590  -->  00:03:17,600
Anyway there you go.

53

00:03:17,650  -->  00:03:21,120
Refresh address is gone.

54

00:03:21,180  -->  00:03:22,890
Beautiful.

55

00:03:22,890  -->  00:03:23,920
All right.

56

00:03:24,360  -->  00:03:30,240
So that's it for the one to one relationship that is not the more that we got to do here unless we do

57

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:31,740
it in an application.

58

00:03:31,740  -->  00:03:37,620
Remember if you didn't get this if for some reason you do not get to go back into it this is not working

59

00:03:37,620  -->  00:03:38,730
100 percent.

60

00:03:38,970  -->  00:03:40,760
Go back and start from scratch.

61

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:44,520
Don't get lazy because that way you will never learn.

62

00:03:44,520  -->  00:03:52,380
All right you will only stretch your mind when you are tired frustrated and you having issues for hours

63

00:03:52,380  -->  00:04:00,120
days weeks months that's when you really grow emotionally intellectually and even sometimes even physically

64

00:04:00,120  -->  00:04:00,330
.

65

00:04:00,360  -->  00:04:01,050
Right.

66

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:04,180
But anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

67

00:04:04,190  -->  00:04:06,960
And I'll see you in the nads lectures
