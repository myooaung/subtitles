00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:04.110
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture I told you that I was going to show you how to

2

00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:12.210
create snippets of code basically little snippets that will actually be created every time you type

3

00:00:12.210  -->  00:00:15.390
in certain words just like Emmett.

4

00:00:15.390  -->  00:00:18.120
So if I type defend you I pressed stop.

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:20.730
You can see that something else is created right.

6

00:00:20.730  -->  00:00:21.770
All right cool.

7

00:00:21.990  -->  00:00:23.250
Let me show you how to do that.

8

00:00:23.250  -->  00:00:28.550
So if you go to PH BE storm preferences or settings if you own a Windows machine I believe.

9

00:00:28.700  -->  00:00:35.820
And you can typing here live and then you would get this life templates window then you're going to

10

00:00:36.300  -->  00:00:38.100
click here live templates.

11

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:39.370
All right.

12

00:00:40.290  -->  00:00:48.360
And I already have one set up but I'm going to set another one up for you so you can see how this is

13

00:00:48.360  -->  00:00:48.660
done.

14

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:54.370
The rights are going to cancel that and going to set up this submit button.

15

00:00:54.390  -->  00:00:54.990
All right.

16

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:56.290
So I'm going to copy it.

17

00:00:56.340  -->  00:01:00.600
Copy that little code preferences.

18

00:01:00.780  -->  00:01:02.710
And as you can see has a shortcut here.

19

00:01:02.760  -->  00:01:09.030
So if I want to preface or you can see Command call my would bring that up for preferences live templates

20

00:01:09.030  -->  00:01:09.900
.

21

00:01:10.080  -->  00:01:12.860
Click on the user I just created the last lecture.

22

00:01:12.890  -->  00:01:18.920
Well in the last couple of seconds so you just click plus symbol live template.

23

00:01:19.440  -->  00:01:27.390
So I'm going to call this abbreviation submit and then I give it a description of a form submit button

24

00:01:29.880  -->  00:01:30.420
and

25

00:01:33.400  -->  00:01:41.600
BHP doesn't help me there with the spelling so I'm going to paste that in there and make sure I face

26

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:43.420
a really nice.

27

00:01:44.010  -->  00:01:44.830
OK.

28

00:01:45.300  -->  00:01:47.420
And I'm going to define it.

29

00:01:47.440  -->  00:01:55.600
So every time I want to use an MPH P available apply and OK.

30

00:01:56.700  -->  00:01:57.600
Let's go back.

31

00:01:57.600  -->  00:02:00.870
There two references actually make it available anywhere.

32

00:02:01.170  -->  00:02:02.300
So change.

33

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:05.630
I'm going to make it available anywhere.

34

00:02:05.640  -->  00:02:06.170
Lie.

35

00:02:06.240  -->  00:02:08.790
OK.

36

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:15.870
So if I want to create a submit button here and let's actually go back real quick I'm sorry guys we

37

00:02:15.870  -->  00:02:17.140
call this submit.

38

00:02:17.160  -->  00:02:17.680
All right.

39

00:02:17.850  -->  00:02:24.910
So if I click on submit enter you can see if I type submit and tab.

40

00:02:25.560  -->  00:02:30.530
I get that so submit tab.

41

00:02:31.020  -->  00:02:32.210
There we go.

42

00:02:32.520  -->  00:02:34.900
See how easy that was.

43

00:02:34.920  -->  00:02:35.350
All right.

44

00:02:35.430  -->  00:02:38.710
So now I created one before you see that one.

45

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:42.710
And I call that tets field enter an hour.

46

00:02:42.720  -->  00:02:45.100
I have a test for you there.

47

00:02:45.120  -->  00:02:45.480
All right.

48

00:02:45.480  -->  00:02:51.040
And why did was copy this and do exactly what we did with the submit button.

49

00:02:51.040  -->  00:02:51.560
All right.

50

00:02:51.590  -->  00:02:55.460
Well you have little snippets of code and you can create a whole form if you want.

51

00:02:55.460  -->  00:03:03.720
So if you want to go ahead in and create a whole form copy it but they get to live templates and just

52

00:03:03.720  -->  00:03:07.400
create another template for it.

53

00:03:07.440  -->  00:03:15.140
Coliform like this whole form pasted in there.

54

00:03:15.720  -->  00:03:19.530
And now you have a whole form created for you romantically.

55

00:03:19.530  -->  00:03:21.650
Pretty cool stuff right.

56

00:03:23.730  -->  00:03:27.430
And you can fix it up why would you want.

57

00:03:28.620  -->  00:03:32.600
And it's up to you how you want it.

58

00:03:32.640  -->  00:03:33.380
All right.

59

00:03:33.720  -->  00:03:38.750
Well I'm not going to fix it right now and I'm just going to put it everywhere.

60

00:03:38.820  -->  00:03:39.270
OK.

61

00:03:39.360  -->  00:03:42.280
You don't have to do that.

62

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:49.990
All right so now if I want to create a hole form I just say form enter and tab.

63

00:03:50.320  -->  00:03:55.950
All right of course you might want to give it another name like open form or something like that.

64

00:03:55.950  -->  00:03:58.770
All right.

65

00:03:58.770  -->  00:03:59.870
All right cool.

66

00:03:59.880  -->  00:04:04.620
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you learn a really good skill here.

67

00:04:04.620  -->  00:04:09.380
So that way you can create applications a lot faster than before we BHB storm.

68

00:04:09.540  -->  00:04:12.360
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures
