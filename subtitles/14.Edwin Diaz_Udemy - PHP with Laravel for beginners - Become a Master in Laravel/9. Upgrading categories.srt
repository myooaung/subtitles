1

00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:03,960
All right my dear students let's go to the next one.

2

00:00:03,990  -->  00:00:04,700
Categories.

3

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:05,090
All right.

4

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:05,860
Let's click on it.

5

00:00:05,880  -->  00:00:08,210
They work in because we build some rules for it.

6

00:00:08,400  -->  00:00:16,800
Let's just come back here and say javascript intermedia intermediate

7

00:00:18,840  -->  00:00:21,270
level 1.

8

00:00:22,700  -->  00:00:23,210
All right.

9

00:00:23,220  -->  00:00:25,080
And it's put a category there.

10

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:26,830
While it's working.

11

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:27,440
All right.

12

00:00:27,590  -->  00:00:29,390
We you have to do much here.

13

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:30,760
Level 2.

14

00:00:30,780  -->  00:00:35,250
And these are actually my courses guys usually my courses is updated.

15

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:36,430
Nice.

16

00:00:36,430  -->  00:00:39,660
We got categories working beautifully.

17

00:00:39,660  -->  00:00:40,280
All right.

18

00:00:40,350  -->  00:00:44,010
Now we might have create a couple other

19

00:00:47,430  -->  00:00:52,800
name routes that we don't need for category so go ahead and delete those if you if we have any extra

20

00:00:52,800  -->  00:00:53,130
ones.

21

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:53,560
All right.

22

00:00:53,640  -->  00:00:59,310
But anyway so create categories Ooh create does not exist.

23

00:00:59,430  -->  00:01:01,920
We made a mistake here somewhere.

24

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:05,210
Let's go and change it.

25

00:01:05,820  -->  00:01:06,090
All right.

26

00:01:06,090  -->  00:01:15,500
So let's go to Web and category's store.

27

00:01:17,790  -->  00:01:25,290
And this is in the controller actually we have a problem and the control is meant to create does not

28

00:01:25,290  -->  00:01:27,570
exist.

29

00:01:27,750  -->  00:01:28,440
So

30

00:01:31,530  -->  00:01:36,380
that's that's a new one of the main categories

31

00:01:43,000  -->  00:01:44,320
and it's true.

32

00:01:44,430  -->  00:01:48,520
I don't see the method create here.

33

00:01:51,110  -->  00:01:51,840
Well let's try.

34

00:01:51,840  -->  00:01:53,530
We don't have a mess to create.

35

00:01:53,780  -->  00:01:55,590
All right.

36

00:01:55,830  -->  00:01:58,070
It does not exist.

37

00:01:58,170  -->  00:02:04,710
So when we click on Create here it's supposed to create it in the same page.

38

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:09,330
So this is supposed to probably a custom method or something that we have created in the last lecture

39

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:09,360
.

40

00:02:09,360  -->  00:02:11,230
Let's go back and check it out.

41

00:02:11,670  -->  00:02:19,090
So we have adenine categories here.

42

00:02:19,250  -->  00:02:19,560
Nice.

43

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:20,490
Not cost them

44

00:02:23,770  -->  00:02:26,120
.

45

00:02:26,120  -->  00:02:27,630
Check out our out.

46

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:28,350
Real quick

47

00:02:30,630  -->  00:02:34,930
.

48

00:02:34,960  -->  00:02:37,560
I mean category's that's what I'm looking for

49

00:02:37,560  -->  00:02:46,710
.

50

00:02:47,120  -->  00:02:55,050
It's a post and it's going to cargo's controller store.

51

00:02:57,020  -->  00:02:57,820
So

52

00:03:00,420  -->  00:03:03,100
what's going on.

53

00:03:03,480  -->  00:03:03,870
There we go.

54

00:03:03,870  -->  00:03:07,250
This is where we this is where he's going supposedly.

55

00:03:07,260  -->  00:03:10,440
All right.

56

00:03:10,440  -->  00:03:11,580
So when I click here

57

00:03:15,030  -->  00:03:15,800
is adding

58

00:03:18,780  -->  00:03:20,430
and it's working fine now.

59

00:03:20,700  -->  00:03:21,750
When I click Update

60

00:03:30,540  -->  00:03:31,730
everything's working fine.

61

00:03:31,780  -->  00:03:34,240
Oh OK.

62

00:03:37,470  -->  00:03:38,090
OK OK.

63

00:03:38,120  -->  00:03:44,880
Can we never created a gosh guys I forgot we have that link there for nothing we never created that

64

00:03:44,880  -->  00:03:45,980
link.

65

00:03:46,080  -->  00:03:50,840
So why don't we just take that off because he's going to confuse the whooshes out was right.

66

00:03:51,030  -->  00:03:51,780
Let's take this off.

67

00:03:51,780  -->  00:03:53,010
We never created this.

68

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:59,220
Now guys this is because I haven't been in the in this application for a little bit.

69

00:03:59,240  -->  00:04:03,310
I have been busy so let's take that off.

70

00:04:03,310  -->  00:04:04,840
We don't need it.

71

00:04:05,160  -->  00:04:08,050
I don't know what I was thinking back then when I left out there.

72

00:04:08,130  -->  00:04:13,080
So let's go to resources.

73

00:04:13,260  -->  00:04:15,360
You probably were wondering what is he doing there.

74

00:04:15,360  -->  00:04:18,110
We don't have that.

75

00:04:18,180  -->  00:04:18,750
Shame on you.

76

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:20,020
You didn't tell me.

77

00:04:20,820  -->  00:04:22,140
So let's do

78

00:04:24,720  -->  00:04:34,330
this is actually in layouts an issue being admin right here.

79

00:04:34,380  -->  00:04:36,620
Let's just take that off.

80

00:04:36,820  -->  00:04:39,550
She's fresh.

81

00:04:39,600  -->  00:04:40,370
There we go.

82

00:04:40,380  -->  00:04:42,820
Let's say it was along.

83

00:04:42,840  -->  00:04:43,540
All right.

84

00:04:43,860  -->  00:04:45,040
So we're good to go here.

85

00:04:45,040  -->  00:04:45,960
All right guys.

86

00:04:45,990  -->  00:04:53,610
Now one thing that we need to make sure and you need to make sure is that all these fields are evaluated

87

00:04:53,630  -->  00:04:53,690
.

88

00:04:53,730  -->  00:04:59,190
All right so make sure that you have that intact right now don't worry the end of this fix up that we

89

00:04:59,190  -->  00:05:00,990
do this upgrade.

90

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:06,840
We will make sure that our application is not submitting empty feels like this one here by creating

91

00:05:06,840  -->  00:05:07,950
a validation point.

92

00:05:07,950  -->  00:05:14,440
If it's if we have not created it if you already have created and we already have created it live with

93

00:05:14,440  -->  00:05:19,190
the way it is but my application right now is not validating against empty fields.

94

00:05:19,480  -->  00:05:19,920
All right.

95

00:05:19,950  -->  00:05:21,350
Maybe yours is.

96

00:05:21,510  -->  00:05:24,260
I'll see you in the next lecture.
