00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:05,210
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture will get a lot of stuff done right.

2

00:00:05,220  -->  00:00:09,400
I mean we did it migrations we had a bunch of columns to it.

3

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:15,130
We created the model on this and this lecture right here we're going to start creating the relationship

4

00:00:15,140  -->  00:00:15,290
.

5

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:17,670
And we play around with the routes.

6

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:18,420
All right.

7

00:00:18,480  -->  00:00:22,650
So for the post we're going to say that impulse has a lot of comments right.

8

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:24,080
That's what we're going to say.

9

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:29,860
So let's do public function and comments.

10

00:00:30,840  -->  00:00:31,540
OK.

11

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:34,150
Well you know return.

12

00:00:34,930  -->  00:00:36,440
Whoops.

13

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:41,480
This has many posts.

14

00:00:41,590  -->  00:00:43,960
Right.

15

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:45,780
Cool.

16

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:46,520
All right.

17

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:49,460
So and comments by.

18

00:00:49,750  -->  00:00:55,910
We're going to say that and we we can actually start creating the fillable as well.

19

00:00:55,920  -->  00:00:58,620
But here let's finish the relationship real quick.

20

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:03,450
We're going to say that this gentleman here has many replies

21

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:08,810
so return does

22

00:01:11,790  -->  00:01:14,850
many replies.

23

00:01:15,720  -->  00:01:24,700
Comment reply I believe that's the model that we created right here and we can say that.

24

00:01:24,720  -->  00:01:26,690
OK that's fine for now.

25

00:01:26,880  -->  00:01:28,060
Let's create a.

26

00:01:28,120  -->  00:01:30,630
Let's start right here.

27

00:01:30,670  -->  00:01:33,690
The Master Simon protection.

28

00:01:34,800  -->  00:01:45,850
And I know for sure we have all the comments we have post ideas.

29

00:01:46,050  -->  00:01:48,380
We have Oerter.

30

00:01:49,350  -->  00:01:52,160
We have e-mail.

31

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:54,390
We have a body.

32

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:59,760
I believe we have is active and let's see what else we have.

33

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:04,200
Let's let's go back here.

34

00:02:04,200  -->  00:02:05,130
Whoops that's not a

35

00:02:08,780  -->  00:02:09,890
true e-mail body.

36

00:02:09,890  -->  00:02:12,780
I think that.

37

00:02:17,070  -->  00:02:23,250
Let me just take all these out real quick.

38

00:02:23,250  -->  00:02:26,310
All right.

39

00:02:28,470  -->  00:02:29,280
That's for comments.

40

00:02:29,280  -->  00:02:33,120
Let's go to come in reply.

41

00:02:33,210  -->  00:02:35,240
We are a similar fillable here.

42

00:02:35,260  -->  00:02:43,910
This one's going to say comment Id here and in-common reply.

43

00:02:43,920  -->  00:02:52,650
We can say public function comment we can say that this guy little guy belongs to a comment

44

00:02:55,530  -->  00:02:57,890
belongs to a comment.

45

00:02:58,380  -->  00:03:01,480
Whoops.

46

00:03:01,530  -->  00:03:03,950
Just in case we need him.

47

00:03:04,200  -->  00:03:05,300
All right.

48

00:03:05,500  -->  00:03:06,770
All right cool.

49

00:03:06,780  -->  00:03:08,000
So let's go and Bill the route.

50

00:03:08,010  -->  00:03:09,650
Maybe later on we have to come back here.

51

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:13,150
But for now we're done with this.

52

00:03:14,130  -->  00:03:15,480
Let's go to routes

53

00:03:18,330  -->  00:03:26,620
and we already have their routes actually for it so we're good we're golden here for comment controller

54

00:03:26,620  -->  00:03:26,890
.

55

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:29,150
What I would need the controllers.

56

00:03:29,170  -->  00:03:31,200
All right let's create a quick

57

00:03:34,890  -->  00:03:35,510
way.

58

00:03:35,510  -->  00:03:37,230
We do have the controllers.

59

00:03:37,560  -->  00:03:52,710
Let's create Let's just say BHP is an make controller and the first song is Paul's comment controller

60

00:03:52,740  -->  00:03:54,540
but we're forgetting the resource

61

00:03:59,760  -->  00:04:01,350
resource.

62

00:04:02,010  -->  00:04:07,430
OK.

63

00:04:07,440  -->  00:04:09,100
All right.

64

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:12,080
Let's create the rests.

65

00:04:12,090  -->  00:04:14,350
This one is going to be called meant

66

00:04:16,690  -->  00:04:17,990
replies.

67

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:21,510
Controller.

68

00:04:21,690  -->  00:04:23,080
All right.

69

00:04:23,730  -->  00:04:25,290
And that's it for these lecture.

70

00:04:25,290  -->  00:04:25,680
All right.

71

00:04:25,710  -->  00:04:28,440
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
