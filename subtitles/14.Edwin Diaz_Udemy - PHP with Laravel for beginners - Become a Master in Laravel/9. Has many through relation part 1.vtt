00:00:00.690  -->  00:00:05.670
Hi welcome back to the students in this lecture here we're going to be learning about another type of

2

00:00:05.670  -->  00:00:08.600
relationship has many true relationship.

3

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:15.420
Now this relationship allow us so provides a convenient shortcut for access distant relationships relationships

4

00:00:15.720  -->  00:00:17.670
via an intermediary relation.

5

00:00:17.670  -->  00:00:24.210
So for example we can have a user stable a post table and of course we can also have a country stable

6

00:00:24.210  -->  00:00:24.580
.

7

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:25.270
Right.

8

00:00:25.290  -->  00:00:32.170
And let's say the user belongs to a country of homeport a week or something like that right.

9

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:39.030
And we want to find out through appose not through the user but through another relay to another table

10

00:00:39.060  -->  00:00:44.110
where is a user from we can do this we has many true relation.

11

00:00:44.190  -->  00:00:46.350
And let me just show you real quick.

12

00:00:46.350  -->  00:00:47.120
OK.

13

00:00:47.400  -->  00:00:54.670
So we had to find out to another table about our relationship for a specific model.

14

00:00:54.690  -->  00:01:00.060
In this case when we find out that really the country for a user through the post table or right to

15

00:01:00.060  -->  00:01:01.350
an intermediate table.

16

00:01:01.350  -->  00:01:01.880
All right.

17

00:01:02.070  -->  00:01:06.470
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to set some type of route.

18

00:01:06.500  -->  00:01:06.840
Right.

19

00:01:06.840  -->  00:01:16.110
We need to make sure that when the user comes in the right becomes the through a route that we can check

20

00:01:16.180  -->  00:01:16.420
right.

21

00:01:16.470  -->  00:01:21.540
We can say okay we get the first parameter and we can say

22

00:01:24.620  -->  00:01:28.420
Let me see if we can find the user country.

23

00:01:28.680  -->  00:01:29.730
OK I like this.

24

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:31.270
There we go.

25

00:01:31.380  -->  00:01:32.860
I think that makes sense.

26

00:01:32.860  -->  00:01:34.970
And what we want to do.

27

00:01:34.980  -->  00:01:36.730
All right.

28

00:01:37.950  -->  00:01:38.580
All right.

29

00:01:38.690  -->  00:01:40.120
If not we'll change it.

30

00:01:40.350  -->  00:01:43.400
So we'll leave this like is now.

31

00:01:43.400  -->  00:01:48.660
But before we do we getting to routes any delay before we start pulling information let's actually create

32

00:01:49.710  -->  00:01:52.660
one of the most important things which is the migration.

33

00:01:52.800  -->  00:01:58.470
We need to have our country stable and we also need to have a column in the user table for country ID

34

00:01:58.800  -->  00:01:59.220
on.

35

00:01:59.230  -->  00:02:03.500
All right we're not going to be accessing the country from the users table.

36

00:02:03.870  -->  00:02:04.860
All right.

37

00:02:04.860  -->  00:02:08.760
We can it's very easy to do but that could get really messy.

38

00:02:08.760  -->  00:02:10.560
We want things clean.

39

00:02:10.570  -->  00:02:15.590
One we want we don't want to have you know forging IDs all over the place.

40

00:02:15.600  -->  00:02:23.850
All right so let's actually create a migration Let's call this BHB or send make let's just make the

41

00:02:23.850  -->  00:02:28.290
model right away because we're going to need a country with a migration of countries.

42

00:02:28.290  -->  00:02:29.230
All right.

43

00:02:29.280  -->  00:02:33.710
Once we have that now we need to add a country Id table to user.

44

00:02:33.710  -->  00:02:36.340
So let's create a migration for that as well.

45

00:02:36.360  -->  00:02:40.810
So BHP areason make migration.

46

00:02:41.490  -->  00:02:46.590
And then we're going to say this is the description we don't have to write it like this but it makes

47

00:02:46.590  -->  00:02:52.770
a lot of a lot of sense and Clarabell recommends for us to write the description of our migration like

48

00:02:52.770  -->  00:02:58.840
this add country Id call them

49

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:05.390
two countries.

50

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:14.580
I mean two users and we're going to be dealing with the table users of course and we go mentor.

51

00:03:14.850  -->  00:03:15.330
Whoops

52

00:03:17.310  -->  00:03:19.510
.

53

00:03:21.000  -->  00:03:22.310
It didn't go through.

54

00:03:22.350  -->  00:03:22.780
There we go.

55

00:03:22.830  -->  00:03:24.750
Enter now is created.

56

00:03:25.140  -->  00:03:25.410
All right.

57

00:03:25.410  -->  00:03:26.390
Perfect.

58

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:31.020
So now let's make sure that it's good.

59

00:03:32.040  -->  00:03:40.420
Let's go to our migration and let's finish it up by users here.

60

00:03:40.440  -->  00:03:44.570
We're going to create a column.

61

00:03:45.030  -->  00:03:49.630
It's going to be a integer actually.

62

00:03:50.740  -->  00:03:53.560
And you know me country ID.

63

00:03:54.540  -->  00:03:57.170
OK.

64

00:03:57.340  -->  00:04:04.350
All right the method here to drop it just in case let's just get the object first right.

65

00:04:05.180  -->  00:04:11.900
And then drop colon and is going to be country.

66

00:04:13.870  -->  00:04:15.560
We go.

67

00:04:15.840  -->  00:04:16.920
All right perfect.

68

00:04:16.920  -->  00:04:22.290
So now let's go and to the countries and also create

69

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:29.970
a name column for it.

70

00:04:30.780  -->  00:04:31.350
All right.

71

00:04:31.350  -->  00:04:33.200
Beautiful.

72

00:04:33.210  -->  00:04:40.740
Now it's migrated Cortis and migrate Antar.

73

00:04:40.770  -->  00:04:45.190
All right both tables table and column migrated.

74

00:04:45.270  -->  00:04:46.740
Let's refresh.

75

00:04:46.770  -->  00:04:49.620
We have the countries table here.

76

00:04:49.620  -->  00:04:59.340
Let's just pull some countries in their right mind and put your PR and

77

00:05:02.040  -->  00:05:06.590
what else would keep rushing there.

78

00:05:07.020  -->  00:05:07.980
U.S.

79

00:05:11.510  -->  00:05:12.060
India

80

00:05:14.980  -->  00:05:15.780
Israel

81

00:05:20.700  -->  00:05:21.180
Canada

82

00:05:23.970  -->  00:05:24.960
United Kingdom

83

00:05:30.340  -->  00:05:31.640
right.

84

00:05:33.110  -->  00:05:33.670
All right.

85

00:05:33.930  -->  00:05:35.960
You guys are from too many countries I can guess.

86

00:05:35.970  -->  00:05:36.980
All of you are right.

87

00:05:37.130  -->  00:05:39.690
And Jose Rodriguez a lot of countries out there.

88

00:05:39.690  -->  00:05:48.510
So anyway so now that we have a country let's actually go to the users table and make Edwin dÃ­az from

89

00:05:48.510  -->  00:05:49.930
the air.

90

00:05:50.670  -->  00:05:51.180
All right.

91

00:05:51.180  -->  00:05:56.680
We'll make him from that country where is the country right here.

92

00:05:56.940  -->  00:06:05.630
So does ID number one let's make Peter from the U.S. I think I actually was a U.S.

93

00:06:10.150  -->  00:06:12.310
You say right here number four.

94

00:06:12.720  -->  00:06:12.990
OK

95

00:06:15.240  -->  00:06:17.820
.

96

00:06:18.150  -->  00:06:19.680
All right cool.

97

00:06:19.680  -->  00:06:22.220
All right so I think I want you to add that did.

98

00:06:22.320  -->  00:06:24.360
I want you to digest this information.

99

00:06:24.360  -->  00:06:27.970
Remember we started with routes.

100

00:06:28.250  -->  00:06:30.720
All right we create a small route here.

101

00:06:30.840  -->  00:06:33.540
Then we started creating the migrations.

102

00:06:33.990  -->  00:06:43.590
OK the countries table and we adding a column called CONTOURI ID to the users table.

103

00:06:44.250  -->  00:06:46.760
So do that and I'll see you in the next lecture.

104

00:06:46.980  -->  00:06:47.400
Thank you
