1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:00,830
All right.

2

00:00:00,830  -->  00:00:01,910
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,910  -->  00:00:04,740
My students so we learn how to do a basic insert.

4

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:05,490
All right.

5

00:00:05,640  -->  00:00:11,820
Now it's time for us to learn how to create data and features the function idea that I'm going to show

6

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:15,180
you right now works very good with forms and with forms.

7

00:00:15,180  -->  00:00:17,970
When you're doing forms you want to use a create method.

8

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:18,690
OK.

9

00:00:18,880  -->  00:00:24,120
So I going to copy and paste and just going to select this and comment it out and I'll show you right

10

00:00:24,120  -->  00:00:25,860
now how easy it is.

11

00:00:25,860  -->  00:00:32,130
So and I want to show you this way because when you are creating data there is something called a mass

12

00:00:32,140  -->  00:00:38,830
assignment operation that goes on and allowable prevents multiple records from being all dated.

13

00:00:38,940  -->  00:00:44,160
I mean create it at the same time unless you specify it in the model and I'm going to show you in a

14

00:00:44,160  -->  00:00:52,110
minute how we let Clarabell know that it's OK to assign values to create new values for multiple columns

15

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:52,140
.

16

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:52,980
OK.

17

00:00:53,100  -->  00:00:55,260
Out of the body would not let you do that.

18

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:01,260
So unless you do what I'm about to show you in a couple of seconds it won't allow you or any application

19

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:06,990
to create data in your application in multiple columns or tables.

20

00:01:06,990  -->  00:01:07,460
All right.

21

00:01:07,620  -->  00:01:11,220
So let's do this get.

22

00:01:12,360  -->  00:01:21,640
And I'm going to call this create function and it's a post.

23

00:01:21,670  -->  00:01:25,180
And now the matter is create like this.

24

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:33,280
Now they create method is going to take an array array of associative an associate of array.

25

00:01:33,440  -->  00:01:44,340
So if we want to have the the title we go like this title and we updated BHB and create method or something

26

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:46,630
like that.

27

00:01:46,680  -->  00:01:48,030
Now the content

28

00:01:51,240  -->  00:01:53,400
content.

29

00:01:55,020  -->  00:01:57,660
Wow I'm learning.

30

00:01:58,480  -->  00:02:00,890
Whoops you had escaped this.

31

00:02:00,900  -->  00:02:03,360
I sure do.

32

00:02:03,490  -->  00:02:04,710
You can skip it like this.

33

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:06,750
I'm just going to like this.

34

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:13,990
I'm learning a lot with BHP with Edwin.

35

00:02:14,760  -->  00:02:16,040
OK.

36

00:02:17,070  -->  00:02:22,920
Let's just keep it real quick.

37

00:02:23,040  -->  00:02:24,260
This is the Coomer right there.

38

00:02:24,260  -->  00:02:30,390
And this was whoops gosh we go this you scape it right there.

39

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:30,920
All right.

40

00:02:31,080  -->  00:02:31,370
Wow.

41

00:02:31,380  -->  00:02:33,120
I'm learning a lot with Edwin.

42

00:02:33,130  -->  00:02:33,690
Yes.

43

00:02:33,690  -->  00:02:35,300
There we go.

44

00:02:35,310  -->  00:02:42,640
So now let's go to that create your echo and we should see something going on there.

45

00:02:42,640  -->  00:02:44,320
Now I'll show you right now let's just call.

46

00:02:44,340  -->  00:02:45,550
Come here.

47

00:02:46,050  -->  00:02:52,530
Let's just take all these out and do create enter mass assignment at ception.

48

00:02:52,530  -->  00:02:55,940
You see that it doesn't allow you to put data in there.

49

00:02:55,940  -->  00:02:56,640
Period.

50

00:02:56,730  -->  00:03:00,540
Unless you let it know that it's safe to do so.

51

00:03:00,750  -->  00:03:02,070
So how do we do it.

52

00:03:02,160  -->  00:03:08,670
Well let's go and let me show you those thing even if it's a q it doesn't go here and do anything refresh

53

00:03:09,330  -->  00:03:19,020
we still have the same right title and I have a different title because I play around with my courses

54

00:03:19,350  -->  00:03:23,880
and they're like lectures before I publish it sometimes and I might do different things.

55

00:03:23,880  -->  00:03:28,620
So if you see that my title and content are not the same as yours don't worry about it.

56

00:03:28,770  -->  00:03:32,730
Sometimes I I'll make a lecture I make a mistake and I read do it again.

57

00:03:32,730  -->  00:03:39,550
All right so anyway so the important thing here is that we're going to learn how to do the math assignment

58

00:03:39,550  -->  00:03:39,610
.

59

00:03:39,600  -->  00:03:44,980
So let's go to a post model right here which is the one that controls the database.

60

00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:49,620
You know call is a mad thing all that really cool stuff that we get from the model right.

61

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:54,510
This is every time you write something here he's going to override what we have in the parent.

62

00:03:54,570  -->  00:04:01,700
So let's come here and write unprotected fillable property.

63

00:04:01,980  -->  00:04:06,820
Right now these fillable property is available in the model somewhere right.

64

00:04:07,140  -->  00:04:11,610
But right now we're going to assign it assign a value to it.

65

00:04:11,610  -->  00:04:16,890
So right now what we're going to be doing is actually this is an array like this.

66

00:04:17,670  -->  00:04:18,370
OK.

67

00:04:18,400  -->  00:04:24,640
We bring it down and now we write each key so it's safe for the title.

68

00:04:25,090  -->  00:04:28,060
And we safe for content to be updated.

69

00:04:28,940  -->  00:04:31,050
OK.

70

00:04:31,080  -->  00:04:36,060
Now if we go in and try to do this now you know

71

00:04:39,030  -->  00:04:43,670
by there we go answer why law.

72

00:04:43,800  -->  00:04:45,780
Now we are able to create something.

73

00:04:46,170  -->  00:04:50,180
So let's just go back to Peachi my admin refresh.

74

00:04:50,640  -->  00:04:53,740
And now you can see that we have a new record here.

75

00:04:53,790  -->  00:04:54,660
They create method.

76

00:04:54,660  -->  00:05:00,900
Wow I'm learning a lot with Edwin Diaz and we escaped that single core so that what we have here as

77

00:05:00,900  -->  00:05:05,110
well as our as well as our Stamm time stamps.

78

00:05:05,370  -->  00:05:06,170
OK.

79

00:05:06,660  -->  00:05:09,000
Beautiful.

80

00:05:09,000  -->  00:05:09,540
All right.

81

00:05:09,660  -->  00:05:19,500
So remember we come here sometimes to allow certain data to be inserted into our application to create

82

00:05:19,500  -->  00:05:23,940
men that solve it later on we're going to talk a little bit about that and I got to get into it right

83

00:05:23,940  -->  00:05:24,210
now.

84

00:05:24,210  -->  00:05:25,710
But I almost did.

85

00:05:25,830  -->  00:05:30,550
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll talk to you and see you in the next one

86

00:05:30,550  -->  00:05:30,600
.

87

00:05:30,600  -->  00:05:31,200
Take care
