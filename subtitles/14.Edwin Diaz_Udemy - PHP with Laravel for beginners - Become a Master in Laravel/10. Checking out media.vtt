00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:01.940
All right welcome back with his students.

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:07.500
So on THE NEXT LIST the last lecture we actually did the categories pretty cool stuff.

3

00:00:07.710  -->  00:00:10.350
But we need to create some validation if we have not already.

4

00:00:10.350  -->  00:00:14.580
All right so I make sure that you have some validation you already know how to do that right.

5

00:00:14.850  -->  00:00:23.700
So but we will finish it off in later on probably after we fates we do they all agree we'll do some

6

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:28.680
little refactoring here and there and just tightened everything up a little bit more.

7

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:32.300
All right so let's go to the media and let's see if we see something there OK.

8

00:00:32.310  -->  00:00:35.360
Media is working.

9

00:00:35.830  -->  00:00:41.830
And we got the last photos we are bloated they are let's blow something here.

10

00:00:42.360  -->  00:00:44.280
All right let's.

11

00:00:45.550  -->  00:00:48.610
I'm going over my pictures I'm going to try to upload something there.

12

00:00:48.660  -->  00:00:50.630
And let's see if it works.

13

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:54.980
I'm going to try to overload my car.

14

00:00:55.740  -->  00:00:57.170
All right.

15

00:00:57.990  -->  00:00:59.270
Let's go here.

16

00:00:59.910  -->  00:01:01.920
And you can see my car right here.

17

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:02.520
Nice.

18

00:01:02.520  -->  00:01:04.770
You can see though you can see my car but.

19

00:01:05.190  -->  00:01:06.760
But anyway he's there.

20

00:01:06.810  -->  00:01:07.370
All right cool.

21

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:08.430
So that's working.

22

00:01:08.430  -->  00:01:09.440
What else.

23

00:01:09.590  -->  00:01:14.230
I mean we don't have anything else this is just placeholder stuff.

24

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:15.870
All right I think we got it working guys.

25

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:23.550
I think the rest is maybe build a dashboard or something there where we can see more data from our application

26

00:01:23.560  -->  00:01:24.500
.

27

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:26.080
I don't know.

28

00:01:26.100  -->  00:01:29.930
I mean you guys make the request and we'll try to put those features in this course.

29

00:01:29.930  -->  00:01:36.030
All right now this course is pretty long so I'm going to probably be making new records on the you know

30

00:01:36.030  -->  00:01:42.000
the newer version on Lavell and with some more features so that way I can show you some more examples

31

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:42.140
.

32

00:01:42.140  -->  00:01:42.780
All right.

33

00:01:43.050  -->  00:01:47.040
But anyway I think we're kind of done for the upgrade here.

34

00:01:47.040  -->  00:01:49.580
If you have any questions let me know.

35

00:01:49.650  -->  00:01:52.320
Put it on this cautions there.

36

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:53.910
Somebody will.

37

00:01:54.080  -->  00:01:57.900
If I don't answer you somebody will answer you right away.

38

00:01:57.900  -->  00:02:00.190
So we are here to help each other.

39

00:02:00.210  -->  00:02:06.300
So let's be friends and I'll see you in the next lectures take care of my students.

40

00:02:06.300  -->  00:02:07.410

41

00:02:07.410  -->  00:02:08.150
Bye bye.
