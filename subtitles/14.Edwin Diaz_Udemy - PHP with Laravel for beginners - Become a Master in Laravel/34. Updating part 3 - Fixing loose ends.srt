1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,440
All right.

2

00:00:00,440  -->  00:00:01,330
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,330  -->  00:00:01,700
Understood.

4

00:00:01,710  -->  00:00:06,330
So in this lecture I want to actually modify this a little bit and make it better.

5

00:00:06,470  -->  00:00:13,130
I mean Admin this controller and what we're gonna be doing here we're going to create conditions for

6

00:00:13,140  -->  00:00:15,300
password field just in case is empty.

7

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:21,660
And we also are going to fix the update method here which is not really hashing a password so let's

8

00:00:21,660  -->  00:00:23,000
actually do that right now.

9

00:00:23,010  -->  00:00:29,790
And what I want to do is I want to do something like this and I say if and this can be abstracted to

10

00:00:29,790  -->  00:00:30,700
a method guys.

11

00:00:30,720  -->  00:00:33,820
So if you want to put it into a method go ahead and do that.

12

00:00:34,400  -->  00:00:35,790
You should know how to do that by now.

13

00:00:35,800  -->  00:00:36,900
Right.

14

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:43,450
All right so if the puzzle is empty We're going to grab the input and we only get to pass cerned feel

15

00:00:43,580  -->  00:00:49,130
to it when I pass all the fields at set password.

16

00:00:49,140  -->  00:00:51,280
And this is a matter that a lot of guys.

17

00:00:51,320  -->  00:00:51,630
All right.

18

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:55,790
Just in case I'm not making this up and we don't have this we don't have a custom method.

19

00:00:55,830  -->  00:00:57,780
This is something that is built into the framework.

20

00:00:57,810  -->  00:01:03,180
OK so if it's empty we've got to pass everything except the password field and that's a very useful

21

00:01:03,210  -->  00:01:09,090
method else mean something is there and we're going to pass everything to it.

22

00:01:09,850  -->  00:01:11,670
OK.

23

00:01:12,810  -->  00:01:16,770
One thing here would be very good to do is trim.

24

00:01:17,450  -->  00:01:20,130
If now you might have a problem with whitespace

25

00:01:23,490  -->  00:01:28,340
so we trim it and.

26

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:33,840
OK you take this guy as well because if not we're going to keep doing the same thing we're going to

27

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:38,760
keep hashing empty spaces.

28

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:44,060
And we put it right here.

29

00:01:44,080  -->  00:01:44,510
Right.

30

00:01:44,550  -->  00:01:50,190
So we have something we encrypt a password and we include the fossil fuel of course and they encrypted

31

00:01:50,200  -->  00:01:50,720
.

32

00:01:51,210  -->  00:01:52,600
All right what else.

33

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:59,820
Let's take it to the let's take this out a year let's take it to the update method.

34

00:01:59,820  -->  00:02:00,910
Right.

35

00:02:01,550  -->  00:02:06,510
Let's go to the old they meant a quick and

36

00:02:09,820  -->  00:02:12,900
last place right here.

37

00:02:14,850  -->  00:02:19,520
You should have a request or somewhere here in the method that I did not.

38

00:02:19,530  -->  00:02:19,990
All right.

39

00:02:20,060  -->  00:02:22,180
Just just because probably I removed it.

40

00:02:22,200  -->  00:02:25,880
Maybe I was editing the lecture or something and forgot to put it there.

41

00:02:26,130  -->  00:02:29,840
But you should have one of those there when you were updating it right.

42

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:37,860
But anyway so we take the same thing back to the Dave method and we are hashing that password as well

43

00:02:37,860  -->  00:02:40,590
here so we don't have to put it right here anymore.

44

00:02:41,080  -->  00:02:42,140
All right.

45

00:02:42,450  -->  00:02:43,930
OK I think we're done.

46

00:02:43,950  -->  00:02:44,250
All right.

47

00:02:44,250  -->  00:02:45,840
Thank you so much for watching.

48

00:02:45,870  -->  00:02:47,810
And if you have an issues let me know.

49

00:02:47,820  -->  00:02:48,960
Take care.
