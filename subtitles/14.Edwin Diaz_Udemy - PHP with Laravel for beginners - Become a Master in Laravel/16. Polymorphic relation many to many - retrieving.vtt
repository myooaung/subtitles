00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.770
All right.

2

00:00:00.810  -->  00:00:02.760
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:02.760  -->  00:00:10.320
So it's time for us to start putting some data inside the tables right the videos and taxing all that

4

00:00:11.070  -->  00:00:16.140
great stuff right now where we can start retrieving some of this relationship.

5

00:00:16.140  -->  00:00:16.700
OK.

6

00:00:16.950  -->  00:00:22.010
So let's go to our beach be my admin.

7

00:00:22.020  -->  00:00:22.940
All right.

8

00:00:23.730  -->  00:00:30.580
And let's go to see we've got we've got some polls.

9

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:34.180
Let's actually before we do that we need to migrate this table.

10

00:00:34.190  -->  00:00:39.250
OK guys so let's go ahead and migrate it because we just created it.

11

00:00:39.250  -->  00:00:40.630
And then whenever migrated.

12

00:00:40.700  -->  00:00:41.220
All right.

13

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:44.560
So BHB already soon migrate.

14

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:46.580
Ok cool.

15

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:50.400
Let's refresh.

16

00:00:50.400  -->  00:00:52.410
Beautiful.

17

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:54.050
All right.

18

00:00:55.020  -->  00:00:57.330
So let's go to

19

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:05.760
this video first and I start with videos and I put the name here.

20

00:01:05.780  -->  00:01:19.260
Doing a movie for movie and coding faculty.

21

00:01:19.390  -->  00:01:22.100
A movie.

22

00:01:22.170  -->  00:01:24.750
Oh here we go.

23

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:30.480
All right so we got those there let's do tax I'm starting from from here actually because I want to

24

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:34.990
feel loved to this relationship.

25

00:01:35.070  -->  00:01:40.790
I want to make sure that they have they have the OK videos pose.

26

00:01:41.070  -->  00:01:42.570
Let's go to tags.

27

00:01:42.990  -->  00:01:44.430
I'm leaving Tiger was for last.

28

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:45.130
OK.

29

00:01:45.540  -->  00:01:48.660
So tags and let's go things are some data.

30

00:01:48.660  -->  00:01:54.380
The name of this tag could be I don't know BHB.

31

00:01:54.370  -->  00:01:55.290
All right.

32

00:01:55.620  -->  00:01:56.430
And

33

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:03.390
this one could be Javascript or something like that.

34

00:02:03.390  -->  00:02:03.720
Right.

35

00:02:03.720  -->  00:02:07.160
Doesn't have to be to too many of them.

36

00:02:07.170  -->  00:02:08.050
And let's go to tag.

37

00:02:08.100  -->  00:02:08.680
OK.

38

00:02:09.050  -->  00:02:10.730
Let's answer some data here.

39

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:11.610
All right.

40

00:02:11.970  -->  00:02:15.510
So the tag ID for this one would be the number one.

41

00:02:16.050  -->  00:02:18.520
OK.

42

00:02:19.410  -->  00:02:22.250
That's the tag ID the tag ID.

43

00:02:22.260  -->  00:02:26.920
This is going to belong to video number one.

44

00:02:28.080  -->  00:02:30.840
And the type with the app.

45

00:02:31.910  -->  00:02:32.490
OK.

46

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:35.060
And video.

47

00:02:35.070  -->  00:02:37.050
There we go.

48

00:02:37.050  -->  00:02:39.100
All right.

49

00:02:39.630  -->  00:02:40.940
This is just an example guys.

50

00:02:40.940  -->  00:02:43.190
All right so don't worry about the data too much.

51

00:02:43.530  -->  00:02:45.280
Oh you know what.

52

00:02:45.390  -->  00:02:48.020
This is the tag that will.

53

00:02:48.330  -->  00:02:53.450
I just realized that this valuable time needs to be a string.

54

00:02:53.910  -->  00:02:55.020
All right cool.

55

00:02:55.020  -->  00:03:00.380
So this is the great thing about Clarabelle we can go back and roll back right.

56

00:03:00.900  -->  00:03:04.260
Let's roll these back real quick.

57

00:03:04.260  -->  00:03:04.890
All right.

58

00:03:05.130  -->  00:03:05.850
All right.

59

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:08.170
So APHC migrate.

60

00:03:08.910  -->  00:03:12.830
Roll back and we rolling back those three.

61

00:03:12.990  -->  00:03:13.760
Beautiful.

62

00:03:13.770  -->  00:03:15.560
So now let's fix that.

63

00:03:16.200  -->  00:03:22.300
Let's go right here to toggles and convert this to a string.

64

00:03:22.820  -->  00:03:24.700
Now let's do migrate here.

65

00:03:25.230  -->  00:03:27.620
BHB and migrate enter.

66

00:03:27.660  -->  00:03:29.850
You see how easy that was.

67

00:03:29.850  -->  00:03:32.910
Now let's refresh right here.

68

00:03:32.970  -->  00:03:34.100
We're good to go again.

69

00:03:34.230  -->  00:03:36.830
OK let's do some videos real quick.

70

00:03:36.840  -->  00:03:38.170
All right.

71

00:03:39.380  -->  00:03:42.750
Insert let's make it more semantic something that makes sense.

72

00:03:42.750  -->  00:03:43.350
All right.

73

00:03:43.440  -->  00:03:47.990
So let's just say BHB is need.

74

00:03:48.120  -->  00:03:57.060
Insert the that a movie and this one would be.

75

00:03:57.240  -->  00:04:00.980
Javascript.

76

00:04:01.260  -->  00:04:04.000
Alert function or something like that.

77

00:04:05.140  -->  00:04:10.500
That will be all right.

78

00:04:10.500  -->  00:04:13.380
Now let's get the tags and this sensors some tags.

79

00:04:13.380  -->  00:04:18.590
This is going to be BHB ashes javascript.

80

00:04:19.360  -->  00:04:30.150
OK let's go to Tiger was and believe that number one is that for PH BE videos and we sure have.

81

00:04:30.210  -->  00:04:30.860
That's fine.

82

00:04:31.050  -->  00:04:35.880
Let's go to tag's Tiger Woods I mean insert.

83

00:04:35.970  -->  00:04:36.410
All right.

84

00:04:36.450  -->  00:04:45.300
So the first tag is going to be the ID Number one the one that we created for ph I believe will ID number

85

00:04:45.300  -->  00:04:51.510
one is fine and Tiger will type.

86

00:04:51.900  -->  00:04:54.810
This is going to be a video.

87

00:04:55.010  -->  00:04:55.460
There we go.

88

00:04:55.470  -->  00:04:57.360
So we put the model here.

89

00:04:58.890  -->  00:05:01.760
Beautiful.

90

00:05:01.800  -->  00:05:03.900
All right so the tag for that.

91

00:05:03.900  -->  00:05:06.530
Now we need to create another tag.

92

00:05:06.540  -->  00:05:08.460
All right.

93

00:05:08.460  -->  00:05:11.010
So thats cool for that.

94

00:05:11.110  -->  00:05:14.010
I mean see one second.

95

00:05:14.010  -->  00:05:14.680
All right.

96

00:05:14.820  -->  00:05:17.950
Let's create another one tag number two.

97

00:05:18.150  -->  00:05:27.100
Taggett will ID is I believe number one and Tegel what type is app post.

98

00:05:27.300  -->  00:05:32.500
Actually we can even more or less you just make that polls

99

00:05:34.780  -->  00:05:36.660
.

100

00:05:37.130  -->  00:05:37.990
OK.

101

00:05:38.600  -->  00:05:46.590
So let's just go to the polls right now and let's just add this for a quick and let's me.

102

00:05:46.640  -->  00:05:49.680
Does Joe script

103

00:05:54.540  -->  00:05:55.740
.

104

00:05:57.260  -->  00:05:57.740
That's fine.

105

00:05:57.740  -->  00:05:59.750
You don't have to have the same data as me.

106

00:05:59.750  -->  00:06:02.790
Just make sure that all the data is filled OK.

107

00:06:03.230  -->  00:06:03.780
So

108

00:06:07.430  -->  00:06:11.250
knishes make sure that all these days is filled.

109

00:06:11.360  -->  00:06:12.500
That's fine.

110

00:06:12.500  -->  00:06:13.590
This is that tug of war.

111

00:06:13.610  -->  00:06:17.030
The one actually for post number one.

112

00:06:17.030  -->  00:06:21.960
So I'm just half or see the meaning that I am very big of other stuff that I do.

113

00:06:21.970  -->  00:06:26.700
So this is going to be BHB guys sorry about that.

114

00:06:26.820  -->  00:06:27.540
OK.

115

00:06:27.680  -->  00:06:29.190
Don't get lazy and write it down array

116

00:06:31.700  -->  00:06:32.930
.

117

00:06:34.280  -->  00:06:39.640
And let's go back where is it or what.

118

00:06:39.650  -->  00:06:43.770
Them are one and make this one javascript again.

119

00:06:43.790  -->  00:06:47.670
All you have to do is have some type of data here so that you can recognize it.

120

00:06:48.020  -->  00:06:49.390
When we retrieve it.

121

00:06:49.410  -->  00:06:52.150
Ok cool.

122

00:06:52.170  -->  00:06:56.360
Now I call it really doesn't matter as long as we have the data filled up.

123

00:06:56.370  -->  00:06:56.850
All right.

124

00:06:56.990  -->  00:07:01.160
So anyway let's go to our HP storm.

125

00:07:01.590  -->  00:07:03.860
Oh I hope you know what we are doing here guys.

126

00:07:03.860  -->  00:07:04.710
All right.

127

00:07:05.270  -->  00:07:08.800
If I explain it before let me just go over a real quick OK.

128

00:07:08.870  -->  00:07:16.650
We have we're pulling we're relating we're putting tags on videos and tags on posts.

129

00:07:17.030  -->  00:07:17.610
OK.

130

00:07:17.810  -->  00:07:23.810
That's what we're doing and that's why they target was right here because it tagged I.D. is right here

131

00:07:24.230  -->  00:07:28.610
is number one is BHB that's a tag I.D. OK.

132

00:07:29.900  -->  00:07:36.980
And then that target I.D. is the for this one.

133

00:07:36.980  -->  00:07:39.970
Here is the video.

134

00:07:40.070  -->  00:07:45.750
So that tag I.D. tag NYPD is this guy right here ID number one that's a tag Y.D..

135

00:07:46.040  -->  00:07:51.160
OK and of course the motto is videos right video.

136

00:07:51.170  -->  00:07:56.370
Remember that the motto is a singular version in with the upper case.

137

00:07:56.390  -->  00:07:57.180
So.

138

00:07:57.410  -->  00:07:58.320
All right.

139

00:07:58.370  -->  00:08:00.350
So that's very simple.

140

00:08:00.860  -->  00:08:06.240
Let's go and start pulling out some data out of the out of it.

141

00:08:06.260  -->  00:08:10.090
Let's go to ETP routes.

142

00:08:11.030  -->  00:08:17.150
If you want to make a comment make this for Lee morphic.

143

00:08:18.080  -->  00:08:20.980
Many too many.

144

00:08:22.010  -->  00:08:23.890
OK.

145

00:08:23.990  -->  00:08:24.680
All right.

146

00:08:25.160  -->  00:08:30.980
So how do we pool information from this relationship.

147

00:08:30.980  -->  00:08:33.920
Remember how we did it with the last relationships right.

148

00:08:33.920  -->  00:08:38.690
We used met his name as a dynamic property and that's exactly how we do it.

149

00:08:38.810  -->  00:08:43.030
So let's say for example I want to pulao their tax for the post.

150

00:08:43.100  -->  00:08:45.190
So I'm going to do this.

151

00:08:45.200  -->  00:08:48.130
I'm going to go and Querrey that model.

152

00:08:48.390  -->  00:08:51.280
I'm going to find the part number one for example.

153

00:08:51.590  -->  00:08:52.330
OK.

154

00:08:52.340  -->  00:08:54.210
And then I look through it.

155

00:08:54.620  -->  00:09:01.020
But let's create a route and let's just write it down route.

156

00:09:04.820  -->  00:09:07.320
And I'm going to write something that makes sense right.

157

00:09:07.910  -->  00:09:08.800
That's right.

158

00:09:09.050  -->  00:09:11.580
Polls.

159

00:09:12.860  -->  00:09:22.000
Polls tag something like that and function parentheses curly brackets bring it down.

160

00:09:22.380  -->  00:09:28.640
Oh go whoops.

161

00:09:28.670  -->  00:09:32.060
Go now we write out for each loop

162

00:09:36.170  -->  00:09:36.680
we go.

163

00:09:36.690  -->  00:09:40.520
PPOs tags.

164

00:09:40.730  -->  00:09:42.770
Tag the killer.

165

00:09:43.100  -->  00:09:51.080
And then here we just echo tag name.

166

00:09:51.080  -->  00:09:52.490
All right cool.

167

00:09:52.520  -->  00:10:04.720
So let's open this up see a mess and it's to pull pulls out enter.

168

00:10:05.360  -->  00:10:08.030
Whoops We misspelled our motto.

169

00:10:08.030  -->  00:10:11.300
Here we go.

170

00:10:12.260  -->  00:10:19.660
Enter as you can see the post tag for now one is javascript array.

171

00:10:20.090  -->  00:10:21.530
Pretty cool stuff right.

172

00:10:21.860  -->  00:10:28.570
So now we can also retrieve the owner of the polymorphic relation from the polymorphic model.

173

00:10:28.570  -->  00:10:28.900
All right.

174

00:10:28.940  -->  00:10:34.510
By testing the name of the method that performs the call to more of a by many.

175

00:10:34.710  -->  00:10:36.530
Ok super simple.

176

00:10:36.530  -->  00:10:42.560
So on that we're going to do it in the next lecture because this lecture has been very long so I want

177

00:10:42.560  -->  00:10:46.350
you to try to actually pull out that Warner OK.

178

00:10:46.370  -->  00:10:51.720
So basically is everything backwards here OK so if you're pulling out of the pool stacks you can pull

179

00:10:51.720  -->  00:10:54.590
out the tags polls.

180

00:10:54.620  -->  00:10:55.220
OK.

181

00:10:55.340  -->  00:10:57.500
So anyway I'll show you how to do that in the next lecture.

182

00:10:57.500  -->  00:10:59.050
Thank you so much for watching guys.

183

00:10:59.060  -->  00:11:00.200
It's been a pleasure.

184

00:11:00.200  -->  00:11:03.420
And actually they are not saying goodbye just for the next lecture.

185

00:11:03.430  -->  00:11:04.390
Hey take care.

186

00:11:04.400  -->  00:11:05.410
See you in the next lecture.

187

00:11:05.410  -->  00:11:06.200
Bye bye.
