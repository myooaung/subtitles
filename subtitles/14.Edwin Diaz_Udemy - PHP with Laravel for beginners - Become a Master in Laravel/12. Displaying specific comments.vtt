00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:04.720
All right so welcome back my students on the last lecture we started the show page here.

2

00:00:04.890  -->  00:00:09.230
Well we're going to break the specific comments for specific post.

3

00:00:09.230  -->  00:00:09.820
All right.

4

00:00:09.960  -->  00:00:11.990
So let's go to a post common controller here.

5

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:14.120
Let's go to our show.

6

00:00:14.210  -->  00:00:19.830
Mad year and we're going to work on this one here because what we want to do is bring the post down

7

00:00:19.860  -->  00:00:20.910
.

8

00:00:21.930  -->  00:00:27.390
All right we're going to find or fail this post.

9

00:00:27.420  -->  00:00:28.200
All right.

10

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:34.390
And we want to bring the pope's comments.

11

00:00:34.500  -->  00:00:37.420
All right.

12

00:00:37.430  -->  00:00:44.790
That is a sign it all very well their call that we want to return to view

13

00:00:48.570  -->  00:01:00.450
with admen comments that show and then fasten that comment.

14

00:01:04.310  -->  00:01:05.790
OK.

15

00:01:05.880  -->  00:01:06.420
All right.

16

00:01:06.480  -->  00:01:15.440
But before we do that we need to go back to posts in that year and posts in that speech and change their

17

00:01:15.450  -->  00:01:21.990
role here if you have not done so ready to show and pass an ID of post ID.

18

00:01:21.990  -->  00:01:29.610
All right let's go back to our post click on to your comments and there is no comments here for these

19

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:30.680
folks.

20

00:01:30.720  -->  00:01:34.620
Let's go and go to post again.

21

00:01:34.620  -->  00:01:37.950
Let's view the polls and make a comment real quick.

22

00:01:38.310  -->  00:01:42.840
Just making a comment.

23

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:50.850
And as you can see your message as being Samit is waiting moderation.

24

00:01:50.850  -->  00:01:52.380
Cool.

25

00:01:52.380  -->  00:01:53.570
All right.

26

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:57.650
Let's go back to our real quick.

27

00:01:57.790  -->  00:02:00.430
We've got to put a link up there.

28

00:02:01.050  -->  00:02:05.110
And this view and there you go.

29

00:02:05.130  -->  00:02:09.550
We can approve it or approve it actually delete it.

30

00:02:09.600  -->  00:02:10.270
That was delete.

31

00:02:10.320  -->  00:02:11.510
Oops.

32

00:02:12.120  -->  00:02:14.460
But as you can see it works flawlessly.

33

00:02:14.460  -->  00:02:15.160
All right.

34

00:02:15.450  -->  00:02:20.910
So let's just do another one real quick because i was fun.

35

00:02:21.060  -->  00:02:22.000
Here we go.

36

00:02:22.230  -->  00:02:23.670
And this has to be.

37

00:02:23.670  -->  00:02:25.540
Let's go back to it.

38

00:02:26.460  -->  00:02:27.910
Let's go to the show.

39

00:02:28.050  -->  00:02:30.570
And he would for some reason we don't have that the lead

40

00:02:32.290  -->  00:02:34.650
.

41

00:02:35.130  -->  00:02:35.970
All right

42

00:02:35.970  -->  00:02:43.400
.

43

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:46.830
We're now seeing the the lead functionality here.

44

00:02:46.830  -->  00:02:50.160
For some reason supposed to be right there

45

00:02:53.680  -->  00:02:55.470
as a proof.

46

00:02:55.470  -->  00:02:57.660
Supposed to be the lead actually.

47

00:02:58.140  -->  00:03:02.830
There we go and we probably have the polls like Doswell right.

48

00:03:03.420  -->  00:03:03.900
So

49

00:03:07.020  -->  00:03:10.820
let's check the polls real quick.

50

00:03:11.600  -->  00:03:13.630
In other polls have that.

51

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:18.220
What about comments comments have that those who have that believe either.

52

00:03:18.570  -->  00:03:20.340
So let's go back to comments real quick

53

00:03:23.260  -->  00:03:30.310
and they delete functionality.

54

00:03:30.440  -->  00:03:30.850
All right.

55

00:03:30.870  -->  00:03:33.400
Just in case you guys don't have a whoops.

56

00:03:33.820  -->  00:03:36.540
What was that.

57

00:03:37.860  -->  00:03:42.230
I'm making my own classes now.

58

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:43.290
There we go.

59

00:03:43.620  -->  00:03:44.710
What is not a proof.

60

00:03:44.730  -->  00:03:50.220
It's the lead.

61

00:03:50.250  -->  00:03:54.270
Now we're good.

62

00:03:54.290  -->  00:03:54.990
There we go

63

00:03:54.990  -->  00:04:01.960
.

64

00:04:01.980  -->  00:04:02.220
All right.

65

00:04:02.220  -->  00:04:05.130
What if that post had more comments.

66

00:04:05.130  -->  00:04:07.610
Well we'll have another one here right.

67

00:04:08.070  -->  00:04:13.460
Let's go here and create another one.

68

00:04:13.530  -->  00:04:17.340
Go back to wildmen posts.

69

00:04:17.630  -->  00:04:22.280
And as you can see we have more for that specific post.

70

00:04:22.470  -->  00:04:25.770
Let's share and let's change this here.

.

74

00:04:40.710  -->  00:04:43.340
We didn't lose good.

75

00:04:43.560  -->  00:04:44.870
We're making progress guys.

76

00:04:44.880  -->  00:04:48.600
We're making progress.

77

00:04:48.600  -->  00:04:50.240
All right.

78

00:04:50.970  -->  00:04:52.660
Looking really good.

79

00:04:52.680  -->  00:04:53.200
All right.

80

00:04:53.250  -->  00:04:58.020
