Let's say you use a composer.

26

00:01:24.590  -->  00:01:25.860
All right.

27

00:01:26.570  -->  00:01:32.950
You'll go ahead and log in to your spam bots.

28

00:01:33.070  -->  00:01:35.960
Right this is the domain name that we use.

29

00:01:35.970  -->  00:01:38.490
This is the key right here.

30

00:01:38.650  -->  00:01:40.480
Well this is my key.

31

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:50.040
But don't worry about that don't even if you copy my key I'm going to delete it anyway so don't even

32

00:01:50.040  -->  00:01:51.230
try and nothing funny with it.

33

00:01:51.230  -->  00:01:51.730
Right.

34

00:01:51.930  -->  00:01:54.730
So anyway let's let's go ahead.

35

00:01:54.820  -->  00:02:00.210
You can argue your domain but we're not going to do that right now where you can go to your dashboard

36

00:02:00.220  -->  00:02:05.190
This is your dashboard right here and you can create mailing list if you want you can have people subscribe

37

00:02:05.190  -->  00:02:07.760
to it and you can send them automatic e-mails.

38

00:02:07.770  -->  00:02:08.930
It's pretty cool stuff.

39

00:02:08.940  -->  00:02:13.650
You upload your logs here that would tell you how many e-mails has been sent routes.

40

00:02:13.650  -->  00:02:14.980
All right.

41

00:02:15.540  -->  00:02:16.530
We have tracking.

42

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:21.390
You can track how many people open the liver clicks all that great stuff in there.

43

00:02:21.390  -->  00:02:23.330
We've got Web hooks suppressions.

44

00:02:23.370  -->  00:02:26.540
I mean you can go to the documentation and read more about it.

45

00:02:26.730  -->  00:02:29.160
Well we're going to be doing is just sending e-mails All right.

46

00:02:29.160  -->  00:02:30.150
That's all we're going to be doing.

47

00:02:30.150  -->  00:02:32.220
We're going to plug it into our bill.

48

00:02:32.310  -->  00:02:38.310
All right once we plug it in then we will use their API we use their server to send e-mail.

49

00:02:38.360  -->  00:02:41.460
All right which is more secure than anything else.

50

00:02:41.460  -->  00:02:44.730
All right now you're going to have your sandbox right here.

51

00:02:44.730  -->  00:02:47.210
This is the domain name that you use.

52

00:02:47.820  -->  00:02:49.200
I'll show you.

53

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:50.210
All right.

54

00:02:50.700  -->  00:02:58.180
So we can use this a.p we can use the logon for that and the password right here.

55

00:02:58.200  -->  00:02:59.680
Now we're not going to be using.

56

00:02:59.700  -->  00:03:01.960
Well we're going to be using their API.

57

00:03:01.980  -->  00:03:04.400
So we're going to use our domain.

58

00:03:04.720  -->  00:03:05.210
All right.

59

00:03:05.220  -->  00:03:09.420
Which is this all right here as well right here.

60

00:03:09.420  -->  00:03:14.840
You see we use our domain we can use our API to it.

61

00:03:14.910  -->  00:03:15.570
All right.

62

00:03:15.840  -->  00:03:22.380
And if you go to the symbol right here it's going to take you to the front and here you get you have

63

00:03:22.380  -->  00:03:24.190
UAP eyes down here as well.

64

00:03:24.240  -->  00:03:29.770
And when you click show you can see your Sikri API and you can see your public API.

65

00:03:29.910  -->  00:03:30.550
All right.

66

00:03:30.690  -->  00:03:35.580
We're going to need this credentials to connect to their server.

67

00:03:35.580  -->  00:03:36.450
All right.

68

00:03:36.930  -->  00:03:42.780
So on the next lecture we're going to see how we can start sending email with how to plug this into

69

00:03:42.780  -->  00:03:46.940
Laro well and a way that we can start sending e-mails OK.

70

00:03:47.100  -->  00:03:50.860
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
