00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:02.490
Or write welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.550  -->  00:00:05.790
So we already looked at it at Sessler right.

3

00:00:05.850  -->  00:00:10.890
And we were able to get a value out of the database at the same time before we even do anything with

4

00:00:10.890  -->  00:00:11.570
it.

5

00:00:11.580  -->  00:00:16.950
We were able to manipulate the data right by using get the name of the column and they were actually

6

00:00:16.990  -->  00:00:18.780
you passing the value there.

7

00:00:18.780  -->  00:00:24.340
So now we're going to look at the mutator how we can set a value in the database before we get weave

8

00:00:24.390  -->  00:00:26.340
before we send it to the to the database.

9

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:27.100
OK.

10

00:00:27.570  -->  00:00:27.840
All right.

11

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:29.640
So how can we manipulate that data.

12

00:00:29.670  -->  00:00:31.980
Well first let's create a mutator.

13

00:00:32.760  -->  00:00:33.700
And this is a convention.

14

00:00:33.690  -->  00:00:43.050
OK we set name actually you know we've got to do is use the only key word that we got to change is the

15

00:00:43.380  -->  00:00:44.230
first one.

16

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:50.910
That's the difference between those two get and set and then everything else is the same.

17

00:00:50.940  -->  00:00:54.030
So you would say to you here.

18

00:00:54.190  -->  00:00:54.810
OK.

19

00:00:54.870  -->  00:00:59.820
The only two key words I will always be the same as they get in there in the accessor and they actually

20

00:00:59.820  -->  00:01:03.090
view and on the mutator the set.

21

00:01:03.110  -->  00:01:10.800
And actually you get Actually you said actually you see the mutator some mutates the data access or

22

00:01:10.800  -->  00:01:11.820
gets the data.

23

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:16.430
All right so have that in your brains.

24

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:17.130
Right.

25

00:01:17.150  -->  00:01:18.960
So OK so how we do this.

26

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:25.100
Well we we have to grab this attributes.

27

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:25.870
OK.

28

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:27.770
And this is going to be an array.

29

00:01:28.260  -->  00:01:33.670
And of course we're going to tell you the name the attributes that we want to mutate.

30

00:01:33.870  -->  00:01:42.300
We want to mutate is actually you and we want to set it to you know why I'm going to use the same functionality

31

00:01:42.300  -->  00:01:43.500
right here.

32

00:01:44.130  -->  00:01:48.450
I want to make sure that that's going to be upper case all of it in the database.

33

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:50.120
So right now we go back.

34

00:01:50.120  -->  00:01:54.660
There is this is all in lowercase right here.

35

00:01:55.140  -->  00:01:56.210
All right.

36

00:01:56.820  -->  00:02:01.980
So now every time I save that data is going to be uppercase but I got to go and save it first.

37

00:02:01.980  -->  00:02:13.440
So let's go to our routes Let's go and create another route right here and this call is set name right

38

00:02:13.460  -->  00:02:13.500
.

39

00:02:13.500  -->  00:02:18.550
Makes sense that name we got to find the user.

40

00:02:19.140  -->  00:02:24.950
We to grab the user's name and we just go.

41

00:02:26.690  -->  00:02:27.020
I don't know.

42

00:02:27.020  -->  00:02:28.560
Mortified to say.

43

00:02:28.800  -->  00:02:31.110
William.

44

00:02:31.110  -->  00:02:38.880
William I think that's OK too.

45

00:02:39.660  -->  00:02:43.210
And then when you say these users save.

46

00:02:43.550  -->  00:02:46.140
OK.

47

00:02:46.260  -->  00:02:46.530
All right.

48

00:02:46.530  -->  00:02:47.270
That should do it.

49

00:02:47.310  -->  00:02:50.550
And then we should go all upper case there.

50

00:02:50.880  -->  00:02:52.330
Let's.

51

00:02:53.040  -->  00:02:54.570
And I'm going to give you this links guys.

52

00:02:54.570  -->  00:02:55.080
OK.

53

00:02:55.140  -->  00:02:58.420
I got the documentation right beside me.

54

00:02:58.540  -->  00:03:03.740
So let's go ahead and do this real quick set name.

55

00:03:03.900  -->  00:03:05.170
Answer.

56

00:03:05.190  -->  00:03:05.530
All right.

57

00:03:05.580  -->  00:03:07.380
Let's go back here.

58

00:03:07.380  -->  00:03:13.420
Refresh and as you can see we change the name of the center time we made it all upper case.

59

00:03:13.440  -->  00:03:20.280
So this is what I'm mutator is super super cool to use them because you can do lots of great things

60

00:03:20.700  -->  00:03:21.780
of money related data.

61

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:22.520
OK.

62

00:03:22.920  -->  00:03:28.410
When you already have certain functionality in your project and you don't want to modify anything else

63

00:03:28.890  -->  00:03:29.470
cool.

64

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:34.670
So now you know by the mutator thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
