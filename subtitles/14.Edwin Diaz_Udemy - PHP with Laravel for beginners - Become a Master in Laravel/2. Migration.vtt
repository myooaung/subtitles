00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.500
All right welcome back to this.

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:07.730
And so we got a lot of stuff set up already we got control those we are or links or pages that you know

3

00:00:07.740  -->  00:00:08.750
our routes.

4

00:00:08.850  -->  00:00:15.630
So it's tough for us to start bringing in data from the database or creating in a new table.

5

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:16.150
All right.

6

00:00:16.260  -->  00:00:20.070
So we don't even have a model for this we need a model for a post.

7

00:00:20.180  -->  00:00:22.170
We we need a migration.

8

00:00:22.170  -->  00:00:23.590
We need to set up a couple of things.

9

00:00:23.590  -->  00:00:26.010
All right let's start with the migration and the model.

10

00:00:26.130  -->  00:00:32.010
So let's go BHB areason Let's do that and then we're going to say make model.

11

00:00:32.010  -->  00:00:37.100
We're going to call it post your name for Migration.

12

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:37.750
Great.

13

00:00:37.840  -->  00:00:42.750
Synchronizes little baby right here synchronizes baby.

14

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:47.700
And let's go to database for a quick migration.

15

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:49.430
There we go we've got the migration.

16

00:00:49.620  -->  00:00:50.070
All right.

17

00:00:50.220  -->  00:00:52.220
So let's set this up for us.

18

00:00:52.320  -->  00:00:56.130
Then we worry about relationship or any other anything else.

19

00:00:56.250  -->  00:00:59.820
So the user is going to have many different posts.

20

00:00:59.850  -->  00:01:06.150
For that we need to have the user id in this table.

21

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:08.950
So enter your user ID.

22

00:01:09.360  -->  00:01:10.520
OK.

23

00:01:10.990  -->  00:01:21.750
That's right in as a matter of fact let's make it on sign as well as let's do that on on site and only

24

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:25.630
positive numbers.

25

00:01:26.010  -->  00:01:27.000
Oops.

26

00:01:27.780  -->  00:01:30.280
What mess was that about.

27

00:01:31.020  -->  00:01:33.370
All right cool what else are we going to have.

28

00:01:33.390  -->  00:01:35.360
We're going to have categories right.

29

00:01:35.610  -->  00:01:36.950
So let's create one there.

30

00:01:36.960  -->  00:01:37.800
As a matter of fact

31

00:01:41.610  -->  00:01:43.080
let's create categories here

32

00:01:45.560  -->  00:01:47.380
category.

33

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:54.280
What else we get our photo IDs ray photos.

34

00:01:54.390  -->  00:01:58.640
So this post is going to be loaded with a lot of things.

35

00:01:58.640  -->  00:02:00.880
All right.

36

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:05.970
So all right what else let's do.

37

00:02:06.990  -->  00:02:08.010
Whoops.

38

00:02:08.340  -->  00:02:08.820
Tidal

39

00:02:14.520  -->  00:02:16.400
waves.

40

00:02:16.400  -->  00:02:18.480
And let's name this.

41

00:02:18.900  -->  00:02:25.940
Let's do a tets and let's name this let's think about it for men let's name this body.

42

00:02:25.940  -->  00:02:26.570
All right.

43

00:02:26.790  -->  00:02:27.930
OK.

44

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:29.480
What do you have to think about it too much.

45

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:30.360
All right.

46

00:02:30.360  -->  00:02:34.560
Choose me that it's beautiful.

47

00:02:34.560  -->  00:02:35.450
All right.

48

00:02:35.910  -->  00:02:48.060
So I'm going to show you a quick trick trick here where we if we delete a user we want also one to lead

49

00:02:48.690  -->  00:02:50.850
the polls as well.

50

00:02:50.850  -->  00:02:54.040
So if we do that we need to create some type of constraint.

51

00:02:54.060  -->  00:02:55.760
But we're going to do the lead on the right.

52

00:02:55.870  -->  00:03:02.540
I want to show you how to create a constraint Basically way of allowable marae.

53

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:07.500
So every time we delete a user automatically is going to delete the relationship that's going to be

54

00:03:07.500  -->  00:03:11.220
pretty awesome for you to understand what we're going to do that later right.

55

00:03:11.220  -->  00:03:14.820
Because right now we don't have any pools for users.

56

00:03:14.820  -->  00:03:15.450
All right.

57

00:03:15.900  -->  00:03:20.710
So we have to create that relationship later.

58

00:03:20.710  -->  00:03:23.420
All right so we have the migration here.

59

00:03:23.700  -->  00:03:27.720
We can go ahead and migrate this.

60

00:03:27.720  -->  00:03:33.800
So it is going to be Orison Ortiz and I agree.

61

00:03:34.440  -->  00:03:36.860
Let's double check this real quick to see if everything is good.

62

00:03:36.900  -->  00:03:39.090
User ID category ID.

63

00:03:39.390  -->  00:03:41.750
Everything looks OK.

64

00:03:41.930  -->  00:03:44.020
There we go migrating.

65

00:03:44.400  -->  00:03:50.430
All right we can check the database for it and refresh.

66

00:03:51.120  -->  00:03:54.990
All right so refreshing is taking a little bit I don't know what's going on with my

67

00:03:57.870  -->  00:03:58.990
computer.

68

00:03:59.190  -->  00:04:03.050
As you can see all of this is in there.

69

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:03.750
All right.

70

00:04:03.750  -->  00:04:04.620
Pretty cool stuff.

71

00:04:04.620  -->  00:04:05.000
All right.

72

00:04:05.010  -->  00:04:07.170
So on the next election we're going to continue with his take here
