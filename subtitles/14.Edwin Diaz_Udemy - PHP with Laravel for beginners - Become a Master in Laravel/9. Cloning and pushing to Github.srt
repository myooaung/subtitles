1

00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:00,630
All right.

2

00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:04,400
Welcome back my students so let's go back to get help.

3

00:00:04,410  -->  00:00:04,990
All right.

4

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:09,730
And we have a project right here called good course.

5

00:00:09,840  -->  00:00:11,390
Now I created a new project.

6

00:00:11,400  -->  00:00:16,920
I also want to show you a new repository I also want to show you how to delete them from here.

7

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:22,670
So let's say I created this I created this Claribel proj repository and I wanted to lead.

8

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:25,500
I go to settings and I just delete it right here.

9

00:00:25,590  -->  00:00:25,940
All right.

10

00:00:25,940  -->  00:00:34,230
And I type in the name Clarabelle and when I type in the name you can see that this gets that you can

11

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:37,660
click on it if you don't type it in and you can click on it.

12

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:38,050
All right.

13

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:39,110
THE LEAD.

14

00:00:39,330  -->  00:00:39,780
Beautiful.

15

00:00:39,810  -->  00:00:40,770
Delete it now.

16

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:45,390
All right so we have this good course that we created like to lecture two lectures ago.

17

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:46,100
All right.

18

00:00:46,290  -->  00:00:53,910
So that's the repository we're going to grab the you are L. And we're going to go to learning good right

19

00:00:53,910  -->  00:00:54,800
here.

20

00:00:55,320  -->  00:01:00,960
Let's go to let's go to Ed in the browser in the terminal.

21

00:01:01,020  -->  00:01:04,480
So the CD learning good.

22

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:06,330
All right.

23

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:08,220
So reading say here we're going to clone this.

24

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:15,150
We're going to use a command called clone get clone based out yourself that way is cloning if you do

25

00:01:15,160  -->  00:01:25,910
ls you can see that new get cores directory there so we can switch to that directory get seated Get

26

00:01:25,980  -->  00:01:26,880
course.

27

00:01:26,910  -->  00:01:33,900
Now if you check this out rectories empty right now if we do clear and you do get status

28

00:01:36,480  -->  00:01:40,230
the first thing that you're going to notice is that gear is already initialized.

29

00:01:40,230  -->  00:01:41,080
So if I do.

30

00:01:41,080  -->  00:01:51,000
LS hyphen a lathe we can see that I get file was actually imported from or export it out from the repository

31

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:52,700
on line and get help.

32

00:01:52,710  -->  00:01:53,110
All right.

33

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:54,870
So now look at this.

34

00:01:54,870  -->  00:02:01,870
So now if I want to I'm going to create a file here touch and that's actually a mail by the way.

35

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:04,980
That's what I got in this good course directory.

36

00:02:04,980  -->  00:02:06,840
But now look at this good.

37

00:02:06,890  -->  00:02:09,650
And we add everything.

38

00:02:09,690  -->  00:02:11,280
Good comment.

39

00:02:11,780  -->  00:02:13,040
We commend it.

40

00:02:13,440  -->  00:02:22,890
And we're just going to say created new age the e-mail indicates that the M-L file committed now we're

41

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:28,450
ready to push this to their own line to this repository right here.

42

00:02:28,470  -->  00:02:28,800
All right.

43

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:30,950
Right now it does not show anything.

44

00:02:31,110  -->  00:02:36,300
It shows you this quick set up screen because it doesn't have any any files.

45

00:02:36,300  -->  00:02:37,640
Maybe they'll change in the future.

46

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:39,040
Right now has not changed it.

47

00:02:39,210  -->  00:02:42,170
So if I wanted to push that to get up I could just do this.

48

00:02:42,180  -->  00:02:42,570
Good

49

00:02:45,290  -->  00:02:47,910
origin Matt.

50

00:02:47,940  -->  00:02:51,210
Actually Hookham sorry get push.

51

00:02:51,210  -->  00:02:54,380
Origin is the remould is gay hop.

52

00:02:54,480  -->  00:03:02,010
That's the remote repository and you want to get push it to Master and it's going to ask you for the

53

00:03:02,180  -->  00:03:03,730
user name.

54

00:03:03,960  -->  00:03:07,300
Mine for this account is a password is this.

55

00:03:08,010  -->  00:03:11,560
And as you can see writing objects 3 done.

56

00:03:12,240  -->  00:03:22,140
Now if I come here and I refresh this you can see that that new in the mail is there and that new compared

57

00:03:22,140  -->  00:03:26,040
with the message that we created is here.

58

00:03:26,040  -->  00:03:28,470
So you click on this and there is nothing there.

59

00:03:28,520  -->  00:03:30,010
There's no contributors.

60

00:03:30,030  -->  00:03:36,510
Contributors to that far yet but people can come here they can find this link that you give them.

61

00:03:36,510  -->  00:03:41,760
All right you give them the link and they're going to find this project or you given the name of the

62

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:44,190
project they can search here.

63

00:03:44,220  -->  00:03:44,730
All right.

64

00:03:44,730  -->  00:03:50,640
And we can type in here good course and they're going to find your project and they're going to contribute

65

00:03:50,640  -->  00:03:51,720
to your project.

66

00:03:52,080  -->  00:03:53,780
All right.

67

00:03:54,960  -->  00:03:57,660
So beautiful.

68

00:03:57,660  -->  00:04:02,640
So the next lecture we're going to let a couple of more things here just in case somebody else has a

69

00:04:02,670  -->  00:04:04,740
project there and you want a country view.

70

00:04:04,920  -->  00:04:08,760
And so I'm going to show you how to do that how to go and find a project.

71

00:04:09,100  -->  00:04:12,600
Clone it in your own space.

72

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:13,080
Right.

73

00:04:13,260  -->  00:04:15,450
And then you can contribute to it.

74

00:04:15,570  -->  00:04:18,030
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
