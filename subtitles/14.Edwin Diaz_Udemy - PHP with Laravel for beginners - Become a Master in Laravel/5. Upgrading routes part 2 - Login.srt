1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,800
All right.

2

00:00:00,810  -->  00:00:01,820
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,830  -->  00:00:06,710
My students so I welcome you with this big error that we had on The Last Lecture right.

4

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:07,730
We tried it again.

5

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:11,300
And while I can I find a logging controller.

6

00:00:11,490  -->  00:00:12,620
All right cool.

7

00:00:12,960  -->  00:00:14,550
So what is this all about.

8

00:00:14,550  -->  00:00:18,000
Well we got a couple of controllers that we need to actually get.

9

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:24,000
So if I go back here to the documentation Mr. Eric here is telling us listen you need to grab a fresh

10

00:00:24,000  -->  00:00:26,010
copy of each one Charlie from get help.

11

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:27,500
All right.

12

00:00:27,840  -->  00:00:29,610
So these are the new controllers here.

13

00:00:29,610  -->  00:00:34,050
And let's just copy this one see what what we can do with it.

14

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:35,810
All right let's copy the raw.

15

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:42,510
And let's just copy this and just create this controller manually or I get lazy.

16

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:42,930
All right.

17

00:00:42,930  -->  00:00:43,700
Don't get lazy.

18

00:00:43,710  -->  00:00:48,900
Trying to create this thing and another way let's just create it like this.

19

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:51,770
Forget about BHP adducing commands or anything like that.

20

00:00:51,810  -->  00:00:53,670
This is old school.

21

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:54,420
All right.

22

00:00:54,720  -->  00:00:55,960
So controller.

23

00:00:56,280  -->  00:01:02,080
And because I'm creating a PSP file I don't need to pull the extension and Mr.

24

00:01:02,080  -->  00:01:05,290
Some not so reliable Mr BHP story.

25

00:01:05,570  -->  00:01:07,210
They are going to pay studying here.

26

00:01:07,300  -->  00:01:08,220
And let's see what he says.

27

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:11,520
Now let's see if he's going to mess around with us again.

28

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:11,870
All right.

29

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:13,020
There we go.

30

00:01:13,140  -->  00:01:14,450
That's what I'm talking about.

31

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:15,990
Beautiful.

32

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:16,320
All right.

33

00:01:16,320  -->  00:01:19,740
So let's login and win at all.

34

00:01:20,100  -->  00:01:21,090
You put your own password.

35

00:01:21,090  -->  00:01:23,460
OK don't copy minds.

36

00:01:23,470  -->  00:01:24,250
All right.

37

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:29,090
And your own username password right.

38

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:30,240
Let's do this.

39

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:32,080
And whoops.

40

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:34,970
What's going on.

41

00:01:35,430  -->  00:01:39,190
Well we get into home and we don't have a home page.

42

00:01:39,240  -->  00:01:42,690
Let's go to the index and we see that we are logged in.

43

00:01:42,690  -->  00:01:43,620
So it's working.

44

00:01:43,620  -->  00:01:44,590
All right cool.

45

00:01:44,700  -->  00:01:46,020
A GO.

46

00:01:47,670  -->  00:01:48,810
We can't log out.

47

00:01:49,050  -->  00:01:51,890
That's not nice.

48

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:53,610
All right.

49

00:01:53,610  -->  00:01:59,760
So now of course you can go back to the contagion and you can read a little bit about it and you can

50

00:01:59,760  -->  00:02:02,530
say OK what's wrong why can't i log out.

51

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:04,290
Oops.

52

00:02:04,590  -->  00:02:06,240
We can create our own logo.

53

00:02:06,540  -->  00:02:07,030
Great.

54

00:02:07,170  -->  00:02:08,690
Let's copy this guy.

55

00:02:08,790  -->  00:02:09,850
And let's go back.

56

00:02:09,900  -->  00:02:14,090
And what can we put this well in the routes.

57

00:02:14,100  -->  00:02:15,270
Right.

58

00:02:16,020  -->  00:02:20,490
Let's put it right up here somewhere right here.

59

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:21,450
All right guys.

60

00:02:21,450  -->  00:02:26,730
And I recommend to actually kind of organize this a little bit and put whatever needs to be putting

61

00:02:26,730  -->  00:02:32,530
admin putting out men and put some comments around you know try to make this look nice.

62

00:02:32,970  -->  00:02:34,350
And I leave that to you.

63

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:36,620
All right that's your job is to.

64

00:02:36,660  -->  00:02:38,090
My job is to teach you.

65

00:02:38,640  -->  00:02:41,220
But you should already know this if you are this far.

66

00:02:41,430  -->  00:02:42,180
All right.

67

00:02:42,180  -->  00:02:48,210
Anyway let's go back and let's open our application software.

68

00:02:49,230  -->  00:02:53,650
Let's go here.

69

00:02:53,670  -->  00:02:55,700
All right.

70

00:02:56,900  -->  00:03:02,230
So love me now.

71

00:03:02,550  -->  00:03:04,160
All right.

72

00:03:04,830  -->  00:03:06,620
We've got to change the redirection a minute.

73

00:03:06,630  -->  00:03:13,730
But this go here and now we can see that we are actually locked down this logo.

74

00:03:13,950  -->  00:03:17,270
And while we love that because we see this menu here.

75

00:03:17,430  -->  00:03:24,650
All right let's go and change that in the loading controller and let's change that to home page.

76

00:03:24,660  -->  00:03:26,500
I mean to the rude.

77

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:29,950
Let's go back here and let's try this again.

78

00:03:30,810  -->  00:03:36,260
Come on Mac my computer sometimes she does this.

79

00:03:36,570  -->  00:03:38,190
Don't mind her.

80

00:03:38,200  -->  00:03:39,320
All right.

81

00:03:39,960  -->  00:03:42,320
No that's not my password it's just password.

82

00:03:42,460  -->  00:03:43,990
And let's try this one.

83

00:03:44,010  -->  00:03:44,810
All right.

84

00:03:45,240  -->  00:03:46,320
Good.

85

00:03:47,070  -->  00:03:51,150
Let's try to logout and voila.

86

00:03:51,540  -->  00:03:51,960
All right.

87

00:03:51,960  -->  00:03:54,860
Logon system is actually almost ready.

88

00:03:54,900  -->  00:03:57,330
Remember that we need to copy the rest of the

89

00:04:02,320  -->  00:04:04,110
page be files right.

90

00:04:04,250  -->  00:04:06,450
The rest of the routes.

91

00:04:06,450  -->  00:04:07,240
All right.

92

00:04:07,500  -->  00:04:14,940
So we have this control is right here we need to create this little guy right here and this is the forgot

93

00:04:14,940  -->  00:04:17,100
controller page study.

94

00:04:17,100  -->  00:04:20,580
There you go.

95

00:04:21,240  -->  00:04:24,890
And no I don't want you to add them manually.

96

00:04:25,500  -->  00:04:29,340
I mean to the good yet I'll add it myself later.

97

00:04:29,340  -->  00:04:31,600
Let's go to the RAW file.

98

00:04:31,600  -->  00:04:38,800
All right this is the I forgot Raul so copy this guy.

99

00:04:39,540  -->  00:04:41,930
And let's just paste them here.

100

00:04:42,640  -->  00:04:43,240
All right.

101

00:04:43,380  -->  00:04:45,200
And we're going to do this for each of these.

102

00:04:45,240  -->  00:04:48,390
And I think we've got two more.

103

00:04:48,590  -->  00:04:51,240
That guy no more.

104

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:53,830
Make sure you got the name here.

105

00:04:54,630  -->  00:04:59,290
Discreate is Guy you BHP file.

106

00:04:59,470  -->  00:05:01,170
Go.

107

00:05:02,560  -->  00:05:03,390
So

108

00:05:08,560  -->  00:05:10,370
Cuppy This is the register

109

00:05:13,250  -->  00:05:17,430
and we go I think we got one more right.

110

00:05:18,210  -->  00:05:19,950
I was a long file.

111

00:05:20,670  -->  00:05:23,130
Let's do one more.

112

00:05:23,400  -->  00:05:24,450
This guy he said

113

00:05:33,630  -->  00:05:34,460
All right.

114

00:05:34,830  -->  00:05:36,480
So let's type this one.

115

00:05:36,480  -->  00:05:41,240
I know I know it's risky because we can make a mistake and mess everything up.

116

00:05:41,490  -->  00:05:45,080
So if you want to copy the name you're welcome to do that.

117

00:05:45,090  -->  00:05:47,220
I'm just going to take a risk and do it myself.

118

00:05:47,220  -->  00:05:54,210
We set passwords and whoops we haven't copied the role yet

119

00:05:56,600  -->  00:06:00,180
.

120

00:06:01,230  -->  00:06:04,640
There we go.

121

00:06:04,840  -->  00:06:07,150
They sit in there we're done.

122

00:06:07,800  -->  00:06:09,700
We're done with this.

123

00:06:09,720  -->  00:06:10,330
All right.

124

00:06:10,410  -->  00:06:21,210
And now remember that this file the this reroutes method here is actually giving us the routes for those

125

00:06:21,210  -->  00:06:21,850
files.

126

00:06:21,870  -->  00:06:24,810
Right for logging into and all that.

127

00:06:24,810  -->  00:06:35,040
So let's look at our list real quick and you can see the lawyer right here actually.

128

00:06:35,040  -->  00:06:35,470
All right.

129

00:06:35,500  -->  00:06:39,860
Jim registration as well.

130

00:06:39,900  -->  00:06:40,660
All right.

131

00:06:40,800  -->  00:06:41,070
All right.

132

00:06:41,070  -->  00:06:42,540
I think we're good here.

133

00:06:42,900  -->  00:06:49,020
We got our logging and password routes and it's working.

134

00:06:49,020  -->  00:06:57,240
The next thing is to actually and I think you know what we should be redirecting to add me right when

135

00:06:57,240  -->  00:06:59,850
we log in.

136

00:06:59,880  -->  00:07:01,440
It's up to you where you want to redirect.

137

00:07:01,440  -->  00:07:04,100
I think gardening is a good choice.

138

00:07:04,100  -->  00:07:07,560
All right so come here.

139

00:07:07,560  -->  00:07:12,220
Let's see if that works.

140

00:07:12,220  -->  00:07:13,010
All right.

141

00:07:13,210  -->  00:07:13,500
OK.

142

00:07:13,510  -->  00:07:16,040
But we have a lot of things to fix the young admin right.

143

00:07:16,260  -->  00:07:21,360
So in the next election we're going to keep start fixing this and make this work.

144

00:07:21,450  -->  00:07:24,970
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
