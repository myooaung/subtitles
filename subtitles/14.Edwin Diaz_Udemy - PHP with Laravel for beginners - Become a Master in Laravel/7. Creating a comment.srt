1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,320
All right welcome back my sister.

2

00:00:02,330  -->  00:00:05,540
And so we are making a lot of progress here.

3

00:00:05,550  -->  00:00:09,870
One thing that we have to start right now in this lecture is this Come in March.

4

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:10,830
I want to start on this.

5

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:16,120
I want to make this I want to use a package for this large of a collector package.

6

00:00:16,440  -->  00:00:22,970
And I also want to only show this when the users logged in.

7

00:00:23,010  -->  00:00:23,640
All right.

8

00:00:23,970  -->  00:00:28,300
So let's go back to our code and let's take a look at that.

9

00:00:28,300  -->  00:00:30,100
Let's make sure that we are there.

10

00:00:30,510  -->  00:00:31,820
Let's see where this is at.

11

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:33,770
This is where they come in.

12

00:00:33,780  -->  00:00:37,080
Is this the first comment and

13

00:00:41,280  -->  00:00:43,180
this is a form actually.

14

00:00:43,190  -->  00:00:43,890
All right.

15

00:00:44,250  -->  00:00:50,790
So this is well we're going to be converting this form into one of our form.

16

00:00:50,790  -->  00:00:59,090
All right so we're going to see form and we can actually take all these out.

17

00:01:00,400  -->  00:01:03,090
Let's use our shortcut form open

18

00:01:05,670  -->  00:01:06,120
loops.

19

00:01:06,120  -->  00:01:11,220
I think it was open form on this lecture on this copy

20

00:01:14,190  -->  00:01:14,880
form.

21

00:01:14,880  -->  00:01:16,260
There we go.

22

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:18,100
All right.

23

00:01:18,300  -->  00:01:20,190
So this is going to go to the

24

00:01:22,670  -->  00:01:28,730
man comments controller right.

25

00:01:28,830  -->  00:01:36,880
Everything else is the same except that this is going to be a tets area area.

26

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:42,520
This is going to be the body.

27

00:01:47,210  -->  00:01:48,910
OK.

28

00:01:49,200  -->  00:01:50,450
And this will be.

29

00:01:50,450  -->  00:01:51,150
Submit

30

00:01:54,000  -->  00:01:55,390
comment.

31

00:01:56,190  -->  00:01:57,670
Let's look at it actually.

32

00:01:57,690  -->  00:02:02,170
Let's also add a little bit of another attribute here.

33

00:02:02,180  -->  00:02:05,700
Called Rose just two or three rows to it

34

00:02:09,380  -->  00:02:10,920
because I think you already had three rows.

35

00:02:10,920  -->  00:02:13,120
Let me check.

36

00:02:13,140  -->  00:02:14,620
So select the has three rows.

37

00:02:14,640  -->  00:02:16,410
OK let's refresh.

38

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:20,250
And we have the wrong controller

39

00:02:20,250  -->  00:02:26,540
.

40

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:30,790
It's called pulls Commines controller.

41

00:02:30,790  -->  00:02:34,980
I remember now we were gonna call it admin but we did not.

42

00:02:34,980  -->  00:02:42,690
So its torment is now defined action pose Commines controller.

43

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:50,440
Now find Let's go out for a quick do we did that already.

44

00:02:50,460  -->  00:02:54,030
Those comments controller is a resource

45

00:02:57,860  -->  00:02:59,970
.

46

00:03:01,810  -->  00:03:04,900
Misspelling it.

47

00:03:05,640  -->  00:03:07,200
Misspelling it is.

48

00:03:07,200  -->  00:03:08,980
Post.

49

00:03:09,550  -->  00:03:11,910
We go mad.

50

00:03:12,070  -->  00:03:12,980
The touch area

51

00:03:20,470  -->  00:03:27,090
and getting so many bugs in this lecture is not even funny guys don't laugh meant that area

52

00:03:31,770  -->  00:03:34,110
is not bugs it's just myself.

53

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:39,400
Without coffee I'm just some guy on the street.

54

00:03:39,630  -->  00:03:48,600
All right so we got a converting to after so many bugs so many hiccups that we got to convert into the

55

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:49,380
form package here.

56

00:03:49,380  -->  00:03:50,230
Ok cool.

57

00:03:50,250  -->  00:03:52,900
So let's make sure that it works.

58

00:03:52,950  -->  00:03:55,890
Let's go to our controller real quick.

59

00:03:56,000  -->  00:04:00,170
Now the Post controller posts comments controller.

60

00:04:00,500  -->  00:04:01,930
Geez.

61

00:04:02,010  -->  00:04:06,620
All right requests.

62

00:04:08,240  -->  00:04:11,880
And well there we go.

63

00:04:11,880  -->  00:04:13,070
We got it submitting.

64

00:04:13,260  -->  00:04:15,490
That's pretty cool stuff.

65

00:04:15,690  -->  00:04:17,980
All right.

66

00:04:19,520  -->  00:04:21,480
All right.

67

00:04:22,920  -->  00:04:25,530
So how are we going to do this.

68

00:04:25,530  -->  00:04:36,990
Well we're going to first do this comment and we're going to say create and we're going to create this

69

00:04:36,990  -->  00:04:38,430
little bat boy right here

70

00:04:41,710  -->  00:04:43,000
make sure that we do this

71

00:04:47,540  -->  00:04:54,050
import that and also we have to redirect.

72

00:04:54,050  -->  00:05:03,230
So things here if you go back let's go back to that to pause for a quick let's just have it here available

73

00:05:03,340  -->  00:05:04,120
.

74

00:05:04,130  -->  00:05:06,670
Take all these out of here.

75

00:05:06,680  -->  00:05:12,440
Whatever we are now using is easy very easy today.

76

00:05:12,710  -->  00:05:17,610
Clogged up with so many things here.

77

00:05:17,630  -->  00:05:21,350
All right and just what we need.

78

00:05:23,690  -->  00:05:24,970
All right.

79

00:05:25,350  -->  00:05:27,670
That we need that we need that post.

80

00:05:27,680  -->  00:05:28,300
All right.

81

00:05:28,370  -->  00:05:33,380
So this is a thing we have a bunch of information that we need to send to our store Matt.

82

00:05:33,390  -->  00:05:34,020
Right.

83

00:05:34,190  -->  00:05:38,750
If you take a look we have the body but think about it like this.

84

00:05:38,750  -->  00:05:46,250
Our table has other name right there has it all three has the email is active in all those fields how

85

00:05:46,250  -->  00:05:48,480
are we going to send all this information.

86

00:05:48,540  -->  00:05:50,430
And we don't even have the fields right.

87

00:05:50,450  -->  00:05:53,380
We could create fields for it and I query.

88

00:05:53,390  -->  00:06:00,460
You know but it would defeat the purpose of keeping this simple and keeping this only logging users

89

00:06:00,470  -->  00:06:00,840
right.

90

00:06:00,860  -->  00:06:09,170
So what we need to do is pull out the information from the logging user or in some form the requests

91

00:06:09,170  -->  00:06:09,640
.

92

00:06:09,860  -->  00:06:13,880
So let's go back here and start working on that.

93

00:06:13,910  -->  00:06:15,140
All right.

94

00:06:15,800  -->  00:06:23,330
So let's create a variable here and it's going to whole the user.

95

00:06:23,330  -->  00:06:26,030
And now let's create an array real quick here

96

00:06:28,150  -->  00:06:29,890
.

97

00:06:30,910  -->  00:06:31,450
All right.

98

00:06:31,640  -->  00:06:33,180
So what is this comment going to have.

99

00:06:33,200  -->  00:06:38,970
Well we're going to have all the fields that we require in our table in our database right now plus

100

00:06:39,050  -->  00:06:42,800
ID we can get that from the requests.

101

00:06:42,890  -->  00:06:52,940
As a matter of fact we need to create some type of hitting input here so we can get that idea because

102

00:06:52,940  -->  00:06:56,180
we don't have it in the store method.

103

00:06:56,450  -->  00:07:00,680
So let's create this.

104

00:07:00,680  -->  00:07:02,710
So we got to think about it like this.

105

00:07:02,750  -->  00:07:05,820
We need to send the somehow.

106

00:07:05,930  -->  00:07:06,200
Right.

107

00:07:06,200  -->  00:07:07,930
So let's do that.

108

00:07:08,410  -->  00:07:15,090
Let's get the input here and let's make it here.

109

00:07:16,190  -->  00:07:16,570
All right.

110

00:07:16,640  -->  00:07:20,300
The name let's make him false ID

111

00:07:23,540  -->  00:07:30,920
and the value we can just make it to parse ID.

112

00:07:30,920  -->  00:07:34,960
All right so we get that in the other side.

113

00:07:36,920  -->  00:07:38,670
All right.

114

00:07:39,680  -->  00:07:41,160
So we choose me.

115

00:07:41,390  -->  00:07:42,770
So we got that cover.

116

00:07:43,280  -->  00:07:54,680
Let's get the author and we can get this from the user object and e-mail.

117

00:07:55,010  -->  00:08:01,070
We can also get that from the user.

118

00:08:01,250  -->  00:08:05,180
Remember that only uses that would be logged into the application.

119

00:08:05,330  -->  00:08:06,500
We'll be able to comment.

120

00:08:06,500  -->  00:08:07,880
All right that's how we're setting this up

121

00:08:07,880  -->  00:08:14,590
.

122

00:08:14,810  -->  00:08:23,540
All right user and this will be the photo file and the body

123

00:08:27,110  -->  00:08:29,090
and this we can get from the requests

124

00:08:30,590  -->  00:08:33,300
.

125

00:08:34,520  -->  00:08:36,480
So a lot of stuff.

126

00:08:36,920  -->  00:08:39,070
All right.

127

00:08:39,500  -->  00:08:39,830
All right.

128

00:08:39,830  -->  00:08:42,090
And you can even actually create a little flashy.

129

00:08:42,110  -->  00:08:47,690
Let's do that just in case you forgot to do this.

130

00:08:47,690  -->  00:08:52,380
All right I'm going to remind you to do this.

131

00:08:52,650  -->  00:08:53,660
All right.

132

00:08:53,670  -->  00:08:56,210
And we can say something like a comment

133

00:08:58,820  -->  00:09:00,160
flash or something like that.

134

00:09:00,180  -->  00:09:03,310
Call my message.

135

00:09:04,880  -->  00:09:07,870
Your you.

136

00:09:08,630  -->  00:09:10,790
Your message has been

137

00:09:13,760  -->  00:09:20,620
submitted and he's waiting moderation.

138

00:09:21,050  -->  00:09:22,940
Cool.

139

00:09:24,950  -->  00:09:31,870
And we can return to that right.

140

00:09:37,730  -->  00:09:41,310
We return it to actually let's return it back

141

00:09:45,430  -->  00:09:46,480
to the same page.

142

00:09:46,480  -->  00:09:48,670
There we go.

143

00:09:48,850  -->  00:09:50,770
All right this looks OK.

144

00:09:50,760  -->  00:10:02,020
Let's make sure that we import off site and make sure that you have this in your your fellow was here

145

00:10:03,380  -->  00:10:07,090
member that is active the court is going to be default.

146

00:10:07,240  -->  00:10:08,500
Zero.

147

00:10:08,500  -->  00:10:09,160
All right.

148

00:10:09,610  -->  00:10:14,780
So let's do this here let's go and test this out real quick.

149

00:10:15,250  -->  00:10:21,160
Let's get a page here a browser somewhere.

150

00:10:21,390  -->  00:10:26,170
Let's go here.

151

00:10:29,920  -->  00:10:33,740
I suppose one yeah we can go.

152

00:10:33,970  -->  00:10:34,840
All right.

153

00:10:34,870  -->  00:10:38,000
And let's also have ph be

154

00:10:41,620  -->  00:10:46,000
this guy right here available.

155

00:10:46,500  -->  00:10:49,380
All right my first

156

00:10:52,300  -->  00:10:55,910
comment.

157

00:10:56,830  -->  00:11:00,020
What happened.

158

00:11:00,120  -->  00:11:01,170
All right.

159

00:11:01,680  -->  00:11:07,000
They come in the night getting certain things trying to access a property that is not available.

160

00:11:07,140  -->  00:11:15,460
So let's go back to those comments and here maybe the photo file doesn't have a photo.

161

00:11:16,110  -->  00:11:18,840
And that could be an issue.

162

00:11:19,000  -->  00:11:28,230
So it does have a form or the user does have a photo.

163

00:11:28,230  -->  00:11:36,800
All right let's live 55.

164

00:11:36,800  -->  00:11:38,060
All right.

165

00:11:38,090  -->  00:11:41,710
Line 55 it is the photo.

166

00:11:41,860  -->  00:11:43,780
All right.

167

00:11:46,210  -->  00:11:47,430
Let's see what we got here.

168

00:11:47,440  -->  00:11:49,380
We've got the file here.

169

00:11:50,710  -->  00:11:51,550
And

170

00:12:04,910  -->  00:12:07,100
oh ok.

171

00:12:07,120  -->  00:12:08,130
The user.

172

00:12:08,350  -->  00:12:11,590
Well we have that relationship song where we have to

173

00:12:15,000  -->  00:12:19,050
go right here in the heart.

174

00:12:19,180  -->  00:12:21,070
We do have that relationship.

175

00:12:21,150  -->  00:12:27,750
Let's go back to it and let's try to submit everything we know the for Oh actually we don't need their

176

00:12:27,750  -->  00:12:32,670
requests all here what we've got to do is request data.

177

00:12:32,680  -->  00:12:38,180
We did this before we did the data array and that's why that happened.

178

00:12:38,190  -->  00:12:39,350
Let's do that.

179

00:12:39,970  -->  00:12:40,960
Let's see if we saw.

180

00:12:40,960  -->  00:12:43,510
So they show it real quick.

181

00:12:43,500  -->  00:12:49,210
Let's go back fresh and wow.

182

00:12:49,240  -->  00:12:51,970
This comment.

183

00:12:51,970  -->  00:12:53,860
It's great.

184

00:12:53,860  -->  00:12:56,350
Actually this post

185

00:13:00,570  -->  00:13:07,240
would be nice when we get some type of notification that to them before we do that before we submit

186

00:13:07,250  -->  00:13:07,530
it.

187

00:13:07,570  -->  00:13:09,850
Just we can see it.

188

00:13:10,070  -->  00:13:17,670
So right below here I can add a check for a session.

189

00:13:17,760  -->  00:13:21,820
So if he has a session what was the session.

190

00:13:21,820  -->  00:13:23,080
He was a common

191

00:13:25,540  -->  00:13:30,520
message I believe.

192

00:13:30,510  -->  00:13:30,970
All right.

193

00:13:30,980  -->  00:13:32,310
That is just

194

00:13:35,040  -->  00:13:36,080
we want to this play.

195

00:13:36,080  -->  00:13:38,240
I'm going to use the global recession

196

00:13:41,200  -->  00:13:43,960
function.

197

00:13:44,000  -->  00:13:44,950
All right.

198

00:13:45,250  -->  00:13:53,520
So let's see that works.

199

00:13:53,590  -->  00:13:56,590
Still trying to.

200

00:13:56,970  -->  00:13:57,850
Still problem here.

201

00:13:57,850  -->  00:14:09,090
I don't see it yet but let's go back to those comments and user for the file.

202

00:14:09,970  -->  00:14:16,820
And of course we have the problem because this is enough for us supposed to be File.

203

00:14:16,880  -->  00:14:19,400
All right let's go back here.

204

00:14:19,400  -->  00:14:24,770
Actually no that's in comments.

205

00:14:25,410  -->  00:14:29,960
The structure is the you know what

206

00:14:34,310  -->  00:14:38,800
we never created that field.

207

00:14:38,810  -->  00:14:49,460
So that's why we have a problem there let's actually create that real quick as BHP and make

208

00:14:52,730  -->  00:15:04,370
migration and add forward all column to comments

209

00:15:07,520  -->  00:15:12,270
table and if guys if you don't have a lot of data don't do this.

210

00:15:12,270  -->  00:15:16,420
All right just migrate refresh and do it again.

211

00:15:16,430  -->  00:15:20,440
You know like but if you have a lot of data you at the table like this.

212

00:15:20,520  -->  00:15:26,060
All right let's just do it like I don't have a lot of data.

213

00:15:26,060  -->  00:15:31,790
I don't mind doing this so I'm going to do this and I'm going to do my grid refresh on I'm going to

214

00:15:31,790  -->  00:15:43,180
come back OK I'm going to pause a video guy so I went ahead and created this here on the on the replies

215

00:15:43,220  -->  00:15:51,320
table and I did it on comments and then I did a migraine refresh and I went ahead and went to my database

216

00:15:51,490  -->  00:15:51,650
.

217

00:15:51,680  -->  00:15:54,450
Phil then the rules added the user.

218

00:15:54,470  -->  00:15:58,590
I actually went to the application register the user once I migrated.

219

00:15:58,940  -->  00:16:03,790
And then I came here in the end it does feel so that way we can log in.

220

00:16:03,830  -->  00:16:04,280
All right.

221

00:16:04,340  -->  00:16:06,800
So that's all I did and I also created a post.

222

00:16:06,800  -->  00:16:09,160
All right so we have a pulse again.

223

00:16:09,200  -->  00:16:10,830
All right cool.

224

00:16:10,940  -->  00:16:16,760
So guys get used to this this work flow is what's going to happen to you when you are developing applications

225

00:16:17,240  -->  00:16:21,680
and but a lot of them makes it really easy to see how we can just migrating create a table instead of

226

00:16:21,680  -->  00:16:26,830
dropping the table or you know it's just you know a lot easier Clarabell.

227

00:16:26,840  -->  00:16:30,730
But anyway let's go back to Paul Swann again.

228

00:16:31,580  -->  00:16:36,890
And now that we have that let's go back and make sure they're both controller.

229

00:16:36,890  -->  00:16:40,230
Is has the forward again field here.

230

00:16:40,760  -->  00:16:41,280
All right.

231

00:16:41,300  -->  00:16:44,430
And now let's try this again.

232

00:16:44,660  -->  00:16:54,410
I think this will work even though I don't mind fixing bugs

233

00:16:57,280  -->  00:16:58,730
.

234

00:16:58,760  -->  00:17:00,050
No way.

235

00:17:00,050  -->  00:17:01,520
We got the same line a.

236

00:17:01,550  -->  00:17:02,300
All.

237

00:17:02,540  -->  00:17:05,020
We got this photo file here.

238

00:17:05,030  -->  00:17:07,390
Messing with us.

239

00:17:07,460  -->  00:17:12,020
Oh that's because we could.

240

00:17:12,740  -->  00:17:13,970
This is just messing with us.

241

00:17:13,970  -->  00:17:14,990
Let's just leave it like this.

242

00:17:14,990  -->  00:17:17,040
We'll fix it in the next lecture.

243

00:17:17,300  -->  00:17:17,640
Let's go.

244

00:17:17,640  -->  00:17:20,450
I can see right now guys I can't see it.

245

00:17:20,810  -->  00:17:22,370
Submit this.

246

00:17:22,370  -->  00:17:23,340
Let's go back here.

247

00:17:23,360  -->  00:17:25,050
Good comments.

248

00:17:25,100  -->  00:17:27,080
There we go.

249

00:17:27,080  -->  00:17:28,810
All right.

250

00:17:30,290  -->  00:17:32,090
It's messing with us.

251

00:17:32,300  -->  00:17:35,630
Photo user photo file

252

00:17:35,650  -->  00:17:41,600
.

253

00:17:47,660  -->  00:17:50,690
I know this user has some type of photo software.

254

00:17:51,170  -->  00:17:55,340
For a year the number one

255

00:17:58,970  -->  00:18:00,080
actually

256

00:18:07,920  -->  00:18:16,390
let's go back here real quick to our admin and let's see something real quick.

257

00:18:16,670  -->  00:18:20,520
For users a forward it looks like our use of those in our photo.

258

00:18:20,750  -->  00:18:25,960
So let's give our user a photo I'm going to give them.

259

00:18:26,120  -->  00:18:28,680
I'm going to make myself like Rico.

260

00:18:29,300  -->  00:18:30,250
There we go.

261

00:18:30,320  -->  00:18:37,490
And now I'm going to try to do this again here and see if that was a problem because I don't like to

262

00:18:37,640  -->  00:18:42,410
leave things on done and I enter whatever.

263

00:18:42,950  -->  00:18:47,720
And it looks like you're mass's has been submitted and he's waiting moderation.

264

00:18:48,020  -->  00:18:53,660
And it looks like it worked OK so the user does I have a picture Guice is not going to work.

265

00:18:53,690  -->  00:18:54,610
Right.

266

00:18:55,250  -->  00:18:57,080
So comments.

267

00:18:57,140  -->  00:18:57,970
There we go.

268

00:18:57,980  -->  00:19:01,010
All right we got it working please.

269

00:19:01,010  -->  00:19:02,090
All right.

270

00:19:03,350  -->  00:19:06,130
Thank you so much guys and sorry for the hiccups.

271

00:19:06,140  -->  00:19:08,770
It happens and they'll get frustrated OK.

272

00:19:08,870  -->  00:19:10,500
I love you.

273

00:19:10,790  -->  00:19:11,750
I love all my students.

274

00:19:11,750  -->  00:19:12,430
I'll see you.

275

00:19:12,490  -->  00:19:15,830
Like you guys don't get freaked out when I say I love you right.

276

00:19:15,830  -->  00:19:20,150
That's just a way of saying I love my students in general.

277

00:19:20,570  -->  00:19:21,030
Thank you.

278

00:19:21,050  -->  00:19:21,380
Bye bye
