00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:07.950
All right welcome back my students so let's go ahead and edit this guy right here and come in post comments

2

00:00:07.950  -->  00:00:08.910
.

3

00:00:08.910  -->  00:00:10.870
Actually no comments replies here.

4

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:13.600
And make sure that we can send some information.

5

00:00:13.890  -->  00:00:18.210
As a matter of fact we already have all of that here.

6

00:00:19.920  -->  00:00:21.630
I'm just going to copy everything guys.

7

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:27.390
I don't plan to make this lecture longer than what it is and I going to face everything there.

8

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:29.130
And we're just going to change a couple of fields

9

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:34.750
.

10

00:00:35.100  -->  00:00:37.850
Everything else is the same.

11

00:00:38.250  -->  00:00:51.090
This would be what is a comment or reply actually like this very similar to important and this would

12

00:00:51.090  -->  00:00:52.890
be reply message

13

00:00:55.110  -->  00:01:00.980
your message your reply.

14

00:01:02.020  -->  00:01:04.580
No.

15

00:01:07.660  -->  00:01:14.120
I think that's the big ice unless we have the feeling we'll see are wrong.

16

00:01:14.490  -->  00:01:18.420
Let's not forget the photo.

17

00:01:19.760  -->  00:01:25.550
You know that was easier than the last one.

18

00:01:25.820  -->  00:01:27.320
Hey all right.

19

00:01:27.480  -->  00:01:34.920
So reply Hey this is the first reply.

20

00:01:34.920  -->  00:01:35.730
Hopefully

21

00:01:39.090  -->  00:01:39.960
it works

22

00:01:46.320  -->  00:01:46.980
of course.

23

00:01:46.980  -->  00:01:51.250
Of course of course.

24

00:01:53.220  -->  00:01:55.260
Let's not forget this little baby right here

25

00:01:58.440  -->  00:02:05.880
folks who'll integrity cannot get no answer.

26

00:02:06.400  -->  00:02:07.000
OK.

27

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:16.230
So we're missing a ID from our comment a hitting ID that we have for you see this guy right here.

28

00:02:16.410  -->  00:02:18.950
That's what we're missing for form right here.

29

00:02:19.800  -->  00:02:25.280
So instead of post ID this one should be comment ID.

30

00:02:25.340  -->  00:02:26.030
All right.

31

00:02:26.250  -->  00:02:29.140
And change this feel right here.

32

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:31.470
Comment ID.

33

00:02:31.500  -->  00:02:32.460
There we go.

34

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:36.640
Guys don't get frustrated if you can't find the problems that are as easy as I do.

35

00:02:36.890  -->  00:02:40.750
All right remember that I encounter these many times and I like bugs.

36

00:02:40.790  -->  00:02:41.180
All right.

37

00:02:41.210  -->  00:02:46.790
I like to encounter things like this because it just makes coding a little bit exciting.

38

00:02:46.800  -->  00:02:53.020
If you're creating everything and you don't and you don't have any issues or barriers challenges.

39

00:02:53.040  -->  00:02:55.380
It's not fun in my opinion.

40

00:02:55.980  -->  00:03:05.420
Hey this one will have to work.

41

00:03:06.680  -->  00:03:08.980
A common idea.

42

00:03:09.020  -->  00:03:09.520
No

43

00:03:09.760  -->  00:03:16.380
.

44

00:03:21.390  -->  00:03:22.840
That's weird.

45

00:03:23.440  -->  00:03:26.810
Let's come back here and he says Come in IDS.

46

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:29.290
No.

47

00:03:29.410  -->  00:03:31.520
See that see the area again.

48

00:03:32.050  -->  00:03:33.040
Call and come in I.

49

00:03:33.060  -->  00:03:33.890
Can i be no

50

00:03:33.890  -->  00:03:40.910
.

51

00:03:42.350  -->  00:03:42.990
It's weird

52

00:03:43.010  -->  00:03:49.390
.

53

00:03:54.820  -->  00:03:57.150
That's as we are.

54

00:03:57.150  -->  00:03:58.370
Let's just set a value here.

55

00:03:58.380  -->  00:04:06.290
Let's send one to see if really that's the case.

56

00:04:06.430  -->  00:04:07.530
That's another case

57

00:04:10.810  -->  00:04:15.300
inserted to come comment reply.

58

00:04:16.150  -->  00:04:21.930
Let's go back here and see nothing there.

59

00:04:22.200  -->  00:04:26.160
Let's go back to our comment reply.

60

00:04:26.160  -->  00:04:28.140
Make sure the comment IDs good here.

61

00:04:28.140  -->  00:04:33.930
The fillable alter e-mail.

62

00:04:34.740  -->  00:04:36.330
That's just weird.

63

00:04:37.110  -->  00:04:43.180
Why don't we just input this output and see what we get.

64

00:04:43.200  -->  00:04:43.970
All right.

65

00:04:44.100  -->  00:04:44.840
So let's just

66

00:04:50.160  -->  00:04:53.060
oh that's what we're missing right here.

67

00:04:53.670  -->  00:04:55.940
Of course guys come on.

68

00:04:56.010  -->  00:04:57.600
There we go.

69

00:04:57.990  -->  00:04:59.780
Let's check it out.

70

00:05:00.810  -->  00:05:02.400
All right.

71

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:04.620
Right.

72

00:05:04.800  -->  00:05:09.540
Yeah.

73

00:05:09.540  -->  00:05:13.040
Really.

74

00:05:15.960  -->  00:05:18.150
Well we have a constraint problem here.

75

00:05:18.510  -->  00:05:28.300
And he's saying that this is a big problem but I think the reply was added No it wasn't it.

76

00:05:29.430  -->  00:05:33.000
Let's check it in sort of to come he replies

77

00:05:44.800  -->  00:05:46.440
coming I d there

78

00:05:46.460  -->  00:05:52.670
.

79

00:05:57.990  -->  00:06:00.110
Let's see we get to come in ID.

80

00:06:00.430  -->  00:06:00.750
They're

81

00:06:06.190  -->  00:06:10.980
supposed to be coming from the requests.

82

00:06:10.980  -->  00:06:13.850
I want to see but oh ok.

83

00:06:13.980  -->  00:06:18.000
I think I have an idea what the problem is.

84

00:06:18.000  -->  00:06:20.560
Let's go back post.

85

00:06:20.670  -->  00:06:25.170
We have this value here that we're not supposed to have.

86

00:06:25.160  -->  00:06:26.120
All right.

87

00:06:26.670  -->  00:06:33.260
So Laura Bush is protecting those guys and comment.

88

00:06:33.470  -->  00:06:37.180
There we go.

89

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:40.950
All right let's check it out now.

90

00:06:41.470  -->  00:06:43.730
There we go.

91

00:06:45.180  -->  00:06:51.270
And while I I.D. coming I say it is active zero.

92

00:06:51.870  -->  00:06:54.410
And you can go and kiss.

93

00:06:54.870  -->  00:06:59.190
Well that's OK.

94

00:06:59.190  -->  00:07:00.070
All right guys.

95

00:07:00.150  -->  00:07:01.590
It's been a pleasure.

96

00:07:01.590  -->  00:07:04.330
You know bugging you I mean courting with you.

97

00:07:04.350  -->  00:07:07.490
I'll see you in the next lecture.
