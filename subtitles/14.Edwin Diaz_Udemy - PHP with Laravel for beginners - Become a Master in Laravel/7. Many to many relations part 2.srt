1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:05,770
All right welcome back my students another we have our migrations right we need to migrate this.

2

00:00:06,150  -->  00:00:09,340
And let's just say BHB autism I agree.

3

00:00:09,380  -->  00:00:11,500
Let's just do that with migration.

4

00:00:11,610  -->  00:00:17,100
In my case I have migrated everything I've been playing around with my migrations so I have no data

5

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:17,920
guys.

6

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:18,950
Oops.

7

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:21,080
Make sure you have some data.

8

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:21,820
All right.

9

00:00:21,840  -->  00:00:25,620
And here we go.

10

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:28,310
Let me just create my user real quick guys.

11

00:00:28,620  -->  00:00:34,150
All right you can forward the video if you want if you don't want to see me or hear me.

12

00:00:35,100  -->  00:00:39,750
And Elisha's do coring faculty.

13

00:00:39,930  -->  00:00:45,760
I'm going to do a really quick guys probably doesn't even get to be my e-mail or all just going to do

14

00:00:45,760  -->  00:00:47,860
a really quickly does that say.

15

00:00:48,110  -->  00:00:49,690
All right now let's create.

16

00:00:49,690  -->  00:00:56,670
Let's pull some data for our roles so let's just create two rules and I create a rule called administrator

17

00:00:56,690  -->  00:00:57,620
.

18

00:00:58,960  -->  00:00:59,800
OK.

19

00:01:00,180  -->  00:01:01,720
And no date stamp.

20

00:01:01,720  -->  00:01:03,490
I don't we don't need that right now.

21

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:13,300
Oops I forgot we need to insert another one so insert and the other one would be subscriber.

22

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:17,460
OK there we go.

23

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:20,570
Now the user this another user right.

24

00:01:20,910  -->  00:01:26,490
So we can let's call this guy what do you want to call this guy Peter.

25

00:01:26,640  -->  00:01:28,020
That's a good name.

26

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:37,630
Peter and he works according faculty for him which is my web site guys remember that.

27

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:38,140
All right.

28

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:41,190
And his password is the same as mine which is a really bad idea.

29

00:01:41,210  -->  00:01:47,550
It doesn't matter because it's hashed is not I'm just joking around guys.

30

00:01:47,550  -->  00:01:48,260
All right.

31

00:01:48,570  -->  00:01:49,010
Beautiful.

32

00:01:49,020  -->  00:01:54,000
So now we got to go to we have the rules and we have the users right.

33

00:01:54,840  -->  00:01:59,240
Now let's go to roll user which is a pivot table and we're going to insert some data here.

34

00:01:59,350  -->  00:02:05,440
We for the user one we've got to make this guy a administrator.

35

00:02:06,010  -->  00:02:06,800
OK.

36

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:15,780
And for the user to use or two we're going to meet these guys will scriber simple look there.

37

00:02:15,810  -->  00:02:16,700
All right.

38

00:02:17,190  -->  00:02:22,840
Because remember the rules here the subscribers know as I has identity or two.

39

00:02:23,070  -->  00:02:30,150
So that's why we went to the pivot table and plays the number two in there.

40

00:02:30,150  -->  00:02:31,210
All right.

41

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:32,130
All right.

42

00:02:32,130  -->  00:02:33,030
Don't worry about this.

43

00:02:33,030  -->  00:02:36,010
This is just the ID for the wrecker in the pivot table.

44

00:02:36,010  -->  00:02:38,940
But this is why it counts right here.

45

00:02:40,140  -->  00:02:40,880
OK.

46

00:02:41,220  -->  00:02:41,960
Beautiful.

47

00:02:42,210  -->  00:02:45,510
So now let's go back to the application.

48

00:02:45,530  -->  00:02:49,510
Well is not an application yet but it's getting there right.

49

00:02:50,170  -->  00:02:53,310
All right.

50

00:02:54,290  -->  00:03:00,990
Now we need to define the relationship in the model right here in the role model actually in the user

51

00:03:01,000  -->  00:03:01,240
.

52

00:03:01,380  -->  00:03:03,930
Oops.

53

00:03:06,040  -->  00:03:06,530
OK.

54

00:03:06,530  -->  00:03:13,940
It was a public function and roles.

55

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:17,160
Me and we'll get no return.

56

00:03:17,160  -->  00:03:20,930
This belongs to many.

57

00:03:21,030  -->  00:03:24,100
We go app backslash.

58

00:03:24,140  -->  00:03:26,170
Full rule.

59

00:03:26,870  -->  00:03:28,520
OK.

60

00:03:28,770  -->  00:03:30,380
That's beautiful isn't it.

61

00:03:30,390  -->  00:03:32,250
Now everything is set up.

62

00:03:32,250  -->  00:03:32,650
All right.

63

00:03:32,670  -->  00:03:35,510
Now we are able to pull this information from there.

64

00:03:35,610  -->  00:03:39,030
As a matter of fact I should leave it to you to actually pull it.

65

00:03:39,330  -->  00:03:42,040
Super simple we have been doing it all this time.

66

00:03:42,060  -->  00:03:42,740
All right.

67

00:03:42,990  -->  00:03:44,190
This is super simple stuff.

68

00:03:44,190  -->  00:03:47,650
So if you want to pool information you are welcome to do it.

69

00:03:47,700  -->  00:03:51,760
I just paused the video and try to do it yourself.

70

00:03:51,770  -->  00:03:52,350
All right.

71

00:03:52,560  -->  00:03:53,630
I'm going to do it in this video.

72

00:03:53,640  -->  00:03:55,660
But just pause it and try to do it.

73

00:03:56,070  -->  00:03:58,420
All right so let's go to Roger real quick.

74

00:03:58,440  -->  00:04:03,660
I hope you a video and try it because it's super cool and you know in a lot if you're trying to figure

75

00:04:03,660  -->  00:04:04,360
that out.

76

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:08,420
So many to many relationship will create a route.

77

00:04:08,430  -->  00:04:12,360
Real quick and we're going to do.

78

00:04:14,080  -->  00:04:15,920
We're going to say.

79

00:04:16,700  -->  00:04:17,360
All right.

80

00:04:17,460  -->  00:04:27,020
When I try to pull out the user number would ID or whatever I want to pull out the roll of that out

81

00:04:27,070  -->  00:04:28,570
of that user.

82

00:04:29,160  -->  00:04:31,160
All right.

83

00:04:32,850  -->  00:04:33,810
Beautiful.

84

00:04:33,810  -->  00:04:37,220
So now here we're going to grab it.

85

00:04:37,230  -->  00:04:46,050
We're going to find the user finder user number one ngi the user's roles.

86

00:04:46,220  -->  00:04:48,020
You like that.

87

00:04:49,860  -->  00:04:51,380
Or we can do this

88

00:04:54,600  -->  00:04:55,190
right here.

89

00:04:55,210  -->  00:05:00,040
Let's this tool for each.

90

00:05:00,090  -->  00:05:08,180
Actually better do it this way it makes more sense user roles as role.

91

00:05:08,370  -->  00:05:13,800
And now here we can say we turn.

92

00:05:14,310  -->  00:05:15,860
We're just going to return one value array

93

00:05:18,510  -->  00:05:19,920
actually wrong name

94

00:05:23,100  -->  00:05:24,400
and there we go.

95

00:05:24,570  -->  00:05:27,060
So a user wants to have an administrator role.

96

00:05:27,240  -->  00:05:32,960
Let's find out how we made our application really cool right now.

97

00:05:32,950  -->  00:05:39,330
Well our little function I do because we have the request in the on top and the you are l the ID requests

98

00:05:39,330  -->  00:05:39,890
right.

99

00:05:40,140  -->  00:05:51,000
So we could say something like user 1 all answer as you can see we get administrator but if we change

100

00:05:51,000  -->  00:05:56,210
this to to enter user number 2.

101

00:05:56,240  -->  00:06:02,460
Oh the reason why we are now getting that is because we are returning one value here.

102

00:06:02,460  -->  00:06:12,510
And actually I'm sorry it does not it is because we didn't make our application dynamic like I thought

103

00:06:12,510  -->  00:06:14,480
it was.

104

00:06:15,210  -->  00:06:20,890
And we go and here now we are in business.

105

00:06:20,890  -->  00:06:30,060
Answer as you can see user number two is a subscriber and the user number one is an administrator.

106

00:06:30,090  -->  00:06:34,740
So we pull in the roll out of their user which is really really cool.

107

00:06:34,740  -->  00:06:41,700
Now let me show you something else you can pool out there all ideas but you can also do this we can

108

00:06:41,700  -->  00:06:42,940
find it.

109

00:06:43,150  -->  00:06:43,620
All right.

110

00:06:43,620  -->  00:06:45,000
And watch this.

111

00:06:45,150  -->  00:06:51,420
We can find the rules right and we can use a method instead.

112

00:06:51,420  -->  00:06:52,460
All right.

113

00:06:52,770  -->  00:06:56,380
The model and you do this order by.

114

00:06:57,540  -->  00:07:04,410
And you can order by name or like say whatever you want to order by id descending or something like

115

00:07:04,410  -->  00:07:06,000
that whatever.

116

00:07:06,660  -->  00:07:09,680
And then you can come here and do this get.

117

00:07:10,870  -->  00:07:12,430
OK.

118

00:07:14,030  -->  00:07:16,880
Whoops I should have left and right there for you.

119

00:07:17,700  -->  00:07:19,110
And we can return the user

120

00:07:21,750  -->  00:07:26,380
array or the roll right but you get my point re

121

00:07:29,870  -->  00:07:31,400
look at that.

122

00:07:31,580  -->  00:07:32,740
All right.

123

00:07:32,760  -->  00:07:41,240
So we're returning the all completely in there and just doing that by Lidice order descend by id descending

124

00:07:41,360  -->  00:07:42,300
.

125

00:07:42,410  -->  00:07:43,490
All right.

126

00:07:43,860  -->  00:07:44,990
Pretty cool stuff.

127

00:07:45,240  -->  00:07:50,040
Anyway I want to thank you for watching this lecture I hope you learn a lot and I hope you like Larabee

128

00:07:50,040  -->  00:07:51,090
like I do.

129

00:07:51,360  -->  00:07:57,800
Larabee is going to help us actually make a lot of really cool Vance applications out there right.

130

00:07:57,810  -->  00:08:07,320
Remember that we can also do the deed chaining or right in constraints like does with most with all

131

00:08:07,320  -->  00:08:14,520
the relationships we can do the Order By OK we can always do this constraint out there with these relationships

132

00:08:14,520  -->  00:08:21,070
so I don't think just because I do a we one relationship you can do it with the other keep trying different

133

00:08:21,360  -->  00:08:27,750
the methods that you see me try and in one side try to with the other side see how you can make your

134

00:08:27,750  -->  00:08:35,170
own things your own queries and relationships and just try just experiment a little bit.

135

00:08:35,190  -->  00:08:35,700
OK.

136

00:08:35,700  -->  00:08:36,510
Get out of the.

137

00:08:36,620  -->  00:08:36,980
Don't.

138

00:08:36,990  -->  00:08:37,890
Don't worry.

139

00:08:37,890  -->  00:08:41,610
Don't wait for me to do things right.

140

00:08:41,640  -->  00:08:43,480
Try doing yourself a swell.

141

00:08:43,500  -->  00:08:46,710
All right thank you so much for watching this lecture and.

142

00:08:46,770  -->  00:08:47,550
See you in the next one.

143

00:08:47,550  -->  00:08:48,560
Take care.
