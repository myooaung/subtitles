00:00:00.360  -->  00:00:05.430
All right welcome back my student so our application is taking form we're going to replay some data

2

00:00:05.430  -->  00:00:10.380
here that what we can get back to our comments right because that's our main goal here.

3

00:00:10.410  -->  00:00:18.570
So let's go real quick to our post page and the story place and some other stuff.

4

00:00:18.690  -->  00:00:28.890
So here says by we're going to replace this with the owner of the posts pose user name.

5

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:32.240
Hopefully we'll get that relationship and post.

6

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:40.310
We don't have that relationship so let's create a relationship pools function user

7

00:00:43.890  -->  00:00:47.520
and return.

8

00:00:48.090  -->  00:00:48.690
This

9

00:00:52.410  -->  00:00:55.140
belongs to the user.

10

00:00:55.140  -->  00:00:59.140
Let's see if we have that set up.

11

00:01:00.260  -->  00:01:07.860
OK let's check it out real quick.

12

00:01:08.580  -->  00:01:10.910
All we're really clear in that.

13

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:12.770
So as we have it available guys.

14

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:14.170
Whoops my bad.

15

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:16.200
So we do have it available.

16

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:18.010
We already set that up.

17

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:21.100
So you can see their change to that.

18

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:22.280
Cool.

19

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:23.450
All right.

20

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:27.480
So date posted on.

21

00:01:28.460  -->  00:01:37.390
We can put some really cool dates here so I'm going to post it.

22

00:01:38.250  -->  00:01:49.380
Post created this use carboned for this so we're going to see a diff for humans.

23

00:01:49.380  -->  00:01:50.780
And guys remember this.

24

00:01:50.930  -->  00:01:53.580
There are a lot of mentors I just like to use this one.

25

00:01:54.180  -->  00:01:58.590
Well there are a line you can format that day however you want.

26

00:01:59.040  -->  00:02:00.210
Let's replace that picture

27

00:02:06.590  -->  00:02:13.960
pose for all file.

28

00:02:16.160  -->  00:02:16.910
We go.

29

00:02:17.150  -->  00:02:25.950
Let's get this let's get some content here.

30

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:39.080
And this would be Post body.

31

00:02:39.100  -->  00:02:41.620
OK.

32

00:02:41.780  -->  00:02:47.430
We don't have a lot of current polls of body or description for these polls right.

33

00:02:47.430  -->  00:02:50.300
All right so now we've got to that comment this is really good.

34

00:02:50.300  -->  00:03:00.090
Now we could put all categories in here too if you want to do that so that's that's static right here

35

00:03:00.090  -->  00:03:01.280
actually.

36

00:03:01.860  -->  00:03:03.900
We probably can work on down and that's your feature.

37

00:03:03.900  -->  00:03:08.990
My main goal on this section here is our comments.

38

00:03:09.000  -->  00:03:09.600
All right.

39

00:03:09.870  -->  00:03:15.390
So if you want to have an let me see that's the

40

00:03:18.450  -->  00:03:23.940
if you want to have categories you can.

41

00:03:23.940  -->  00:03:25.420
All right.

42

00:03:26.250  -->  00:03:29.800
Let's go back to.

43

00:03:31.560  -->  00:03:32.490
We have categories.

44

00:03:32.490  -->  00:03:35.900
Boy if you want to show them that's up to you for now.

45

00:03:35.910  -->  00:03:38.520
Later on we will do them for sure.

46

00:03:38.520  -->  00:03:46.210
We can go back to adenine layouts and post and you can see that we have them somewhere here blog category's

47

00:03:46.220  -->  00:03:46.560
OK

48

00:03:47.600  -->  00:03:52.250
.

49

00:03:56.990  -->  00:03:59.590
There we go.

50

00:04:01.110  -->  00:04:01.410
OK.

51

00:04:01.410  -->  00:04:03.160
This is the blog sidebar widgets.

52

00:04:03.170  -->  00:04:04.700
All right.

53

00:04:05.760  -->  00:04:12.630
So if you want them this is where you would put take this back over there and create some type of another

54

00:04:12.630  -->  00:04:17.940
yield yield maybe a sidebar and take it in in the post.

55

00:04:17.940  -->  00:04:19.010
All right.

56

00:04:19.580  -->  00:04:23.490
And we see it right here somewhere down here.

57

00:04:23.490  -->  00:04:26.670
All right so that's up to you if you want to do that now.

58

00:04:26.700  -->  00:04:28.280
