00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.520
All right welcome back to my students.

2

00:00:01.540  -->  00:00:06.730
So before we go to the controller I think we should actually have put a password in our form right.

3

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:14.430
But at the same time we also have to make sure that our evaluations are are good because our validation

4

00:00:14.430  -->  00:00:19.350
is passed because we don't want to actually be able to submit a form that is missing a field or anything

5

00:00:19.350  -->  00:00:21.220
like that right.

6

00:00:21.240  -->  00:00:27.470
So let's go to our form real quick and this create a password field that

7

00:00:30.760  -->  00:00:32.200
gets filled.

8

00:00:32.770  -->  00:00:35.300
Oops.

9

00:00:36.420  -->  00:00:47.130
Let's make this a password method Mantid real quick and replace with password of course.

10

00:00:47.130  -->  00:00:48.340
Take them all out of there.

11

00:00:48.330  -->  00:00:51.120
We don't need a default password

12

00:00:54.660  -->  00:00:56.870
right.

13

00:00:58.610  -->  00:01:00.270
OK.

14

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:04.650
Let's go back.

15

00:01:04.920  -->  00:01:07.860
There we go.

16

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:09.240
All right cool.

17

00:01:09.300  -->  00:01:18.500
So once we have that the next step would be to make sure that we get or all of these data.

18

00:01:18.540  -->  00:01:30.840
So let's just say enter data for Jose and Jose courting faculty makes sure that this guy he's role is

19

00:01:31.050  -->  00:01:38.460
my database is empty right now but actually I'm going to fill it up right now.

20

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:43.140
Give me one second and pull some data in my database.

21

00:01:43.140  -->  00:01:48.930
I had to do a migrate refresh when you guys weren't looking because I have some type of issue with my

22

00:01:49.590  -->  00:01:50.100
computer.

23

00:01:50.100  -->  00:01:51.000
But anyway.

24

00:01:51.000  -->  00:01:52.300
So we got the data right.

25

00:01:52.830  -->  00:01:54.140
Now we got the password.

26

00:01:54.330  -->  00:01:58.740
If for some reason we go here and we type in Jose

27

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:07.200
or I make him active and some crazy password we do this we get these data returned.

28

00:02:07.200  -->  00:02:07.890
Right.

29

00:02:08.160  -->  00:02:09.300
So we're doing good.

30

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:11.800
We can get that data back in the controller.

31

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:15.370
So we go back to the controller we're returning that data so we can see.

32

00:02:15.810  -->  00:02:25.410
All right so now we would like to create a to make sure that this form does not get sent where empty

33

00:02:25.410  -->  00:02:26.510
data to the database right.

34

00:02:26.520  -->  00:02:28.200
So let's create our requests.

35

00:02:28.350  -->  00:02:29.820
So let's go here.

36

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:37.870
If you guys remember BHB areason if you don't remember the name you just type in BHB already and we're

37

00:02:37.870  -->  00:02:39.480
going to make a request.

38

00:02:39.480  -->  00:02:40.660
You can see that.

39

00:02:40.970  -->  00:02:41.380
All right.

40

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:46.760
And if you want to find out by the convention if I can get my

41

00:02:49.830  -->  00:02:53.420
my actually my terminal down that would be nice.

42

00:02:53.640  -->  00:02:56.610
If you want to know the convention you can see it right here.

43

00:02:56.610  -->  00:02:56.890
All right.

44

00:02:56.890  -->  00:03:10.950
Kim OK's So let's clear let's do BHP Arty's and make requests and we're going to say users requests

45

00:03:15.550  -->  00:03:20.010
users or we can use or

46

00:03:24.070  -->  00:03:29.800
we can be a little more descriptive user that create requests.

47

00:03:30.570  -->  00:03:34.730
OK if we want to.

48

00:03:35.340  -->  00:03:41.200
But since we can't use this in the edit as well.

49

00:03:41.220  -->  00:03:42.100
All right.

50

00:03:42.430  -->  00:03:43.430
I have the same fields.

51

00:03:43.440  -->  00:03:45.320
We can use going to make it like this.

52

00:03:45.330  -->  00:03:46.420
All right cool.

53

00:03:46.440  -->  00:03:50.460
So let's synchronizes real quick.

54

00:03:50.910  -->  00:03:55.240
You guys probably don't have to synchronize like me.

55

00:03:55.560  -->  00:03:56.320
All right.

56

00:03:56.880  -->  00:04:00.680
Guys if you wanted to commit any time go ahead and do that.

57

00:04:00.690  -->  00:04:02.090
All right.

58

00:04:02.100  -->  00:04:05.650
Right now we're just going to authorize this.

59

00:04:05.780  -->  00:04:07.180
We're going to set some rules here.

60

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:11.900
OK.

61

00:04:11.910  -->  00:04:13.980
We're going to say the name

62

00:04:19.020  -->  00:04:25.650
is hoops required.

63

00:04:26.570  -->  00:04:26.910
Guys.

64

00:04:26.940  -->  00:04:30.450
And I'm just typing in the first line so you guys remember how to do this.

65

00:04:30.450  -->  00:04:31.100
OK.

66

00:04:31.230  -->  00:04:32.220
Go ahead and fill it in.

67

00:04:32.220  -->  00:04:38.140
I'm going to puzzle video affiliating myself as well filling all my part here.

68

00:04:38.190  -->  00:04:46.110
If you go back to your IMing at Mencken's admins controller here we have to replace this request with

69

00:04:46.170  -->  00:04:49.110
the user's requests.

70

00:04:49.780  -->  00:04:51.810
OK of course is not going to be important.

71

00:04:51.820  -->  00:04:57.000
I'll make sure that you import that clouds on top right here.

72

00:04:57.180  -->  00:04:58.280
So always available here.

73

00:04:58.280  -->  00:05:00.450
So we are injecting into these method.

74

00:05:00.510  -->  00:05:01.200
All right.

75

00:05:01.500  -->  00:05:02.420
All right cool.

76

00:05:02.430  -->  00:05:10.500
So now we go back here and we try to submit this form with no data at all create.

77

00:05:10.530  -->  00:05:12.950
He's going to redirect us back here again.

78

00:05:12.960  -->  00:05:15.360
You see that doesn't it does not get submitted.

79

00:05:15.390  -->  00:05:15.840
All right.

80

00:05:15.930  -->  00:05:18.740
Now the next step is to actually display the arrows right.

81

00:05:19.020  -->  00:05:19.650
All right cool.

82

00:05:19.650  -->  00:05:21.490
So we're going to do that in the next lecture OK.

83

00:05:21.570  -->  00:05:21.990
Take care
