00:00:00.300  -->  00:00:07.410
All right welcome back my students so it's time for us to start returning to persist data into our table

2

00:00:07.410  -->  00:00:08.070
in the database.

3

00:00:08.070  -->  00:00:08.640
All right.

4

00:00:08.820  -->  00:00:14.670
So here as you can see in the store method we are returning this data and we did this in The Last Lecture

5

00:00:14.670  -->  00:00:15.320
OK.

6

00:00:15.390  -->  00:00:19.820
So if you go back there and you try to submit something you get this data back.

7

00:00:19.820  -->  00:00:21.780
Now we don't want to just return data.

8

00:00:21.780  -->  00:00:23.310
We want to persist it to our database.

9

00:00:23.310  -->  00:00:24.990
So this is super simple guys.

10

00:00:25.170  -->  00:00:27.760
We create posts like we did before.

11

00:00:28.290  -->  00:00:29.040
OK.

12

00:00:29.340  -->  00:00:33.550
And then all we have to do is put the request in here.

13

00:00:34.030  -->  00:00:34.340
All right.

14

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:41.610
So every every everything from the polls will go in the create method and it would be persisted to the

15

00:00:41.610  -->  00:00:42.180
database.

16

00:00:42.180  -->  00:00:47.070
Now let's comment that make sure that you have this on top.

17

00:00:47.070  -->  00:00:47.790
All right.

18

00:00:47.790  -->  00:00:50.810
The namespace already entered this.

19

00:00:50.840  -->  00:00:53.940
All right of course you didn't see me because I did it before the lecture.

20

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:54.370
OK.

21

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:55.920
Well make sure that you have that there.

22

00:00:55.920  -->  00:01:00.240
All right so you click on your.

23

00:01:00.240  -->  00:01:00.850
There we go.

24

00:01:00.990  -->  00:01:01.390
All right.

25

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:03.460
Make sure that's important right here.

26

00:01:03.750  -->  00:01:04.810
Ok cool.

27

00:01:05.280  -->  00:01:08.090
So that's one way of doing it let me show you another way of doing this.

28

00:01:08.100  -->  00:01:14.100
I'm going to come in this out and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say I'm going to create an array

29

00:01:14.640  -->  00:01:19.570
or a variable am going to put all that in.

30

00:01:19.570  -->  00:01:23.860
There you go.

31

00:01:23.880  -->  00:01:33.540
All right so now what I can do is kind of say this title and this is going to be good to their requests

32

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:34.520
.

33

00:01:34.530  -->  00:01:37.110
Title like this.

34

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:38.970
All right.

35

00:01:38.970  -->  00:01:41.900
And I can do this.

36

00:01:42.660  -->  00:01:43.260
Post

37

00:01:48.820  -->  00:01:52.830
quiz all done.

38

00:01:53.160  -->  00:01:53.590
OK.

39

00:01:53.670  -->  00:01:55.570
That's one way of doing it.

40

00:01:55.590  -->  00:02:02.820
Let me show you the last way of doing it in doing this you can Stashie an object like this and you can

41

00:02:02.820  -->  00:02:08.750
say pose is equal to requests.

42

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:11.000
Actually hold on.

43

00:02:11.040  -->  00:02:14.070
Title is equal to requests.

44

00:02:14.070  -->  00:02:15.790
Title.

45

00:02:16.800  -->  00:02:21.440
And you can say those save done.

46

00:02:21.520  -->  00:02:25.700
All right what's a preferred way of doing it well depends on what you're building.

47

00:02:25.710  -->  00:02:26.050
All right.

48

00:02:26.050  -->  00:02:31.180
The less lines the better for me so I'm going to leave this on right here.

49

00:02:31.230  -->  00:02:32.140
All right.

50

00:02:32.200  -->  00:02:33.040
They all work.

51

00:02:33.060  -->  00:02:34.870
You can test it out.

52

00:02:35.240  -->  00:02:35.910
Cool.

53

00:02:35.940  -->  00:02:42.680
So once you have this there let's go back to the form real quick.

54

00:02:42.840  -->  00:02:43.940
There we go.

55

00:02:43.950  -->  00:02:45.550
And now the database is clean.

56

00:02:45.540  -->  00:02:47.730
You go to the database real quick.

57

00:02:47.730  -->  00:02:51.170
Make sure that you do a refresh array if you haven't done so already.

58

00:02:51.330  -->  00:02:52.140
Go to the polls.

59

00:02:52.140  -->  00:02:53.360
There is nothing there.

60

00:02:53.550  -->  00:03:01.090
Let's persist something BHP Antar refresh and as you can see the record was created.

61

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:02.030
All right.

62

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:03.540
Beautiful.

63

00:03:03.540  -->  00:03:10.410
Now the only problem with this is that if you saw they got redirected to the post page but there is

64

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:11.360
nothing there.

65

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:13.280
So we've got to we got to take care of that.

66

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:13.950
All right.

67

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:15.140
We'll do the next lecture.

68

00:03:15.150  -->  00:03:15.920
Thank you guys.

69

00:03:15.930  -->  00:03:16.620
And I'll see you then.

70

00:03:16.620  -->  00:03:17.480
Bye bye.
