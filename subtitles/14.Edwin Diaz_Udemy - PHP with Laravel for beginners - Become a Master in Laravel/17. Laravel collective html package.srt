1

00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:00,590
All right.

2

00:00:00,590  -->  00:00:01,860
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:04,030
Why these students hope you're having a really good day today.

4

00:00:04,090  -->  00:00:07,470
We are going to be starting the forum to create users.

5

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:08,700
All right cool.

6

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:13,170
Now before we start this I want to actually use the package I don't know if you remember but we are

7

00:00:13,170  -->  00:00:21,180
actually in one of the sections we were using in the form class the age the amount from the collective

8

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:21,240
.

9

00:00:21,260  -->  00:00:28,470
And let's do a check to see if our application has I doubt that he has it because we have actually not

10

00:00:28,470  -->  00:00:29,940
included that right.

11

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:37,110
So let's double check just in case so let's go to config and then app that BHP.

12

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:39,910
Let's see if we have that service provider here.

13

00:00:40,050  -->  00:00:41,670
We don't have it.

14

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:42,200
All right.

15

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:44,490
So we need to actually require.

16

00:00:44,550  -->  00:00:46,050
All right cool.

17

00:00:46,110  -->  00:00:51,450
So we required a couple of different ways or I'm going to show you and I'm just going to give you a

18

00:00:51,450  -->  00:00:55,470
little reminder of how we require this stuff.

19

00:00:55,470  -->  00:00:55,960
All right.

20

00:00:55,990  -->  00:01:01,240
So Claribel collective estimate.

21

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:01,760
There we go.

22

00:01:01,860  -->  00:01:04,020
Even there an auto company.

23

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:06,660
And I'm just going to show this one 5.0.

24

00:01:06,720  -->  00:01:09,910
And as you can see we could if we wanted to go to that computer.

25

00:01:09,910  -->  00:01:21,090
Our Jason File put that in there then to compose or update and include is any clue this but just because

26

00:01:21,090  -->  00:01:22,890
I want to do it in terminal.

27

00:01:23,250  -->  00:01:27,900
All right I'm going to do a composer require.

28

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:34,160
And then we're going to spell it Claribel collective enter.

29

00:01:34,740  -->  00:01:35,160
All right

30

00:01:39,110  -->  00:01:39,720
there we go.

31

00:01:39,720  -->  00:01:43,110
That's going to take a little bit to do.

32

00:01:43,560  -->  00:01:44,980
Mine already finished.

33

00:01:44,980  -->  00:01:54,860
And if you go to computer there Jason we have the let's actually do synchronize here real quick.

34

00:01:55,180  -->  00:01:57,560
Make sure that it is working there.

35

00:01:57,560  -->  00:01:58,590
There we go.

36

00:01:58,620  -->  00:01:59,920
So it is there.

37

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:05,550
All right so now all I have to do is go back and add that service provider class.

38

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:06,450
All right.

39

00:02:06,450  -->  00:02:09,540
So let's go back to La Belle collective.

40

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:17,130
Let me see if I can find it in my alarm bell.

41

00:02:18,440  -->  00:02:19,530
I had it here somewhere.

42

00:02:19,530  -->  00:02:21,670
Let me see if I have it.

43

00:02:22,950  -->  00:02:24,820
Let's go back here real quick guys.

44

00:02:24,910  -->  00:02:28,840
A collective actually a male right here.

45

00:02:29,140  -->  00:02:31,660
And all we have to do is grab this.

46

00:02:31,940  -->  00:02:33,400
OK.

47

00:02:34,350  -->  00:02:41,980
Go back to our app where the service providers are right here and just based that in there.

48

00:02:42,150  -->  00:02:43,360
And then the alias's.

49

00:02:43,360  -->  00:02:49,660
All right so we have to copy the aliases that way we can use that with these keys.

50

00:02:50,550  -->  00:02:56,810
Let's go back to where it says alias's in a space setting here like this.

51

00:02:56,810  -->  00:02:58,700
All right.

52

00:02:58,740  -->  00:03:02,460
Now if we go back to create we can actually start using that.

53

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:07,310
So let's go back create.

54

00:03:08,190  -->  00:03:17,210
And we also have a shortcut that we created on our collection to go cold form open.

55

00:03:17,760  -->  00:03:22,170
Actually I think it was open form.

56

00:03:22,290  -->  00:03:23,620
Now we don't have that at all.

57

00:03:23,670  -->  00:03:24,900
We already did.

58

00:03:25,350  -->  00:03:34,940
But if we go to BHB storage preferences we check on the live Templi section for a form.

59

00:03:35,340  -->  00:03:37,760
We just type for Main and we do everything for us.

60

00:03:37,800  -->  00:03:45,180
OK so let's let's do that.

61

00:03:45,180  -->  00:03:46,620
There we go.

62

00:03:46,620  -->  00:03:55,430
Now let's go back to our create and let's see if if he's working all right now the fine that's OK.

63

00:03:55,620  -->  00:03:57,660
We're going to just define it real quick.

64

00:03:57,670  -->  00:03:59,850
Whoops.

65

00:04:00,420  -->  00:04:05,390
We're going to call this admin users.

66

00:04:06,000  -->  00:04:10,080
And now let's go back and see if it's working.

67

00:04:10,080  -->  00:04:10,640
There we go.

68

00:04:10,770  -->  00:04:12,360
So our form is working.

69

00:04:12,360  -->  00:04:17,220
If for some reason it was not able to installed to be installed that you were going to get an error

70

00:04:17,220  -->  00:04:17,990
here OK.

71

00:04:18,000  -->  00:04:25,080
So now this is a sign that it is working you can inspect it and see that your form is there ready.

72

00:04:25,080  -->  00:04:26,250
All right cool.

73

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:28,730
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture guys.

74

00:04:28,740  -->  00:04:33,350
I hope it was pretty exciting for you and you are really motivated to keep going.

75

00:04:33,510  -->  00:04:38,010
If not I want you to think about your goals and I want you to think about the stuff that you are going

76

00:04:38,010  -->  00:04:42,560
to be creating after you finish a course that's going to motivate you to keep going guys.

77

00:04:42,610  -->  00:04:43,430
Right.

78

00:04:44,010  -->  00:04:47,260
So in the beginning just a learning process later on.

79

00:04:47,260  -->  00:04:48,330
It's just more fun.

80

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:48,890
All right.

81

00:04:49,050  -->  00:04:50,950
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture
