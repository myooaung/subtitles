1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,950
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:10,020
So I decided to come back and give some more knowledge about you know retrieving models from from your

3

00:00:10,020  -->  00:00:16,110
application using it when I decided to give some more knowledge because I think this is not just enough

4

00:00:16,170  -->  00:00:18,960
but I want to give you a little bit more so you can defend yourself.

5

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:31,260
So let's just create another round real quick and let's just say get it and let's call this find more

6

00:00:31,800  -->  00:00:35,560
right than function.

7

00:00:37,060  -->  00:00:42,650
Whoops no go.

8

00:00:42,840  -->  00:00:43,290
All right.

9

00:00:43,440  -->  00:00:51,750
So let's say for example once a retiree something again and we just say let's use it.

10

00:00:51,790  -->  00:00:57,260
Use this method find or fail this way.

11

00:00:58,050  -->  00:00:59,220
And this is a method.

12

00:00:59,220  -->  00:01:04,090
This is something that's already and application in the model right.

13

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:09,430
This final film met to try to find a record that you give it an ID right you give them the ID.

14

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:11,550
If you can't find the is going to give an exception.

15

00:01:11,550  -->  00:01:17,570
So if I try to find record number one and I try to return this let's just return it.

16

00:01:18,080  -->  00:01:26,220
Pause Well let's go to the browse and check it out real quick find Moyes to you or else that we have

17

00:01:26,220  -->  00:01:26,640
to

18

00:01:29,710  -->  00:01:32,660
write for more enter.

19

00:01:32,730  -->  00:01:36,860
We get no phone reception no square resorts for model.

20

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:37,690
All right.

21

00:01:37,690  -->  00:01:41,850
Of course we see this because we are in the development

22

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:47,570
area Ryad development stage of our application.

23

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:52,830
But if anything will we see something like this you know area like this.

24

00:01:53,600  -->  00:01:54,290
Okay.

25

00:01:54,350  -->  00:02:00,930
And we would throw out this 404 error that we can catch and we could show the user a 4 4 page or something

26

00:02:00,930  -->  00:02:01,410
like that.

27

00:02:01,410  -->  00:02:02,150
All right.

28

00:02:02,250  -->  00:02:05,660
So just know that we are able to do that.

29

00:02:05,850  -->  00:02:08,910
So now that we we we have the ability to do that.

30

00:02:08,910  -->  00:02:19,640
There is also you can also come here and let's just leave it this way here and we could do this.

31

00:02:19,670  -->  00:02:24,540
So you know this right of examples and we can use the model again.

32

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:28,050
I want you to get very used to doing this or I would guess a where

33

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:41,850
for example where users count all right and then you put it this function could take multiple Arap parameters

34

00:02:43,070  -->  00:02:46,940
will say where users count is less than.

35

00:02:47,310  -->  00:02:47,860
I don't know.

36

00:02:47,870  -->  00:02:49,230
15.

37

00:02:49,950  -->  00:02:51,300
OK.

38

00:02:51,300  -->  00:02:56,760
So you could do that and then you can change it and take how the first out of it.

39

00:02:56,820  -->  00:03:01,060
Or you could say first or fail.

40

00:03:02,030  -->  00:03:02,370
Right.

41

00:03:02,370  -->  00:03:06,550
So you can see how you can use eloquent to do a lot of things.

42

00:03:06,560  -->  00:03:07,080
All right.

43

00:03:07,220  -->  00:03:10,140
To leave this late this year if you want this file.

44

00:03:10,140  -->  00:03:11,790
Let me know I will have it available for you.

45

00:03:11,790  -->  00:03:15,680
That's why I'm creating everything in one file and I'm going to document it there.

46

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:19,150
But I want you to do the same thing I want you to write this stuff down with me ok.

47

00:03:19,270  -->  00:03:22,920
Don't just get comfortable way for me to give you the file I might change my mind I'll give it to you

48

00:03:22,920  -->  00:03:23,340
.

49

00:03:23,340  -->  00:03:26,880
I want you to write stuff down and do it yourself.

50

00:03:26,970  -->  00:03:27,620
OK.

51

00:03:27,900  -->  00:03:29,410
So that's one thing that you could do.

52

00:03:29,460  -->  00:03:30,110
All right.

53

00:03:30,240  -->  00:03:31,380
And it's pretty cool.

54

00:03:31,420  -->  00:03:36,270
Again there's a lot more methods you can find all these methods into the command station as well as

55

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:38,490
was clicking command.

56

00:03:38,610  -->  00:03:43,360
All right command and clicking on it.

57

00:03:43,770  -->  00:03:49,880
So if you go to your model right here you double click and you click command or control if you are in

58

00:03:49,880  -->  00:03:54,230
a Windows and you pull your mouse over and BHB story is going to give you a whole bunch of classes.

59

00:03:54,240  -->  00:03:59,790
But you click it while you pressing control command and you're able to go here and if you want to find

60

00:03:59,790  -->  00:04:04,710
out some more information about some other methods you click it again and you try to see OK.

61

00:04:04,770  -->  00:04:06,080
I want to go somewhere else.

62

00:04:06,090  -->  00:04:11,250
You see that really cool stuff.

63

00:04:11,250  -->  00:04:12,010
All right.

64

00:04:12,270  -->  00:04:13,070
Keep it cool again.

65

00:04:13,070  -->  00:04:13,760
Click it again.

66

00:04:13,770  -->  00:04:15,950
You got all this.

67

00:04:16,030  -->  00:04:17,190
Use me.

68

00:04:17,420  -->  00:04:19,310
Go methods.

69

00:04:21,030  -->  00:04:24,690
All these files all these classes.

70

00:04:24,870  -->  00:04:31,100
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you learn a lot on this one and know that

71

00:04:31,200  -->  00:04:33,260
eloquent super beautiful too.

72

00:04:33,480  -->  00:04:36,890
And you know very descriptive with what you want to do right.

73

00:04:37,140  -->  00:04:44,070
You get there where the way he uses counts is less than 50 and then you take out the first or fail if

74

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:46,570
you can't find it right.

75

00:04:46,590  -->  00:04:47,430
Pretty cool.

76

00:04:47,430  -->  00:04:48,900
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

77

00:04:48,900  -->  00:04:49,920
We'll try.

78

00:04:49,920  -->  00:04:51,840
I'll try to give you some more information.

79

00:04:51,840  -->  00:04:55,590
But we'll continue with eloquence because I think it's very important for you to learn it and this is

80

00:04:55,590  -->  00:04:57,280
why we are using our About the most.

81

00:04:57,480  -->  00:04:58,730
See you in the next lecture guys.

82

00:04:58,740  -->  00:05:03,780
I'm enjoying teaching it to you and I hope you're having fun and I'll see you then I see you in the

83

00:05:03,780  -->  00:05:04,180
next one.

84

00:05:04,180  -->  00:05:04,710
Take your
