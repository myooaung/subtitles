00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.700
All right welcome back my students so hopefully you got it done.

2

00:00:02.700  -->  00:00:04.200
If not do not worry.

3

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:05.640
I have your back.

4

00:00:05.850  -->  00:00:06.380
OK.

5

00:00:06.540  -->  00:00:10.870
So once we move the images let's actually create a photo.

6

00:00:10.950  -->  00:00:11.720
All right.

7

00:00:12.000  -->  00:00:17.990
So let's call the photo class and we're going to include it right now than where we actually is or is

8

00:00:18.090  -->  00:00:19.410
it is already included.

9

00:00:19.830  -->  00:00:25.760
So we're going to say it's a I think his file that we named it is it.

10

00:00:25.830  -->  00:00:31.730
Yes it is file and we can always check the create.

11

00:00:31.750  -->  00:00:34.500
Where is it.

12

00:00:34.890  -->  00:00:37.590
All right there we go.

13

00:00:37.800  -->  00:00:39.440
Cool.

14

00:00:39.450  -->  00:00:39.880
All right.

15

00:00:39.990  -->  00:00:48.540
So once we have this done then we'll grab here their photo ID in a signing

16

00:00:51.080  -->  00:00:52.470
photo ID.

17

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:56.410
Beautiful cool stuff right.

18

00:00:56.610  -->  00:00:57.180
All right.

19

00:00:57.390  -->  00:01:00.390
So what we want to do here with a user is updating.

20

00:01:00.450  -->  00:01:02.270
We don't want to do anything else right.

21

00:01:02.310  -->  00:01:09.670
We want to see a user update input no matter what you do.

22

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:13.080
And then we want to redirect back.

23

00:01:13.200  -->  00:01:18.380
So let's return redirect.

24

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:20.730
I know I know I'm misspelling it.

25

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:22.650
That's OK.

26

00:01:23.490  -->  00:01:27.640
Admin users.

27

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:28.730
All right.

28

00:01:28.890  -->  00:01:31.780
Let's see what happens here.

29

00:01:32.140  -->  00:01:45.600
By the students and editing Edwin so I'll include a picture of me and actually we have a password that

30

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:49.270
has to be filled in is active Let's make him active.

31

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:55.410
And as a matter of fact we don't let's not require the past where we don't have to get a new password

32

00:01:55.410  -->  00:01:56.560
every time right.

33

00:01:57.000  -->  00:01:59.220
So let's not do that.

34

00:02:00.180  -->  00:02:03.260
Let's go to our.

35

00:02:06.540  -->  00:02:12.340
And this is where we probably need to have a different request.

36

00:02:12.390  -->  00:02:13.460
Right.

37

00:02:14.130  -->  00:02:17.570
All right let's go back here.

38

00:02:18.180  -->  00:02:20.070
Guys you really don't have to do that.

39

00:02:20.120  -->  00:02:24.850
Create a requests all the time unless you do something really complex.

40

00:02:24.900  -->  00:02:29.400
But I wanted you know I'm also taking a paternally to show you how to do stuff.

41

00:02:29.430  -->  00:02:35.580
Right so sometimes you might see me do things the long way sometimes you might see me doing things a

42

00:02:35.580  -->  00:02:36.680
couple of times.

43

00:02:36.720  -->  00:02:41.220
That's that's just because I want you to learn all right doesn't mean that you have to do it like that

44

00:02:41.220  -->  00:02:41.920
all the time.

45

00:02:42.010  -->  00:02:42.730
OK.

46

00:02:42.750  -->  00:02:50.220
So we have included here a class A user request class that's preventing us from going further unless

47

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:51.240
we feel this in.

48

00:02:51.780  -->  00:02:56.230
And that's not cool.

49

00:02:56.580  -->  00:03:04.900
All right so if we do this BHB these and make requests I want you to get used to building this.

50

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:12.300
We're going to say users that it requires it right.

51

00:03:12.630  -->  00:03:16.820
It's just that I want this information to be engraved in your brain.

52

00:03:16.920  -->  00:03:17.290
All right.

53

00:03:17.300  -->  00:03:21.420
That's the whole reason why I keep doing the things that we learned in the course.

54

00:03:21.420  -->  00:03:22.440
All right.

55

00:03:22.440  -->  00:03:26.330
All right so we have this guy here and we're just going to 7:2 true.

56

00:03:27.060  -->  00:03:31.050
And let's go back and copy some of this stuff.

57

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:35.630
Let's take it back here and paste it.

58

00:03:35.670  -->  00:03:37.870
And let's not include the password.

59

00:03:37.870  -->  00:03:38.920
All right.

60

00:03:39.540  -->  00:03:46.170
And let's go back to our admin users and right here.

61

00:03:46.740  -->  00:03:50.590
There we go.

62

00:03:53.640  -->  00:03:54.660
Let's include it on top.

63

00:03:54.660  -->  00:03:56.370
OK.

64

00:03:57.900  -->  00:03:58.760
All right.

65

00:03:59.040  -->  00:04:03.630
So now we should be able to do something here.

66

00:04:04.590  -->  00:04:06.960
OK.

67

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:08.210
All right.

68

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:13.520
Actif let's give him a picture.

69

00:04:13.590  -->  00:04:14.580
That's it.

70

00:04:14.580  -->  00:04:20.210
There we go see the dogs there right now and that's actually give them a better picture.

71

00:04:20.210  -->  00:04:22.520
I think I have something in my desktop.

72

00:04:22.630  -->  00:04:23.990
There's Jose Fays.

73

00:04:24.000  -->  00:04:26.910
Now he's got those little blowholes holes.

74

00:04:26.910  -->  00:04:29.100
This guy looks like Jose right here.

75

00:04:29.610  -->  00:04:31.690
And less shoes.

76

00:04:32.970  -->  00:04:34.590
He's not an administrator.

77

00:04:34.590  -->  00:04:37.600
Since when Ray was making active as well.

78

00:04:37.620  -->  00:04:38.810
There we go.

79

00:04:39.420  -->  00:04:39.910
All right.

80

00:04:40.020  -->  00:04:44.410
We're getting somewhere let's get Maria to go awry.

81

00:04:44.430  -->  00:04:52.740
Let's see which one looks like Maria is on doesn't this one doesn't think this one here looks like Maria

82

00:04:54.980  -->  00:04:55.890
rightless.

83

00:04:55.930  -->  00:04:57.580
She's active as well.

84

00:04:57.800  -->  00:04:59.340
And there we go getting there.

85

00:04:59.340  -->  00:05:00.440
So we're getting somewhere.

86

00:05:00.450  -->  00:05:04.500
Guys let's look for people to see who looks like Peter.

87

00:05:04.500  -->  00:05:07.330
This guy looks like Peter for sure.

88

00:05:07.400  -->  00:05:08.490
All right.

89

00:05:08.880  -->  00:05:10.980
He's active already.

90

00:05:10.980  -->  00:05:11.890
Here we go.

91

00:05:12.060  -->  00:05:17.800
So we got the whole crew here except me and my picture Well I got I got me here but I got me twice.

92

00:05:18.060  -->  00:05:20.480
But you see this picture is kind of bigger than the rest.

93

00:05:20.490  -->  00:05:22.260
But anyway that's OK right.

94

00:05:22.290  -->  00:05:24.390
All right so I think we're doing pretty good here.

95

00:05:24.390  -->  00:05:29.620
Let's check the database real quick to make sure that those pictures are getting Surly there.

96

00:05:30.000  -->  00:05:40.340
Let's check for number three here that we just updated and called King beach between my admen.

97

00:05:40.400  -->  00:05:41.220
All right.

98

00:05:41.490  -->  00:05:43.330
So Or number three Maria.

99

00:05:43.380  -->  00:05:44.320
There we go.

100

00:05:44.490  -->  00:05:51.210
We see that she's active and she has a picture with the number four.

101

00:05:51.240  -->  00:05:59.760
So we go to photos we can see that up picture there it says war warmer for say woman.

102

00:05:59.760  -->  00:06:01.420
All right.

103

00:06:01.830  -->  00:06:05.250
So I'm got to fix that in my in my for the guys.

104

00:06:05.580  -->  00:06:08.820
I don't know why you guys don't tell me this stuff right there.

105

00:06:08.850  -->  00:06:16.980
I'm so used to just courting dad I don't even look at the spelling guys.

106

00:06:16.980  -->  00:06:18.930
All right don't take it against me.

107

00:06:19.110  -->  00:06:20.650
Just correct it.

108

00:06:20.790  -->  00:06:21.450
All right.

109

00:06:21.750  -->  00:06:23.040
OK cool.

110

00:06:23.040  -->  00:06:23.660
All right.

111

00:06:23.820  -->  00:06:27.230
So I think we're making a really good improvement here and this is taking form.

112

00:06:27.420  -->  00:06:29.550
And then you learning a whole bunch of other things.

113

00:06:29.590  -->  00:06:31.230
Really useful stuff.

114

00:06:31.230  -->  00:06:32.820
All right let's look Amaria better.

115

00:06:33.000  -->  00:06:33.330
All right.

116

00:06:33.390  -->  00:06:34.440
There we go.

117

00:06:34.440  -->  00:06:34.890
All right.

118

00:06:34.890  -->  00:06:39.670
So take care my dear students and I'll see you in the next lecture
