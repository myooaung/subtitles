00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:05.070
All right welcome back my sister and so every time we delete a user or create a user all day they use

2

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:11.100
a we don't have any feedback Re would be nice to have some type of feedback maybe like some type of

3

00:00:11.910  -->  00:00:16.770
notification on top here that says A The user has been the leader of data or something.

4

00:00:16.800  -->  00:00:17.690
That would be cool.

5

00:00:17.940  -->  00:00:22.020
So let's actually do that with sessions I already show you how to do that but I'm going to apply to

6

00:00:22.020  -->  00:00:24.420
this project or I don't want you to forget about it.

7

00:00:24.720  -->  00:00:30.290
So let's go to I mean users and right here below before we destroy it.

8

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:34.770
And I want you guys to actually apply this to the rest of your application.

9

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:40.740
We've got to do it too with it destroy method here because that's the last one we have done.

10

00:00:40.850  -->  00:00:43.620
And then I want you to apply it to whatever you want.

11

00:00:43.620  -->  00:00:44.420
All right.

12

00:00:44.760  -->  00:00:45.550
All right cool.

13

00:00:45.690  -->  00:00:56.390
So before we could however use the request to call the if you remember to call the session method.

14

00:00:56.430  -->  00:00:57.420
All right.

15

00:00:58.380  -->  00:01:05.630
We could use this but we have to inject the request right here or we could use our global function I

16

00:01:05.630  -->  00:01:14.620
guess to do that or we can use another class from Claribel called session and we can say session.

17

00:01:15.380  -->  00:01:18.350
I'm just showing you different ways.

18

00:01:18.480  -->  00:01:18.870
Delete

19

00:01:22.070  -->  00:01:22.870
delete it.

20

00:01:22.910  -->  00:01:23.650
User.

21

00:01:23.840  -->  00:01:25.090
Or something like that.

22

00:01:25.620  -->  00:01:27.720
And then you can say something.

23

00:01:27.720  -->  00:01:32.740
The user has being deleted.

24

00:01:33.690  -->  00:01:34.550
OK.

25

00:01:35.040  -->  00:01:38.850
And of course you have to include this on top.

26

00:01:39.590  -->  00:01:41.550
Arrive for SA.

27

00:01:42.300  -->  00:01:45.900
And then once you are let's go back to end it's

28

00:01:48.390  -->  00:01:52.310
here and right above here.

29

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:54.180
See above.

30

00:01:54.180  -->  00:02:02.300
Users could do this in a be danger.

31

00:02:02.320  -->  00:02:16.460
Let's just check first if if session can use this method here to check for the lead it user.

32

00:02:16.800  -->  00:02:20.880
And that's what I think we need that key.

33

00:02:21.720  -->  00:02:23.710
We go back to our means controller.

34

00:02:23.970  -->  00:02:30.110
It's good that you copy and paste it just in case so you don't make a mistake.

35

00:02:30.210  -->  00:02:41.370
So if it does have a delete a user key that session if we find the session then we can go now.

36

00:02:42.550  -->  00:02:43.610
Looking at Guido.

37

00:02:43.860  -->  00:02:44.910
So we're going to say

38

00:02:48.850  -->  00:02:51.370
we can use of we can use this global function here.

39

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:58.090
As a matter of fact we can say delete it user.

40

00:02:58.090  -->  00:02:58.690
All right.

41

00:02:58.830  -->  00:03:00.670
So two different ways of doing it.

42

00:03:01.200  -->  00:03:04.570
All right so let's delete the poor recall.

43

00:03:04.650  -->  00:03:05.370
I don't want it really.

44

00:03:05.370  -->  00:03:06.000
Maria.

45

00:03:06.180  -->  00:03:08.010
Maria is cool with those races.

46

00:03:08.010  -->  00:03:09.010
All right.

47

00:03:09.600  -->  00:03:09.920
All right.

48

00:03:09.920  -->  00:03:11.480
We could really Peter.

49

00:03:11.530  -->  00:03:13.980
Peter's not doing much here.

50

00:03:14.340  -->  00:03:18.660
And as you can see we have it where he says the user has been deleted.

51

00:03:18.690  -->  00:03:19.610
All right.

52

00:03:19.770  -->  00:03:25.110
You could if you want to give it a class

53

00:03:28.470  -->  00:03:34.610
of B.G. danger and that's just going to make a read.

54

00:03:35.640  -->  00:03:37.640
OK.

55

00:03:39.720  -->  00:03:44.740
So literally Jose I don't I don't want it that we go whoops.

56

00:03:45.000  -->  00:03:46.460
What am I doing.

57

00:03:46.470  -->  00:03:47.180
There we go.

58

00:03:47.190  -->  00:03:48.550
The user has been deleted.

59

00:03:48.870  -->  00:03:53.640
Go ahead and apply that to every of your function every functionality that you wanted.

60

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:54.110
All right.

61

00:03:54.120  -->  00:03:56.560
Where you want to go ahead apply where you want it.

62

00:03:56.820  -->  00:03:59.350
So I'm showing you how it's done.

63

00:03:59.430  -->  00:04:03.550
You are responsible for making your application the way you want anyway.

64

00:04:03.570  -->  00:04:05.910
Thank you so much for watching this lecture guys I hope.

65

00:04:05.970  -->  00:04:10.980
Hopefully you learned something new and something that will allow you to create really good applications

66

00:04:10.980  -->  00:04:11.460
in the future.

67

00:04:11.460  -->  00:04:13.480
Keep up the great work.

68

00:04:13.570  -->  00:04:14.510
Keep active.

69

00:04:14.520  -->  00:04:15.800
Remember why you here.

70

00:04:15.800  -->  00:04:20.090
Remember that this is something that is going to give you a lot of benefits in the future.

71

00:04:20.130  -->  00:04:22.370
You just have to learn it and start doing it.

72

00:04:22.620  -->  00:04:23.040
Take care
