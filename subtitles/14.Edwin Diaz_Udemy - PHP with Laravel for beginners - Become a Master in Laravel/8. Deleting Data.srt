00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:06,750
All right welcome back my students on this lecture we're going to learn how to lead in eloquent using

2

00:00:06,760  -->  00:00:09,210
eloquent Clarabell in different ways.

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:09,800
All right.

4

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:12,400
So let's just come in this hour real quick.

5

00:00:12,480  -->  00:00:14,450
Let's create a delete.

6

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:16,670
Let's just say this.

7

00:00:17,130  -->  00:00:27,980
Let's get one then we go and we're going to say delete function.

8

00:00:28,460  -->  00:00:29,440
All right.

9

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:33,910
So the first thing the first way that we are going to learn how to delete.

10

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:41,920
And let's just say post and let's just do it like this which is actually we already have the model there

11

00:00:41,920  -->  00:00:41,940
.

12

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:54,010
So let's just find Paul's number one and Malesherbes deleted this by calling them the lead method.

13

00:00:54,150  -->  00:00:55,080
OK.

14

00:00:55,350  -->  00:00:56,380
Super simple.

15

00:00:56,610  -->  00:00:59,020
So let's come here real quick.

16

00:01:00,180  -->  00:01:01,030
And we are ready.

17

00:01:01,060  -->  00:01:05,550
We have this in PH BE MY outmatch you can see there we have that in our table.

18

00:01:05,570  -->  00:01:07,910
All right we are the number two.

19

00:01:08,460  -->  00:01:11,740
So if you want to delete something that's how you do it.

20

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:12,630
Answer.

21

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:14,700
Oops.

22

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:17,820
Actually I always make the mistake of putting ID number one.

23

00:01:17,810  -->  00:01:21,240
I don't know why is.

24

00:01:21,240  -->  00:01:23,490
Go now into it enter.

25

00:01:23,550  -->  00:01:24,730
There we go.

26

00:01:25,490  -->  00:01:27,990
Refresh and that is gone.

27

00:01:28,060  -->  00:01:32,220
OK that's one way of deleting stuff.

28

00:01:32,220  -->  00:01:33,640
Let me show you another way.

29

00:01:34,380  -->  00:01:43,130
So I know some of you don't like to be writing but I am forcing you to write because I'm the instructor

30

00:01:43,140  -->  00:01:45,660
I want you to learn this stuff.

31

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:53,280
OK I want you to be very clear how to do this just from the by instinct.

32

00:01:53,280  -->  00:01:59,360
So the leading number two sort of going to say that lead to here and.

33

00:02:00,900  -->  00:02:02,990
Ok cool.

34

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:08,550
So now if you're one of the lead and it's 16 maade or you know the key.

35

00:02:08,710  -->  00:02:10,100
All right.

36

00:02:10,530  -->  00:02:17,490
We can't use the destroy method like this.

37

00:02:17,490  -->  00:02:22,710
We can destroy it and we can we can if we're going to destroy one we can.

38

00:02:22,720  -->  00:02:24,330
And let me just show you right now.

39

00:02:24,360  -->  00:02:27,750
I'm going to destroy number three.

40

00:02:27,780  -->  00:02:28,770
All right.

41

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:34,310
March is number three they're in.

42

00:02:34,590  -->  00:02:36,340
Let's see how simple this is.

43

00:02:36,380  -->  00:02:38,710
I mean if I have the browser behind me there we go.

44

00:02:38,880  -->  00:02:42,490
So I lean over to enter Let's go and see.

45

00:02:42,510  -->  00:02:45,080
And you see how easy that was right.

46

00:02:45,120  -->  00:02:47,170
Beautiful refresh.

47

00:02:47,360  -->  00:02:48,450
And he's gone.

48

00:02:48,750  -->  00:02:51,650
But let me show you how to delete multiple records.

49

00:02:51,660  -->  00:02:55,440
So now we are four and five here and we're going to have to get some data source are going to show you

50

00:02:55,440  -->  00:03:00,680
how to answer a lot of data too which is pretty cool with something called Cedar's and

51

00:03:03,390  -->  00:03:04,010
factories.

52

00:03:04,050  -->  00:03:12,010
So anyway let's go back here and let's do a couple of them.

53

00:03:12,240  -->  00:03:16,270
So I'm going to put an array here and all we got to do is put the idea of we know in.

54

00:03:16,470  -->  00:03:19,870
So four and five that say.

55

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:22,230
Now this is going to lead it.

56

00:03:22,230  -->  00:03:24,520
Remember that you can also really by Querrey.

57

00:03:24,540  -->  00:03:24,870
OK.

58

00:03:24,870  -->  00:03:33,900
You can also lead something like you can make your query like this post way using the word statement

59

00:03:33,900  -->  00:03:33,930
.

60

00:03:33,960  -->  00:03:35,330
Right.

61

00:03:35,340  -->  00:03:43,050
These were a method and you could really were whatever Where is admin is equal to zero or whatever.

62

00:03:43,680  -->  00:03:47,830
OK and you can call this like this.

63

00:03:48,090  -->  00:03:50,780
All right.

64

00:03:50,790  -->  00:03:56,460
Remember that you can do this well but I'm going to come in that hour I'm just going to make sure you

65

00:03:56,460  -->  00:03:57,420
have that.

66

00:03:57,420  -->  00:04:03,500
So let's go and try to see if we can leave everything Antar come back to you my admin.

67

00:04:03,540  -->  00:04:08,220
Now refresh and why law is Garren right.

68

00:04:08,220  -->  00:04:09,630
Super easy.

69

00:04:09,630  -->  00:04:17,570
So if you know the model you are deleting or if you know the condition you could use destroy or destroy

70

00:04:17,700  -->  00:04:18,580
we fine.

71

00:04:18,810  -->  00:04:20,930
If you know the key.

72

00:04:20,940  -->  00:04:23,150
So pretty cool stuff right.

73

00:04:23,310  -->  00:04:27,900
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in the next

74

00:04:27,900  -->  00:04:28,230
one.

75

00:04:28,230  -->  00:04:29,440
Take care.
