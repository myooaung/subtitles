1

00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:02,080
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:02,090  -->  00:00:04,930
I stood and so we got the categories working here.

3

00:00:05,140  -->  00:00:09,300
One of the things that we are missing here in this application is the ability to THE LEAD image.

4

00:00:09,300  -->  00:00:14,340
So we're going to start creating that section here where we can delete the images because we have a

5

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:19,590
couple of images that are not doing anything on our servers and we would like to delete them.

6

00:00:19,590  -->  00:00:20,290
Right.

7

00:00:20,310  -->  00:00:26,370
So just for demonstration purposes only you can look at the polls and you can see age polls has the

8

00:00:26,370  -->  00:00:28,020
categories that we create.

9

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:30,350
All right so they are working.

10

00:00:30,510  -->  00:00:32,190
Cool.

11

00:00:32,190  -->  00:00:32,970
All right.

12

00:00:33,390  -->  00:00:38,160
So let's going create a media page or photos page whatever you want to call it.

13

00:00:39,120  -->  00:00:42,890
And I don't believe we have that for them here.

14

00:00:44,310  -->  00:00:50,040
So this created media and it's

15

00:00:53,590  -->  00:00:56,820
now awry.

16

00:00:57,090  -->  00:01:02,520
This is a good time to do a commit good ad and good commit

17

00:01:06,540  -->  00:01:12,930
categories working 100 percent.

18

00:01:15,440  -->  00:01:17,220
All right cool.

19

00:01:18,350  -->  00:01:18,650
All right.

20

00:01:18,650  -->  00:01:22,290
And guys you want to be a little bit more descriptive on what you're doing and when you're working with

21

00:01:22,290  -->  00:01:29,190
a team I'm doing this just to force you to actually do it but be a little more descriptive when you

22

00:01:29,190  -->  00:01:30,330
are actually making comments.

23

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:35,520
Remember that if you're working on a team they going to see this and they wonder why in the world he

24

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:43,470
just meant with that you could say all day the categories added the L Day features and delete it and

25

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:45,050
delete features or something like that.

26

00:01:45,100  -->  00:01:46,840
Ok cool.

27

00:01:47,040  -->  00:01:50,130
Let's actually take all of this out of here.

28

00:01:50,130  -->  00:01:53,370
We're going to create is pretty fast guys.

29

00:01:53,400  -->  00:01:54,510
All right.

30

00:01:55,800  -->  00:01:56,010
All right.

31

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:07,030
We are the media here with let's do it stands and we're going to say layouts and then whoops

32

00:02:14,110  -->  00:02:19,640
content.

33

00:02:24,610  -->  00:02:28,090
All right.

34

00:02:30,950  -->  00:02:33,890
This to this table.

35

00:02:34,020  -->  00:02:35,780
What are we going to have here.

36

00:02:36,300  -->  00:02:40,740
Well we're going to have an I.D. for a picture and the name of our picture that say maybe they created

37

00:02:40,740  -->  00:02:41,710
they if you want.

38

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:43,110
That's up to you.

39

00:02:43,410  -->  00:02:44,710
OK.

40

00:02:44,780  -->  00:02:45,350
So

41

00:02:48,130  -->  00:02:58,910
the name of it and the maybe created they it's up to you.

42

00:03:00,500  -->  00:03:01,970
All right.

43

00:03:02,850  -->  00:03:09,680
And we don't of course want to see this on unless we have photos.

44

00:03:11,700  -->  00:03:15,530
I'm going to build in this already because we already know while we're going to do.

45

00:03:15,540  -->  00:03:16,260
Right.

46

00:03:16,290  -->  00:03:17,040
So

47

00:03:19,770  -->  00:03:24,650
we just know that we are going to have all this year's I'm starting from the back.

48

00:03:24,650  -->  00:03:25,100
All right.

49

00:03:25,140  -->  00:03:30,540
I'm starting from the view we should start from the controller usually but we already know this stuff

50

00:03:30,540  -->  00:03:31,570
right.

51

00:03:32,340  -->  00:03:35,630
So for those for whom

52

00:03:39,080  -->  00:03:46,950
and then we get to close it up here and I'm doing this pretty fast because I know you guys know this

53

00:03:46,950  -->  00:03:47,760
already.

54

00:03:47,790  -->  00:03:52,550
You should if not you need to watch some videos and get it down.

55

00:03:52,680  -->  00:03:53,210
All right.

56

00:03:53,220  -->  00:03:56,790
It's about time you know this stuff and very well

57

00:04:07,350  -->  00:04:11,270
forward on this story at all.

58

00:04:14,550  -->  00:04:15,420
If conditions here

59

00:04:18,360  -->  00:04:22,770
so we find the name actually

60

00:04:30,230  -->  00:04:36,000
if we find a photo this play let's play the photo file.

61

00:04:36,030  -->  00:04:37,020
And if not

62

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:45,260
actually this is going to be an image here that's fine.

63

00:04:45,300  -->  00:04:46,720
We'll we'll come back to that.

64

00:04:46,920  -->  00:04:48,380
Well this is not going to be an image.

65

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:49,380
This is they create it.

66

00:04:49,380  -->  00:04:50,210
Sorry about that.

67

00:04:50,220  -->  00:04:53,760
We already have that on top.

68

00:04:53,760  -->  00:04:55,760
All right.

69

00:04:57,540  -->  00:04:59,790
Create it out.

70

00:04:59,960  -->  00:05:00,930
All right.

71

00:05:01,620  -->  00:05:07,910
So if we have a create that we're going to show one we'll show it.

72

00:05:08,100  -->  00:05:11,640
If not then no date.

73

00:05:12,750  -->  00:05:15,000
And you might do this for the file as well.

74

00:05:15,000  -->  00:05:15,650
Just in case.

75

00:05:15,660  -->  00:05:20,680
But if we are actually going out or the images they should have something right.

76

00:05:20,700  -->  00:05:23,050
So I don't think we should have a problem with this one.

77

00:05:23,250  -->  00:05:25,420
I don't think we will have a problem with that one.

78

00:05:25,470  -->  00:05:25,770
All right.

79

00:05:25,770  -->  00:05:36,820
So let's go and create Well we don't have we have a false model here but we don't have a Fodor's controller

80

00:05:36,860  -->  00:05:43,400
I know and we can name it whatever we want for us control over media media controller OK.

81

00:05:43,610  -->  00:05:46,310
So artists make

82

00:05:50,900  -->  00:05:58,110
controller and we're not going to create it with the resource we don't need it we just need and that's

83

00:05:58,250  -->  00:06:01,040
really that's all we need.

84

00:06:01,040  -->  00:06:01,490
All right.

85

00:06:01,520  -->  00:06:10,880
So we're going to say the media's media controller

86

00:06:17,340  -->  00:06:28,010
the media's controller helps misspell something they're not.

87

00:06:29,270  -->  00:06:33,510
This is not a class.

88

00:06:33,500  -->  00:06:34,900
Here we go.

89

00:06:35,630  -->  00:06:42,620
OK then let's go to rouse real quick and make sure that we have our routes there for media even though

90

00:06:42,620  -->  00:06:44,560
we're not creating a resource.

91

00:06:44,690  -->  00:06:45,500
Let's just do it

92

00:06:48,260  -->  00:06:53,330
because we have we might in the future so admen

93

00:06:56,060  -->  00:07:01,010
media.

94

00:07:05,700  -->  00:07:08,310
Ok cool.

95

00:07:08,420  -->  00:07:15,100
Let's also fix the link in the lay out.

96

00:07:15,570  -->  00:07:19,180
Let's go to actually no.

97

00:07:19,520  -->  00:07:20,240
It's right here

98

00:07:24,650  -->  00:07:25,760
media right here

99

00:07:28,720  -->  00:07:32,320
.

100

00:07:33,160  -->  00:07:35,530
It just froze on me real quick.

101

00:07:36,330  -->  00:07:38,080
All right.

102

00:07:39,220  -->  00:07:48,660
Ad Man media and it's OK.

103

00:07:49,790  -->  00:07:56,840
And this would be a no blow page here so this is going to cost them away.

104

00:07:56,880  -->  00:07:57,570
Could

105

00:08:05,720  -->  00:08:10,280
we could give it make it for the show.

106

00:08:10,280  -->  00:08:18,660
All right let's just say ad men media overload.

107

00:08:20,220  -->  00:08:22,340
All right we'll fix that in a minute.

108

00:08:22,340  -->  00:08:23,060
We'll make it.

109

00:08:23,060  -->  00:08:25,760
We'll make a custom rule for this.

110

00:08:25,850  -->  00:08:27,590
A custom rap name.

111

00:08:27,590  -->  00:08:29,070
All right cool.

112

00:08:29,120  -->  00:08:30,860
So let's go to the controller

113

00:08:33,520  -->  00:08:37,290
that's synchronizes

114

00:08:49,870  -->  00:08:52,580
carrying public function in its

115

00:08:57,120  -->  00:08:57,620
turn

116

00:09:11,170  -->  00:09:12,580
whether we call it Fotos.

117

00:09:12,600  -->  00:09:14,310
I think we did right.

118

00:09:15,050  -->  00:09:19,130
I'm asking you but you never asked for me back.

119

00:09:19,130  -->  00:09:22,690
All right let's add this here

120

00:09:27,300  -->  00:09:29,750
and let's do this compact

121

00:09:32,860  -->  00:09:35,450
Fotos.

122

00:09:35,450  -->  00:09:37,780
All right let's see if we got something here.

123

00:09:37,820  -->  00:09:38,900
Let's refresh this.

124

00:09:38,900  -->  00:09:40,760
And of course add mean media overload.

125

00:09:40,770  -->  00:09:48,740
Now the fine let's go and find out real quick and.

126

00:09:52,290  -->  00:09:54,790
All right.

127

00:09:54,840  -->  00:09:55,330
Admin

128

00:09:58,790  -->  00:09:59,390
media

129

00:10:02,780  -->  00:10:05,040
overload.

130

00:10:06,540  -->  00:10:07,470
Oh Lord.

131

00:10:07,490  -->  00:10:09,810
And then we need to.

132

00:10:10,760  -->  00:10:16,110
So sorry my dog just came in the room.

133

00:10:16,130  -->  00:10:16,940
I had to post a video.

134

00:10:16,940  -->  00:10:17,910
But anyway.

135

00:10:18,230  -->  00:10:27,740
So let's just do this and we're going to say ass

136

00:10:30,940  -->  00:10:35,470
we'll give it a real name.

137

00:10:35,510  -->  00:10:39,230
I mean what do we call it media overload

138

00:10:42,760  -->  00:10:46,500
and end users

139

00:10:49,190  -->  00:10:55,330
give with the controller admin media's controller.

140

00:10:55,900  -->  00:10:57,140
OK.

141

00:10:57,950  -->  00:10:59,260
All right that should be good.

142

00:10:59,440  -->  00:11:02,930
Let's see Vallet row action

143

00:11:05,450  -->  00:11:08,900
.

144

00:11:08,920  -->  00:11:19,580
I mean media overload controller is missing the where the method is going.

145

00:11:19,590  -->  00:11:24,770
I think that this should be going to overload.

146

00:11:25,730  -->  00:11:26,900
All right.

147

00:11:27,800  -->  00:11:32,800
Even though this should be going to store because we're going to be storing this.

148

00:11:33,090  -->  00:11:37,030
So that's what it should be going.

149

00:11:37,040  -->  00:11:38,530
All right let's try this now.

150

00:11:38,630  -->  00:11:40,290
There we go.

151

00:11:40,350  -->  00:11:41,120
So media

152

00:11:44,570  -->  00:11:45,210
you

153

00:11:48,340  -->  00:11:53,090
mean media in this.

154

00:11:54,330  -->  00:11:56,150
That's an invalid view.

155

00:11:56,620  -->  00:12:03,080
That's we're BHP artists and raúl list

156

00:12:08,110  -->  00:12:16,970
in media and that is the name.

157

00:12:17,870  -->  00:12:19,950
So we don't have it.

158

00:12:20,760  -->  00:12:21,760
OK.

159

00:12:21,800  -->  00:12:24,310
I think we don't have any admin guys.

160

00:12:24,420  -->  00:12:31,190
Let's check real quick views and we don't have media there.

161

00:12:31,190  -->  00:12:35,540
No we need to take them farther back here.

162

00:12:35,540  -->  00:12:43,050
But for some reason I would to your raggie socks.

163

00:12:43,050  -->  00:12:44,290
All right let's just create.

164

00:12:44,300  -->  00:12:47,520
I was able to drag it before I don't know what's going on with my editor.

165

00:12:47,510  -->  00:12:49,610
I don't know what's going on with my computer.

166

00:12:50,160  -->  00:12:53,250
He says that's fine.

167

00:12:53,270  -->  00:12:55,340
Add it up.

168

00:12:55,380  -->  00:13:04,430
All right says I guess we'll copy everything from here to this fall here and then we'll delete the media

169

00:13:04,430  -->  00:13:05,030
outside.

170

00:13:05,030  -->  00:13:08,610
All right my bad guys.

171

00:13:08,620  -->  00:13:15,340
So make sure that the media fall there is it is in there in the end that is there.

172

00:13:15,410  -->  00:13:15,870
All right.

173

00:13:15,920  -->  00:13:16,760
Cool.

174

00:13:16,760  -->  00:13:17,890
There we go.

175

00:13:18,500  -->  00:13:19,530
All right.

176

00:13:20,070  -->  00:13:22,070
We shouldn't we were seeing something now.

177

00:13:22,080  -->  00:13:24,690
Boy we need to actually show a picture.

178

00:13:25,080  -->  00:13:27,430
So let's do that.

179

00:13:27,600  -->  00:13:27,990
All right.

180

00:13:28,010  -->  00:13:30,330
I'm trying to do everything in one lecture.

181

00:13:30,440  -->  00:13:32,230
I don't know how you guys like this.

182

00:13:32,240  -->  00:13:33,490
Let me know.

183

00:13:34,330  -->  00:13:34,810
And

184

00:13:37,830  -->  00:13:40,650
whoops there we go.

185

00:13:41,040  -->  00:13:44,450
Oh those big with my face right in front of me.

186

00:13:44,480  -->  00:13:46,270
I was huge.

187

00:13:46,320  -->  00:13:47,200
All right.

188

00:13:47,420  -->  00:13:49,540
Fifty.

189

00:13:50,850  -->  00:13:52,640
OK.

190

00:13:52,640  -->  00:13:55,040
All right look all the photos we got weaving up.

191

00:13:55,700  -->  00:13:57,450
None pictures in there.

192

00:13:57,440  -->  00:14:03,890
All right let's just delete this e-mail stuff there.

193

00:14:03,890  -->  00:14:05,490
All right we got it going guys.

194

00:14:05,510  -->  00:14:06,930
We really got it going there.

195

00:14:06,920  -->  00:14:09,770
We got to work on this guy here.

196

00:14:09,830  -->  00:14:11,900
We'll do that in the next lecture OK.

197

00:14:11,930  -->  00:14:12,670
All right cool.

198

00:14:12,660  -->  00:14:14,350
At least we got this going there.

199

00:14:14,630  -->  00:14:18,870
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
