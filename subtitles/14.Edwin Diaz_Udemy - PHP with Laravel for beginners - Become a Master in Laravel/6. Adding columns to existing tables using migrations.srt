1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:04,480
All right welcome back muddiest student I hope you're really excited on this lecture here.

2

00:00:04,510  -->  00:00:09,260
We're going to be learning how to add columns to our tables are already created.

3

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:13,370
So for example you already have a migration right.

4

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:19,430
And you know you don't want to really go back and say you know I'm going to drop the whole table in

5

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:26,880
day and edit it and read you know re migrated again because you have some data already that you don't

6

00:00:26,880  -->  00:00:27,470
want to delete.

7

00:00:27,470  -->  00:00:29,320
Right you don't want to delete the polls.

8

00:00:29,460  -->  00:00:35,320
You have 20 30 40 50 pausa rating you application and you don't want to go ahead and do that.

9

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:36,460
Delete it right.

10

00:00:36,690  -->  00:00:41,910
Well you can add a column without interrupting your data that you already have which is pretty cool

11

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:42,120
.

12

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:49,030
So I'm going to clear my terminal here and I'm going to run the command.

13

00:00:49,340  -->  00:00:52,890
Right to create a new migration to add a table.

14

00:00:52,920  -->  00:00:53,900
Pretty cool.

15

00:00:53,910  -->  00:00:56,510
So BHB artisan.

16

00:00:57,340  -->  00:01:03,560
All right migrate actually make migration.

17

00:01:04,180  -->  00:01:15,490
And then all right we write that what we wanted to add let's say what we want and we want to add a is

18

00:01:15,770  -->  00:01:23,200
adamantium or something and is adding in column or something like that.

19

00:01:23,200  -->  00:01:24,010
All right.

20

00:01:24,150  -->  00:01:30,480
You want to write something like this or something descriptive or write is adding call in to tables

21

00:01:30,750  -->  00:01:34,970
to post table something like that.

22

00:01:34,980  -->  00:01:35,580
All right.

23

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:40,980
And then here you get it create a flag that's called Table because you want to reference the table that

24

00:01:40,980  -->  00:01:41,910
you're using.

25

00:01:41,970  -->  00:01:49,400
I'm going to put a little symbol some quotes around it if you want.

26

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:52,790
And now I'm working with a post table.

27

00:01:53,130  -->  00:01:53,940
All right.

28

00:01:53,940  -->  00:01:55,110
Now you click enter.

29

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:57,190
Now you created that migration.

30

00:01:57,240  -->  00:01:59,580
And of course it's going to take a couple of seconds of mine.

31

00:01:59,580  -->  00:02:06,670
Now you're also able to do it I believe without the quotes like this.

32

00:02:06,750  -->  00:02:10,250
I think I've tested this before and it works.

33

00:02:10,350  -->  00:02:12,680
So you're welcome to try with other quotes if you want.

34

00:02:12,730  -->  00:02:13,300
Right.

35

00:02:13,380  -->  00:02:16,650
You can try whatever you want as long as it works for you.

36

00:02:16,650  -->  00:02:24,200
So I've got to figure out why mine Id taken a long time to produce this.

37

00:02:24,630  -->  00:02:25,850
All right.

38

00:02:26,490  -->  00:02:36,160
Let me see an event log and if we can refresh this if this is happening to you.

39

00:02:37,190  -->  00:02:40,440
This has to be a way to refresh to synchronize the table

40

00:02:42,930  -->  00:02:44,880
synchronize migrations.

41

00:02:44,880  -->  00:02:45,420
There we go.

42

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:47,610
Synchronize would do it right away.

43

00:02:47,610  -->  00:02:48,080
All right.

44

00:02:48,300  -->  00:02:49,240
Cool.

45

00:02:49,260  -->  00:02:50,500
So let's double click this.

46

00:02:50,490  -->  00:03:00,330
And now we can see that we have that this schema here that instead of actually creating that table is

47

00:03:00,330  -->  00:03:03,220
actually is referencing the table pools.

48

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:03,770
All right.

49

00:03:03,840  -->  00:03:13,150
So we have to do here is use the objects write table and we've got to add that that column.

50

00:03:13,170  -->  00:03:15,670
So we're not are adding a column to our table.

51

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:16,880
Right.

52

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:21,140
And we're going to say is admen.

53

00:03:21,270  -->  00:03:22,060
All right.

54

00:03:22,630  -->  00:03:28,000
And as a matter of fact this admin could be an integer so we can use Integer.

55

00:03:28,080  -->  00:03:29,440
All right.

56

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:35,760
And we can make this on signed on signed means that it does.

57

00:03:35,820  -->  00:03:37,670
It cannot be a negative number.

58

00:03:37,670  -->  00:03:38,300
All right.

59

00:03:38,310  -->  00:03:44,640
And if we want to drop it of course here what you need to do is you reference the referenced object

60

00:03:44,980  -->  00:03:45,760
use.

61

00:03:45,920  -->  00:03:48,980
This meant drop column.

62

00:03:49,200  -->  00:03:49,810
There we go.

63

00:03:49,980  -->  00:03:55,740
And you write the name of the column is admiring is the name of the column Antar.

64

00:03:55,970  -->  00:03:56,430
Right.

65

00:03:56,550  -->  00:03:58,390
So once you have this you're good to go.

66

00:03:58,390  -->  00:04:09,550
Now all you have to do is migrate BHB artists and make no migrate enter.

67

00:04:09,600  -->  00:04:11,020
Now this has migrated.

68

00:04:11,220  -->  00:04:15,290
Now we have to go to PH be my admin and check it out.

69

00:04:15,720  -->  00:04:21,420
If you're using some type of using another source

70

00:04:24,330  -->  00:04:30,540
for your database that's fine or you don't have to use it to my admin you could use anything else that

71

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:38,240
you are able to see your database like I use Zeke equal Prawle as well from my Mac to look up my database

72

00:04:38,250  -->  00:04:39,810
information which is pretty cool.

73

00:04:40,020  -->  00:04:49,020
So anyway so let's go to Lara Bell database U-Mass and you can see right here we go to polls structure

74

00:04:49,040  -->  00:04:49,240
.

75

00:04:49,410  -->  00:04:54,570
You can see that there is admin Karlo has being added as an integer of 10 by default.

76

00:04:54,690  -->  00:04:58,410
It's going to give you a limit on how big it is how big this is.

77

00:04:58,410  -->  00:04:58,960
Right.

78

00:04:58,980  -->  00:05:15,330
So if I wanted to let's go back and let's use run a command here and the going BHB artist and migrate

79

00:05:16,040  -->  00:05:22,960
Roback I'm going to roll that back answer.

80

00:05:23,340  -->  00:05:25,890
This has been rolled back so he's not longer there.

81

00:05:26,070  -->  00:05:34,200
So what I'm going to do is I want this to be a default of two values.

82

00:05:34,210  -->  00:05:35,030
All right.

83

00:05:35,370  -->  00:05:41,180
So now if I press my key and you can see that I'm doing things down here.

84

00:05:41,360  -->  00:05:44,340
All right I'm going to migrate again.

85

00:05:44,990  -->  00:05:45,370
Antar

86

00:05:49,220  -->  00:05:50,650
see.

87

00:05:51,720  -->  00:05:52,820
Let's see something.

88

00:05:52,920  -->  00:05:56,110
Let's see if it migrated again.

89

00:05:56,130  -->  00:05:56,520
All right.

90

00:05:56,520  -->  00:05:57,780
It does not migrate.

91

00:05:57,780  -->  00:05:59,700
I think I misspelled this.

92

00:06:00,060  -->  00:06:03,210
Let's just clear it real quick.

93

00:06:03,210  -->  00:06:08,240
Let's see what I did wrong here huh.

94

00:06:11,230  -->  00:06:12,760
OK.

95

00:06:13,020  -->  00:06:14,210
All we can do this.

96

00:06:14,230  -->  00:06:20,280
Default and we can put let's say a zero here.

97

00:06:20,280  -->  00:06:21,060
All right.

98

00:06:21,360  -->  00:06:23,570
Or we can make this a tiny

99

00:06:26,040  -->  00:06:31,430
tiny tiny.

100

00:06:34,650  -->  00:06:41,900
If you forget this values here I'm going to show you a way to find that to find it in your Clarabell

101

00:06:41,910  -->  00:06:42,030
.

102

00:06:42,030  -->  00:06:49,840
All right so we're going to go to Claribel dot com and we're going to find this migration stuff.

103

00:06:49,840  -->  00:06:56,130
All right documentation migration.

104

00:06:56,610  -->  00:06:58,000
Delicious food values.

105

00:06:58,050  -->  00:07:00,660
Let's see if we can find the like this really quick

106

00:07:03,920  -->  00:07:05,320
creating or editing.

107

00:07:05,340  -->  00:07:06,990
I think it says is the right thing.

108

00:07:06,990  -->  00:07:14,100
Right here you see that and it's supposed to have a list.

109

00:07:14,160  -->  00:07:16,260
There we go.

110

00:07:16,260  -->  00:07:22,890
So if you go to tiny integer tiny quickly see that.

111

00:07:22,890  -->  00:07:24,200
So this is a tiny integer.

112

00:07:24,200  -->  00:07:25,260
This is what we want.

113

00:07:25,470  -->  00:07:27,470
And this is all in numbers here.

114

00:07:27,780  -->  00:07:32,710
So we can go back call these guy tiny and like this.

115

00:07:32,710  -->  00:07:43,460
All right now where you can go and say My great artist and and refresh it.

116

00:07:44,370  -->  00:07:48,080
And now you can see that tiny int with a value of four.

117

00:07:48,150  -->  00:07:51,420
So that's a tiny value for a tiny integer.

118

00:07:51,420  -->  00:07:53,570
There is another one called Tiny int.

119

00:07:53,940  -->  00:07:58,230
But anyway you can see that you can go to Larabee all that come and find all that information which

120

00:07:58,230  -->  00:07:59,210
is really good.

121

00:07:59,220  -->  00:08:00,050
All right.

122

00:08:00,360  -->  00:08:01,890
So you had to do that already.

123

00:08:02,130  -->  00:08:05,550
Everything is in the documentation guys remember that.

124

00:08:05,550  -->  00:08:07,670
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

125

00:08:07,950  -->  00:08:08,490
OK.

126

00:08:08,490  -->  00:08:14,100
On the next lecture I'm going to show you some extra stuff with migrations but we're almost done.

127

00:08:14,100  -->  00:08:14,880
We've got to learn a lot.

128

00:08:14,880  -->  00:08:15,790
A whole bunch.

129

00:08:15,930  -->  00:08:19,300
And when we're building our application so keep tuned for that.

130

00:08:19,340  -->  00:08:21,520
Keep enjoying Claribel is really cool.

131

00:08:21,520  -->  00:08:22,720
And I'll see you next lectures
