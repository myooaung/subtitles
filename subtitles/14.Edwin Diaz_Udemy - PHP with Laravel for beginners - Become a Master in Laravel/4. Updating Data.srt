1

00:00:00,390  -->  00:00:03,240
All right welcome back my students another we are back.

2

00:00:03,240  -->  00:00:06,560
It's time for us to go and try something else right.

3

00:00:06,570  -->  00:00:15,570
We have instead of records into the database we have read records and now it's time for us to update

4

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:19,410
that information and then delete it so you can see how this works.

5

00:00:19,410  -->  00:00:20,030
All right.

6

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:23,330
So let's actually comment this out.

7

00:00:23,610  -->  00:00:34,150
Let's create a nother get requests for us or a route I get.

8

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:41,760
So we are we are going to be updating now right of date when I pass a second parameter as a closure

9

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:43,490
function.

10

00:00:43,490  -->  00:00:45,980
There we go.

11

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:47,080
All right.

12

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:54,180
So now what I have to tell you is that these returns they update method of the method returns an effect

13

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:55,020
that Roe.

14

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:55,710
All right.

15

00:00:55,710  -->  00:01:03,330
So if for some reason we delete a row or two rows we returned the number so we could say something like

16

00:01:03,460  -->  00:01:07,690
affected or updated.

17

00:01:09,510  -->  00:01:10,120
All right.

18

00:01:10,260  -->  00:01:14,600
The an update.

19

00:01:14,640  -->  00:01:23,240
So now we can say something like of date set of date polls set.

20

00:01:23,430  -->  00:01:31,630
Title excuse me equal to updated title.

21

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:34,740
OK.

22

00:01:34,930  -->  00:01:41,520
Make sure there where ID equals.

23

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:48,250
Let's put that question Marchal we combined it with the ID this array there.

24

00:01:48,470  -->  00:01:50,460
And now I'm going to return

25

00:01:53,470  -->  00:01:58,320
the updater variable there so that what you can see how this works right.

26

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:00,710
So now let's go to update.

27

00:02:00,840  -->  00:02:02,060
I mean let's go up here.

28

00:02:02,270  -->  00:02:02,580
Right.

29

00:02:02,580  -->  00:02:08,590
Update and enter and you can see that we have a number there.

30

00:02:08,610  -->  00:02:10,050
So that's a value right.

31

00:02:10,150  -->  00:02:15,770
Let's refresh pools of data title right here.

32

00:02:15,810  -->  00:02:17,100
Beautiful right.

33

00:02:17,100  -->  00:02:19,650
You see how simple that is.

34

00:02:19,680  -->  00:02:20,160
All right.

35

00:02:20,220  -->  00:02:24,000
Lauber makes a very simple even with raw SU Oake whereis.

36

00:02:24,000  -->  00:02:24,550
All right.

37

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:29,930
So even keep our information protected with his binding right here like we do MPD All right.

38

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:34,800
Anyway thank you so much for watching and the next lecture I expect you to try to do it on your own

39

00:02:35,070  -->  00:02:35,930
right now.

40

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:42,000
Before you jump into the next lecture which is me try to do it and then compare with my Michael to see

41

00:02:42,000  -->  00:02:43,360
if you were able to do it.

42

00:02:43,410  -->  00:02:44,300
All right.

43

00:02:44,700  -->  00:02:47,590
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
