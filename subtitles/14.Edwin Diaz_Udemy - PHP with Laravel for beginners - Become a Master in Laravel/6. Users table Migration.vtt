00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.600
All right.

2

00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:02.250
Welcome back my student.

3

00:00:02.250  -->  00:00:06.870
So on this lecture here we're going to set up our migration for a users table.

4

00:00:06.960  -->  00:00:10.020
But before we keep going on this course here.

5

00:00:10.050  -->  00:00:10.920
All right.

6

00:00:11.130  -->  00:00:14.910
We're going to make use of some of the knowledge that we already learned.

7

00:00:14.910  -->  00:00:15.640
Right.

8

00:00:15.660  -->  00:00:20.670
We're going to start actually using version control because we're going to push this to get how one

9

00:00:20.670  -->  00:00:21.680
of these days right.

10

00:00:21.870  -->  00:00:25.740
We're going to make a really awesome project and we want other people to cooperate with us.

11

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:28.430
Or maybe you guys want to cooperate with me on this project.

12

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:33.720
And when we launch it to get hot you guys can you know suggest some so new features.

13

00:00:33.780  -->  00:00:37.610
Well maybe implementing your project we can pull that in and use that.

14

00:00:37.620  -->  00:00:40.520
You know we can do a lot of things if we have it available.

15

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:47.810
So let's make sure that whatever we do on this project we don't lose let's do good in it.

16

00:00:47.880  -->  00:00:52.140
Now right now is to get status.

17

00:00:52.150  -->  00:00:56.010
All right so we need to add this to the staging area.

18

00:00:56.010  -->  00:01:00.530
All right so get add full.

19

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:01.450
There we go.

20

00:01:01.740  -->  00:01:03.620
You can do it get started again.

21

00:01:03.700  -->  00:01:05.380
You can see the old green now.

22

00:01:05.460  -->  00:01:06.140
Beautiful.

23

00:01:06.330  -->  00:01:15.030
So now we're going to do a quick comment here and it's a good comment and we're going to say my first

24

00:01:15.030  -->  00:01:15.690
comment

25

00:01:19.670  -->  00:01:28.760
and we're going to save views admin views or something like that created.

26

00:01:28.830  -->  00:01:30.220
There we go now.

27

00:01:30.230  -->  00:01:31.180
Good log.

28

00:01:31.410  -->  00:01:35.610
Whoops.

29

00:01:35.670  -->  00:01:36.320
There we go.

30

00:01:36.480  -->  00:01:37.790
So now we can always go back.

31

00:01:37.800  -->  00:01:38.560
OK.

32

00:01:39.000  -->  00:01:41.010
Beautiful.

33

00:01:41.010  -->  00:01:41.410
All right.

34

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:44.150
So now let's go ahead and start the migration now guys.

35

00:01:44.160  -->  00:01:47.610
You don't really want to do it like I usually don't do commits.

36

00:01:47.640  -->  00:01:52.560
I don't really do commit commits unless I'm doing something really awesome.

37

00:01:52.560  -->  00:02:00.230
I don't want to lose it like you know if I build maybe you'll see how I do it but because I don't do

38

00:02:00.280  -->  00:02:02.980
commits all the time it's just too much riding right.

39

00:02:03.150  -->  00:02:06.710
But I do commit to every time I add a special feature and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it.

40

00:02:06.720  -->  00:02:07.310
Right.

41

00:02:07.530  -->  00:02:13.200
But anyway let's go to our migrations real quick.

42

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:15.720
We can see that we have a user stable here.

43

00:02:15.840  -->  00:02:17.940
We click on it we need to modify this a little bit.

44

00:02:17.940  -->  00:02:25.240
So let's come here and add what I was thinking is that we should add a roll right.

45

00:02:25.470  -->  00:02:30.520
So let's make it an integer and we need to add a rule ID.

46

00:02:30.570  -->  00:02:36.450
So if you want this user to be related to our roles table later on we need to have a real ID.

47

00:02:36.480  -->  00:02:40.200
And of course we need to have the roles migration as well.

48

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:42.210
But let's set this up first.

49

00:02:42.210  -->  00:02:42.810
All right.

50

00:02:43.350  -->  00:02:50.310
And then I was thinking that we could actually take away the privileges from a user meaning that i could

51

00:02:50.310  -->  00:02:57.840
we could actually in the sakte deactivate the user interface or let's actually create a column for that

52

00:02:58.120  -->  00:03:05.830
let's call it is active active like this.

53

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:06.530
All right.

54

00:03:06.720  -->  00:03:12.500
And we could create the fault for it and we can say default is make it zero.

55

00:03:12.690  -->  00:03:15.240
So if it's zero that means the user is not active.

56

00:03:15.270  -->  00:03:17.430
If he's one the user will be active.

57

00:03:17.430  -->  00:03:19.070
That's how we're going to set it up.

58

00:03:19.070  -->  00:03:19.650
All right.

59

00:03:19.740  -->  00:03:23.250
So we got the name the e-mail all of this looks correct.

60

00:03:24.240  -->  00:03:30.590
And this the real I.D. we can make a little faster and we can put an in that's there and we can also

61

00:03:30.660  -->  00:03:35.950
make sure that he's on signed a positive number.

62

00:03:35.950  -->  00:03:36.570
All right.

63

00:03:36.570  -->  00:03:41.010
We can make a note Laboy if we wanted to you can do that as well.

64

00:03:41.010  -->  00:03:42.790
All right.

65

00:03:44.190  -->  00:03:47.400
All right so you don't have a problem if he's not here.

66

00:03:47.830  -->  00:03:48.700
All right cool.

67

00:03:48.750  -->  00:03:52.350
Even though you shouldn't have a problem if he's empty.

68

00:03:52.350  -->  00:03:55.760
I think we're good with this migration.

69

00:03:56.350  -->  00:03:58.190
All right.

70

00:03:59.160  -->  00:04:00.320
All right cool.

71

00:04:00.330  -->  00:04:08.390
So now here let's set up the rose migration as well so let's clear this out and let's just say BHP artists

72

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:15.810
and make let's make them model right away make model rule

73

00:04:19.110  -->  00:04:25.490
and increase the migration.

74

00:04:25.730  -->  00:04:34.170
Right click on it and it's quick come here and let's just give it a name

75

00:04:37.820  -->  00:04:39.340
name.

76

00:04:39.520  -->  00:04:40.220
All right.

77

00:04:40.470  -->  00:04:41.250
Cool.

78

00:04:41.250  -->  00:04:41.840
All right.

79

00:04:41.910  -->  00:04:42.330
Beautiful.

80

00:04:42.330  -->  00:04:44.590
So in the next lecture will create relationships.

81

00:04:44.590  -->  00:04:50.370
And if you guys remember go ahead and do it yourself and we'll compare the call on the that's lecture

82

00:04:50.370  -->  00:04:50.890
.

83

00:04:50.910  -->  00:04:52.080
Take care.
