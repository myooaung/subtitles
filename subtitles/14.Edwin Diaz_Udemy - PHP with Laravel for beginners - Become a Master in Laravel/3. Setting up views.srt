1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,610
All right.

2

00:00:00,610  -->  00:00:06,860
Welcome back the students so let's test now to see if our routes are working.

3

00:00:06,860  -->  00:00:11,040
Right let's go and find out how in admin comments are right.

4

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:17,880
First let's set up a link real quick in our layouts.

5

00:00:17,880  -->  00:00:22,710
So let's go to outman layouts.

6

00:00:22,740  -->  00:00:26,870
And here we go.

7

00:00:27,830  -->  00:00:36,150
All posts categories media it would be nice to have her right below here somewhere

8

00:00:36,150  -->  00:00:54,950
.

9

00:00:55,090  -->  00:00:55,560
All right.

10

00:00:55,560  -->  00:00:56,520
We can say

11

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:01,860
comments

12

00:01:06,680  -->  00:01:17,130
or comments and we don't want to create comment comments.

13

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:23,640
As a matter of fact we only have one page and should not even be dropped down.

14

00:01:23,660  -->  00:01:26,940
We don't need a drop down for this.

15

00:01:27,600  -->  00:01:32,690
You know let's put it real close to polls actually.

16

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:40,050
All right so on polls if we go to the polls we can find out if we have any comments on that too as well

17

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:40,440
.

18

00:01:40,440  -->  00:01:42,950
I think that's a good place for it.

19

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:50,750
And this would be outman comments I believe.

20

00:01:50,890  -->  00:01:51,960
Let's check it out real quick

21

00:01:55,710  -->  00:01:57,160
that

22

00:02:00,160  -->  00:02:07,110
problem incumbents Let's go to the control test is out.

23

00:02:08,460  -->  00:02:13,170
I mean post controller looks like I don't have my controller here yet

24

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:18,890
.

25

00:02:19,000  -->  00:02:21,550
There we go.

26

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:22,280
Here.

27

00:02:22,650  -->  00:02:24,140
OK.

28

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:33,790
So let's return to see if this works it works.

29

00:02:33,810  -->  00:02:34,220
All right

30

00:02:35,730  -->  00:02:40,280
.

31

00:02:41,630  -->  00:02:46,580
Hello again.

32

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:50,090
Oh that's right with the migration.

33

00:02:50,180  -->  00:02:55,610
So make sure that you have provide new information now.

34

00:02:55,830  -->  00:03:00,480
You guys should know how to do this already.

35

00:03:00,570  -->  00:03:04,000
We register the user and we have to set it.

36

00:03:04,410  -->  00:03:06,060
You say this is not fine.

37

00:03:06,060  -->  00:03:07,430
So we've got to work on that.

38

00:03:07,610  -->  00:03:12,300
But let's go to the database real quick and let's set up a couple of things.

39

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:16,260
First rule like the one active one.

40

00:03:16,650  -->  00:03:18,120
Let's get the rolls going

41

00:03:18,130  -->  00:03:28,480
.

42

00:03:39,180  -->  00:03:40,490
All right.

43

00:03:40,980  -->  00:03:42,700
Let's go back here.

44

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:46,230
So it looks like admin comments is fine.

45

00:03:46,230  -->  00:03:46,520
Yes.

46

00:03:46,530  -->  00:03:59,490
It is not fine actually because his abdomen comments and it's so let's go back to that lay low and let's

47

00:04:00,300  -->  00:04:04,440
fix that up.

48

00:04:04,830  -->  00:04:06,030
There we go.

49

00:04:06,810  -->  00:04:15,060
So now right here in polls we can check the comments polls comments controller does not exist

50

00:04:15,860  -->  00:04:20,530
.

51

00:04:22,140  -->  00:04:29,970
Polls comment all because his comment controller for some reason I call that comment and I'm going to

52

00:04:29,970  -->  00:04:34,920
delete that actually because I want comments so it should be.

53

00:04:35,010  -->  00:04:36,450
Let's see if we can find that common.

54

00:04:36,450  -->  00:04:36,780
Here

55

00:04:41,220  -->  00:04:42,960
we go.

56

00:04:44,140  -->  00:04:46,320
Oh I don't even have to read synchronized at this time.

57

00:04:46,320  -->  00:04:48,680
That's cool.

58

00:04:48,720  -->  00:04:49,460
All right.

59

00:04:49,470  -->  00:04:54,990
So it looks like he's working now.

60

00:04:55,020  -->  00:04:55,820
All right.

61

00:04:56,080  -->  00:04:56,440
So

62

00:05:04,790  -->  00:05:09,640
so that's the row and we're supposed to be returning something from there.

63

00:05:10,410  -->  00:05:10,840
But

64

00:05:14,570  -->  00:05:18,780
that's right we have a new country we just deleted that so.

65

00:05:20,340  -->  00:05:24,260
All right call this return this one.

66

00:05:25,200  -->  00:05:28,410
I'm pretty sure it works now guys.

67

00:05:28,410  -->  00:05:33,020
All right there we go.

68

00:05:33,730  -->  00:05:40,070
So let's set up our Simply real quick and

69

00:05:42,650  -->  00:05:45,230
in our route in view.

70

00:05:45,420  -->  00:05:46,050
OK.

71

00:05:46,500  -->  00:05:52,830
So resources views we should have that are available somewhere here so that we're looking at pretty

72

00:05:52,830  -->  00:05:55,430
quick comments.

73

00:05:55,500  -->  00:06:02,360
It's right here stance layouts.

74

00:06:05,370  -->  00:06:09,990
Hope you guys having a good days of really good day to be courting guys.

75

00:06:10,020  -->  00:06:12,160
Remember though why are you doing this or why.

76

00:06:12,390  -->  00:06:18,450
Sometimes it seems that things can be can look like they're very difficult but they are actually very

77

00:06:18,450  -->  00:06:19,530
simple.

78

00:06:19,890  -->  00:06:22,490
And if you got to this point it's just simple stuff for you.

79

00:06:22,560  -->  00:06:29,800
You are already probably thinking about your next project.

80

00:06:29,910  -->  00:06:30,620
All right.

81

00:06:30,900  -->  00:06:35,790
So let's go back to here and let's return to our view

82

00:06:39,000  -->  00:06:42,710
and the view and many comments.

83

00:06:42,790  -->  00:06:44,130
And it's I believe

84

00:06:47,090  -->  00:06:48,940
it will go.

85

00:06:49,530  -->  00:06:50,330
All right.

86

00:06:50,670  -->  00:06:52,990
So this is where we're going to be displaying our comments.

87

00:06:53,220  -->  00:06:56,430
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
