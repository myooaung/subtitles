00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.740
All right.

2

00:00:00.780  -->  00:00:03.180
Welcome back my dear student.

3

00:00:03.420  -->  00:00:12.510
So now we're doing this right here just in case we have a photo but if we don't have one we're going

4

00:00:12.510  -->  00:00:14.260
to do whatever is here.

5

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:18.970
So we're going to say user Oh come on

6

00:00:22.740  -->  00:00:27.760
create and create input.

7

00:00:28.330  -->  00:00:30.920
OK.

8

00:00:34.050  -->  00:00:40.010
Now before we do this here remember that our password field is not getting encrypted right.

9

00:00:40.220  -->  00:00:45.630
When able to encrypt that so let's actually do this right now so we're going to do input

10

00:00:49.400  -->  00:00:53.330
or passwords or not another field that passed was not getting Crypta right.

11

00:00:53.520  -->  00:00:59.250
So we're going to do a big crypt and we're going to get the requests password

12

00:01:01.640  -->  00:01:03.060
actually.

13

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:03.760
Yeah

14

00:01:06.980  -->  00:01:07.570
actually

15

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:15.750
yeah that's ok I guess.

16

00:01:15.770  -->  00:01:20.210
Yeah that's fine yeah.

17

00:01:20.520  -->  00:01:21.570
That's OK.

18

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:22.620
All right.

19

00:01:23.530  -->  00:01:26.500
So I think we're good here.

20

00:01:26.530  -->  00:01:27.740
I'm double checking stuff.

21

00:01:27.750  -->  00:01:30.780
But if we have a problem we'll fix it.

22

00:01:30.900  -->  00:01:34.950
But I think it's doing great right now.

23

00:01:34.950  -->  00:01:38.240
All right let's check this out real quick.

24

00:01:38.340  -->  00:01:42.740
Open up a browser somewhere.

25

00:01:42.750  -->  00:01:45.490
Looks like I already have one of these windows open here.

26

00:01:45.870  -->  00:01:49.160
Let's create a user and we're going to call.

27

00:01:49.170  -->  00:01:53.930
Going to give these users some type of generic name.

28

00:01:54.000  -->  00:02:01.910
Let's call them John and John called and faculty of course he works for us.

29

00:02:02.010  -->  00:02:03.240
He's in the team.

30

00:02:04.200  -->  00:02:08.950
And he this guy is going to be an author is active.

31

00:02:08.970  -->  00:02:10.660
And let's give him a photo.

32

00:02:11.150  -->  00:02:16.470
All right I'm going to give him a photo of me of course but I think I have a folder of pictures there

33

00:02:16.470  -->  00:02:18.510
that I'm going to give you guys.

34

00:02:18.510  -->  00:02:20.570
So make sure that you ask for it.

35

00:02:20.570  -->  00:02:24.040
It's use a bow a picture of women and guys.

36

00:02:24.090  -->  00:02:24.430
All right.

37

00:02:24.450  -->  00:02:28.470
Nothing that you should now see is just normal stuff.

38

00:02:28.470  -->  00:02:29.220
All right.

39

00:02:29.640  -->  00:02:37.270
And let's just give them a password let's just say his e-mail his password is 1 2 3 4 and 5.

40

00:02:37.410  -->  00:02:40.660
Let's see if letters do that enter.

41

00:02:41.070  -->  00:02:44.110
And we are now returning by the way we should it return.

42

00:02:44.130  -->  00:02:47.010
But let's just refresh this.

43

00:02:47.150  -->  00:02:48.750
See what we get.

44

00:02:48.750  -->  00:02:50.040
All right cool.

45

00:02:50.040  -->  00:02:55.830
This is we get a user ID number five and you probably have a different result in your database.

46

00:02:55.840  -->  00:02:56.880
That's OK.

47

00:02:56.910  -->  00:03:03.270
Roll IDs 2 which means there's an author he's asked if his name was John e-mail and we think we are

48

00:03:03.270  -->  00:03:04.830
even encrypted the password here.

49

00:03:04.830  -->  00:03:10.130
Let's look at photo I.D. photo I.D. number wine.

50

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:12.230
Beautiful.

51

00:03:12.270  -->  00:03:17.030
And let's check our fotos field here.

52

00:03:17.130  -->  00:03:21.290
We have created a photo with a time appended to it.

53

00:03:21.330  -->  00:03:24.050
Look at that beautiful guys.

54

00:03:24.060  -->  00:03:26.850
You've done a really good job here.

55

00:03:26.850  -->  00:03:27.400
All right.

56

00:03:27.540  -->  00:03:34.770
Now let's check on the Pali directory to see if we created that image image just for her.

57

00:03:34.800  -->  00:03:38.250
Well I have to synchronize my stuff all the time.

58

00:03:38.250  -->  00:03:44.250
I'm having issues with this copy of BHB storm as you can see.

59

00:03:44.250  -->  00:03:47.420
We got images and we got this.

60

00:03:47.490  -->  00:03:53.050
So now we can actually do some type of commed right.

61

00:03:53.790  -->  00:03:56.500
So let's add it up good add.

62

00:03:57.030  -->  00:03:57.740
Let's do.

63

00:03:57.740  -->  00:04:00.570
Good comment.

64

00:04:00.660  -->  00:04:03.840
And we're going to commed users

65

00:04:06.420  -->  00:04:10.340
with photos working or something like that.

66

00:04:10.350  -->  00:04:13.910
You can be more descriptive guys and just giving you an idea how this is done.

67

00:04:14.040  -->  00:04:18.350
All I try to be descriptive on where you are when you're typing these messages.

68

00:04:18.660  -->  00:04:21.510
All right so users with photo photos

69

00:04:24.760  -->  00:04:30.000
you can pull features or for overloading.

70

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:30.780
Overloading

71

00:04:30.780  -->  00:04:36.280
.

72

00:04:36.300  -->  00:04:43.200
So users were uploading feature working or something like that and then enter a beautiful good log just

73

00:04:43.250  -->  00:04:44.420
to make sure.

74

00:04:44.920  -->  00:04:48.140
And as you can see we have this comment right here.

75

00:04:48.140  -->  00:04:49.020
All right cool.

76

00:04:49.020  -->  00:04:51.050
Good job if you were able to get this far.

77

00:04:51.240  -->  00:04:52.180
You're doing awesome.

78

00:04:52.230  -->  00:04:55.210
Let's continue learning some more stuff and so in having fun guys.

79

00:04:55.200  -->  00:04:55.640
All right.

80

00:04:55.740  -->  00:04:59.430
If you want you can take a little rest and come back and where you can see things a little bit more

81

00:04:59.430  -->  00:05:00.120
clearly.

82

00:05:00.330  -->  00:05:02.990
Thank you and see you in the next lecture
