1

00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:07,920
All right welcome back my students so let's make sure that this route is working and that we can actually

2

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:10,700
route the requests to our Controller.

3

00:00:11,010  -->  00:00:11,650
All right.

4

00:00:11,770  -->  00:00:14,200
So let's go here.

5

00:00:14,280  -->  00:00:24,480
Our Terman on the say BHP areason route calling list that what we can see that you are I hear as you

6

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:28,100
can see they all have to be starting with admin.

7

00:00:28,230  -->  00:00:33,450
And then the next world will be users and depending on what you're doing you have an idea you don't

8

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:34,300
have one.

9

00:00:34,300  -->  00:00:34,520
All right.

10

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:36,580
The only one that doesn't have an ID is create a.

11

00:00:36,620  -->  00:00:42,990
Here everything else like the show meant as an ID that destroy has an idea of the edit.

12

00:00:42,990  -->  00:00:43,820
All right cool.

13

00:00:44,010  -->  00:00:49,590
So the first thing that I want to actually make sure that his that is working is the end it's all right

14

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:49,620
.

15

00:00:49,620  -->  00:01:00,670
So let's go back here to Amin Azmin const controllers and let's return the view for admin.

16

00:01:00,870  -->  00:01:04,010
So if you remember we have a folder called admin.

17

00:01:04,350  -->  00:01:08,980
Then we have inside users and then we have an index.

18

00:01:09,490  -->  00:01:22,020
All right let's go back and check this out real quick so you can say admin users enter and yes you can

19

00:01:22,020  -->  00:01:23,190
see is empty right now.

20

00:01:23,190  -->  00:01:27,680
And that's because we don't have anything but let's just test it out real quick and let's just put something

21

00:01:27,680  -->  00:01:33,960
in there resources we go.

22

00:01:34,500  -->  00:01:38,700
And just put this it's working or something like that.

23

00:01:39,570  -->  00:01:41,340
Let's go back Antar.

24

00:01:41,370  -->  00:01:44,030
And as you can see it is working.

25

00:01:44,030  -->  00:01:45,240
All right.

26

00:01:45,960  -->  00:01:46,530
So beautiful.

27

00:01:46,530  -->  00:01:51,840
We know that it's working.

28

00:01:51,930  -->  00:01:53,310
All right cool.

29

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:59,880
So what is the next step the next step is actually to get a master Leo right.

30

00:01:59,940  -->  00:02:01,360
That's the next step to do.

31

00:02:01,500  -->  00:02:04,700
And what we're going to be doing is we're going to be copying some files that are going to give you

32

00:02:04,700  -->  00:02:12,710
the last lecture because I have this special Basrah father's already ready with our admin styles.

33

00:02:12,730  -->  00:02:18,000
Mariah we're not going to be dealing with a lot of styles in this course because this is not a CSSA

34

00:02:18,020  -->  00:02:19,740
or booster of course.

35

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:24,840
By the time you get here you guys should know how to use bootstrap in some type of template so that

36

00:02:24,940  -->  00:02:30,200
you can create you application discourses of our Laro in dealing with frameworks.

37

00:02:30,450  -->  00:02:31,740
NASA says styling.

38

00:02:31,740  -->  00:02:32,410
All right.

39

00:02:32,700  -->  00:02:38,370
So I care more and more about the functionality of the website than actually the styling we can we as

40

00:02:38,370  -->  00:02:44,790
a developer program and we can actually hire somebody for a couple of bucks and create a Leo and build

41

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:50,910
this crazy functionality in the back which will make us money we'll who will make our boss very proud

42

00:02:50,910  -->  00:02:51,340
of us.

43

00:02:51,350  -->  00:02:51,900
Right.

44

00:02:51,990  -->  00:02:54,410
The functionality is the most important thing.

45

00:02:54,420  -->  00:03:01,150
Now if you are a designer or a graphics person you can create is super easy if you're not.

46

00:03:01,380  -->  00:03:01,840
All right.

47

00:03:01,850  -->  00:03:08,140
You can actually buy one which are really cheap or you can even use the free ones out there.

48

00:03:08,160  -->  00:03:08,730
All right.

49

00:03:08,940  -->  00:03:14,140
So the next lecture we're going to download it right on the lecture and is going to be pretty fun and

50

00:03:14,150  -->  00:03:17,820
I show you some really cool features and we're going to be installing.

51

00:03:18,000  -->  00:03:18,570
No Jay.

52

00:03:18,580  -->  00:03:23,010
Yes if you don't have it and giving you a heads up right now but don't worry about it.

53

00:03:23,040  -->  00:03:25,830
I'm going to give you more details on the next lecture OK.

54

00:03:25,860  -->  00:03:34,650
So make sure that all your routes your work song when I'm going to do is I'm going to we can either

55

00:03:34,650  -->  00:03:37,380
write it all we can copy and pasted.

56

00:03:37,700  -->  00:03:39,030
All right.

57

00:03:39,040  -->  00:03:43,830
And we're going to say man that users create.

58

00:03:44,350  -->  00:03:47,390
All right.

59

00:03:49,910  -->  00:03:52,510
You can do the rest if you like.

60

00:03:53,100  -->  00:03:54,300
Super easy stuff

61

00:03:54,300  -->  00:04:02,050
.

62

00:04:02,490  -->  00:04:05,700
All right.

63

00:04:05,700  -->  00:04:10,670
But anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

64

00:04:10,680  -->  00:04:11,460
Take care.
