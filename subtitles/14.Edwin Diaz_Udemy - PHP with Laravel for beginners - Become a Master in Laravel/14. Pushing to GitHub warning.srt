00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:02,200
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,220  -->  00:00:04,620
Just a precaution here.

3

00:00:04,620  -->  00:00:10,440
And I just wanted to get you know make this lecture used to make you aware that when you're pushing

4

00:00:10,920  -->  00:00:17,100
projects right you are also ignoring some of the when you push you to get help you're ignoring some

5

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:17,600
files.

6

00:00:17,610  -->  00:00:23,070
I want to remember that if you go to get the ignore you are ignoring the vendor the mall use all these

7

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:24,500
files right here.

8

00:00:24,800  -->  00:00:25,220
All right.

9

00:00:25,220  -->  00:00:30,570
That you will need in order for you to actually recreate this in another scenario.

10

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:36,210
So for example you push just to get help and you want to actually clone that and use it somewhere else

11

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:36,600
.

12

00:00:36,600  -->  00:00:39,870
You're going to need your vendors your money is you going to need these files.

13

00:00:39,880  -->  00:00:40,330
OK.

14

00:00:40,350  -->  00:00:46,220
So if you're working on this yourself take them off OK take them off.

15

00:00:46,260  -->  00:00:50,100
And as a matter of fact you can take all of these off if you're working on those files yourself.

16

00:00:50,130  -->  00:00:54,750
I don't recommend taking this off though you can recreate that in the other.

17

00:00:55,130  -->  00:00:57,030
In the other application.

18

00:00:57,030  -->  00:01:02,640
So just take all these off and and you know blow those files.

19

00:01:02,640  -->  00:01:07,800
The reason why we take these off is because those vendor files these are these are a lot of files in

20

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:08,140
there.

21

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:12,990
I remember the vendors have all the dependency That's a lot of files for you to be pushed in to get

22

00:01:12,990  -->  00:01:13,260
help.

23

00:01:13,260  -->  00:01:14,180
OK.

24

00:01:14,820  -->  00:01:19,850
Of course you can you know recreate those files into other application.

25

00:01:19,890  -->  00:01:22,310
Just be aware that you need those files.

26

00:01:22,520  -->  00:01:26,070
You don't need to know this if you're working on that yourself.

27

00:01:26,070  -->  00:01:27,460
All right.

28

00:01:27,530  -->  00:01:30,430
You can recreate this in other publications as well.

29

00:01:30,510  -->  00:01:33,390
Remember that you are also ignoring this file here.

30

00:01:33,390  -->  00:01:37,440
So when you try to clone this phone the other side.

31

00:01:37,470  -->  00:01:38,820
All right.

32

00:01:38,820  -->  00:01:41,590
To an operation you're not going to have all of this.

33

00:01:41,610  -->  00:01:43,280
You're going to have the example here.

34

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:43,590
All right.

35

00:01:43,590  -->  00:01:49,170
So remember to save this as this and then you change your.

36

00:01:49,200  -->  00:01:52,140
You give access to the application to that database.

37

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:52,860
All right.

38

00:01:52,860  -->  00:01:56,810
Also you're going to need to generate a new application key.

39

00:01:56,810  -->  00:01:57,680
All right.

40

00:01:58,080  -->  00:02:02,800
When you transfer this if you see the example here that simple doesn't have a key.

41

00:02:02,820  -->  00:02:03,430
All right.

42

00:02:03,690  -->  00:02:07,680
So you're going to need to actually generate a key and the rate the way that you generate a key for

43

00:02:07,680  -->  00:02:09,110
your applications like this.

44

00:02:09,240  -->  00:02:15,150
BHP areason key generator.

45

00:02:15,280  -->  00:02:16,120
All right.

46

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:21,560
And that will create a key for you if you go to Beechfield is an issue should have it right here somewhere

47

00:02:21,560  -->  00:02:21,600
.

48

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:26,010
Let me see if he has the command so you can see it right here.

49

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:27,720
You see that.

50

00:02:28,530  -->  00:02:31,980
So you generate a new key and you're good to go again.

51

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:32,510
OK.

52

00:02:32,640  -->  00:02:37,620
Just remember that you are ignoring these files just in case you have a problem and you try to clone

53

00:02:37,620  -->  00:02:43,440
this project from somewhere else and you like OK this is not working.

54

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:45,830
Remember that you are ignoring these files.

55

00:02:45,840  -->  00:02:49,650
All right you're going to need that in the next application.

56

00:02:49,650  -->  00:02:50,010
All right.

57

00:02:50,100  -->  00:02:53,670
So anyway now that we are clear I just wanted to make you aware of that.

58

00:02:53,670  -->  00:02:54,580
OK.

59

00:02:54,870  -->  00:02:57,920
Now that we're clear which should go on with the Course.

60

00:02:58,080  -->  00:03:01,710
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
