00:00:00,170  -->  00:00:05,180
I welcome back my students so it's time for us to add a little bit more security to our application

2

00:00:05,190  -->  00:00:06,180
just a little bit more.

3

00:00:06,300  -->  00:00:12,690
If you remember we have created this active status here and this is for a reason because we don't just

4

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:16,500
want to make sure that these user is logged in and he's an administrator.

5

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:21,540
We want to also make sure that he's active What if for some reason these user does something in our

6

00:00:21,540  -->  00:00:22,080
application.

7

00:00:22,090  -->  00:00:23,490
He's an administrator.

8

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:29,790
We can we can delete him if we wanted to but we could leave the ministry in her role and make an active

9

00:00:29,800  -->  00:00:30,110
.

10

00:00:30,380  -->  00:00:30,870
All right.

11

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:35,430
Not taking my will not take him out of the application right away and not take him out of the role right

12

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:39,250
away but just make sure that he's on active to do certain things with him.

13

00:00:39,270  -->  00:00:44,640
We could all day that he's profiled do something and he's not able to log in while we finish updating

14

00:00:44,640  -->  00:00:47,110
his stuff or do something like that right.

15

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:49,950
It's just more security a lot more control.

16

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:55,680
So the way we do that is we go back to a user and the hearing where he says is admin We also want to

17

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:59,120
make sure that it is he's active as well.

18

00:00:59,130  -->  00:01:04,860
So we could say and the ampersand here this

19

00:01:07,470  -->  00:01:08,580
is active

20

00:01:11,970  -->  00:01:16,580
he calls to one worker and that's all.

21

00:01:16,710  -->  00:01:21,210
So it shouldn't do anything here because we are administrator.

22

00:01:21,480  -->  00:01:23,740
So let's go and try Maria.

23

00:01:23,910  -->  00:01:31,200
She's an administrator too but Rico is not an administrator or he is an administrator Let's make and

24

00:01:31,210  -->  00:01:37,850
not active and is giving a password just in case if we don't we haven't given it to him.

25

00:01:37,870  -->  00:01:38,960
Let's go.

26

00:01:39,100  -->  00:01:43,890
Let's try to in with Rico and let's see what's going on.

27

00:01:44,160  -->  00:01:45,760
Whoops.

28

00:01:46,120  -->  00:01:52,080
Recall this again and let's try to go to admen.

29

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:58,770
As you can see we get redirect back again and you can tell right here that Rico is an administrator

30

00:01:58,770  -->  00:01:58,790
.

31

00:01:58,800  -->  00:02:01,610
You can see the role he's just now active.

32

00:02:01,830  -->  00:02:02,390
OK.

33

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:06,900
Now one thing that I want to do here is I want to redirect every time we log in I want to go ahead and

34

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:10,160
read right back to add me now to the home page.

35

00:02:10,350  -->  00:02:16,350
So if you remember back in the lectures in the beginning lectures we talked about that and it is in

36

00:02:16,350  -->  00:02:21,520
this off controller you see the redirect property here goes to the root.

37

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:24,210
So that's why you can't miss the lectures.

38

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:27,740
You see I just showed you or reminded you of something new.

39

00:02:27,830  -->  00:02:30,030
Right or different.

40

00:02:30,030  -->  00:02:30,900
All right.

41

00:02:31,210  -->  00:02:32,780
So now this should be good now.

42

00:02:32,790  -->  00:02:34,260
All right.

43

00:02:35,210  -->  00:02:36,480
Listen again with Edwin

44

00:02:39,960  -->  00:02:41,870
and now we are logging into Outman.

45

00:02:41,910  -->  00:02:48,030
All right now we are we will of course attack this dashboard later in the future where we have a lot

46

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:53,460
more information and a lot more features in our application that way we can either display them here

47

00:02:53,790  -->  00:02:56,710
or do some type of settings here.

48

00:02:56,880  -->  00:02:57,470
OK.

49

00:02:57,690  -->  00:03:03,720
Well now we don't have much features that we need to you know incorporate any dash dashboard right now

50

00:03:03,720  -->  00:03:03,750
.

51

00:03:03,750  -->  00:03:09,100
So cool Riego now active let's make them active.

52

00:03:09,600  -->  00:03:12,630
Ok cool.

53

00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:13,690
All right.

54

00:03:14,040  -->  00:03:18,180
So that's one way of implementing a little bit more security to our application.

55

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:19,820
Take care and see you in the next lecture
