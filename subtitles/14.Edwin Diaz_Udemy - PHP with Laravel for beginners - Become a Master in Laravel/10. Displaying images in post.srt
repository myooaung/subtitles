1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:00,660
All right.

2

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:01,810
Welcome back.

3

00:00:01,810  -->  00:00:07,200
My students saw the last lecture we have our polls here and I wanted to fix this a little bit before

4

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:12,260
we go on Araya I wanted to actually have some type of category here just to show something.

5

00:00:12,360  -->  00:00:18,240
And for now until we create the category and I wanted to also have a picture here you know let's just

6

00:00:18,240  -->  00:00:19,160
fix it up a little bit.

7

00:00:19,170  -->  00:00:19,840
Right.

8

00:00:20,190  -->  00:00:20,580
All right.

9

00:00:20,580  -->  00:00:26,030
So first of all let's go and fix that create

10

00:00:29,700  -->  00:00:39,900
file that has the category there we have a an array here which with options let's just change this and

11

00:00:40,860  -->  00:00:46,230
let's just say then we're going to have a value of one here and let's call this guy BHP or something

12

00:00:46,230  -->  00:00:47,270
like that.

13

00:00:47,910  -->  00:00:48,400
All right.

14

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:49,030
And

15

00:00:52,320  -->  00:00:59,860
I don't know let's just say that we have another value here and this one would be Javascript.

16

00:01:00,590  -->  00:01:01,850
OK.

17

00:01:02,670  -->  00:01:04,200
Now if we go back to

18

00:01:09,630  -->  00:01:12,510
create we can see that we have those two there.

19

00:01:13,050  -->  00:01:13,370
All right.

20

00:01:13,380  -->  00:01:28,080
So now we create a new pose my third post choose a file not a placeholder of this or I could say

21

00:01:33,050  -->  00:01:34,020
all

22

00:01:36,760  -->  00:01:40,460
right we can see that there are polls we have a category there.

23

00:01:40,470  -->  00:01:41,400
So that's working.

24

00:01:41,400  -->  00:01:48,840
We know that we just got it created categories later and pulao those pull it out from the database right

25

00:01:48,850  -->  00:01:49,190
.

26

00:01:49,530  -->  00:01:52,530
So for all we know that's working too.

27

00:01:52,530  -->  00:02:00,780
But we are displaying a id so let's actually go back to in it's here and instead of photo ID we're going

28

00:02:00,780  -->  00:02:06,990
to display that we also can display the category name here if we wanted to but we're not gonna do that

29

00:02:06,990  -->  00:02:08,980
now.

30

00:02:09,000  -->  00:02:10,560
All right instead of photo ID.

31

00:02:10,710  -->  00:02:15,700
And let's actually create a condition here just in case we can't find the photo right.

32

00:02:16,320  -->  00:02:17,590
So.

33

00:02:18,600  -->  00:02:23,170
Image tag actually image tag.

34

00:02:23,190  -->  00:02:27,410
This is put this in the source.

35

00:02:27,600  -->  00:02:32,040
Oops.

36

00:02:33,420  -->  00:02:33,810
Right.

37

00:02:33,810  -->  00:02:39,380
And then we're going to say if Paul's photo is there.

38

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:43,970
Whoops I think it came out of there.

39

00:02:44,280  -->  00:02:45,440
All right.

40

00:02:46,110  -->  00:02:47,500
So post photos there

41

00:02:54,690  -->  00:02:58,350
we display the photo name.

42

00:02:59,280  -->  00:03:09,120
And I think that's the name that we have in a database or the title photos file actually.

43

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:10,940
All right.

44

00:03:12,330  -->  00:03:16,860
If not then we display some type of placeholder.

45

00:03:16,860  -->  00:03:17,290
Right.

46

00:03:17,310  -->  00:03:18,740
I think we already have that.

47

00:03:18,770  -->  00:03:22,560
We know we don't have that logic in the

48

00:03:25,850  -->  00:03:29,340
in the user model do we.

49

00:03:29,670  -->  00:03:31,700
We don't have the logic.

50

00:03:31,710  -->  00:03:34,960
No that's OK then.

51

00:03:35,920  -->  00:03:37,340
OK.

52

00:03:37,650  -->  00:03:39,250
We're just going to put a placeholder here.

53

00:03:39,290  -->  00:03:40,410
HTP

54

00:03:43,320  -->  00:03:45,620
please hold it.

55

00:03:45,650  -->  00:03:53,250
And like I said I recommend getting your own images as placeholders right because you never know when

56

00:03:53,250  -->  00:03:54,940
the server is going to go down.

57

00:03:55,490  -->  00:03:58,290
All right.

58

00:03:58,290  -->  00:04:06,060
I want to create a height here of Honduras fine.

59

00:04:06,390  -->  00:04:07,890
Let's see how this looks for a quick

60

00:04:10,480  -->  00:04:11,180
refresh.

61

00:04:11,190  -->  00:04:12,570
Whoops.

62

00:04:12,690  -->  00:04:21,630
We have a variable here that does not exist just because it's post photo now photo pose.

63

00:04:22,230  -->  00:04:24,500
All right there we go.

64

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:25,560
OK.

65

00:04:25,560  -->  00:04:27,030
I think that's too big.

66

00:04:27,540  -->  00:04:31,630
Let's make this 50 guys.

67

00:04:31,630  -->  00:04:33,000
All right.

68

00:04:34,080  -->  00:04:34,410
There we go.

69

00:04:34,410  -->  00:04:35,600
That's OK.

70

00:04:35,610  -->  00:04:39,910
That looks a little better.

71

00:04:39,960  -->  00:04:41,010
All right.

72

00:04:42,120  -->  00:04:48,390
OK what else we do need here.

73

00:04:48,390  -->  00:04:53,730
All right we're good here for now.

74

00:04:54,210  -->  00:04:58,980
We got the updated the body the title the photo.

75

00:04:58,980  -->  00:05:01,830
I think we should move the photo to the front here.

76

00:05:02,190  -->  00:05:04,350
Let's do that real quick.

77

00:05:04,470  -->  00:05:09,260
So let's move this whole thing to the front.

78

00:05:09,390  -->  00:05:12,450
After the ID and

79

00:05:15,160  -->  00:05:15,570
here

80

00:05:19,370  -->  00:05:20,600
category type of body.

81

00:05:20,610  -->  00:05:25,020
OK that looks good.

82

00:05:25,020  -->  00:05:25,630
All right.

83

00:05:25,660  -->  00:05:27,670
That looks a little better.

84

00:05:27,760  -->  00:05:30,460
We got to replace this little guy right there.

85

00:05:31,170  -->  00:05:34,170
OK.

86

00:05:34,170  -->  00:05:35,160
All righty.

87

00:05:35,160  -->  00:05:35,480
All right.

88

00:05:35,490  -->  00:05:36,380
Perfect.

89

00:05:36,390  -->  00:05:39,650
I think we're done with this lecture here.

90

00:05:39,660  -->  00:05:40,680
I'll see you the next one.

91

00:05:40,680  -->  00:05:41,100
Take care
