1

00:00:00,210  -->  00:00:01,970
All right welcome back my story.

2

00:00:01,970  -->  00:00:06,870
So you start for us a story actually of dating this right using this.

3

00:00:06,900  -->  00:00:14,370
So let's go to the comments replies controller and let's try this logic right here.

4

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:31,620
So we're going to say Come my reply find or fail and then we're going to do it right the requests.

5

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:34,420
Very simple stuff.

6

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:40,740
We're going to redirect back.

7

00:00:41,700  -->  00:00:43,380
Make sure that we return that.

8

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:46,430
And let's check it real quick.

9

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:48,550
All right.

10

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:49,660
All right.

11

00:00:50,030  -->  00:00:50,840
So it's working now.

12

00:00:50,840  -->  00:00:53,720
All right cool.

13

00:00:53,790  -->  00:00:55,140
Let's go back here.

14

00:00:55,140  -->  00:01:02,700
So if we don't approve this we go back here we're not supposed to see it but we are seeing it.

15

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:03,960
All right.

16

00:01:04,560  -->  00:01:11,930
So that logic is in control or admin.

17

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:16,440
Post controller and re-impose is where we have this logic right.

18

00:01:16,680  -->  00:01:24,590
Well actually no we have this logic in the form.

19

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:26,480
That's how we are.

20

00:01:26,550  -->  00:01:28,880
We're showing the replies in the form.

21

00:01:29,310  -->  00:01:35,830
So we only want to show the forms if there are active for that we need to actually the replies.

22

00:01:35,890  -->  00:01:38,280
We need to actually write that.

23

00:01:38,640  -->  00:01:39,440
All right.

24

00:01:39,740  -->  00:01:48,130
So let's go to resources and polls.

25

00:01:48,150  -->  00:01:48,680
All right.

26

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:55,090
So we need to write a little bit more here a little more condition.

27

00:01:55,710  -->  00:02:01,740
Would you say if your reply is

28

00:02:04,340  -->  00:02:05,000
active

29

00:02:09,130  -->  00:02:13,260
if it's actually equal to one then it's active.

30

00:02:13,260  -->  00:02:14,840
One is short.

31

00:02:15,650  -->  00:02:16,320
So

32

00:02:20,370  -->  00:02:21,780
this is to comment

33

00:02:24,620  -->  00:02:28,490
.

34

00:02:29,670  -->  00:02:30,630
And if

35

00:02:36,200  -->  00:02:48,810
it does that the fear this if this is the media yeah that's where we want to be.

36

00:02:48,810  -->  00:02:49,290
All right

37

00:02:52,390  -->  00:02:53,940
there we go.

38

00:02:53,940  -->  00:02:59,550
So now if we approve it and come back here we can see that it works

39

00:02:59,550  -->  00:03:06,120
.

40

00:03:07,080  -->  00:03:10,390
That's looking pretty good guys really looking good.

41

00:03:10,440  -->  00:03:12,980
Let's work with the delete method.

42

00:03:13,830  -->  00:03:14,160
All right

43

00:03:19,220  -->  00:03:23,250
let's come and reply.

44

00:03:23,250  -->  00:03:24,520
Fine.

45

00:03:25,180  -->  00:03:27,660
Fine or fail.

46

00:03:28,690  -->  00:03:30,950
We'll delete the answers to your

47

00:03:37,910  -->  00:03:40,180
return.

48

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:41,650
All right

49

00:03:44,980  -->  00:03:47,110
Joe.

50

00:03:47,160  -->  00:03:48,370
Redirect back.

51

00:03:48,720  -->  00:03:50,610
Well let's set a

52

00:03:54,180  -->  00:03:59,360
statement here for some reason those and find the

53

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:06,390
oh he's just going to say no replies

54

00:04:07,040  -->  00:04:11,750
.

55

00:04:17,940  -->  00:04:18,200
I

56

00:04:23,990  -->  00:04:26,450
see that.

57

00:04:26,610  -->  00:04:30,400
All right we've got to make sure that we are sending this to the right place.

58

00:04:30,460  -->  00:04:31,490
Delete.

59

00:04:31,890  -->  00:04:44,460
Let's go back to that show reply show replies in this show meant the page that's in Sayad men come comments

60

00:04:44,460  -->  00:04:49,750
replies and show where I hear OK guys don't get lost on me I know that there is a lot of files out there

61

00:04:49,780  -->  00:04:50,380
but.

62

00:04:50,760  -->  00:04:51,550
All right.

63

00:04:52,140  -->  00:05:00,060
So we're sending this Samit polls sending this woman to the wrong place.

64

00:05:00,330  -->  00:05:01,690
That is Troy.

65

00:05:02,340  -->  00:05:05,100
We've got to send it here.

66

00:05:05,100  -->  00:05:06,930
There we go.

67

00:05:06,930  -->  00:05:10,180
So now we try that.

68

00:05:10,320  -->  00:05:12,280
We fresh.

69

00:05:12,300  -->  00:05:14,330
There we go.

70

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:22,110
All right now let's check those few comments.

71

00:05:22,130  -->  00:05:29,310
All right let's create a reply real quick.

72

00:05:30,360  -->  00:05:33,970
What if we wanted to have a reply for this guy right here.

73

00:05:34,050  -->  00:05:36,970
We don't have a button here for him right.

74

00:05:37,830  -->  00:05:43,070
I think that Biden should be available outside.

75

00:05:43,290  -->  00:05:44,400
It's disappearing.

76

00:05:44,400  -->  00:05:47,040
All right so we need to put up an outside.

77

00:05:47,430  -->  00:05:52,330
Let's go to polls again and.

78

00:05:53,430  -->  00:05:57,130
Well we'll find a place for that by next lecture OK.

79

00:05:57,220  -->  00:06:01,250
We're able to delete replies.

80

00:06:01,280  -->  00:06:01,760
All right.

81

00:06:01,790  -->  00:06:03,750
Approved them approve them and all that.

82

00:06:03,830  -->  00:06:07,410
The next lecture will go ahead and it fits up.

83

00:06:07,440  -->  00:06:09,530
And as a matter of fact take us a challenge.

84

00:06:09,540  -->  00:06:13,310
Put this bun somewhere that is not here.

85

00:06:13,310  -->  00:06:19,510
And when we you know when we don't have a reply that is available all the time.

86

00:06:19,680  -->  00:06:22,370
So do that on the next lecture we'll compare cold.

87

00:06:22,410  -->  00:06:22,890
Thanks
