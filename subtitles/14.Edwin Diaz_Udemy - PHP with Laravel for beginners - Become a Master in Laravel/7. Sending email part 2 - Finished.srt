1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:01,340
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:06,510
My students are we are almost ready to send e-mail but there is one thing that we are missing that we

3

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:08,640
need to require.

4

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:17,550
We need to inquire a package Clarabell requires in order for us to send e-mail with mail gone awry.

5

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:25,200
So if I go to the doc's real quick here and you're going to say Clarabelle send email I'll show you

6

00:00:25,200  -->  00:00:27,140
right now.

7

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:32,310
There is a package called Gause old HTP that we have to require.

8

00:00:32,340  -->  00:00:32,910
OK.

9

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:34,950
So let's do that.

10

00:00:34,990  -->  00:00:36,360
That's clear.

11

00:00:36,360  -->  00:00:52,120
These are real quick and let's just require composer require his goals Gozal h t t p and then goes like

12

00:00:52,120  -->  00:00:54,760
this.

13

00:00:55,080  -->  00:00:55,580
All right.

14

00:00:55,620  -->  00:00:57,960
Answer.

15

00:00:59,180  -->  00:01:03,040
All right cool mine took like about 10 seconds there.

16

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:09,180
So now once we have this the next step is to set our view real quick.

17

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:16,950
Let's go to resources views and let's just push them actually mail here and bring some of the variables

18

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:17,800
.

19

00:01:18,000  -->  00:01:23,200
Let's just say H-1 And here we're going to put the title.

20

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:25,720
Let's just say p.

21

00:01:26,850  -->  00:01:33,360
And here are with I can't remember these variables are coming from the from these data array here.

22

00:01:33,570  -->  00:01:36,750
This key right here are these keys.

23

00:01:36,750  -->  00:01:37,550
OK.

24

00:01:38,010  -->  00:01:41,010
All right so let's change this a little bit elysÃ©e.

25

00:01:41,130  -->  00:01:42,990
Where are you coming back.

26

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:45,480
Let's just make sure we spell it correctly.

27

00:01:45,480  -->  00:01:46,810
Why are you coming back.

28

00:01:46,840  -->  00:01:55,350
I was in your neighborhood last time and I could not find my way back.

29

00:01:57,120  -->  00:01:58,400
Hi.

30

00:01:59,160  -->  00:02:01,710
Hi.

31

00:02:03,750  -->  00:02:06,130
What's up.

32

00:02:06,130  -->  00:02:08,140
Has actually escaped.

33

00:02:09,030  -->  00:02:11,670
There we go.

34

00:02:11,970  -->  00:02:14,920
It's here and there.

35

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:16,250
All right cool.

36

00:02:16,260  -->  00:02:18,240
So I think we are ready to send e-mail.

37

00:02:18,270  -->  00:02:23,650
Let's go to our answer.

38

00:02:25,050  -->  00:02:28,930
And we have this little problem right here OK.

39

00:02:29,010  -->  00:02:29,570
All right.

40

00:02:29,580  -->  00:02:35,760
So I think got an issue like this one time and I remembered the way we solve this.

41

00:02:35,930  -->  00:02:41,850
And the way I solved it was going to and you can probably find a permanent solution for this.

42

00:02:41,850  -->  00:02:44,190
For this Assos a difficult problem.

43

00:02:44,190  -->  00:02:48,620
If you look at if you get higher and copy and paste it on google and try to find it.

44

00:02:48,930  -->  00:02:51,020
I think I sold it like this.

45

00:02:51,060  -->  00:02:57,220
Let me see if I will go to the vendor and we'll look for that specific specific package.

46

00:02:57,220  -->  00:03:01,650
Let's make sure you synchronize that he's there for us to find it.

47

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:02,600
Gozal.

48

00:03:02,600  -->  00:03:03,750
All right.

49

00:03:04,110  -->  00:03:11,220
Then as it goes or this Gordis source code and here require a quick

50

00:03:17,400  -->  00:03:21,190
configure the Fords here this is where we.

51

00:03:21,690  -->  00:03:29,560
So let's turn this off to verification and let's make it false.

52

00:03:29,580  -->  00:03:31,900
All right cool.

53

00:03:31,970  -->  00:03:34,170
Nothing else that we get a check here real quick.

54

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:40,530
This is a little bit more avenges guys are not going to get into detail of all this but I'm just showing

55

00:03:40,530  -->  00:03:42,870
you how to connect to an API and send e-mail.

56

00:03:42,870  -->  00:03:47,000
There are many drivers out there that you can use with of L.K..

57

00:03:47,100  -->  00:03:50,550
Let's make sure that this works now OK looks like it's working.

58

00:03:50,550  -->  00:03:57,890
I'm going to go to my e-mail and find to see if I have something there.

59

00:03:59,340  -->  00:04:04,530
All right looks like I got the message on I show it to you right here if you can see that.

60

00:04:04,530  -->  00:04:06,660
You see that.

61

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:07,810
I just got it right now.

62

00:04:07,810  -->  00:04:09,630
It's come in via mail gone.

63

00:04:09,690  -->  00:04:12,600
We've got the title there and we've got the content.

64

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:13,260
All right.

65

00:04:13,530  -->  00:04:14,830
Pretty cool stuff right.

66

00:04:15,060  -->  00:04:20,730
So we are able to send e-mail with just this driver guys.

67

00:04:20,730  -->  00:04:22,280
There are many other drivers.

68

00:04:22,440  -->  00:04:28,560
You can also use BHB male function to do this a mandrill which is really cool.

69

00:04:28,650  -->  00:04:32,850
And if you go back to your male gun statistics.

70

00:04:32,930  -->  00:04:36,580
All right let's go back here and let's just check the logs.

71

00:04:36,780  -->  00:04:42,210
You could see that we have some logs here that you can check.

72

00:04:42,240  -->  00:04:43,140
All right.

73

00:04:43,530  -->  00:04:44,710
Pretty cool stuff.

74

00:04:44,730  -->  00:04:46,280
You can even build mailing lists.

75

00:04:46,290  -->  00:04:52,530
And we are probably going to create a course on that to how people subscribe to our courses and to our

76

00:04:52,580  -->  00:04:57,810
Web sites or applications and then send e-mails or automatic e-mails.

77

00:04:57,810  -->  00:04:58,200
All right.

78

00:04:58,200  -->  00:05:04,070
But on this course we're going to focus on build in our application which is not a meeting application

79

00:05:04,080  -->  00:05:08,300
but but anyway routes tracking right here.

80

00:05:08,390  -->  00:05:10,470
And you can see some information.

81

00:05:10,470  -->  00:05:11,070
All right.

82

00:05:11,340  -->  00:05:17,060
So anyway thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you in the next lectures
