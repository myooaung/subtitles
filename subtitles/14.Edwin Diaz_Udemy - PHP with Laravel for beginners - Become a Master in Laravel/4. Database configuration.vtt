3

00:00:08.760  -->  00:00:10.320
All right cool.

4

00:00:10.380  -->  00:00:12.950
Let's make sure that you get there.

5

00:00:13.090  -->  00:00:15.350
I am waiting for you.

6

00:00:16.480  -->  00:00:17.330
All right cool.

7

00:00:17.460  -->  00:00:21.390
So now in this lecture you were going to create that database right.

8

00:00:21.390  -->  00:00:25.920
We're going to create a database and we're going to configure it in our in our in EMV file.

9

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:26.770
All right.

10

00:00:27.210  -->  00:00:28.260
All right.

11

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:28.640
All right.

12

00:00:28.650  -->  00:00:31.260
Let's go to BHB my admin real quick.

13

00:00:31.260  -->  00:00:32.540
Let's create a database.

14

00:00:32.550  -->  00:00:37.920
Let's call it cold hacking and in real life guys you never want to do that you never actually name a

15

00:00:37.920  -->  00:00:40.170
database the same name as your domain.

16

00:00:40.180  -->  00:00:40.510
Right.

17

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:42.000
Don't ever do that.

18

00:00:42.160  -->  00:00:45.330
You can see you can smell the security issue from here right.

19

00:00:45.900  -->  00:00:47.860
I can you can smell it from anywhere.

20

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:49.130
When you have that.

21

00:00:49.190  -->  00:00:50.240
All right.

22

00:00:50.270  -->  00:00:52.020
Use a name route.

23

00:00:52.080  -->  00:00:55.420
We have done this so many times I can talk to you and do it right.

24

00:00:55.710  -->  00:00:57.600
All right cool.

25

00:00:57.600  -->  00:01:00.440
You can test this out by doing a really quick migration.

26

00:01:00.450  -->  00:01:07.550
So BHP areason migrate now rights as they migrated to tables.

27

00:01:07.560  -->  00:01:09.840
Let's check it out real quick.

28

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:10.830
All right.

29

00:01:10.830  -->  00:01:15.390
Three tables actually forgot the migrations table.

30

00:01:15.390  -->  00:01:16.170
All right.

31

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:19.870
So our database is set up is created and we are set.

32

00:01:19.920  -->  00:01:21.610
We are actually ready to go guys.

33

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:24.480
