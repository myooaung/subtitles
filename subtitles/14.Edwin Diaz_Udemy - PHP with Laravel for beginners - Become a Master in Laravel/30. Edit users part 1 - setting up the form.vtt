00:00:00.390  -->  00:00:05.580
All right welcome back my students so it's tough for us to star edit in our users right.

2

00:00:05.580  -->  00:00:10.600
We need a way for us to click on the user and go to another page where we edit the user.

3

00:00:10.650  -->  00:00:11.850
That's going to be pretty cool.

4

00:00:11.850  -->  00:00:12.450
All right.

5

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:18.840
Now I know you guys want pictures so I got pictures for you in this lecture you can download a folder

6

00:00:18.840  -->  00:00:22.500
with a bunch of little pictures that I got prepare for this course of course.

7

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:28.260
We got some of the pictures or the pictures that we have from all the projects in here but we also have

8

00:00:28.260  -->  00:00:30.760
some very attractive people for the ladies here.

9

00:00:30.790  -->  00:00:33.070
We as all men are I.

10

00:00:33.210  -->  00:00:36.810
And we have some women for the men.

11

00:00:36.810  -->  00:00:37.390
There you go.

12

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:39.200
As you can see I don't discriminate.

13

00:00:39.230  -->  00:00:40.340
Blondin.

14

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:41.550
All right.

15

00:00:41.850  -->  00:00:43.860
So cool stuff.

16

00:00:43.870  -->  00:00:49.530
All right I'm going include my self in this for the here just in case you want to see your instructor

17

00:00:49.530  -->  00:00:51.030
.

18

00:00:51.030  -->  00:00:51.840
All right guys.

19

00:00:51.930  -->  00:00:57.100
All right so another we got some laughs and we are doing this let's get down to business.

20

00:00:57.130  -->  00:00:57.990
Right.

21

00:00:58.020  -->  00:00:58.410
All right.

22

00:00:58.410  -->  00:01:08.160
So we're going to copy the create form and we're going to go to the edit and paste it in there and then

23

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:11.220
we're going to modify this a little bit right.

24

00:01:11.220  -->  00:01:13.130
We're going to edit the user.

25

00:01:13.800  -->  00:01:18.410
And here we are going to convert this into a form.

26

00:01:18.480  -->  00:01:21.280
We're going to do form model binding.

27

00:01:21.300  -->  00:01:22.460
Remember what that is.

28

00:01:22.470  -->  00:01:24.140
We do this.

29

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:26.510
We pass the user.

30

00:01:27.630  -->  00:01:28.140
OK.

31

00:01:28.140  -->  00:01:31.310
And we're going to do that now in the edit it controller.

32

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:32.400
All right.

33

00:01:33.030  -->  00:01:36.290
As a matter of fact let's go there and do it now so that what you don't get confused.

34

00:01:36.300  -->  00:01:40.700
All right let's go to the admin uses controller.

35

00:01:41.430  -->  00:01:45.850
Let's go to the edit right here.

36

00:01:46.280  -->  00:01:46.970
OK.

37

00:01:47.130  -->  00:01:51.570
So now what we're going to do here is going to find the user.

38

00:01:51.570  -->  00:01:58.790
So we're going to see user find or fail right here with it.

39

00:01:58.790  -->  00:02:05.360
With that Id come in from from here and we're going to pass it into the I mean users.

40

00:02:06.000  -->  00:02:08.220
I don't know why I keep having that there.

41

00:02:08.260  -->  00:02:14.390
I mean users that end it and pass it in like this.

42

00:02:15.310  -->  00:02:16.140
OK.

43

00:02:16.730  -->  00:02:18.240
Good stuff.

44

00:02:18.240  -->  00:02:19.450
All right.

45

00:02:20.280  -->  00:02:26.490
Another thing that we need before we get going into more is that we need to go to the end of the user

46

00:02:26.880  -->  00:02:28.220
and we need to put a link somewhere.

47

00:02:28.260  -->  00:02:35.300
I think it would be good to put a link on the name of the user or the photo but the name is fine as

48

00:02:35.300  -->  00:02:39.630
to the name first.

49

00:02:40.030  -->  00:02:40.260
All

50

00:02:43.140  -->  00:02:54.360
right so here when I say route I want you to take whoever clicks here to admin that users that add it

51

00:02:54.660  -->  00:02:57.810
and also take their I.D. with it with it.

52

00:02:57.930  -->  00:03:00.210
So I pass as a second parameter.

53

00:03:00.210  -->  00:03:02.240
All right.

54

00:03:02.250  -->  00:03:02.780
All right.

55

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:07.530
So let's go back to edit users at it and make sure that this is a patch

56

00:03:11.850  -->  00:03:18.130
patch and this is going to update.

57

00:03:18.540  -->  00:03:19.830
Let's look at it real quick.

58

00:03:19.840  -->  00:03:20.140
All right.

59

00:03:20.140  -->  00:03:27.150
I think it's going to give us an error maybe not just don't check it yeah it's going to get an error

60

00:03:27.200  -->  00:03:35.690
saying that he's missing that you or I or I I mean you're missing a parameter there somewhere.

61

00:03:35.700  -->  00:03:36.720
All right let's go back.

62

00:03:36.730  -->  00:03:39.240
I think we made a little booboo here somewhere.

63

00:03:39.250  -->  00:03:40.070
So

64

00:03:43.900  -->  00:03:49.210
I mean users user ID.

65

00:03:51.000  -->  00:03:51.600
That's weird

66

00:03:55.320  -->  00:03:58.600
missing required parameter for roud admin users update.

67

00:03:58.630  -->  00:04:00.040
OK I gotcha.

68

00:04:00.090  -->  00:04:01.020
That's not here.

69

00:04:01.030  -->  00:04:04.180
That's And it's in the form.

70

00:04:04.170  -->  00:04:07.920
Right here we're missing this parameter so I thought I was going to be able to do it so I can show you

71

00:04:07.920  -->  00:04:10.320
what the model binding for modern binding is.

72

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:13.960
But you guys already know that so let's just finish it up right here.

73

00:04:14.100  -->  00:04:15.500
Choose me.

74

00:04:15.680  -->  00:04:16.170
All right.

75

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:18.690
So let's close this up a little bit

76

00:04:21.020  -->  00:04:23.180
actually.

77

00:04:23.400  -->  00:04:24.390
Yeah that's fine.

78

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:29.090
And here we're going to pass in the User ID.

79

00:04:30.130  -->  00:04:30.540
OK

80

00:04:34.020  -->  00:04:37.730
enter and supporter.

81

00:04:37.770  -->  00:04:40.690
Oh I see.

82

00:04:42.630  -->  00:04:44.480
OK.

83

00:04:44.490  -->  00:04:47.520
Let's make sure we get that there.

84

00:04:48.230  -->  00:04:51.690
And for all we are not passing in roles here.

85

00:04:51.690  -->  00:04:55.020
So we still need to do a little work on these guys.

86

00:04:55.020  -->  00:05:08.590
All right so let's go back to our users here and we need to passing roles.

87

00:05:09.120  -->  00:05:13.010
So we need to do the same thing we did in your create method.

88

00:05:13.170  -->  00:05:14.770
We need to do it here.

89

00:05:14.850  -->  00:05:27.150
All right so we see a role in this and we're going to pass in the name of the role and the I.D. and

90

00:05:27.210  -->  00:05:29.100
all.

91

00:05:30.510  -->  00:05:31.090
OK.

92

00:05:31.290  -->  00:05:42.030
Make sure that we pass it in here as well rolls or right now if we go back to where we go.

93

00:05:42.030  -->  00:05:47.380
It works now and we have all the rules here as you can see.

94

00:05:47.650  -->  00:05:48.340
All right.

95

00:05:48.360  -->  00:05:52.440
And this user obviously is an administrator if I click on Peter.

96

00:05:52.440  -->  00:05:55.570
Peter is and I mean sure we got to fix that in a minute.

97

00:05:56.350  -->  00:05:57.410
All right.

98

00:05:58.050  -->  00:06:00.560
But this is working now.

99

00:06:00.570  -->  00:06:04.000
Let's go back to users.

100

00:06:04.230  -->  00:06:06.770
We're passing this here.

101

00:06:08.070  -->  00:06:08.550
OK.

102

00:06:08.580  -->  00:06:12.690
Oh let's convert this into a model.

103

00:06:12.690  -->  00:06:14.660
Passing the user here.

104

00:06:15.360  -->  00:06:16.290
And that's it.

105

00:06:16.420  -->  00:06:19.180
Let's see if now we get the users information.

106

00:06:19.190  -->  00:06:24.080
Now as you can see now we're getting all of the users information.

107

00:06:24.410  -->  00:06:25.030
All right.

108

00:06:25.170  -->  00:06:33.880
So now we know that these guys this person Maria is a subscriber right now active.

109

00:06:33.990  -->  00:06:35.270
Let's look at it Peter.

110

00:06:35.280  -->  00:06:38.040
Peter is now active we've got to pass that into.

111

00:06:38.040  -->  00:06:39.620
It will be nice to pass out from the data.

112

00:06:39.640  -->  00:06:40.600
He's a swell guy.

113

00:06:40.620  -->  00:06:43.350
I think we're going to have to do that here for the added user.

114

00:06:43.700  -->  00:06:44.240
OK.

115

00:06:44.460  -->  00:06:49.380
But as you can see we're getting all the information and we're actually having a lot of fun here guys

116

00:06:49.400  -->  00:06:49.550
.

117

00:06:49.660  -->  00:06:55.710
And now that we've got to do is set up an image section here so that where we can bring down the image

118

00:06:55.770  -->  00:07:01.050
from the use and we're going to do this in the left side here we bring down the image from the user

119

00:07:01.080  -->  00:07:07.680
and we king real blow a differing image to it to that field the right to the database as well.

120

00:07:07.680  -->  00:07:09.930
So anyway we're going to do that in the next lecture.

121

00:07:09.930  -->  00:07:11.910
Take care and have fun.

122

00:07:11.910  -->  00:07:12.330
Bye bye
