00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:05.130
All right welcome back my students so we're going to create a new Larabee solution for this section

2

00:00:05.130  -->  00:00:07.270
here just because I want to keep things clean.

3

00:00:07.470  -->  00:00:13.720
And just because I would really like to add more lectures in the future so that makes it easy to add

4

00:00:13.720  -->  00:00:17.730
lectures since it's just going to be this installation for mailing.

5

00:00:17.730  -->  00:00:18.400
OK.

6

00:00:18.610  -->  00:00:22.230
So I was going to make it easy for you to reference your files is going to make it easier for me to

7

00:00:22.230  -->  00:00:23.890
add new lectures in the future.

8

00:00:24.210  -->  00:00:25.460
If you guys are requesting.

9

00:00:25.700  -->  00:00:26.220
All right.

10

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:28.170
So let's create a new Larabee project.

11

00:00:28.170  -->  00:00:33.950
I'm going to go and press my up arrow key and I already have this here so I just type in mail.

12

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:36.010
That's going to be the name or our application.

13

00:00:36.150  -->  00:00:39.630
I'm going to describe here the 5.2 to 9 version.

14

00:00:39.630  -->  00:00:45.580
You can do like I you know you don't have to do this but I will.

15

00:00:46.460  -->  00:00:47.030
OK.

16

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:53.840
Just to make sure that if you are following this your project work works exactly like mine.

17

00:00:53.850  -->  00:00:54.450
OK.

18

00:00:54.580  -->  00:00:56.710
That would be the reason for you to follow the same version.

19

00:00:56.850  -->  00:00:58.980
But remember them all is going to keep updating this.

20

00:00:58.980  -->  00:00:59.400
OK.

21

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:06.870
So make sure that you create a new project set up your whole set up your virtual host restart your server

22

00:01:07.170  -->  00:01:09.110
and get ready to go I'm going to pause the video.

23

00:01:09.120  -->  00:01:11.630
I'm going to do it right now you're not going to see me doing it.

24

00:01:11.850  -->  00:01:12.790
I want you to do it.

25

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:13.080
All right.

26

00:01:13.080  -->  00:01:14.250
Get used to that.

27

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:17.130
All right some parts of the video everything should be done in my site.

28

00:01:17.250  -->  00:01:19.590
Make sure that you do it in yours.

29

00:01:20.410  -->  00:01:22.710
Tom Doney my side are not by your side.

30

00:01:22.700  -->  00:01:28.740
I got my virtual wholesale shrine to you right now so I got this going.

31

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:29.490
Done.

32

00:01:29.820  -->  00:01:30.650
OK.

33

00:01:30.900  -->  00:01:39.080
As a matter of fact I'm going to change this here to save me to where we go.

34

00:01:39.810  -->  00:01:42.210
All right so my virtual holes are good.

35

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:46.420
My holes are good as well.

36

00:01:46.470  -->  00:01:53.310
You can see I got that IP to the mail that the Eevee array and I restarted my server and everything

37

00:01:53.310  -->  00:01:54.470
should be working.

38

00:01:54.750  -->  00:01:54.980
All right.

39

00:01:54.990  -->  00:02:00.580
So if I go to mail DV I will go.

40

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:01.210
All right.

41

00:02:01.230  -->  00:02:03.440
Make sure your stuff is working as well.

42

00:02:03.510  -->  00:02:04.350
Your installation.

43

00:02:04.350  -->  00:02:06.310
And I'll see you in the next lectures.

44

00:02:06.330  -->  00:02:08.250
Take care.
