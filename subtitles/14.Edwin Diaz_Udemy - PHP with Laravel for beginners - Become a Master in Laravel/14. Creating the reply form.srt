00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,590
All right welcome back my story.

2

00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:04,950
So we got to work on this page here for our replies right.

3

00:00:05,280  -->  00:00:07,320
Well we don't have any replies right now.

4

00:00:07,320  -->  00:00:12,770
We do have a reply's table but we don't have any replies.

5

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:14,050
All right.

6

00:00:14,190  -->  00:00:18,900
So let's actually work on the Create for functionality.

7

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:19,620
Let's do that.

8

00:00:19,620  -->  00:00:20,540
Why don't we do that.

9

00:00:20,580  -->  00:00:23,410
It's very simple to do.

10

00:00:23,520  -->  00:00:29,770
It's going to take a little bit of time since we're gonna have to modify a couple of things but you

11

00:00:30,160  -->  00:00:31,840
should be really easy.

12

00:00:31,860  -->  00:00:33,120
All right.

13

00:00:33,860  -->  00:00:34,720
OK.

14

00:00:35,310  -->  00:00:40,300
Let's go here to.

15

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:51,060
Well first you got to do is figure out how where does nested device.

16

00:00:51,150  -->  00:01:02,020
So as you can see right there let's just take it from there and take this file and paste it right here

17

00:01:02,050  -->  00:01:02,220
.

18

00:01:02,360  -->  00:01:03,980
Right below this guy right here.

19

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:06,840
So let's see how that looks real quick

20

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:11,010
as you can see it looks good.

21

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:12,230
That's the way it is.

22

00:01:12,510  -->  00:01:14,100
All right.

23

00:01:14,580  -->  00:01:19,320
Now we got to figure out where we got to put that reply form.

24

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:25,650
We have to build this reply form and we have to find a way to put it in here somewhere.

25

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:26,400
So

26

00:01:29,660  -->  00:01:37,760
I think right below these media media body right here should be a form.

27

00:01:37,770  -->  00:01:47,670
Let's just see how that looks in there OK let's form and let's open one form here and this is going

28

00:01:47,670  -->  00:01:56,880
to the store method and to to to to to do common replies

29

00:01:59,910  -->  00:02:00,570
controller

30

00:02:08,900  -->  00:02:12,440
right.

31

00:02:15,400  -->  00:02:27,680
Whilst this should be a tÃªtes area and it's Shumi body we're going to fix the security later.

32

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:35,430
We might have to create a maybe a custom method so that way this form can not send any more requests

33

00:02:35,440  -->  00:02:38,170
or anything else.

34

00:02:38,430  -->  00:02:45,170
If you remember this is inside our admin middleware.

35

00:02:45,690  -->  00:02:53,910
If you wan we could create a group just for users there are not.

36

00:02:53,910  -->  00:03:01,030
Then instead create a custom method just to send down request there instead of giving access to all

37

00:03:01,050  -->  00:03:04,680
this in the admin section.

38

00:03:04,710  -->  00:03:05,270
All right.

39

00:03:05,490  -->  00:03:09,280
So as a matter of fact let's just do a real quick

40

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:21,960
and this will give access to the user that's logged in and

41

00:03:26,190  -->  00:03:32,720
we can just create a get.

42

00:03:32,940  -->  00:03:36,240
This is actually not a get or post post

43

00:03:38,640  -->  00:03:47,160
and it could be a comment reply like this.

44

00:03:47,160  -->  00:03:48,630
And he goes to the comment

45

00:03:57,070  -->  00:03:58,420
replies controller

46

00:04:01,830  -->  00:04:04,210
and he goes to the mat.

47

00:04:04,830  -->  00:04:11,690
I don't know create We're going to create them meant to now create a reply or something.

48

00:04:11,690  -->  00:04:12,790
All right.

49

00:04:13,560  -->  00:04:19,140
And now if we go to the comments replies controller

50

00:04:22,120  -->  00:04:23,580
that's do it all the way.

51

00:04:23,590  -->  00:04:29,790
Actually that's too close to store we could take store out of there if we want to but I'm going to do

52

00:04:29,790  -->  00:04:35,490
it right below here so you see that is different create.

53

00:04:35,520  -->  00:04:40,360
I believe that's the name reply.

54

00:04:43,260  -->  00:04:53,040
And this mentor is going to have their requests just as they were on top and return to functionality

55

00:04:53,040  -->  00:04:54,410
right here.

56

00:04:55,260  -->  00:05:00,980
It works OK.

57

00:05:01,440  -->  00:05:02,010
So

58

00:05:06,570  -->  00:05:08,280
create a reply

59

00:05:12,540  -->  00:05:13,710
then send the body there

60

00:05:27,010  -->  00:05:28,650
to its area.

61

00:05:28,680  -->  00:05:31,910
Let's create another row here.

62

00:05:32,850  -->  00:05:37,980
Well I'm not sure you Rose maybe one.

63

00:05:38,520  -->  00:05:39,670
I don't know how that looks.

64

00:05:39,690  -->  00:05:40,970
But let's try it.

65

00:05:41,030  -->  00:05:42,050
And fine now.

66

00:05:42,090  -->  00:05:44,970
And that's how it looks.

67

00:05:44,970  -->  00:05:50,290
Let's submit this and we go to that method.

68

00:05:50,340  -->  00:05:53,400
All right cool.

69

00:05:53,520  -->  00:05:56,300
So we're going to finish this in the next lecture.

70

00:05:56,390  -->  00:05:59,070
Are we're going to try to go that way.

71

00:05:59,080  -->  00:06:00,360
Some comments.

72

00:06:00,750  -->  00:06:08,200
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture actually submits replies.

73

00:06:08,280  -->  00:06:09,060
Take care.

74

00:06:09,060  -->  00:06:10,160
See you in the next lecture
