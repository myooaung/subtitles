1

00:00:00,300  -->  00:00:01,580
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:06,830
This stood and so we getting arrows to errors in our application but that's fine right because what

3

00:00:06,850  -->  00:00:08,490
are doing right now is upgrading.

4

00:00:08,700  -->  00:00:09,120
All right.

5

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:12,560
Now for that we have to upgrade our application this way.

6

00:00:12,570  -->  00:00:13,060
Right.

7

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:15,260
And it's not alarm bells for either guys.

8

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:16,620
Come on don't get upset at them.

9

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:23,730
All right let's fix this so we've got this raÃºl error here and this is because we need to find the name

10

00:00:23,730  -->  00:00:25,860
of our routes right now.

11

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:27,010
All right.

12

00:00:27,030  -->  00:00:27,810
Get out of here.

13

00:00:27,810  -->  00:00:30,190
I should have just clicked.

14

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:32,730
Don't show me again but I forgot.

15

00:00:32,760  -->  00:00:40,540
Anyway so what's going on here is that we are getting these routes we are Laro they always omitting

16

00:00:40,560  -->  00:00:51,120
the first parameter here and we got the second parameter and we are defining this in our layouts.

17

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:54,390
Let's go to resources real quick.

18

00:00:54,390  -->  00:01:01,890
So if we go to layouts real quick and we go in Admin we can see that we are saying admin post create

19

00:01:01,910  -->  00:01:01,950
.

20

00:01:01,980  -->  00:01:02,420
OK.

21

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:03,710
Yeah yeah.

22

00:01:03,900  -->  00:01:07,680
So no yeah we can come here and do this and take it off.

23

00:01:07,680  -->  00:01:09,140
But why do that.

24

00:01:09,180  -->  00:01:15,210
We are actually calling this dynamically all right by the name so we can go to Web.

25

00:01:15,810  -->  00:01:23,370
Let's actually find that up here on where we go web and we can actually start defining that need those

26

00:01:23,370  -->  00:01:24,660
names right here.

27

00:01:24,690  -->  00:01:27,260
All right customer names for applications.

28

00:01:27,270  -->  00:01:28,300
How we do that well.

29

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:29,250
Let me show you.

30

00:01:29,460  -->  00:01:33,340
So we having a problem with admin users and it's OK.

31

00:01:33,650  -->  00:01:35,190
Good.

32

00:01:35,250  -->  00:01:35,450
All right.

33

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:42,870
Let's actually create an array right here let's put a coma and let's give this array a key in this key

34

00:01:42,870  -->  00:01:45,300
is going to be called names.

35

00:01:45,500  -->  00:01:52,130
And now we just actually put another way inside this array and we bring it down.

36

00:01:53,310  -->  00:02:01,660
And now we're going to say OK I mean users and it's I want you to go to and it's off.

37

00:02:02,600  -->  00:02:10,010
Then that's off admin dot users in it.

38

00:02:10,760  -->  00:02:12,270
That's it.

39

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:19,180
So basically here you find a way you want to go where you want it to go to what method basically and

40

00:02:19,810  -->  00:02:21,630
your the name or your route.

41

00:02:21,810  -->  00:02:23,910
So if we come here it's going to give us another error.

42

00:02:23,910  -->  00:02:26,030
OK don't worry about that we're going to fix that in a minute.

43

00:02:26,220  -->  00:02:28,400
As you can see now we have create error.

44

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:33,150
So it's missing all the methods here.

45

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:37,440
So we've got create and we do this all routes right now guys.

46

00:02:37,440  -->  00:02:38,100
All right.

47

00:02:38,460  -->  00:02:43,320
So if you want to go ahead and do that you can just do it for the routes that we've got down here.

48

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:50,760
I'm going to do it right now just because some of you like me to do this even though it's a lot of typing

49

00:02:50,760  -->  00:02:52,310
.

50

00:02:52,320  -->  00:02:54,620
All right so they create goes to I mean users create.

51

00:02:54,630  -->  00:02:55,340
OK.

52

00:02:55,620  -->  00:02:57,540
And then we go what are we got what is it.

53

00:02:57,540  -->  00:02:59,530
That's one store

54

00:03:02,010  -->  00:03:12,320
and this one actually you know what let's just copy this guy right here and copy him one more time.

55

00:03:12,360  -->  00:03:15,090
So here I just going to change this for a store

56

00:03:18,990  -->  00:03:22,840
and this one for edit.

57

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:25,980
All right.

58

00:03:26,910  -->  00:03:27,990
Let's look at it now.

59

00:03:28,000  -->  00:03:32,010
We're going to get another arrow going to get and that's error's for comments or something like that

60

00:03:32,210  -->  00:03:32,730
folks.

61

00:03:32,730  -->  00:03:33,550
All right.

62

00:03:33,840  -->  00:03:36,240
So we've got polls that's and that's Raut right here.

63

00:03:36,240  -->  00:03:38,510
So we'll do the same thing to this route.

64

00:03:39,560  -->  00:03:40,240
All right.

65

00:03:40,530  -->  00:03:46,150
And you can go ahead and forward the video and do it yourself if you want.

66

00:03:48,060  -->  00:03:51,440
This is actually another array.

67

00:03:53,300  -->  00:03:54,250
Yes that's fine.

68

00:03:54,300  -->  00:03:56,510
We just need to call me right here.

69

00:03:57,150  -->  00:03:57,950
All right.

70

00:03:58,470  -->  00:04:02,500
And then just going to copy this guy right here because I don't want to type so much.

71

00:04:02,880  -->  00:04:03,790
Let's take the last one.

72

00:04:03,790  -->  00:04:05,020
We don't need it.

73

00:04:06,240  -->  00:04:10,800
And this is going to be out in the polls polls

74

00:04:13,590  -->  00:04:14,280
polls

75

00:04:20,100  -->  00:04:24,660
polls that we go and let's do this one

76

00:04:28,310  -->  00:04:29,030
names.

77

00:04:29,070  -->  00:04:30,160
Whoops.

78

00:04:30,730  -->  00:04:32,550
I went ahead of myself there for a minute

79

00:04:35,780  -->  00:04:36,790
.

80

00:04:37,250  -->  00:04:39,270
We forgot to call my Here again

81

00:04:41,970  -->  00:04:50,740
and this is category's So we're going to go and see categories and we're getting better at it.

82

00:04:50,760  -->  00:05:02,540
Right guys go nice and let's do this one.

83

00:05:05,940  -->  00:05:07,110
Let's not forget this guy

84

00:05:11,040  -->  00:05:13,580
.

85

00:05:15,090  -->  00:05:16,110
It's fine

86

00:05:24,270  -->  00:05:24,980
to the media.

87

00:05:24,980  -->  00:05:25,620
Real quick

88

00:05:28,310  -->  00:05:33,370
.

89

00:05:37,140  -->  00:05:40,410
I don't know where my hand is slipping so much guys.

90

00:05:41,230  -->  00:05:45,740
I guess the coffee by the way I'm not drinking coffee anymore.

91

00:05:46,380  -->  00:05:52,040
For those of you that follow me for throughout the whole course I always talk about coffee.

92

00:05:52,120  -->  00:05:55,550
I started being bad to my stomach for some reason.

93

00:05:55,560  -->  00:06:00,080
We're going to click here he says I'm in polls and it is not fine.

94

00:06:00,870  -->  00:06:01,610
All right.

95

00:06:01,660  -->  00:06:08,590
That is strange oddment polls and it's

96

00:06:14,190  -->  00:06:15,700
hmm

97

00:06:17,880  -->  00:06:20,270
that's weird because we are finding it right there.

98

00:06:20,280  -->  00:06:23,290
Right.

99

00:06:25,970  -->  00:06:27,450
Let's go back and refresh

100

00:06:32,880  -->  00:06:36,160
let's look at it real carefully.

101

00:06:37,590  -->  00:06:39,650
So we've got this error here.

102

00:06:40,130  -->  00:06:44,680
I mean polls and it's that we need to take care.

103

00:06:44,730  -->  00:06:45,390
All right.

104

00:06:45,660  -->  00:06:46,320
So

105

00:06:49,530  -->  00:06:54,260
all that's right we are forgetting to put names on.

106

00:06:54,270  -->  00:06:59,250
Here we go.

107

00:06:59,250  -->  00:07:01,130
All right.

108

00:07:02,450  -->  00:07:06,270

00:07:17,730  -->  00:07:19,290
Sorry about that guys.

112

00:07:19,500  -->  00:07:24,540
Like I said my computer sometimes does this stuff and I turn up to do it.

113

00:07:24,940  -->  00:07:26,220
Well she still does it.

114

00:07:26,220  -->  00:07:31,770
All right let's just open a window right here.

115

00:07:31,770  -->  00:07:31,980
All right.

116

00:07:31,980  -->  00:07:35,290
We've got comments we've got to work them comments.

117

00:07:35,420  -->  00:07:37,430
All right.

118

00:07:37,870  -->  00:07:39,330
A couple more here.

119

00:07:39,330  -->  00:07:39,800
All right.

120

00:07:39,810  -->  00:07:42,850
Don't get impatient.

121

00:07:42,930  -->  00:07:43,700
I mean

122

00:07:49,710  -->  00:07:55,150
this needs to be wrapped here.

123

00:07:59,190  -->  00:08:04,710
All right let's do this one too and

124

00:08:07,620  -->  00:08:11,680
we'll fix this if we are wrong and the next lecture guys.

125

00:08:11,700  -->  00:08:17,340
I mean in the next lecture we're next following a lecture but we're just doing this balk at it in here

126

00:08:17,340  -->  00:08:18,000
.

127

00:08:18,000  -->  00:08:18,910
We should be good.

128

00:08:19,140  -->  00:08:19,630
All right.

129

00:08:19,640  -->  00:08:21,430
Anything we use We'll fix it.

130

00:08:21,620  -->  00:08:25,830
Let's just copy this guy here so we don't have to type in so much.

131

00:08:25,860  -->  00:08:28,680
So comments we can look at the comments

132

00:08:34,270  -->  00:08:37,350
and replies.

133

00:08:39,090  -->  00:08:43,990
I don't know if we have these routes for these replies but we'll find out.

134

00:08:44,880  -->  00:08:45,890
All right.

135

00:08:46,530  -->  00:08:50,150
All right so all the other names that are the key and all of that.

136

00:08:50,190  -->  00:08:51,150
All right cool.

137

00:08:51,270  -->  00:08:54,180
Let's check it out.

138

00:08:54,180  -->  00:09:01,390
All right we got a error here and that I should be very noticeable.

139

00:09:02,700  -->  00:09:05,450
And that arrow is on line at 97.

140

00:09:05,450  -->  00:09:07,310
There we go.

141

00:09:07,470  -->  00:09:10,950
What's going on here.

142

00:09:10,950  -->  00:09:12,190
All right.

143

00:09:12,810  -->  00:09:14,140
Check it out.

144

00:09:14,690  -->  00:09:17,000
And we guy living OK.

145

00:09:18,020  -->  00:09:20,590
111.

146

00:09:21,150  -->  00:09:22,830
We've got an extra one there.

147

00:09:22,830  -->  00:09:23,810
That's what we had.

148

00:09:23,820  -->  00:09:24,940
Well I had.

149

00:09:25,320  -->  00:09:26,280
I'm pretty sure you didn't.

150

00:09:26,310  -->  00:09:27,100
So all right.

151

00:09:27,120  -->  00:09:29,640
We got it to work.

152

00:09:29,980  -->  00:09:31,620
Wow guys.

153

00:09:31,620  -->  00:09:34,380
All right let's go to users.

154

00:09:34,380  -->  00:09:34,980
All right.

155

00:09:34,980  -->  00:09:38,340
We're getting something here.

156

00:09:38,340  -->  00:09:41,070
All right so we got to go to this lecture here.

157

00:09:41,340  -->  00:09:49,040
And if we go here we should get an error and we've got to fix that on the next lecture.

158

00:09:49,080  -->  00:09:49,770
OK.

159

00:09:49,770  -->  00:09:54,510
Let me take a break because I've been courting for like 12 hours and I need a little break.

160

00:09:54,510  -->  00:09:59,180
All right if you've been calling for more than five you should take a break you're the student.

161

00:09:59,190  -->  00:10:00,080
Take care guys.

162

00:10:00,170  -->  00:10:02,550
I'll see you in the next lecture
