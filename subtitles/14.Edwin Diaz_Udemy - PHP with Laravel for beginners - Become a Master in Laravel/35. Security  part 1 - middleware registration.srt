1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,560
All right.

2

00:00:00,560  -->  00:00:02,620
Welcome back my dear student.

3

00:00:02,730  -->  00:00:08,450
So when this lecture here we're going to create some security for admin all right or admin users should

4

00:00:08,460  -->  00:00:11,280
have a security for this page.

5

00:00:11,310  -->  00:00:15,490
Or I only add me users are logged in only users are logged in.

6

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:21,530
And would a roll of admin and active should be allowed in here.

7

00:00:21,600  -->  00:00:22,280
All right.

8

00:00:22,470  -->  00:00:27,010
So we have an admin that is not active is not going to be allowed either.

9

00:00:28,110  -->  00:00:33,690
So if it's not if is that the reason I mean is Shrader not going in.

10

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:34,290
All right.

11

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:39,340
So the first part of this is one thing that I want you to actually notice here is that every time we

12

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:46,500
of day our records you can see that these changes and different from here you see that 30 seconds ago

13

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:47,360
three hours ago.

14

00:00:47,370  -->  00:00:48,740
So it's pretty cool stuff right.

15

00:00:48,740  -->  00:00:51,070
Carbon makes this really nice.

16

00:00:51,100  -->  00:00:55,690
There's a whole bunch of the documentation with carbon So that's the cloud that deals with data.

17

00:00:55,710  -->  00:00:56,480
By the way.

18

00:00:56,850  -->  00:00:57,350
All right.

19

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:03,970
So let's go and play around with this a little bit and let's create a middleware.

20

00:01:04,200  -->  00:01:08,010
Let's register it and let's create a route group.

21

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:08,400
All right.

22

00:01:08,400  -->  00:01:10,410
A lot of stuff right.

23

00:01:10,440  -->  00:01:14,900
Geez how are we going to have a lot of fun right guys.

24

00:01:15,090  -->  00:01:16,470
Really good fun.

25

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:21,810
So it's Fiore's and make what does it matter where you go.

26

00:01:21,810  -->  00:01:24,690
Sometimes I ask myself a question and answer me.

27

00:01:24,720  -->  00:01:26,660
I don't think that's crazy.

28

00:01:26,670  -->  00:01:28,630
Some people think is a little weird.

29

00:01:28,680  -->  00:01:30,070
I don't worry about it.

30

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:31,370
It's OK.

31

00:01:31,590  -->  00:01:36,310
So this areason make middleware and we're going to call this guy admin.

32

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:38,070
Really good stuff.

33

00:01:38,140  -->  00:01:39,670
All right.

34

00:01:40,230  -->  00:01:42,940
I hope you're awake and not falling asleep.

35

00:01:43,010  -->  00:01:47,970
I don't like that in my class so if you are falling asleep go either get arrests or get some coffee

36

00:01:47,970  -->  00:01:48,810
.

37

00:01:48,810  -->  00:01:49,390
All right.

38

00:01:49,530  -->  00:01:52,040
So middleware admin.

39

00:01:52,050  -->  00:01:52,890
There we go.

40

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:53,430
All right.

41

00:01:53,640  -->  00:02:02,550
Before we do these guys this is a really good time to do some version control.

42

00:02:02,550  -->  00:02:03,260
All right.

43

00:02:03,330  -->  00:02:07,000
So let's actually do it right now before we do anything else.

44

00:02:07,260  -->  00:02:09,260
Let's do get ADD.

45

00:02:09,450  -->  00:02:12,030
We're going to add every day when I say get to it.

46

00:02:12,630  -->  00:02:19,000
So let's make a comment real quick and we're going to say what do we have done here.

47

00:02:19,410  -->  00:02:28,330
Well we got the users working 100 percent right with everything except security.

48

00:02:28,890  -->  00:02:29,400
So

49

00:02:31,740  -->  00:02:43,870
users section working 100 percent minus of security.

50

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:47,210
OK.

51

00:02:47,460  -->  00:02:49,020
Let's say that we go

52

00:02:52,740  -->  00:02:58,200
now we know that if anything happens after this we can roll back to where this was working 100 percent

53

00:02:58,220  -->  00:02:58,430
.

54

00:02:58,650  -->  00:03:00,530
But the only thing that was missing was security.

55

00:03:00,660  -->  00:03:01,450
OK.

56

00:03:01,890  -->  00:03:03,980
All right good stuff.

57

00:03:04,020  -->  00:03:06,530
So now that we have a middle where Let's play around with it a little bit.

58

00:03:06,750  -->  00:03:11,340
Let's register first and let's go to our colonel

59

00:03:14,490  -->  00:03:28,000
and let's name it admin and we know that it is an app HTB controllers and he's on middleware actually

60

00:03:29,550  -->  00:03:31,100
.

61

00:03:32,140  -->  00:03:34,560
See Actually no it's not on controllers.

62

00:03:34,600  -->  00:03:37,920
Whoops isn't middleware.

63

00:03:38,430  -->  00:03:40,510
And then the name is admin.

64

00:03:40,650  -->  00:03:44,410
No it doesn't have that class.

65

00:03:44,970  -->  00:03:47,970
Ok cool.

66

00:03:50,190  -->  00:03:50,550
Whoops.

67

00:03:50,550  -->  00:03:51,180
What am I doing.

68

00:03:51,180  -->  00:03:52,550
What did I do wrong here.

69

00:03:52,620  -->  00:03:55,480
I don't see it or are missing the arrow arrow here.

70

00:03:55,970  -->  00:03:58,870
All right cool.

71

00:03:58,870  -->  00:04:05,870
Now once we have this we can go and create a raÃºl group here.

72

00:04:06,990  -->  00:04:15,770
So let's say around group actually is not groud is group like this.

73

00:04:15,780  -->  00:04:20,970
We go create an array for the middleware.

74

00:04:22,980  -->  00:04:32,940
OK we tell it which made to where we want and we want which one the admin middleware of course create

75

00:04:32,940  -->  00:04:36,600
a second parameter here would be a function.

76

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:38,670
And

77

00:04:45,010  -->  00:04:45,620
there we go

78

00:04:49,650  -->  00:04:50,930
starting to look better now.

79

00:04:50,970  -->  00:04:54,450
Right guys really good.

80

00:04:54,450  -->  00:04:54,930
All right.

81

00:04:55,020  -->  00:04:56,100
So we're got to leave it like this.

82

00:04:56,100  -->  00:05:02,250
Now we did our quite a bit in this lecture and on the next lecture we're going to continue with this

83

00:05:02,250  -->  00:05:04,180
and we're going to have a lot more fun.

84

00:05:04,200  -->  00:05:04,740
Right.

85

00:05:04,740  -->  00:05:07,860
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
