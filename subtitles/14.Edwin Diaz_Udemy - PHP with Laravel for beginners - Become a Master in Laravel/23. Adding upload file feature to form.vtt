00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:00.600
All right.

2

00:00:00.600  -->  00:00:02.140
Welcome back my sister.

3

00:00:02.140  -->  00:00:07.110
And so we are almost done with this form and we have our evaluations we have almost all the fields here

4

00:00:07.130  -->  00:00:07.870
.

5

00:00:07.860  -->  00:00:13.050
There's one field that we don't have and I think it should be good to add a here so that way you guys

6

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:13.660
can.

7

00:00:13.770  -->  00:00:21.180
KING You know a little bit more practice we already did this we already uploaded files but it would

8

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:27.500
be nice to have this application with some file file capability features right.

9

00:00:27.690  -->  00:00:32.050
So why don't we do this why don't we actually you know create a function item where we can overload

10

00:00:32.100  -->  00:00:36.970
files so that we you can you can know what else to do in your posts and your categories.

11

00:00:36.970  -->  00:00:42.920
Well categories are known going to have images but for post you can follow some pictures.

12

00:00:42.910  -->  00:00:46.350
So basically you can do the same thing we're doing to users we can do to post.

13

00:00:46.470  -->  00:00:48.620
So that way you have a really good idea how that works.

14

00:00:48.630  -->  00:00:49.140
OK.

15

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:52.200
You should already know that but I wanted to reinforce that knowledge.

16

00:00:52.200  -->  00:00:52.870
OK.

17

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:58.100
So for this to happen we need to have a multipart.

18

00:00:58.180  -->  00:01:03.690
Each of you write and type review in the form we're going to create in a little bit.

19

00:01:03.960  -->  00:01:07.140
And we also need another space here.

20

00:01:07.220  -->  00:01:11.330
One that would only add space here we need another input feel for file.

21

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:11.880
All right.

22

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:16.180
So let's get this get it done right.

23

00:01:16.210  -->  00:01:22.140
Let's go to create and let's see what we can put this input type file here.

24

00:01:22.140  -->  00:01:25.890
I think the file should be maybe close to the password maybe.

25

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:26.230
All right.

26

00:01:26.250  -->  00:01:31.230
Let's just put it there and then we can move it later on to wherever we want.

27

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:34.080
Let's just do it right here.

28

00:01:34.080  -->  00:01:37.760
All right so text field.

29

00:01:39.330  -->  00:01:42.240
First before we do this let's actually make this

30

00:01:46.080  -->  00:01:53.130
multipart right for the ink type here and then when we do that is by adding this key and with a value

31

00:01:53.130  -->  00:01:53.780
of true.

32

00:01:53.880  -->  00:01:56.380
Let's make sure it is working.

33

00:01:57.090  -->  00:02:00.750
Let's inspect real quick.

34

00:02:00.750  -->  00:02:01.320
All right guys.

35

00:02:01.330  -->  00:02:07.350
And remember my goal here is to show you as much as I can in every lecture you see and type.

36

00:02:07.890  -->  00:02:13.170
So when and when I switch like this and I tell you guys let's do this let's do that.

37

00:02:13.180  -->  00:02:17.900
Because I'm trying to fit as much knowledge as possible into the lecture.

38

00:02:17.940  -->  00:02:23.250
OK I'm trying to make that give you all the knowledge that I can for that specific topic so that way

39

00:02:23.250  -->  00:02:26.340
you guys have that and can use it with other things out there.

40

00:02:26.340  -->  00:02:26.980
All right.

41

00:02:27.210  -->  00:02:32.340
So you know I just don't want to show you one thing and say I want to keep showing you more and more

42

00:02:32.340  -->  00:02:34.310
tricks and techniques and different stuff.

43

00:02:34.310  -->  00:02:35.540
All right.

44

00:02:35.690  -->  00:02:37.120
Well you guys have more knowledge.

45

00:02:37.140  -->  00:02:45.630
But anyway so now with that we have this let's create that import field and it's my let's move this

46

00:02:45.630  -->  00:02:46.830
a little bit.

47

00:02:48.030  -->  00:02:51.780
Let's make this a file method here.

48

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:56.330
Let's name it file and file.

49

00:02:56.580  -->  00:03:03.600
We have to modify our migration a little bit and we're going to keep it as if you see what I'm doing

50

00:03:03.600  -->  00:03:09.510
here guys I'm adding stuff taking stuff out because this is the way you do it in real life if you know

51

00:03:09.540  -->  00:03:14.100
most of the time you planned this stuff but laid on you change your mind and you want to make it different

52

00:03:14.100  -->  00:03:14.160
.

53

00:03:14.160  -->  00:03:15.780
All right.

54

00:03:15.960  -->  00:03:16.200
All right.

55

00:03:16.200  -->  00:03:19.260
Make sure that you guys are doing your very good version control as well.

56

00:03:19.260  -->  00:03:19.670
All right.

57

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:20.920
We got something working already.

58

00:03:20.940  -->  00:03:21.960
You don't want to mess it up.

59

00:03:21.960  -->  00:03:27.330
I do my version control when I have mostly the features that I want working already.

60

00:03:27.330  -->  00:03:32.490
So we still have not completed his user section so that's why I haven't done a version control yet.

61

00:03:32.820  -->  00:03:37.230
But anyway so you know in real life you add stuff when you take stuff off.

62

00:03:37.230  -->  00:03:43.230
Let's check out our database we could right here

63

00:03:47.770  -->  00:03:50.150
database right here migrations.

64

00:03:50.160  -->  00:03:52.210
And let's check out the users table.

65

00:03:52.860  -->  00:03:57.250
All right we need to add a column for photo.

66

00:03:57.270  -->  00:03:58.110
All right.

67

00:03:58.470  -->  00:04:01.910
So let's do that.

68

00:04:01.920  -->  00:04:06.180
We don't even have a photo ID table yet but we will.

69

00:04:06.180  -->  00:04:07.810
So we're just working on users right now.

70

00:04:07.810  -->  00:04:08.460
Right guys.

71

00:04:08.460  -->  00:04:12.780
Later on we're going to work on photos and all that but right now we've got to get the users part done

72

00:04:12.780  -->  00:04:12.990
.

73

00:04:13.020  -->  00:04:19.310
But let's add a table here meanwhile and let's open terminal.

74

00:04:20.280  -->  00:04:32.570
Let's clear this out and let's just say BHB artists and migrate I actually make migration.

75

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:35.530
This is the problem when you have aliases for everything guys.

76

00:04:35.550  -->  00:04:37.230
You forget the commands.

77

00:04:37.440  -->  00:04:46.570
So between our recent migration and photo ID to users.

78

00:04:46.620  -->  00:04:47.710
All right.

79

00:04:48.990  -->  00:04:52.350
Table users.

80

00:04:52.990  -->  00:04:53.350
We go

81

00:05:01.140  -->  00:05:04.410
right there we go.

82

00:05:04.410  -->  00:05:12.330
The reason why is Ray remember is because a good version is on on track.

83

00:05:12.600  -->  00:05:13.640
That's good.

84

00:05:13.720  -->  00:05:15.800
BHB storm detects that.

85

00:05:16.110  -->  00:05:20.970
All right so the users table and we're going to add a column name

86

00:05:23.790  -->  00:05:29.370
file actually photo ID I'm sorry.

87

00:05:29.370  -->  00:05:30.890
All right.

88

00:05:32.040  -->  00:05:39.670
Make sure right here you have the drub column here.

89

00:05:41.430  -->  00:05:49.810
All right cool this to BHB Ortiz and I agree.

90

00:05:50.020  -->  00:05:51.810
Cool.

91

00:05:51.810  -->  00:05:53.010
Done.

92

00:05:53.880  -->  00:05:54.520
All right.

93

00:05:54.900  -->  00:05:59.530
So now we have this file input put here we can receive files in our.

94

00:05:59.640  -->  00:06:04.450
Now let's go back to requests.

95

00:06:04.860  -->  00:06:08.630
So let's go CTP.

96

00:06:09.540  -->  00:06:12.170
Let's go back here and we're going to also make sure.

97

00:06:12.180  -->  00:06:15.300
As a matter of fact we don't have to have an image for the user.

98

00:06:15.330  -->  00:06:21.540
We're not going to make that a requirement and our validation and our input in our field here.

99

00:06:21.570  -->  00:06:27.270
Now guys remember that here you can also pass other parameters so if you want to know more parameters

100

00:06:27.690  -->  00:06:34.050
you can always visit Clarabell the allowable Web site and type in validation rules and that's going

101

00:06:34.050  -->  00:06:37.470
to give you a lot more parameters that you can passing here.

102

00:06:37.470  -->  00:06:37.920
OK.

103

00:06:37.950  -->  00:06:39.300
It's going to show you some more stuff.

104

00:06:39.300  -->  00:06:39.870
All right.

105

00:06:39.870  -->  00:06:41.630
So I think we're done with this here.

106

00:06:41.640  -->  00:06:44.550
And let's refresh this.

107

00:06:44.580  -->  00:06:46.680
We can see that we have an input there so

108

00:06:50.940  -->  00:06:56.700
I think we are actually returning this information.

109

00:06:56.700  -->  00:07:03.130
Now we go and create a validation taking place there.

110

00:07:04.110  -->  00:07:09.210
All right we're getting going back there because we don't have the whole idea of the user active field

111

00:07:10.080  -->  00:07:11.150
or I

112

00:07:14.580  -->  00:07:15.270
filed

113

00:07:17.960  -->  00:07:18.500
we go

114

00:07:25.170  -->  00:07:26.740
all right.

115

00:07:26.760  -->  00:07:28.950
We'll check on that on the next election when we come back.

116

00:07:28.950  -->  00:07:37.430
But we have this validation rules we have our migrations we have.

117

00:07:37.440  -->  00:07:40.440
I mean we have done a lot here on this lecture.

118

00:07:40.440  -->  00:07:41.540
All right.

119

00:07:41.970  -->  00:07:43.320
We'll continue on the next one.

120

00:07:43.320  -->  00:07:44.570
Take care.
