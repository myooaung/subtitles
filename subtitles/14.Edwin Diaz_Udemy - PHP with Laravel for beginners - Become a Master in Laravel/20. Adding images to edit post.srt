00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:00,660
All right.

2

00:00:00,660  -->  00:00:02,510
Welcome back my sister.

3

00:00:02,510  -->  00:00:08,250
And so one thing that I want to address here before we jump into another section is having the image

4

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:14,610
here so that what we see right what right now we're able to edit the post when I get to see what kind

5

00:00:14,610  -->  00:00:19,720
of image she has and unless we go to this section right here so it will be nice to do that.

6

00:00:19,740  -->  00:00:21,630
Let's go to our posts

7

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:26,040
to this for us and

8

00:00:28,610  -->  00:00:32,090
fuse and pose.

9

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:39,180
Let's go at it all we have to do is divide this form into well this page will have the picture here

10

00:00:39,180  -->  00:00:43,760
and one side and then we'll have the form in another side.

11

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:46,510
Right.

12

00:00:48,930  -->  00:00:52,980
Take that out there from there.

13

00:00:54,270  -->  00:00:59,580
Actually let's leave that there and

14

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:06,350
put this inside.

15

00:01:08,640  -->  00:01:10,270
Now you

16

00:01:16,900  -->  00:01:19,080
have another flaid here

17

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:26,400
and then we'll close it right here

18

00:01:34,010  -->  00:01:43,830
with the image right here and we'll give it a class actually of I Am G responsive

19

00:01:43,820  -->  00:01:57,940
.

20

00:01:58,210  -->  00:02:02,490
All right let's check it out real quick.

21

00:02:02,520  -->  00:02:03,730
All right cool.

22

00:02:03,810  -->  00:02:08,170
Should make this a little smaller right next to that.

23

00:02:08,920  -->  00:02:10,850
Let's just make it three.

24

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:15,900
I guess this will be nine.

25

00:02:18,210  -->  00:02:18,480
All right.

26

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:19,320
That's OK.

27

00:02:19,530  -->  00:02:20,430
I think that's OK.

28

00:02:20,520  -->  00:02:21,250
Right.

29

00:02:21,660  -->  00:02:22,340
All right cool.

30

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:24,010
That's all we wanted to do in this lecture.

31

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:27,270
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
