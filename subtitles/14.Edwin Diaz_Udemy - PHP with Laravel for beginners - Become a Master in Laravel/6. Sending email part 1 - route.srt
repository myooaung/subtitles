1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:01,860
All right welcome back to the soil.

2

00:00:01,860  -->  00:00:04,640
Time for us to start jumping into the cold right.

3

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:09,850
Jumping into creating a a test trial and testing our application real quick.

4

00:00:10,020  -->  00:00:15,390
Our small applications so let's go do that let's go two routes in.

5

00:00:15,420  -->  00:00:17,230
Right here we're going to do it in the home page.

6

00:00:17,250  -->  00:00:18,500
All right.

7

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:25,830
You could if you wanted to do it in another round like say e-mail Rao or even create a controller and

8

00:00:25,830  -->  00:00:27,620
do this and the controller is on to you.

9

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:31,740
I'm going to do it here just to do it in a fast way.

10

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:33,110
All right.

11

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:43,110
So first of all we're going to create a data array here because what we want to do is have some data

12

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:48,020
right ready for the message.

13

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:48,590
All right.

14

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:50,620
So I'm going to have a title here.

15

00:00:50,820  -->  00:00:56,680
It's going to be an associate of a re going to say hi my students.

16

00:00:57,690  -->  00:01:03,110
I hope you like the course.

17

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:04,610
All right cool.

18

00:01:05,160  -->  00:01:07,500
Let's go and create another one.

19

00:01:07,620  -->  00:01:09,840
Content and this can be whatever you want.

20

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:10,350
OK.

21

00:01:10,530  -->  00:01:18,490
Now I got to tell you right now this keys keeps going to turn into variables once he gets to that template

22

00:01:18,500  -->  00:01:18,590
.

23

00:01:18,700  -->  00:01:21,590
The view right now if you don't know what I mean don't worry.

24

00:01:21,590  -->  00:01:22,680
And I explain to you in a minute

25

00:01:26,830  -->  00:01:35,010
is love of course was created with a lot of love and dedication

26

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:38,830
for you.

27

00:01:38,830  -->  00:01:39,970
All right.

28

00:01:39,990  -->  00:01:40,690
That's true guys.

29

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:41,710
That is very true.

30

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:42,980
All right cool.

31

00:01:42,990  -->  00:01:45,360
So if you want to send mail right.

32

00:01:45,390  -->  00:01:51,690
We have to use the mail facade right or the mail class as the as I call it.

33

00:01:52,020  -->  00:01:54,510
And there is a medical center.

34

00:01:55,080  -->  00:01:56,250
There we go.

35

00:01:56,250  -->  00:01:57,590
All right.

36

00:01:58,320  -->  00:02:04,950
So now he's complaining here that his class is not included I guess less important on top.

37

00:02:04,950  -->  00:02:05,630
All right.

38

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:07,110
So he doesn't complain.

39

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:07,820
All right.

40

00:02:07,950  -->  00:02:13,050
So the first parameter here this is going to take a couple of Ramadan's the first one would be the view

41

00:02:13,080  -->  00:02:19,830
because the way this works is that this would actually use a view instead of a roll masses.

42

00:02:19,920  -->  00:02:26,020
Now there are many ways you can do it you can actually send a roll or hd a mail message by default.

43

00:02:26,040  -->  00:02:28,290
This is sending NHT e-mail message OK.

44

00:02:28,560  -->  00:02:29,940
But you can make this raw.

45

00:02:30,000  -->  00:02:32,990
And I will go to the documentation right now and see it.

46

00:02:33,000  -->  00:02:35,400
But let's just do this right now.

47

00:02:35,400  -->  00:02:40,400
Let's try to set up this set this up.

48

00:02:40,410  -->  00:02:52,110
Views are going to create here a folder called Mail array or e-mails and say here I'm going to say test

49

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:53,660
.

50

00:02:53,670  -->  00:02:55,440
All right cool.

51

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:59,660
So let's go back to RAO here and we're going to say e-mails dot tests.

52

00:02:59,710  -->  00:03:02,940
All right e-mails fill the folder into us just for the file.

53

00:03:02,940  -->  00:03:06,470
This is how we do it just like we do views because this is a view.

54

00:03:06,750  -->  00:03:08,870
So the segment that can take views like this.

55

00:03:08,880  -->  00:03:09,450
All right.

56

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:12,650
Now the second parameter here would be the data that is going in.

57

00:03:12,690  -->  00:03:17,920
And here you can put your array here if you wanted to but we're just doing it like this.

58

00:03:17,920  -->  00:03:20,920
That way we can just pass it in in a cleaner way.

59

00:03:21,030  -->  00:03:21,570
All right.

60

00:03:21,600  -->  00:03:23,890
The third parameter is the closure function.

61

00:03:24,480  -->  00:03:25,900
And now here what you can do.

62

00:03:25,890  -->  00:03:30,010
This takes a variable and then you can call it whatever you want.

63

00:03:30,210  -->  00:03:36,180
This very well turns into an object which you can use to call cement.

64

00:03:36,200  -->  00:03:40,510
It's like the two method where is their email going to I.

65

00:03:40,830  -->  00:03:46,270
Well let's say we're going to do in D.S. India.

66

00:03:46,310  -->  00:03:48,210
Com for example.

67

00:03:48,210  -->  00:03:51,070
That's what we saying is going all right.

68

00:03:51,330  -->  00:03:58,570
And it's going to a guy named Edwin does.

69

00:03:59,160  -->  00:04:04,400
All right and then we can change this to another method on the subject.

70

00:04:04,440  -->  00:04:09,020
We go again say hello.

71

00:04:09,840  -->  00:04:13,990
Student How are you.

72

00:04:14,520  -->  00:04:15,930
Or something like that.

73

00:04:16,500  -->  00:04:17,040
OK.

74

00:04:17,130  -->  00:04:22,310
Now remember that you're going to what you're going to be doing is taking stuff from the form.

75

00:04:22,320  -->  00:04:23,140
All right.

76

00:04:23,490  -->  00:04:25,600
And inserting it right here.

77

00:04:25,630  -->  00:04:27,440
I like form stuff.

78

00:04:27,620  -->  00:04:30,820
This is hard coding everything right now.

79

00:04:30,990  -->  00:04:35,050
But remember that this information will come from a form.

80

00:04:35,100  -->  00:04:35,980
All right.

81

00:04:36,450  -->  00:04:39,050
And then you can take it to your view.

82

00:04:39,060  -->  00:04:44,700
So if we go to the view we take you there but we're going to do then and that's lecture OK.

83

00:04:44,730  -->  00:04:48,850
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the net lecture
