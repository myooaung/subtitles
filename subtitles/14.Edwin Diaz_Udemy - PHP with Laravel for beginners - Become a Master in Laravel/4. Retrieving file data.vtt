00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:07.200
All right welcome back my the students on the last lecture we modify our form or create form to accept

2

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:08.580
files right.

3

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:17.370
So now in this lecture we're going to retrieve that data that comes from the files in our post controller

4

00:00:17.580  -->  00:00:20.950
in their store meant that this is where all that data is coming to.

5

00:00:20.970  -->  00:00:25.170
Right now if you don't have this comment that I'll make sure that you comment all this out.

6

00:00:25.400  -->  00:00:26.270
OK.

7

00:00:26.880  -->  00:00:28.110
And let's get started.

8

00:00:28.110  -->  00:00:37.080
So the way that we received data from a file from the form it's by accessing the object has an object

9

00:00:37.770  -->  00:00:39.330
called requests.

10

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:40.270
Right.

11

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:43.560
And we have it up here.

12

00:00:43.600  -->  00:00:46.520
Now this object has a method called File.

13

00:00:46.620  -->  00:00:54.420
And inside this method you got to give it the file name the name value actually you will if you go back

14

00:00:54.420  -->  00:00:57.300
to your form to create form.

15

00:00:57.300  -->  00:00:59.380
We saw the how we gave it.

16

00:00:59.400  -->  00:01:02.430
This is the name of your value is going to be called file.

17

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:03.770
So we get to the pole.

18

00:01:03.780  -->  00:01:05.550
This is a super global right.

19

00:01:05.550  -->  00:01:16.510
So when this for go global value gets to here remember that we have these files in regular ph be awry

20

00:01:16.880  -->  00:01:18.780
when we have the name right.

21

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:23.140
And we have you know whatever the file whatever.

22

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:32.070
So this will put all the value this value right here will be equal to the one that we've got to put

23

00:01:32.070  -->  00:01:32.610
here.

24

00:01:32.780  -->  00:01:33.730
OK.

25

00:01:33.930  -->  00:01:39.480
Now if you return these data and you go to the browser and you look at it this is just going to be a

26

00:01:39.480  -->  00:01:42.090
path with a temporary name.

27

00:01:42.090  -->  00:01:47.650
Let's go and let me show you how that looks.

28

00:01:48.600  -->  00:01:51.960
Let's go here and just you just get a picture ready there.

29

00:01:52.390  -->  00:01:55.320
OK.

30

00:01:55.500  -->  00:02:05.490
And if I click Create we can see the name of our file the path in this name if I go back and try this

31

00:02:05.490  -->  00:02:11.110
again you can see that it keeps changing BHB s w to Y.

32

00:02:11.330  -->  00:02:11.550
Right.

33

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:15.580
Look at this y to y right let's go back again and try this again.

34

00:02:15.780  -->  00:02:20.660
That keeps changing this is the temporary spacing memory that we have for that file.

35

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:22.080
Ok there's always going to keep change.

36

00:02:22.090  -->  00:02:24.500
That's another real name of the file.

37

00:02:24.660  -->  00:02:28.650
If you want to return the real name then you have to do a little bit more digging.

38

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:35.340
So let's apply this array values to an object.

39

00:02:35.370  -->  00:02:35.670
Right.

40

00:02:35.700  -->  00:02:38.450
Let's create this object out of it.

41

00:02:38.640  -->  00:02:45.840
And what we can do is let's just create some Eckles here so you can see the different functionalities

42

00:02:45.840  -->  00:02:46.660
that we can.

43

00:02:46.750  -->  00:02:52.000
I'm not going to show you all of them because there are so many but I'm going to show you a couple so

44

00:02:52.010  -->  00:02:53.180
that where you can get an idea.

45

00:02:53.190  -->  00:03:02.040
Now we pitch the storm and maybe if you have a really good editor idea you can see the recommended you

46

00:03:02.040  -->  00:03:03.590
know methods.

47

00:03:03.600  -->  00:03:08.850
So when I type when I created this object now and I type in the little arrow you can see all the methods

48

00:03:08.850  -->  00:03:10.120
that I'm working at this.

49

00:03:10.260  -->  00:03:16.780
So now if I want to get the original name with this client right I just do this.

50

00:03:16.780  -->  00:03:19.490
And now if I go back and try this.

51

00:03:19.490  -->  00:03:25.120
Now you can see that we get the name of the picture the real name right.

52

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:28.330
We have so many methods that we can use guys.

53

00:03:28.390  -->  00:03:29.090
Unbelievable.

54

00:03:29.100  -->  00:03:33.530
And you see how easy Lero makes it for us.

55

00:03:33.570  -->  00:03:39.870
All we have to do is type in the no I mean ph B store makes it for us.

56

00:03:40.050  -->  00:03:43.190
We can even inspect the size of the client.

57

00:03:43.860  -->  00:03:45.000
OK.

58

00:03:45.360  -->  00:03:48.800
Let's go back and let's look at the size.

59

00:03:49.030  -->  00:03:53.910
All right of course you might want to create a little functionality where you can convert the bytes

60

00:03:53.910  -->  00:04:01.260
into kilobytes or maybe the text that if he's over certain characters certain numbers you know he's

61

00:04:01.260  -->  00:04:08.220
a megabyte or a gigabyte or whatever and then you might want to not allow certain files in your application

62

00:04:08.230  -->  00:04:11.440
if they are bigger you know then whatever you allow it to be.

63

00:04:11.670  -->  00:04:16.160
So that's something that can be done very easily especially with Larabee.

64

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:22.170
But anyway so as you can see here we can get a lot of information out and it's very easy to do with

65

00:04:22.170  -->  00:04:23.150
his methods.

66

00:04:23.340  -->  00:04:26.610
You don't have to write a thing from scratch like we used to do before.

67

00:04:26.610  -->  00:04:27.300
OK.

68

00:04:27.540  -->  00:04:35.280
With Nady BHB BHB allows Larabee allows us to access methods that pulls that information out and there's

69

00:04:35.280  -->  00:04:41.430
a lot of things that we can do to this to even create a more to create a better flexible replication

70

00:04:41.430  -->  00:04:42.130
with files.

71

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:42.480
Right.

72

00:04:42.480  -->  00:04:48.450
So anyway thank you so much for you know watching this lecture and being my student and I'm going to

73

00:04:48.450  -->  00:04:50.930
show you some more stuff in the next lecture is going to be pretty cool.

74

00:04:51.030  -->  00:04:51.440
Thank you
