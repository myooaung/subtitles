1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,230
All right welcome back my student so one thing that I want to do here before we go on I want to ask

2

00:00:04,230  -->  00:00:08,420
some links re years so that we don't have to be typing it in you are out.

3

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:13,570
But in this lecture what we're going to be doing is we're going to start doing the file configuration

4

00:00:13,570  -->  00:00:14,620
in our controller.

5

00:00:14,850  -->  00:00:18,020
We need to overload photos and we need to set that up.

6

00:00:18,060  -->  00:00:23,340
But right now we need to have some links here so it just makes it a little easier for us to do that

7

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:23,750
.

8

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:33,610
So let's go to our layouts in views and then admin in here somewhere which says All users here.

9

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:34,910
All right.

10

00:00:35,400  -->  00:00:37,570
We've got to go and use that route.

11

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:44,070
And the reason why we what I like to use routes are I would I use a route name here would function call

12

00:00:44,070  -->  00:00:46,380
route and we've done that before.

13

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:51,600
All right so the reason why I like to use route route names in staes because just in case in the future

14

00:00:51,600  -->  00:00:59,960
I change the route of my of this section here for users is always going to be sinked with the route

15

00:00:59,960  -->  00:01:03,040
name instead of being hard quartering here.

16

00:01:03,070  -->  00:01:04,230
If you then I understand it.

17

00:01:04,230  -->  00:01:05,180
Let me explain.

18

00:01:05,430  -->  00:01:07,850
So let's say for example in the future.

19

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:11,760
I come here and I change this to whatever right.

20

00:01:11,810  -->  00:01:17,640
Then we have to go to each part of my application and update it if I have a hard core.

21

00:01:17,950  -->  00:01:25,420
But if I'm using a router name all I have to do right is nothing.

22

00:01:25,800  -->  00:01:31,360
All right so let's say for example I have a wrong name here of Agyeman users right.

23

00:01:31,480  -->  00:01:35,340
Yeah I already show you how to change the name of your routes.

24

00:01:35,340  -->  00:01:35,770
All right.

25

00:01:35,790  -->  00:01:39,650
So if you have a default route you could always pass a parameter here and change it.

26

00:01:39,870  -->  00:01:49,850
Let's say use your ass if you remember that you can go to the documentation and look it up but you give

27

00:01:49,860  -->  00:01:51,050
it your your.

28

00:01:51,060  -->  00:01:57,600
You get requests around name and the will reflect in your application is a lot more dynamic guys right

29

00:01:57,630  -->  00:01:58,580
a lot more.

30

00:01:58,590  -->  00:02:01,260
So that's why I like to use routes.

31

00:02:01,410  -->  00:02:03,690
All right let's do routes.

32

00:02:03,720  -->  00:02:10,270
And we're going to take me and that users we go.

33

00:02:10,320  -->  00:02:10,700
All right.

34

00:02:10,710  -->  00:02:11,970
So that's where we're going.

35

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:26,700
And this one here are out and men users create.

36

00:02:26,700  -->  00:02:27,840
All right.

37

00:02:27,840  -->  00:02:30,340
So let's come back here.

38

00:02:30,360  -->  00:02:32,370
Whoops.

39

00:02:33,050  -->  00:02:34,910
All right so.

40

00:02:35,240  -->  00:02:36,630
OK.

41

00:02:37,020  -->  00:02:41,030
We are actually typing in that as well.

42

00:02:41,030  -->  00:02:43,170
All right there we go.

43

00:02:43,170  -->  00:02:47,830
So now if I go to all users if I go to create we've got that working OK.

44

00:02:48,000  -->  00:02:55,430
So now we are actually uploading files so let's go ahead and receive that file in our controller.

45

00:02:56,820  -->  00:02:57,190
OK

46

00:03:01,020  -->  00:03:09,750
let's go to our controller right here and we can take all that off.

47

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:12,210
We will leave this there.

48

00:03:12,210  -->  00:03:16,650
All right so the first thing that we are going to be doing is we are going to put everything inside

49

00:03:16,650  -->  00:03:21,620
a requests a input variable.

50

00:03:22,290  -->  00:03:31,130
So that way I can modify this and we're going to check if their requests file.

51

00:03:31,170  -->  00:03:33,950
And I think we are naming this file.

52

00:03:33,960  -->  00:03:35,060
Let's go back.

53

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:42,660
Actually his photo ID for I.D. Let me check on that right now because that something just occurred to

54

00:03:42,660  -->  00:03:44,910
me.

55

00:03:44,910  -->  00:03:47,260
All right this is in the users that's fine.

56

00:03:47,340  -->  00:03:49,660
Let's check.

57

00:03:50,370  -->  00:03:53,260
Yeah OK.

58

00:03:53,280  -->  00:03:55,440
We add a column here called

59

00:03:57,780  -->  00:04:00,190
photos.

60

00:04:00,310  -->  00:04:01,450
No that's not it.

61

00:04:01,710  -->  00:04:03,900
This song is all right.

62

00:04:04,010  -->  00:04:06,330
All right.

63

00:04:08,600  -->  00:04:10,110
So let's go back here.

64

00:04:10,320  -->  00:04:12,000
So if this exists.

65

00:04:12,060  -->  00:04:15,810
I want you to do something with it.

66

00:04:15,840  -->  00:04:21,850
So I'm going to return for Lloyd's List.

67

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:23,640
Let's check it out real quick.

68

00:04:23,650  -->  00:04:29,390
Guys I let's just real quick make sure that this is working.

69

00:04:29,730  -->  00:04:33,600
Let's fill this up real quick.

70

00:04:33,710  -->  00:04:36,330
A regular 90 is that as

71

00:04:39,870  -->  00:04:46,400
well up 18 put it out data.

72

00:04:47,010  -->  00:04:48,350
I think weirding refresh.

73

00:04:48,360  -->  00:04:52,370
We need to make sure that we refresh that array.

74

00:04:53,040  -->  00:04:59,320
And now let's try to do that again.

75

00:05:03,360  -->  00:05:09,930
OK let's come back and see what in the world happened.

76

00:05:13,160  -->  00:05:16,150
I'm going to take that feature of my operating system.

77

00:05:16,150  -->  00:05:17,780
I don't like it.

78

00:05:17,820  -->  00:05:18,060
All right.

79

00:05:18,060  -->  00:05:20,220
So we are putting data here even though

80

00:05:23,670  -->  00:05:27,170
we don't have a photo ID for it.

81

00:05:27,170  -->  00:05:29,370
All right.

82

00:05:29,870  -->  00:05:31,390
We're supposed to return this.

83

00:05:31,410  -->  00:05:36,570
Oh this is redirecting That's why we have a second return here that's why he's doing that.

84

00:05:36,630  -->  00:05:38,490
So let's go back here and try these again

85

00:05:41,200  -->  00:05:45,620
Ray.

86

00:05:49,760  -->  00:05:52,540
OK.

87

00:05:52,560  -->  00:05:57,030
All right it's not returning anything.

88

00:05:57,330  -->  00:06:00,850
So he's not finding this here.

89

00:06:03,810  -->  00:06:12,750
Let's take this out and let's go back to our creator for him real quick.

90

00:06:13,230  -->  00:06:15,660
I think I already know what the problem is

91

00:06:20,460  -->  00:06:25,940
resources man users create.

92

00:06:25,950  -->  00:06:27,080
All right.

93

00:06:27,810  -->  00:06:38,330
This is named file we shouldn't name this file in a database but this is photo I.D..

94

00:06:39,440  -->  00:06:43,330
Right.

95

00:06:46,650  -->  00:06:50,140
And I really wanted to name it.

96

00:06:51,300  -->  00:06:54,120
Named is file.

97

00:06:55,080  -->  00:06:58,350
But we're following a convention.

98

00:06:58,800  -->  00:06:59,580
All right.

99

00:06:59,910  -->  00:07:04,030
So let's go back here and let's do this again.

100

00:07:04,340  -->  00:07:08,040
Let's refresh actually.

101

00:07:09,120  -->  00:07:13,800
The guys and I leave all these lectures here when I make mistakes so I will you guys can learn some

102

00:07:13,800  -->  00:07:15,230
debugging skills OK.

103

00:07:15,390  -->  00:07:19,890
And I always do that in all my courses I don't think is natural for me to raise these lectures and redo

104

00:07:19,890  -->  00:07:21,280
them again.

105

00:07:21,930  -->  00:07:23,410
You guys won't learn much.

106

00:07:23,730  -->  00:07:25,580
OK for you this as you can see there.

107

00:07:25,790  -->  00:07:31,500
OK you guys won't learn much if I live on mistakes here you learn from my mistakes you learn from your

108

00:07:31,500  -->  00:07:34,010
mistakes and you just become better.

109

00:07:34,140  -->  00:07:37,350
And I want you guys to be better than me a lot better than me.

110

00:07:37,410  -->  00:07:38,250
OK.

111

00:07:38,250  -->  00:07:42,310
If you guys are better than me I was successful teaching you something right.

112

00:07:42,510  -->  00:07:47,550
So that's what makes my day guys when you guys you know e-mail me and thank me for showing you something

113

00:07:47,550  -->  00:07:53,100
that you know or helping you find a job out there because of the skill you got from the Course does

114

00:07:53,100  -->  00:07:53,170
.

115

00:07:53,190  -->  00:07:54,930
Those are the things that wake me up in the morning.

116

00:07:54,930  -->  00:07:55,570
OK.

117

00:07:55,860  -->  00:07:57,750
And don't let me sleep at night sometimes.

118

00:07:57,750  -->  00:07:58,170
All right.

119

00:07:58,260  -->  00:08:05,370
So now we know that we are getting some data here and uses controller we're getting the fire we get

120

00:08:05,370  -->  00:08:06,390
in the photo.

121

00:08:06,630  -->  00:08:12,540
Now the next lecture we're going to see if we can complete it complete the whole process of storing

122

00:08:12,990  -->  00:08:14,140
the user.

123

00:08:14,250  -->  00:08:20,370
And at the same time storing is storing a photo of the user with all the required fields.

124

00:08:20,370  -->  00:08:20,770
All right.

125

00:08:20,820  -->  00:08:21,840
Thank you so much for watching.

126

00:08:21,840  -->  00:08:23,250
I'll see you in the next lecture
