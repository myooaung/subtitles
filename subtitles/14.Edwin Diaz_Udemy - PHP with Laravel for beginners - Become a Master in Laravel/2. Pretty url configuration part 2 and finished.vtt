00:00:00.540  -->  00:00:01.150
All right.

2

00:00:01.170  -->  00:00:02.670
Welcome back.

3

00:00:02.700  -->  00:00:03.140
Sister.

4

00:00:03.160  -->  00:00:08.010
So it's time for us to start creating pretty you or else so right now the way we have it is that every

5

00:00:08.010  -->  00:00:14.040
time we click on this view post we see the post-boy we only see the ID of the polls right.

6

00:00:14.040  -->  00:00:22.570
So what we need to do is we need to go here and send the log out instead of the ID.

7

00:00:22.770  -->  00:00:30.960
But the problem is that if you go to two Ph.D. My out men show you right now problem is that we don't

8

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:32.480
even have a slug for that yet.

9

00:00:32.750  -->  00:00:33.550
All right now.

10

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:37.150
So why don't we going updated and see what happens.

11

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:47.430
So right now by default this package if we go to our admin and update it it's back to work update now

12

00:00:47.700  -->  00:00:48.560
refresh.

13

00:00:48.710  -->  00:00:54.150
And as you can see right now some really cool polls is separated by a high fence.

14

00:00:54.160  -->  00:00:55.330
Does this slug.

15

00:00:55.530  -->  00:00:56.340
Does it title.

16

00:00:56.370  -->  00:01:01.410
Separated by the Slogger by hyphens.

17

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:06.570
Now you could do this by default Clarabell without having to install a package.

18

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:11.880
But the problem with this is with a default functionality Clarabell is that every time you create a

19

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:15.460
post with the same name.

20

00:01:15.910  -->  00:01:20.540
Basically it keeps creating posts with the same name over and over again.

21

00:01:20.550  -->  00:01:20.980
All right.

22

00:01:20.980  -->  00:01:23.870
And so that's the problem with the full functionality Falasha bill.

23

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:32.130
You could however you see if you go to for example let me just explain it to you and a little by showing

24

00:01:32.130  -->  00:01:33.930
you SDR slogger.

25

00:01:33.960  -->  00:01:34.590
All right.

26

00:01:34.590  -->  00:01:40.470
So if you look for this in your best friend Google you can see that this is a helper function in an

27

00:01:40.470  -->  00:01:41.380
hour.

28

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:42.120
All right.

29

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:45.500
So I'm going to look for it right here as the slug.

30

00:01:46.080  -->  00:01:54.120
So right now while this function this method this function could do is it takes the whatever name string

31

00:01:54.120  -->  00:01:57.770
you give it and you can separate it by the hyphen.

32

00:01:57.900  -->  00:01:58.380
Right.

33

00:01:58.380  -->  00:02:01.350
Basically it's like replace functionality.

34

00:02:01.560  -->  00:02:07.920
So you could grab the title when you are saving it so let's say for example let's go to our controller

35

00:02:09.040  -->  00:02:11.380
I'm impulse controller.

36

00:02:12.090  -->  00:02:17.070
So for example when you are creating the name here let's

37

00:02:23.360  -->  00:02:26.270
let's use them right here when you're storing it.

38

00:02:26.540  -->  00:02:27.320
All right.

39

00:02:27.420  -->  00:02:34.820
Right here with your story and what you could do is you can graph the I don't know the title.

40

00:02:36.090  -->  00:02:37.140
Right.

41

00:02:37.290  -->  00:02:41.120
And you can use that function as your slog.

42

00:02:42.140  -->  00:02:42.720
All right.

43

00:02:42.760  -->  00:02:46.620
And like this.

44

00:02:46.870  -->  00:02:54.980
And now automatically you have this letter where you have to of course separated by this automatically

45

00:02:54.990  -->  00:03:02.580
you have this title now separated by hyphens and then you can put that in the slot column in your database

46

00:03:02.580  -->  00:03:02.710
.

47

00:03:02.710  -->  00:03:03.340
All right.

48

00:03:03.420  -->  00:03:08.630
So you could do that but like I said before you keep making If you key if you create a duplicate it

49

00:03:08.640  -->  00:03:10.970
keeps creating that duplicate over and over again.

50

00:03:11.100  -->  00:03:16.070
And with this package that we are actually using slogan Vote right now and probably in the future they're

51

00:03:16.080  -->  00:03:17.330
going to be a lot more.

52

00:03:17.490  -->  00:03:23.110
Every time you create I know if they say here they did the show say it every time you create a new duplicate

53

00:03:23.110  -->  00:03:24.210
is going to create it.

54

00:03:24.360  -->  00:03:31.160
All right here as a matter of fact you see that every time you create a duplicate title.

55

00:03:31.380  -->  00:03:36.380
All right you get it it's going to create a second.

56

00:03:36.790  -->  00:03:38.700
It's going to give you a number after it.

57

00:03:39.030  -->  00:03:43.540
So we're going to give you for a duplicate for the first title.

58

00:03:43.560  -->  00:03:47.430
Once you create a topic it's going to give you the number one the next one is going to be number two

59

00:03:47.430  -->  00:03:47.450
.

60

00:03:47.450  -->  00:03:49.470
Number three number four or five.

61

00:03:49.530  -->  00:03:53.060
So it was it will never be a duplicate inside your application.

62

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:53.670
All right.

63

00:03:53.910  -->  00:03:57.520
So as a matter of fact right here this is where it is.

64

00:03:57.570  -->  00:04:00.500
As you can see you have the first one normal.

65

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:02.880
The second one will be a duplicate of one.

66

00:04:02.880  -->  00:04:06.190
The second will be the third one with the duplicate number two.

67

00:04:06.570  -->  00:04:08.490
Hopefully that makes a little bit more sense now.

68

00:04:08.510  -->  00:04:08.990
Right.

69

00:04:09.210  -->  00:04:15.980
But anyway I think I got we got a little sidetracked out of the air out of what we were doing and.

70

00:04:16.320  -->  00:04:16.950
All right.

71

00:04:17.340  -->  00:04:24.100
So we have created our configuration it's time for us to start making use of this.

72

00:04:24.150  -->  00:04:27.700
So I'm going to close so this right now because I'm going to about to show you some.

73

00:04:28.290  -->  00:04:30.430
As a matter of fact already.

74

00:04:31.590  -->  00:04:36.880
Let's go back to this real quick and make sure that we don't have that there.

75

00:04:37.130  -->  00:04:42.650
Didn't get creative is all right.

76

00:04:42.860  -->  00:04:46.460
Should I make a mistake and left that input there.

77

00:04:46.620  -->  00:04:51.760
All right so let's take all this out.

78

00:04:51.840  -->  00:04:52.820
Sorry for the site.

79

00:04:52.880  -->  00:04:58.350
So being side on this guys for getting sidetracked but I wanted to actually explain to you why we are

80

00:04:58.350  -->  00:05:03.170
using that baggage instead of using Lavell default functions.

81

00:05:03.180  -->  00:05:03.760
All right.

82

00:05:04.110  -->  00:05:06.150
So let's go to our viewers real quick

83

00:05:08.840  -->  00:05:10.460
resources views.

84

00:05:10.710  -->  00:05:17.900
Let's go to our admen pose and then it's right here.

85

00:05:18.510  -->  00:05:19.020
All right.

86

00:05:19.200  -->  00:05:26.370
So right here what we're doing is we are we have this link right here that every time we click it view

87

00:05:26.370  -->  00:05:30.360
pause is going to send that to our home Depot's route.

88

00:05:30.390  -->  00:05:32.640
And that's in the front of our application.

89

00:05:32.760  -->  00:05:34.930
But we are actually using.

90

00:05:35.050  -->  00:05:38.640
We are sending the ID with it what we're going to be doing is with now we are going to be sending this

91

00:05:38.640  -->  00:05:39.490
log.

92

00:05:40.020  -->  00:05:53.820
Right and now when we go to our controllers go to trollers and no one controller and we created this

93

00:05:53.820  -->  00:05:53.870
.

94

00:05:53.920  -->  00:06:03.840
It's actually it's own where it click here.

95

00:06:03.840  -->  00:06:07.020
We had to find that post method right here.

96

00:06:07.020  -->  00:06:07.780
All right cool.

97

00:06:07.950  -->  00:06:12.630
So instead of looking for fine or fail ID what we need to do is find a slug.

98

00:06:12.640  -->  00:06:13.800
So I'm just going to change the name.

99

00:06:13.800  -->  00:06:15.050
We don't have to.

100

00:06:15.360  -->  00:06:21.240
But I wanted to make it you know so that way we know what we are finding right.

101

00:06:22.500  -->  00:06:26.990
So we're going to be using Find a slug.

102

00:06:27.300  -->  00:06:32.700
And there are all other functions here that you can use from this tree from this class find by slug's

103

00:06:32.700  -->  00:06:35.630
find by slug or fail as a matter of fact let's find.

104

00:06:35.640  -->  00:06:42.400
Let's do that so we get an exception where you can you can do fine by a slug or id or find by local

105

00:06:42.430  -->  00:06:44.350
ID or fail is up to you.

106

00:06:44.400  -->  00:06:50.480
I'm going to use this one fine by slug or fail.

107

00:06:50.480  -->  00:06:51.060
All right.

108

00:06:51.210  -->  00:07:02.190
So now if we go to our admen right here and we refresh this to this real quick refresh here and then

109

00:07:02.190  -->  00:07:06.880
we click View Polsce you can see you're pretty you're on top.

110

00:07:06.880  -->  00:07:08.090
All right.

111

00:07:08.100  -->  00:07:10.050
Very simple guys.

112

00:07:10.050  -->  00:07:14.100
So now every time you create Let's just go ahead and create a different one.

113

00:07:14.160  -->  00:07:21.600
Another cool post let's put some images there.

114

00:07:22.050  -->  00:07:26.610
My javascript cores which is really good for those of you that have not that do not know javascript

115

00:07:26.610  -->  00:07:32.650
you should know javascript guys are right is a requirement to be a developer so make sure that you know

116

00:07:33.270  -->  00:07:41.860
I love this dispose of this was.

117

00:07:41.980  -->  00:07:42.630
All right.

118

00:07:42.750  -->  00:07:48.830
And now we click View polls and you can see that pretty you're on top right.

119

00:07:49.110  -->  00:07:53.840
So I hope this was an eye opener for you and I hope you liked the course very much.

120

00:07:53.840  -->  00:07:57.170
A few have not given this course a five star review.

121

00:07:57.420  -->  00:07:58.700
What are you waiting for guys.

122

00:07:58.730  -->  00:08:01.220
Really you waiting for me to have more lectures.

123

00:08:01.230  -->  00:08:02.900
That's going to happen anyway.

124

00:08:02.910  -->  00:08:03.660
All right.

125

00:08:03.690  -->  00:08:10.130
Anyway if you have not subscribe to our Facebook group make sure you do if you like Facebook.

126
