00:00:00,560  -->  00:00:06,690
All right welcome back my students so it's time for us to start actually seeing something here in the

2

00:00:06,690  -->  00:00:14,730
post page that means reading information and at the same time we have to go and show this information

3

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:16,550
for each individual post.

4

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:25,180
So let's go back here and say OK once you create this instead of redirect into pools that actually let's

5

00:00:25,200  -->  00:00:27,860
make sure that there is some data there.

6

00:00:27,860  -->  00:00:35,370
So there's got to end it's as you can see we're supposed to get something like this where I was supposed

7

00:00:35,370  -->  00:00:41,270
to get this in it's content but we don't get that because this is now really really refreshing when

8

00:00:41,390  -->  00:00:46,380
is redirecting is redirecting what is now refreshing the page at the same time.

9

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:54,250
So for that what we can do is we can say OK when you create a record or when you return this redirect

10

00:00:54,260  -->  00:01:00,000
and we have a built in function for that Clarabelle and this one here you would just have to give it

11

00:01:00,370  -->  00:01:03,940
where you want to redirect to polls.

12

00:01:04,150  -->  00:01:11,860
OK let's try again let's create and different folks.

13

00:01:11,940  -->  00:01:21,170
My second post answer and as you can see it says that page is now working for some reason.

14

00:01:21,200  -->  00:01:24,710
All right of course we know that that's not true.

15

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:26,400
Right.

16

00:01:27,060  -->  00:01:29,010
OK cool.

17

00:01:29,010  -->  00:01:31,550
So why did that happen.

18

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:32,270
I don't know.

19

00:01:32,280  -->  00:01:35,570
Let's try to create another one that see what the issue is.

20

00:01:35,580  -->  00:01:39,490
Let's just say angular.

21

00:01:40,570  -->  00:01:42,680
Yes.

22

00:01:43,290  -->  00:01:50,790
Answer Scarlett on available to us this requests.

23

00:01:50,790  -->  00:01:51,570
All right that's cool.

24

00:01:51,570  -->  00:01:54,270
Let's let's check our

25

00:01:57,340  -->  00:01:59,570
r r b list

26

00:02:01,780  -->  00:02:03,630
.

27

00:02:04,830  -->  00:02:06,510
It's BHB artisan actually

28

00:02:09,990  -->  00:02:11,630
wrote this.

29

00:02:12,420  -->  00:02:14,720
All right we're supposed to actually hit it in.

30

00:02:14,730  -->  00:02:20,530
It's there but we're not hitting it for some reason but that's OK.

31

00:02:20,970  -->  00:02:25,000
The reason why this might be a problem is because we've got this idea here.

32

00:02:25,380  -->  00:02:29,360
All right let's just say take the video.

33

00:02:31,110  -->  00:02:31,950
All right.

34

00:02:32,260  -->  00:02:35,720
And let's come back and try now.

35

00:02:35,940  -->  00:02:37,170
There we go is working now.

36

00:02:37,260  -->  00:02:38,900
All right cool.

37

00:02:39,990  -->  00:02:40,380
All right.

38

00:02:40,380  -->  00:02:46,860
So instead of returning this we're going to return the view.

39

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:47,890
All right.

40

00:02:48,270  -->  00:02:50,680
And the view is going to be posts in.

41

00:02:50,750  -->  00:02:56,650
That's because they used the name route try that route name right here.

42

00:02:56,670  -->  00:02:59,340
All right you see the column name on top.

43

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:01,220
That's what it is.

44

00:03:01,230  -->  00:03:07,220
So now another way we turning that as you can see there is nothing there.

45

00:03:08,130  -->  00:03:12,430
Let's just go back to that view real quick and put something in there OK.

46

00:03:13,080  -->  00:03:14,090
Let's close this.

47

00:03:14,090  -->  00:03:15,780
It makes it easy for us to file.

48

00:03:15,810  -->  00:03:18,750
Now where we are close this aswell.

49

00:03:18,780  -->  00:03:26,030
Let's go to views of those and it's so let's cancel this. All right.

50

00:03:26,030  -->  00:03:31,130
So let's take some of this stuff from create and put it here.

51

00:03:31,420  -->  00:03:40,680
And as a matter of fact let's take this one that's well and let's make all the area like that OK.

52

00:03:42,830  -->  00:03:44,160
All right let's make everything

53

00:03:46,740  -->  00:03:50,700
and I don't know why this is yielding this is not something that is

54

00:03:55,380  -->  00:03:57,770
let's fix this real quick create.

55

00:03:57,960  -->  00:04:01,600
It's not supposed to be yielding here anything.

56

00:04:01,650  -->  00:04:08,370
We're supposed to be closing up this here and section.

57

00:04:08,850  -->  00:04:15,570
So I'm going to correct that guys and that would be for all of them.

58

00:04:15,570  -->  00:04:18,150
This is Section added.

59

00:04:18,810  -->  00:04:22,490
Ok that's cool.

60

00:04:23,580  -->  00:04:24,930
So I'm going to copy this.

61

00:04:24,990  -->  00:04:29,170
I'm going to take it to where it is sitting there as well.

62

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:30,220
I'm going to take it all in.

63

00:04:30,300  -->  00:04:32,600
That's that's fine.

64

00:04:32,630  -->  00:04:35,710
That's it to show and take the form out.

65

00:04:35,860  -->  00:04:39,690
Ok cool.

66

00:04:39,690  -->  00:04:41,150
All right guys sorry about that little boy.

67

00:04:41,150  -->  00:04:46,500
What was going kind of fast indeed now realize that I was copying the yield function.

68

00:04:46,500  -->  00:04:46,840
All right.

69

00:04:46,860  -->  00:04:47,630
But anyway.

70

00:04:47,760  -->  00:04:53,690
So once we go to end that's what we want to do is actually display some of these data in here.

71

00:04:53,730  -->  00:04:57,220
But we don't have any data coming to the view yet.

72

00:04:57,240  -->  00:05:02,640
We have to go back to the controller and create these data and pass it through just like we did before

73

00:05:02,650  -->  00:05:02,710
.

74

00:05:02,760  -->  00:05:03,430
OK.

75

00:05:03,640  -->  00:05:11,040
So we say post all that is was going to bring these data down.

76

00:05:11,340  -->  00:05:15,620
OK let's assign it to a variable called Polsce OK.

77

00:05:15,910  -->  00:05:22,920
And now here we're going to use a little function called Compact this little free the Find function

78

00:05:22,920  -->  00:05:29,360
is going to take any name of variables any name that he finds in converted to a variable.

79

00:05:29,370  -->  00:05:29,610
All right.

80

00:05:29,610  -->  00:05:33,510
So he's going to add that little dollar sign to it.

81

00:05:33,840  -->  00:05:34,390
OK.

82

00:05:34,770  -->  00:05:35,960
So I think we are ready.

83

00:05:36,030  -->  00:05:41,000
And let's go back to when it's let's go here.

84

00:05:41,020  -->  00:05:43,330
And I'm going to create a tag here

85

00:05:45,780  -->  00:05:54,610
and let's go and do this for each pose.

86

00:05:54,660  -->  00:06:01,690
So that's a very well that's coming through I suppose and that is an object now.

87

00:06:02,340  -->  00:06:08,920
And for each Well there is I believe that gets a collection.

88

00:06:08,920  -->  00:06:16,160
Our guys if you want to find now remember that you can do the return here and return this whole thing

89

00:06:17,100  -->  00:06:19,170
real quick.

90

00:06:19,170  -->  00:06:25,010
And when you go back to polls Antar you can see this whole thing there.

91

00:06:25,110  -->  00:06:25,530
All right.

92

00:06:25,560  -->  00:06:32,550
But if you want to find out exactly what it is and you wrap it around the dye dump and you dump it out

93

00:06:32,560  -->  00:06:33,010
.

94

00:06:33,510  -->  00:06:36,070
OK.

95

00:06:36,080  -->  00:06:36,740
And there we go.

96

00:06:36,810  -->  00:06:39,720
You see the collection and we've got three of them.

97

00:06:40,380  -->  00:06:41,650
One two and three.

98

00:06:42,060  -->  00:06:43,230
OK.

99

00:06:43,230  -->  00:06:44,700
Perfect.

100

00:06:44,700  -->  00:06:46,650
So anyway let's do command Z control Z

101

00:06:49,260  -->  00:06:51,970
and that.

102

00:06:52,050  -->  00:06:52,960
All right.

103

00:06:53,310  -->  00:06:58,250
So now we know that we have it available in the ANE That's file here.

104

00:06:58,410  -->  00:07:04,090
Let's go and display some of these data.

105

00:07:05,700  -->  00:07:06,640
Let's use blade.

106

00:07:06,690  -->  00:07:10,330
And they say PPOs title.

107

00:07:10,350  -->  00:07:11,730
There we go.

108

00:07:12,660  -->  00:07:13,880
Let's look at it now.

109

00:07:13,960  -->  00:07:16,220
Antar OK.

110

00:07:16,290  -->  00:07:18,260
Let's go back to real quick.

111

00:07:18,300  -->  00:07:18,990
We're still

112

00:07:22,110  -->  00:07:23,670
returning the

113

00:07:27,600  -->  00:07:32,410
let's go back here let's see what we return to we read we're making this return first That's why it

114

00:07:32,410  -->  00:07:33,300
is now work.

115

00:07:33,300  -->  00:07:33,660
All right.

116

00:07:33,660  -->  00:07:35,070
Now let's do this.

117

00:07:35,480  -->  00:07:38,080
And as you can see all the titles are here.

118

00:07:38,100  -->  00:07:39,450
Pretty cool stuff right guys.

119

00:07:39,450  -->  00:07:40,640
All right cool.

120

00:07:40,650  -->  00:07:48,480
So now we've got three different Polsce titles this plane and we're really good to go for this lecture

121

00:07:48,490  -->  00:07:49,050
OK.

122

00:07:49,080  -->  00:07:50,460
I'll see you in the next one.

123

00:07:50,460  -->  00:07:52,030
Take care guys.
