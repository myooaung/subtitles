00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:03.510
All right welcome back to these students I hope you're really excited because today we're going to be

2

00:00:03.510  -->  00:00:04.910
learning a bow.

3

00:00:05.220  -->  00:00:07.020
We've already done the create.

4

00:00:07.380  -->  00:00:09.710
We already run done the read.

5

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:10.530
All right.

6

00:00:10.890  -->  00:00:14.640
We need a lot of date med that's going to be pretty awesome.

7

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:15.330
All right.

8

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:17.460
We're almost there guys almost there.

9

00:00:17.470  -->  00:00:19.600
So but before we do that.

10

00:00:19.620  -->  00:00:22.350
All right we're showing this in the index.

11

00:00:22.620  -->  00:00:30.000
And since we're doing the read part of the crowd why don't we make sure that instead of seeing every

12

00:00:30.000  -->  00:00:32.350
post here we also see the individual pools.

13

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:33.050
Right.

14

00:00:33.060  -->  00:00:37.410
So let's do the show Mantid as well right here.

15

00:00:37.430  -->  00:00:38.600
That's you.

16

00:00:38.600  -->  00:00:40.200
There we go right here.

17

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:40.550
All right.

18

00:00:40.560  -->  00:00:42.560
So you remember how that works right.

19

00:00:43.110  -->  00:00:46.050
Let me just give you a little refresher real quick.

20

00:00:46.170  -->  00:00:47.920
The show matter right here.

21

00:00:48.300  -->  00:00:52.160
You can see that is going to have the you are I suppose.

22

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:53.400
And then for Slash.

23

00:00:53.570  -->  00:00:56.380
And you have to catch it with a variable.

24

00:00:56.460  -->  00:00:57.110
All right.

25

00:00:57.120  -->  00:01:00.450
Or with some type of ID or something there for that post.

26

00:01:00.450  -->  00:01:00.930
All right.

27

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:05.980
So that's why I has an idea here when we created this resource it created this idea for us there.

28

00:01:06.000  -->  00:01:06.600
OK.

29

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:11.220
So now what we're going to do here is going to return the view.

30

00:01:11.580  -->  00:01:12.150
Right.

31

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:17.850
And the name of this view is polls that show that's the name of the route.

32

00:01:18.120  -->  00:01:19.140
Ok cool.

33

00:01:19.140  -->  00:01:24.290
So now in order for us to show these polls we have to do we have to find their eyes so we have to say

34

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:33.560
post and then find or fail and then we have the idea right.

35

00:01:33.990  -->  00:01:36.020
That's all we do and we come back here.

36

00:01:36.330  -->  00:01:38.310
We are aware of our function here.

37

00:01:38.340  -->  00:01:40.860
It's really helpful.

38

00:01:40.860  -->  00:01:42.050
And when you say that.

39

00:01:42.330  -->  00:01:44.700
Ok cool.

40

00:01:44.730  -->  00:01:48.170
And now we go to the show.

41

00:01:48.840  -->  00:01:53.820
And with this play right here now let's go back to our end there and take that little piece of code

42

00:01:53.820  -->  00:01:59.490
from there and let's go back here and just base that in there because this is for their most recent

43

00:01:59.490  -->  00:02:01.080
purposes only guys.

44

00:02:01.080  -->  00:02:07.140
All right so now actually we don't need this because what we are displaying is just one poll so we don't

45

00:02:07.140  -->  00:02:08.250
need to live through anything.

46

00:02:08.280  -->  00:02:09.340
We already have it.

47

00:02:09.600  -->  00:02:17.580
So if you want to do having one you do have one and you know the title right here.

48

00:02:18.120  -->  00:02:24.650
So now OK if you pass the idea of the polls let's say for Slash 1.

49

00:02:24.870  -->  00:02:29.760
You can see the polls for that number to see that one.

50

00:02:29.820  -->  00:02:33.850
Number three you can see that we're on call now.

51

00:02:33.860  -->  00:02:37.780
Let's create a little link on the index to go to the polls right.

52

00:02:37.980  -->  00:02:40.320
That will be nice to do.

53

00:02:40.440  -->  00:02:41.410
All right.

54

00:02:41.610  -->  00:02:46.410
So let's go and create a little link right here swimming in that.

55

00:02:46.650  -->  00:02:50.060
I'm topping the AM tabbing it.

56

00:02:50.790  -->  00:02:54.120
And then I'm going to wrap it around.

57

00:02:54.210  -->  00:02:56.480
I'm going to show you this function for having yet.

58

00:02:56.490  -->  00:02:58.340
I think I already show you this function.

59

00:02:58.380  -->  00:03:00.000
Let's put it inside blade.

60

00:03:00.160  -->  00:03:05.520
And this is the route the name of the route that we want to send this thing to or whoever clicks on

61

00:03:05.870  -->  00:03:06.690
this link.

62

00:03:06.690  -->  00:03:08.840
We want to send them to pose that.

63

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:12.820
What were they going to the show Matt.

64

00:03:12.840  -->  00:03:13.360
Right.

65

00:03:13.470  -->  00:03:19.130
But now remember that this show meant the with you or I takes an I.D. right.

66

00:03:19.140  -->  00:03:21.880
So the second parameter of this function is an I.D..

67

00:03:22.080  -->  00:03:29.460
So we're just going to say balls we already have the ID re pose ID because we have this object here

68

00:03:29.470  -->  00:03:30.350
.

69

00:03:30.360  -->  00:03:34.470
All right this collection we are looping through finding each object and we have the ID right here and

70

00:03:34.470  -->  00:03:35.840
we have that title.

71

00:03:35.880  -->  00:03:36.770
All right cool.

72

00:03:36.780  -->  00:03:41.600
So now if I go back to pose we can see there are links.

73

00:03:41.640  -->  00:03:44.820
If I click on them it takes me to that specific post.

74

00:03:44.880  -->  00:03:47.280
Go back.

75

00:03:47.280  -->  00:03:49.680
All right cool stuff right guys.

76

00:03:49.680  -->  00:03:50.110
All right.

77

00:03:50.220  -->  00:03:54.870
So now let's get to the to the edit functionality right.

78

00:03:55.320  -->  00:03:56.680
Because that's why we've got to do.

79

00:03:56.850  -->  00:03:58.770
Let's go back here.

80

00:04:00.390  -->  00:04:04.890
And we are ready we already have this Actually this.

81

00:04:05.460  -->  00:04:08.850
All right we just have to make it so this one is to create.

82

00:04:09.000  -->  00:04:19.090
They just put a one here so it doesn't confuse us create post and this one would be a it post.

83

00:04:19.390  -->  00:04:24.520
Ok cool.

84

00:04:24.540  -->  00:04:25.290
All right.

85

00:04:25.620  -->  00:04:32.510
So now that we have this let's also go make this one receive an ID.

86

00:04:32.550  -->  00:04:35.290
So let's go to controller.

87

00:04:36.070  -->  00:04:39.720
Let's go to Ed it and this is why it's getting executed.

88

00:04:39.870  -->  00:04:40.860
All right.

89

00:04:40.920  -->  00:04:50.220
So remember when the visitors visits this you or I which is pose for last an ID and therefore Sless

90

00:04:50.310  -->  00:04:51.250
edit.

91

00:04:51.260  -->  00:04:53.930
All right that's automatically fine for us.

92

00:04:53.930  -->  00:04:55.910
They visit this route.

93

00:04:55.920  -->  00:04:57.450
They're going to hit this mentor right here.

94

00:04:57.450  -->  00:04:59.870
So they're going to hit this method.

95

00:04:59.950  -->  00:05:01.600
Let's just put this down a little bit.

96

00:05:02.210  -->  00:05:04.690
And we've got to find the pole star I'm going to pull.

97

00:05:04.710  -->  00:05:05.810
I'm going to copy that.

98

00:05:06.060  -->  00:05:08.600
Let's just do it.

99

00:05:08.880  -->  00:05:11.760
Find or fail.

100

00:05:11.760  -->  00:05:12.860
All right.

101

00:05:13.310  -->  00:05:17.630
We're going to find and then we're going to return the data the view.

102

00:05:18.320  -->  00:05:19.430
OK.

103

00:05:19.990  -->  00:05:29.810
And we're going to return to pose that edit view and we will return it with what with Tippoo's of course

104

00:05:29.810  -->  00:05:30.460
guys.

105

00:05:30.480  -->  00:05:31.950
Very good.

106

00:05:31.950  -->  00:05:32.610
There we go.

107

00:05:32.790  -->  00:05:36.060
Like this super simple stuff right.

108

00:05:36.570  -->  00:05:37.240
Cool.

109

00:05:37.530  -->  00:05:42.950
So now we have done that and let's go back to our edit.

110

00:05:42.990  -->  00:05:44.300
All right.

111

00:05:44.310  -->  00:05:47.670
On the next lecture we're going to continue with the added functionality is going to be pretty cool

112

00:05:47.670  -->  00:05:49.990
guys and see you then.

113

00:05:50.070  -->  00:05:50.580
Take care.

114

00:05:50.580  -->  00:05:51.840
Bye bye.
