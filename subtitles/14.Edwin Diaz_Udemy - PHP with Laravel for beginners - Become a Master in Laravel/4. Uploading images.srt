1

00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:00,610
All right.

2

00:00:00,620  -->  00:00:02,610
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02,610  -->  00:00:07,870
So on this lecture here we are going to be finally uploading images.

4

00:00:07,920  -->  00:00:08,950
Yeah that's right.

5

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:13,980
We've got to do it all right now I want you to grab any image that you have anywhere on your computer

6

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:15,720
and drop it in there and see what happens.

7

00:00:15,720  -->  00:00:21,510
All right we're going to have our inspector Fleming open real quick and our Network tab right here.

8

00:00:21,510  -->  00:00:22,310
All right.

9

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:23,790
Now I want you to look at that.

10

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:27,990
And going to drop some images real quick I'm going to drop my image.

11

00:00:28,320  -->  00:00:31,310
And as you can see it gives me a 500 error there.

12

00:00:31,330  -->  00:00:32,930
Does not find anything.

13

00:00:32,930  -->  00:00:38,670
I mean it's this we get this internal error here is saying something is wrong.

14

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:40,290
What's going on.

15

00:00:40,950  -->  00:00:42,180
All right.

16

00:00:42,180  -->  00:00:42,840
All right.

17

00:00:42,840  -->  00:00:45,930
So let's actually take care of that.

18

00:00:45,930  -->  00:00:50,100
Let's go back to our HTP controllers.

19

00:00:50,670  -->  00:01:03,520
And right here on store what we're going to create now we gonna come back here and we go and call the

20

00:01:03,520  -->  00:01:10,370
store and make sure that you put the request here guys.

21

00:01:10,380  -->  00:01:11,340
All right.

22

00:01:12,240  -->  00:01:12,870
Cool.

23

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:19,560
Let's return let's actually go blow it right away.

24

00:01:19,560  -->  00:01:21,270
All right let's just do it.

25

00:01:21,270  -->  00:01:21,570
All right.

26

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:30,990
So from that form from that form automatically We're going to get a pause superglue or we'll call file

27

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:32,220
would a kill file.

28

00:01:32,310  -->  00:01:32,930
OK.

29

00:01:33,110  -->  00:01:39,270
Like this if it was native BHB will get something like that.

30

00:01:39,310  -->  00:01:42,030
All right with the imagery information I.

31

00:01:42,500  -->  00:01:43,430
I actually like.

32

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:44,450
I'm sorry.

33

00:01:44,450  -->  00:01:47,710
All right files.

34

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:48,340
All right.

35

00:01:48,540  -->  00:01:53,610
But in this case this is about.

36

00:01:53,640  -->  00:01:58,040
So we're going to get our requests.

37

00:01:58,070  -->  00:02:05,190
It's going to be type of file requests and it's going to be named file.

38

00:02:05,550  -->  00:02:05,900
All right.

39

00:02:05,940  -->  00:02:11,640
By default if you change if you want to change it you can go to the drop zone Web site and they have

40

00:02:12,540  -->  00:02:16,560
they have the documentation there but then you can set a default with something you can set did the

41

00:02:16,560  -->  00:02:18,480
form with some options.

42

00:02:18,480  -->  00:02:28,350
All right let's give it some random time numbers here for our images like we do all the time.

43

00:02:28,350  -->  00:02:34,230
And let's just move it as well to images

44

00:02:38,520  -->  00:02:41,180
right.

45

00:02:41,640  -->  00:02:45,270
And this created super easy stuff guys

46

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:49,240
path

47

00:02:52,320  -->  00:03:02,610
actually is a path I believe this file has the same name as one comment on the form.

48

00:03:02,610  -->  00:03:04,030
OK.

49

00:03:04,170  -->  00:03:05,070
All right.

50

00:03:05,730  -->  00:03:07,770
So let's see this bathing action.

51

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:10,140
All right let's.

52

00:03:10,590  -->  00:03:13,610
Actually releasing images here.

53

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:20,620
Hopefully our application doesn't go all crazy because we're deleting images.

54

00:03:21,250  -->  00:03:22,920
I'm going to delete are the images.

55

00:03:22,950  -->  00:03:24,120
I know that's very.

56

00:03:24,330  -->  00:03:27,020
As a matter of fact licious.

57

00:03:27,900  -->  00:03:30,060
Let's just leave it there.

58

00:03:30,060  -->  00:03:32,230
We're going to overlook some more images.

59

00:03:32,370  -->  00:03:33,720
I don't want to leave my images.

60

00:03:33,750  -->  00:03:35,130
No.

61

00:03:35,670  -->  00:03:37,710
All right cool.

62

00:03:37,710  -->  00:03:41,840
Let's click on this and let's use our blog.

63

00:03:43,560  -->  00:03:50,710
All these images and I'm going to hit the open and when I do that let me see if I can.

64

00:03:51,130  -->  00:03:56,490
Well now we're not going to be able to see it with my editor because I have to synchronize but if I

65

00:03:56,490  -->  00:03:58,550
do this all these images should be here.

66

00:03:58,560  -->  00:04:06,240
Let's synchronize it and let's wait for it.

67

00:04:06,240  -->  00:04:09,150
There we go see that.

68

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:12,810
So now we get images now and not only that but we can see this thing in no obligation.

69

00:04:12,810  -->  00:04:13,870
Real quick.

70

00:04:14,160  -->  00:04:18,060
Let's go to our application and you can see all the images right here.

71

00:04:18,090  -->  00:04:20,090
All right.

72

00:04:20,430  -->  00:04:21,540
Beautiful.

73

00:04:21,540  -->  00:04:24,000
That is just nice right.

74

00:04:24,000  -->  00:04:26,820
It would be nice to be able to delete these images as well.

75

00:04:26,820  -->  00:04:28,800
So we're going to do that in the next lecture.

76

00:04:28,800  -->  00:04:29,970
Take care.

77

00:04:29,970  -->  00:04:30,640
Have fun.

78

00:04:30,640  -->  00:04:31,360
And I see you then.

79

00:04:31,370  -->  00:04:32,010
Bye bye.
