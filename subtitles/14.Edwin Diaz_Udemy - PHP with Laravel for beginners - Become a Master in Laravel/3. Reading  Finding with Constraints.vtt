00:00:00.180  -->  00:00:04.500
All right welcome back my students so now that we are retrieving records and we know how to retrieve

2

00:00:04.770  -->  00:00:10.340
one single instance model right for instance and will know how to retrieve multiple.

3

00:00:10.500  -->  00:00:14.170
Let's find out how we can we treat them with conditions right.

4

00:00:14.550  -->  00:00:15.480
All right cool.

5

00:00:15.480  -->  00:00:18.650
So let's comment this hour real quick.

6

00:00:18.870  -->  00:00:25.850
You can of course keep making comments about each and every thing that you are doing here.

7

00:00:25.860  -->  00:00:28.350
Read find whatever.

8

00:00:28.350  -->  00:00:28.990
All right.

9

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:37.870
So now how can we retrieve information based on a where statement like we do in roll as well right.

10

00:00:38.070  -->  00:00:41.270
Or native BHB.

11

00:00:41.480  -->  00:00:45.130
So supercool let me let me show you.

12

00:00:45.240  -->  00:00:48.780
Let's create a route and

13

00:00:51.720  -->  00:00:53.100
I'm going to call this

14

00:00:56.430  -->  00:00:57.090
find

15

00:01:00.290  -->  00:01:01.650
do we have a final ready.

16

00:01:01.690  -->  00:01:05.970
Yeah we we have a find there so we could use the same one that's fine.

17

00:01:05.970  -->  00:01:08.260
We can just replicate it here.

18

00:01:08.280  -->  00:01:09.450
All right fine where.

19

00:01:09.530  -->  00:01:14.070
Let's call it find where that's cool and then function.

20

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:16.890
All right.

21

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:18.160
All right.

22

00:01:18.840  -->  00:01:20.420
So let's do something simple right.

23

00:01:20.430  -->  00:01:29.570
So let's say pose and let's use the model and we got to do this.

24

00:01:29.910  -->  00:01:32.640
It's going to be kind of backwards but it's not.

25

00:01:32.760  -->  00:01:43.990
All right we're going to say where there's a method and where I-T equals one actually two.

26

00:01:44.020  -->  00:01:45.330
I always keep forgetting that.

27

00:01:45.460  -->  00:01:50.990
That's right not we're not done with that right.

28

00:01:50.990  -->  00:01:55.650
So now what we can do is we can do something called chaining or we're going to change it it changes

29

00:01:56.070  -->  00:02:01.580
to another method call order by the camel case.

30

00:02:01.740  -->  00:02:07.740
So we got the first one all lower case and then the second word starts with an upper case.

31

00:02:07.740  -->  00:02:10.120
So this method takes two parameters.

32

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:12.250
Again where.

33

00:02:12.400  -->  00:02:12.960
All right.

34

00:02:13.110  -->  00:02:16.170
So order by D.

35

00:02:16.200  -->  00:02:16.530
Right.

36

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:18.300
I mean where ID goes to order.

37

00:02:18.300  -->  00:02:20.190
By what do you want to be ordered by

38

00:02:23.730  -->  00:02:27.840
id say Id descending.

39

00:02:28.020  -->  00:02:28.520
Right.

40

00:02:28.660  -->  00:02:31.630
Let's just do that or ascending.

41

00:02:31.650  -->  00:02:32.690
It's up to you.

42

00:02:32.700  -->  00:02:33.570
All right.

43

00:02:33.630  -->  00:02:39.560
Actually I think is the as C not misspelling incorrectly we're good.

44

00:02:39.640  -->  00:02:50.410
Let's keep changing and they are going to say take one out of it and then bring get it to me.

45

00:02:50.910  -->  00:02:51.730
All right.

46

00:02:51.960  -->  00:02:56.140
And then we can say return POWs of course we only have one record.

47

00:02:56.430  -->  00:03:01.560
But let's actually insert another record as a matter of fact we already have an insert

48

00:03:01.580  -->  00:03:06.960
.

49

00:03:07.060  -->  00:03:09.960
All right let's use puls right there.

50

00:03:10.740  -->  00:03:12.640
Let's see if we can.

51

00:03:13.020  -->  00:03:14.950
Something's wrong with my return.

52

00:03:14.950  -->  00:03:15.870
All right we go.

53

00:03:16.080  -->  00:03:19.270
Let's see if we can insert something here real quick.

54

00:03:19.290  -->  00:03:29.020
Let's use one of our Royse inserts here and we're gonna insert peachy Claribel.

55

00:03:29.730  -->  00:03:35.670
Let's use do Loughran well as some

56

00:03:38.580  -->  00:03:41.860
with Edwin go.

57

00:03:42.390  -->  00:03:48.080
Now I'm you're going to put periods here something like that just to make it different.

58

00:03:48.160  -->  00:03:53.850
And now I'm going to go to my browser of course and we're going to go and see and just insert something

59

00:03:53.850  -->  00:03:54.390
there.

60

00:03:54.390  -->  00:03:56.260
Insert enter.

61

00:03:56.370  -->  00:03:57.210
Cool.

62

00:03:57.210  -->  00:04:03.710
So now we have a different record there and you can verify that of course if you go to your database

63

00:04:03.720  -->  00:04:05.700
you can see it.

64

00:04:05.760  -->  00:04:07.440
All right cool.

65

00:04:08.490  -->  00:04:09.180
So now

66

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:15.770
we have this like this.

67

00:04:15.780  -->  00:04:20.000
Let's actually find now what are we getting right.

68

00:04:20.760  -->  00:04:21.420
So

69

00:04:25.040  -->  00:04:30.900
let's start this do it find where find where enter.

70

00:04:31.040  -->  00:04:35.450
And as you can see we're able to pull that out.

71

00:04:36.000  -->  00:04:39.870
All right if I wanted to pull the other one now I just

72

00:04:42.870  -->  00:04:43.590
say this out

73

00:04:46.450  -->  00:04:51.790
and pull the other one out.

74

00:04:51.910  -->  00:04:52.570
All right.

75

00:04:52.620  -->  00:04:59.550
Or if I had another let's say a column that was active or E's admin I could pull out all the adman's

76

00:04:59.640  -->  00:05:06.840
and Order order them by id descending and take one out bring out whatever you see that you see how easy

77

00:05:06.840  -->  00:05:13.170
it is to pulao to use Outlook when to deal with databases supercool super easy to do.

78

00:05:13.870  -->  00:05:14.300
Right.

79

00:05:14.310  -->  00:05:17.180
And there are a lot more metho guys a lot more mentors that we can use.

80

00:05:17.190  -->  00:05:21.030
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

81

00:05:21.030  -->  00:05:26.930
I think we're done here but we'll get back in with some more eloquent later on.

82

00:05:27.120  -->  00:05:29.460
And of course we'll keep going.

83

00:05:29.460  -->  00:05:29.830
Right now.

84

00:05:29.830  -->  00:05:32.980
Well when we still got a little bit to catch and a little bit to do.

85

00:05:33.240  -->  00:05:36.150
Thank you so much for watching again LCN and lectures.

86

00:05:36.150  -->  00:05:36.740
Take care.
