00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:01.900
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.950  -->  00:00:05.040
It's time for us to start creating our project.

3

00:00:05.040  -->  00:00:05.580
All right.

4

00:00:05.580  -->  00:00:12.470
So the first step is to create a new Larabee installation so go to your HD docs and less typing commands

5

00:00:12.470  -->  00:00:12.570
.

6

00:00:12.570  -->  00:00:21.410
Let's say composers create project and we get to do this one now preferred distro.

7

00:00:21.950  -->  00:00:28.890
This is a new command is actually the same command issues reordered or I have if you remember we started

8

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:34.440
in the course we started with this idea almost right.

9

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:41.370
So it wasn't working for me after a while and then I have to switch it up all right.

10

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:42.280
It depends.

11

00:00:42.420  -->  00:00:50.220
You know when you have the your composer you King all day you're a composer by doing the composer self

12

00:00:51.030  -->  00:00:56.650
update like this helps yourself didn't like that.

13

00:00:56.970  -->  00:00:58.020
All right.

14

00:00:58.140  -->  00:01:03.810
So anyway just make sure before you update that you read the documentation because your is your stuff

15

00:01:03.910  -->  00:01:05.470
start failing right.

16

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:07.550
So a composer create project.

17

00:01:07.830  -->  00:01:12.180
And if you want to pause a video and go ahead and do this we're going to create a project is going to

18

00:01:12.180  -->  00:01:15.610
be cold cold hacking.

19

00:01:15.690  -->  00:01:21.360
I think that's a great name for a project where you think and I'm sorry for my manners or even ask you

20

00:01:21.750  -->  00:01:28.560
if you were if you agree with a project name but if you want a different project name go ahead you know

21

00:01:28.560  -->  00:01:29.880
name it whatever you want.

22

00:01:30.060  -->  00:01:39.190
So anyway prefer distro and package and the vendor of the vendor and the package name and we'll get

23

00:01:39.190  -->  00:01:42.420
the name called hacking.

24

00:01:42.540  -->  00:01:46.880
All right cool and going to be version five point to nine.

25

00:01:46.900  -->  00:01:48.950
And that's a current version that I'm using right now.

26

00:01:49.020  -->  00:01:52.980
So even if I don't type this version I would get the same version right.

27

00:01:53.160  -->  00:01:57.480
But you might be looking at this in the future and you might have a different version.

28

00:01:57.510  -->  00:02:00.070
So if you want to do a full version that's OK.

29

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:05.690
But I would prefer you to do this version so that where we can be on the same page.

30

00:02:05.850  -->  00:02:08.510
But I will keep updating the scores anyways.

31

00:02:08.520  -->  00:02:09.340
All right cool.

32

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:13.220
So I'm going to click enter.

33

00:02:13.770  -->  00:02:15.350
You see my computer super fast.

34

00:02:15.350  -->  00:02:18.580
You saw that I'm just joking I posed to you guys.

35

00:02:18.690  -->  00:02:19.200
All right.

36

00:02:19.320  -->  00:02:27.470
So now that we have this let's go to our hold file right and let's do a pseudo E.T. see.

37

00:02:27.600  -->  00:02:32.650
And holes actually we have to go Nan on this guy.

38

00:02:33.420  -->  00:02:35.240
That's a good term isn't it.

39

00:02:35.250  -->  00:02:36.630
We have to go national.

40

00:02:36.630  -->  00:02:37.510
There we go.

41

00:02:37.530  -->  00:02:42.160
And now let's go all the way to the bottom here and let's set it up.

42

00:02:42.450  -->  00:02:42.960
Whoops.

43

00:02:42.980  -->  00:02:48.320
Now I want to for I never change my server IP address code.

44

00:02:48.320  -->  00:02:51.630
Hacking DV.

45

00:02:51.750  -->  00:02:53.550
All right.

46

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:58.520
Now let's go to the virtual hose.

47

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:00.230
So suruh Nano.

48

00:03:00.330  -->  00:03:04.370
And for me it's going to be applications were for you could be anything else right.

49

00:03:04.370  -->  00:03:12.540
I mean if you own a Windows machine or linnets you know your path or applications camp and I believe

50

00:03:12.570  -->  00:03:16.560
the CTC extra and

51

00:03:19.910  -->  00:03:24.450
we go I suggest you get yourself some alias's guys.

52

00:03:24.450  -->  00:03:25.490
All right.

53

00:03:26.190  -->  00:03:29.220
I don't want to keep doing alias's because I don't know if you guys have set it up.

54

00:03:29.220  -->  00:03:30.720
I want to be in the same page as you.

55

00:03:30.720  -->  00:03:35.600
So if I do alias's and you have him being able to do it you're going to get lost because they're going

56

00:03:35.600  -->  00:03:38.630
to do it pretty fast.

57

00:03:38.730  -->  00:03:41.640
All right so called hacking.

58

00:03:42.760  -->  00:03:47.310
All right.

59

00:03:47.770  -->  00:03:48.030
And

60

00:03:53.090  -->  00:03:56.850
cool hacking.

61

00:03:56.880  -->  00:04:00.040
All right I think I got it right correct this time.

62

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:03.680
And let's go to our ZAHM.

63

00:04:04.410  -->  00:04:10.820
We can find it if I can find the one of my monitors here right here.

64

00:04:11.520  -->  00:04:12.660
Let's just restart it

65

00:04:16.520  -->  00:04:19.410
and just restart it let's go and check it out real quick.

66

00:04:19.410  -->  00:04:21.220
Code hacking.

67

00:04:21.510  -->  00:04:24.880
Now if you're wondering why I chose that name Murphies working.

68

00:04:25.330  -->  00:04:30.770
It's just because you know it's about time that we change the names of our projects right we have some

69

00:04:30.780  -->  00:04:35.300
really you know passive names like CMOS or e-commerce.

70

00:04:35.310  -->  00:04:40.230
Let's just name it called hacking issues create a site where people can post their stuff and we can

71

00:04:40.230  -->  00:04:41.970
just help each other out right.

72

00:04:42.150  -->  00:04:43.450
I don't already checked.

73

00:04:43.470  -->  00:04:50.400
Cole How can dot com is not available guys or I just read that maybe cold hacking that something else

74

00:04:50.460  -->  00:04:55.090
is available but this one has not arrived but just in case.

75

00:04:55.230  -->  00:04:59.460
If you wanted to just know that why I named this light this is just because I want to make this a little

76

00:04:59.460  -->  00:05:00.780
bit more exciting.

77

00:05:00.780  -->  00:05:01.170
All right.

78

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:03.190
But anyway thank you so much for watching.

79

00:05:03.210  -->  00:05:04.410
Let's go to the next lecture
