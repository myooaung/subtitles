00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.340
All right welcome back my students on the last lecture.

2

00:00:02.340  -->  00:00:07.070
I thought this by in here was kind of a different from what it is now.

3

00:00:07.320  -->  00:00:11.860
And I thought it was a had to do with a class that I was given a class form control.

4

00:00:12.060  -->  00:00:13.160
But I guess it wasn't that.

5

00:00:13.170  -->  00:00:17.390
And I was just playing around with it a little bit but it isn't that it wasn't that.

6

00:00:17.400  -->  00:00:20.410
So I'm going to take this off.

7

00:00:20.970  -->  00:00:23.070
I'm just going to leave it like this.

8

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:30.720
As a matter of fact I might just take the class out because it's going to make things.

9

00:00:32.370  -->  00:00:35.500
I got to leave didn't know they I just got to leave it that way these guys.

10

00:00:35.490  -->  00:00:36.050
All.

11

00:00:36.380  -->  00:00:38.070
I got to play around with it right now.

12

00:00:38.070  -->  00:00:45.090
Later on after we finish all this if we want to tweak it and you know tweak our application to have

13

00:00:45.090  -->  00:00:47.060
different styles cool.

14

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:50.790
We do that but right now we've got to focus on making this work.

15

00:00:50.970  -->  00:00:55.670
So let's find out we are actually getting some type of data right.

16

00:00:55.890  -->  00:00:57.750
Right now it's blank.

17

00:00:57.780  -->  00:01:00.390
Let's go to our ad admin post controller

18

00:01:03.420  -->  00:01:06.460
this torment is the one responsible to receive all that data.

19

00:01:06.510  -->  00:01:08.700
Let's see what he's receiving.

20

00:01:09.710  -->  00:01:10.720
OK.

21

00:01:11.340  -->  00:01:12.840
And devilishness

22

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:29.580
create this return that is returning all of this so we can say it is working.

23

00:01:29.580  -->  00:01:29.970
All right.

24

00:01:30.030  -->  00:01:30.830
Cool.

25

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:38.410
One thing that I want to do here is that I want to make a request.

26

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:39.310
Whoops.

27

00:01:39.390  -->  00:01:43.650
I saw this data I'm stealing thinker.

28

00:01:44.100  -->  00:01:46.270
Just get out of there.

29

00:01:46.800  -->  00:01:53.670
So let's make our requests here for validation for our form in posts.

30

00:01:53.720  -->  00:01:57.060
So Whoops.

31

00:01:57.630  -->  00:02:10.100
The HP areason make requests posts create requests.

32

00:02:10.380  -->  00:02:11.510
All right.

33

00:02:11.670  -->  00:02:16.120
We go synchronize mice.

34

00:02:16.120  -->  00:02:16.680
Here

35

00:02:19.950  -->  00:02:22.920
we go.

36

00:02:22.920  -->  00:02:27.950
This is true here.

37

00:02:28.040  -->  00:02:31.650
And let's see what we are going to be validating.

38

00:02:32.160  -->  00:02:33.230
All right.

39

00:02:33.780  -->  00:02:39.390
So we know that if we don't have a category we don't want to go anywhere.

40

00:02:39.750  -->  00:02:42.800
So category ID

41

00:02:46.410  -->  00:02:47.970
this should be required

42

00:02:47.970  -->  00:02:54.220
.

43

00:02:54.270  -->  00:02:55.670
What else should be required.

44

00:02:55.680  -->  00:02:56.700
A photo

45

00:03:06.150  -->  00:03:13.240
what else a title we can have a force without a title right.

46

00:03:13.950  -->  00:03:15.400
So the should be required

47

00:03:17.930  -->  00:03:22.520
and body.

48

00:03:25.590  -->  00:03:28.920
OK.

49

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:37.410
Now of course you can make these ladies so that way makes more sense

50

00:03:37.410  -->  00:03:46.590
.

51

00:03:46.620  -->  00:03:49.380
All right.

52

00:03:52.560  -->  00:03:55.930
Let's go back to our.

53

00:03:57.780  -->  00:04:04.200
As a matter of fact in our views because all we want to do now is display the arrows right.

54

00:04:04.200  -->  00:04:07.600
But we have a form.

55

00:04:07.750  -->  00:04:11.620
Let's go back to.

56

00:04:13.620  -->  00:04:14.010
Right.

57

00:04:14.010  -->  00:04:15.180
We've got this tray here.

58

00:04:15.180  -->  00:04:17.000
I'm just checking some things out guys.

59

00:04:17.010  -->  00:04:17.550
All right.

60

00:04:17.730  -->  00:04:20.140
So let's go to resources real quick.

61

00:04:20.160  -->  00:04:23.290
And we see inclusive form error Belaid.

62

00:04:23.340  -->  00:04:23.990
All right.

63

00:04:24.210  -->  00:04:29.900
So we can include this just like we did in our users.

64

00:04:29.900  -->  00:04:30.860
I mean that's right.

65

00:04:31.060  -->  00:04:33.060
Was it in that it was only created.

66

00:04:33.450  -->  00:04:41.880
So we are including these errors there so we can do that to our boss create a year.

67

00:04:43.270  -->  00:04:44.850
OK.

68

00:04:45.180  -->  00:04:53.370
Make sure to actually make this a role so that way you guys don't have a problem with it

69

00:04:55.780  -->  00:04:59.200
.

70

00:05:02.730  -->  00:05:09.740
Just stop being lazy right.

71

00:05:15.240  -->  00:05:17.060
All right.

72

00:05:19.020  -->  00:05:21.680
So we've got validations in place we'll test them later.

73

00:05:21.690  -->  00:05:28.180
But we know it's working well just in case you want it tested go ahead and do that.

74

00:05:30.530  -->  00:05:32.220
That's OK that's good.

75

00:05:32.220  -->  00:05:34.770
They're beautiful.

76

00:05:34.770  -->  00:05:35.210
All right.

77

00:05:35.310  -->  00:05:38.820
So we've got to continue this in the next lecture because we still got a couple of more things to do

78

00:05:38.820  -->  00:05:39.400
here.

79

00:05:39.720  -->  00:05:40.560
Thank you so much.

80

00:05:40.560  -->  00:05:42.660
See you in the next lecture
