00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,300
All right welcome back my students so we are making good progress here with the comments.

2

00:00:04,440  -->  00:00:10,540
I'm going to go to to our what you might call it to our posts here.

3

00:00:10,680  -->  00:00:16,740
And as a matter of fact I'm going to add a little feature here that I was going to take as to that specific

4

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:17,700
post.

5

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:18,600
All right.

6

00:00:19,030  -->  00:00:22,770
So we had this but we don't have it and it would be nice to do.

7

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:23,140
All right.

8

00:00:23,140  -->  00:00:30,790
So let's go to the post page adman's.

9

00:00:30,820  -->  00:00:35,830
I'm going to minimize all this.

10

00:00:36,360  -->  00:00:46,380
There we go and I'm going to add this right after body that's going to be a link and very similar to

11

00:00:46,380  -->  00:00:50,450
what we did in the in the other.

12

00:00:50,550  -->  00:00:58,410
We're going to say I want you to take me to the home post and please take this idea with you.

13

00:00:59,190  -->  00:00:59,930
All right.

14

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:01,430
Cool.

15

00:01:01,530  -->  00:01:02,420
If you post

16

00:01:05,070  -->  00:01:07,330
and it's super cool.

17

00:01:07,360  -->  00:01:11,670
We're going to open your tie and that's going to take me to the post.

18

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:12,100
Cool.

19

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:17,340
It will be nice to also have a tag here for comments right now if you put a lot of stuff here guys.

20

00:01:17,370  -->  00:01:20,300
You know you won't be able to see your body here.

21

00:01:20,310  -->  00:01:28,260
So you know I'm not going to go into details on how to create a page to see the comment because you

22

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:29,820
guys should know that right.

23

00:01:29,820  -->  00:01:32,780
We I mean we do that with the post we have.

24

00:01:32,790  -->  00:01:38,070
We do that with everything here and this publication is about doing the crowd Ryrie create read up day

25

00:01:38,070  -->  00:01:38,520
in the lead.

26

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:41,340
So you know that should be very easy for you.

27

00:01:41,370  -->  00:01:43,680
So I'm not going to go into details about that.

28

00:01:44,070  -->  00:01:51,110
All right so let's actually be on now functionality where we can see the comment.

29

00:01:51,350  -->  00:01:53,230
So I'm going to have a link here.

30

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:59,340
This link is going to take me to the comments page.

31

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:06,800
I will leave his admin comments and that's it.

32

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:07,970
I don't know.

33

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:08,670
I don't know.

34

00:02:08,670  -->  00:02:14,130
You see I took an answer that's nothing wrong with that guys.

35

00:02:14,130  -->  00:02:15,520
Nothing wrong with that.

36

00:02:15,540  -->  00:02:17,340
So admen

37

00:02:20,010  -->  00:02:22,320
comments that ended I think I'm right.

38

00:02:22,480  -->  00:02:23,730
I am.

39

00:02:24,510  -->  00:02:26,110
There we go again.

40

00:02:27,000  -->  00:02:27,530
All right.

41

00:02:27,630  -->  00:02:33,910
So a few comments.

42

00:02:37,510  -->  00:02:42,700
Let's see if that allows us to do that.

43

00:02:43,260  -->  00:02:51,840
We could do that we can view the comments but it would be nice to view just disposed comments so we

44

00:02:51,840  -->  00:02:54,720
could do that as well.

45

00:02:54,720  -->  00:02:55,620
All right.

46

00:02:55,730  -->  00:02:59,570
So right now we are linking to this.

47

00:02:59,580  -->  00:03:09,090
But if we go and do a show and pass the idea of the polls we can go to a specific page where we only

48

00:03:09,090  -->  00:03:11,910
see the comments for this post.

49

00:03:12,000  -->  00:03:12,450
So

50

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:21,150
let's go and create that real quick.

51

00:03:21,150  -->  00:03:22,510
I wasn't planning on creating that.

52

00:03:22,530  -->  00:03:26,730
But now that you insist.

53

00:03:27,300  -->  00:03:29,430
Let's do that.

54

00:03:29,640  -->  00:03:30,330
All right.

55

00:03:30,330  -->  00:03:30,720
So

56

00:03:42,240  -->  00:03:43,640
this is a table here for.

57

00:03:43,670  -->  00:03:47,970
For that I'm going to face a year and see if we can modify this and make it

58

00:03:55,080  -->  00:03:55,770
make it better

59

00:03:55,770  -->  00:04:02,970
.

60

00:04:03,330  -->  00:04:05,150
We don't need to do anything

61

00:04:07,590  -->  00:04:10,080
.

62

00:04:10,500  -->  00:04:12,660
As a matter of fact we only need a table here guys

63

00:04:15,720  -->  00:04:18,150
and for each of us

64

00:04:41,160  -->  00:04:42,160
actually we need it.

65

00:04:42,170  -->  00:04:42,960
And the

66

00:04:45,870  -->  00:04:47,270
this one here.

67

00:04:48,180  -->  00:04:55,560
And if and then there was let's see what we get.

68

00:04:55,560  -->  00:04:59,130
All right there we go

69

00:05:04,110  -->  00:05:08,460
your comments you also comment want but we don't have anything there.

70

00:05:08,550  -->  00:05:10,980
So he goes to that specific comment there.

71

00:05:10,980  -->  00:05:16,770
We could however create a page where we only show the comments for The View.

72

00:05:16,770  -->  00:05:17,840
All right.

73

00:05:18,750  -->  00:05:20,850
So that's what we're going to do in the next lecture.

74

00:05:20,850  -->  00:05:23,700
We're going to play around with that a little bit because I want to show you how to do that.

75

00:05:23,700  -->  00:05:24,330
All right.

76

00:05:24,390  -->  00:05:25,920
Anyway thank you so much for watching.

77

00:05:25,920  -->  00:05:27,630
I'll see you in the next lecture
