00:00:00,240  -->  00:00:04,720
All right welcome back to the students on the last lecture with a little bit of everything right.

2

00:00:04,740  -->  00:00:10,500
We've created some functionality where we see the individual post as you can see right here.

3

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:12,060
All right.

4

00:00:12,060  -->  00:00:19,930
We also created the functionality where we find the post and we send it to the edit form.

5

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:24,150
So that way gets populated right and I'll show you that in this lecture how we do that.

6

00:00:24,150  -->  00:00:26,750
So right now this is going to this form right here.

7

00:00:26,880  -->  00:00:29,190
Actually it's not going there yet.

8

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:31,870
Let me see.

9

00:00:31,870  -->  00:00:35,450
All right it should.

10

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:38,140
Let's go to our terminal look the HP router list.

11

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:43,110
So we supposed to go to polls an ID in between.

12

00:00:43,110  -->  00:00:44,170
And then the edit.

13

00:00:44,220  -->  00:00:44,830
All right.

14

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:46,540
So let's go ahead and do that.

15

00:00:46,540  -->  00:00:49,520
And the reason why I did not do is because I forgot this for Slash.

16

00:00:49,570  -->  00:00:53,130
Enter now you can see that it will form there but it's not getting populated.

17

00:00:53,310  -->  00:00:59,000
So that's the whole reason why we're sending we're finding the post and we sending it there.

18

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:04,290
So that way we can take those values and populate the form.

19

00:01:04,290  -->  00:01:05,450
So let's go into that.

20

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:08,090
Let's go to the edit and right here.

21

00:01:08,220  -->  00:01:20,080
I'm going to create a value and use Billy to put the pools title in there and it's as simple as that

22

00:01:20,080  -->  00:01:20,110
.

23

00:01:20,120  -->  00:01:24,530
Guys very simple enter as you can see the title is there.

24

00:01:24,530  -->  00:01:28,790
Now look at that beautiful right now in order for us to submit this.

25

00:01:28,860  -->  00:01:30,560
We need to do a couple of things.

26

00:01:30,570  -->  00:01:30,900
All right.

27

00:01:30,900  -->  00:01:40,710
First of all we need to have the ID of the post sent somewhere so it's going to be going to let's open

28

00:01:40,710  -->  00:01:42,740
our BHB route less real quick.

29

00:01:42,900  -->  00:01:50,430
Is going to this update right so he needs to go in this in this format the post and the ID soling action

30

00:01:50,700  -->  00:01:55,000
you put forward slash and the ID.

31

00:01:55,140  -->  00:02:00,070
Now also make sure that your method this post may be on the last lecture I didn't do that.

32

00:02:00,120  -->  00:02:01,910
Or maybe you don't have it.

33

00:02:01,930  -->  00:02:04,970
Just make sure that your form says method post there.

34

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:05,630
OK.

35

00:02:05,910  -->  00:02:12,490
Now Laro bill does not understand this post when you see the one you you're using this you or I understand

36

00:02:12,510  -->  00:02:14,560
understands put or patch.

37

00:02:14,610  -->  00:02:18,350
So we need to make it so that way Larabee understands it.

38

00:02:18,540  -->  00:02:19,200
OK.

39

00:02:19,500  -->  00:02:25,170
So in order for that to happen we need to create an imp hitting input all right and there are packages

40

00:02:25,230  -->  00:02:30,060
and we will learn about them but they are packages where would all this is done for us automatically

41

00:02:30,060  -->  00:02:32,790
once we define a couple of previous functions.

42

00:02:32,790  -->  00:02:36,020
Right now we're doing it the hard way because I want you to understand how everything works.

43

00:02:36,030  -->  00:02:36,460
OK.

44

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:42,850
So let's create this input is going to be type hidden arrived.

45

00:02:43,020  -->  00:02:48,170
And let's give it a name.

46

00:02:48,200  -->  00:02:49,800
This is going to be a super global.

47

00:02:50,130  -->  00:02:52,850
Whoops we have a comma here.

48

00:02:52,980  -->  00:02:58,470
So this super global is going to be sent as underscore method.

49

00:02:58,680  -->  00:02:59,390
All right.

50

00:02:59,700  -->  00:03:07,270
And the next thing is the value the value of this loops is going to be put.

51

00:03:07,290  -->  00:03:11,730
All right we're going to be putting that information in there in that database and once you do that

52

00:03:11,730  -->  00:03:12,930
you're good to go with this.

53

00:03:12,920  -->  00:03:14,690
OK.

54

00:03:14,760  -->  00:03:23,050
Also make sure that this is in belayed not jaws dropped in there you probably saw that.

55

00:03:23,410  -->  00:03:25,110
OK what else are we missing here.

56

00:03:25,110  -->  00:03:26,830
I'm trying to see.

57

00:03:26,860  -->  00:03:27,430
All right.

58

00:03:27,570  -->  00:03:32,570
Oh another thing here is that each of these four needs to have a talking.

59

00:03:32,580  -->  00:03:33,150
All right.

60

00:03:33,240  -->  00:03:41,250
So Larabee has this if you don't know what the talking is you should go back and take my you know BHB

61

00:03:41,250  -->  00:03:47,880
log in of course which I show you how to create a really cool talking using a couple of functions from

62

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:48,320
BHP.

63

00:03:48,320  -->  00:03:56,700
But anyways a big string of integers that I'll show you right now what it is so we're going to create

64

00:03:56,940  -->  00:04:05,160
the blade format here and it's going to be a function called C R S is a series C S are actually sirra

65

00:04:05,400  -->  00:04:07,680
is our field.

66

00:04:07,680  -->  00:04:13,260
Now let's go back to our application let's refresh here.

67

00:04:13,650  -->  00:04:16,910
Let's reichlich inspect it.

68

00:04:17,940  -->  00:04:20,910
And let's look at it real quick.

69

00:04:21,470  -->  00:04:23,580
And as you can see has it talking right here.

70

00:04:23,610  -->  00:04:28,210
You see that.

71

00:04:28,980  -->  00:04:31,530
So we have this name talking there.

72

00:04:32,100  -->  00:04:35,030
Lara is going to detect that.

73

00:04:35,400  -->  00:04:42,060
And that's the C or S or C S R F All right function.

74

00:04:42,060  -->  00:04:42,350
All right.

75

00:04:42,340  -->  00:04:45,210
Anyway let's go back here.

76

00:04:45,570  -->  00:04:51,170
We have a problem here and that's where I was looking at in my input.

77

00:04:51,720  -->  00:04:53,140
OK.

78

00:04:53,640  -->  00:04:57,260
Let's go and fix this real quick.

79

00:04:57,360  -->  00:04:58,200
So type

80

00:05:01,280  -->  00:05:09,020
hitting Can you believe I don't see the problem here.

81

00:05:09,630  -->  00:05:11,070
I don't see it.

82

00:05:11,080  -->  00:05:19,050
I got two cords here and the name and then two cords right here

83

00:05:22,440  -->  00:05:28,920
and then value and I don't understand it when you are so tired you don't understand what's going on

84

00:05:28,920  -->  00:05:29,400
.

85

00:05:29,400  -->  00:05:31,690
Recreate this stuff.

86

00:05:31,980  -->  00:05:33,110
All right.

87

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:36,540
There we go.

88

00:05:36,540  -->  00:05:38,510
Just recreate it.

89

00:05:39,480  -->  00:05:43,530
If you don't see it just like it's happening to me and this is where you are calling for many hours

90

00:05:43,950  -->  00:05:47,320
name method.

91

00:05:48,630  -->  00:05:49,700
OK.

92

00:05:50,790  -->  00:05:56,550
I still don't see a guy says unbelievable how the problem could be right in front of us and we won't

93

00:05:56,550  -->  00:05:57,090
see it.

94

00:05:57,210  -->  00:05:57,500
All right.

95

00:05:57,510  -->  00:06:05,490
But anyway I'm not spending much time developing this as a matter of fact is not here a problem is here

96

00:06:05,490  -->  00:06:06,860
.

97

00:06:06,870  -->  00:06:08,300
Now I saw it.

98

00:06:09,000  -->  00:06:09,670
OK.

99

00:06:10,110  -->  00:06:11,060
There we go.

100

00:06:11,070  -->  00:06:16,510
So I was right here I was I didn't see it because the mistake was over here and this function was not

101

00:06:16,510  -->  00:06:18,600
even telling me nothing.

102

00:06:18,660  -->  00:06:21,410
I was not telling me that something was misspelled here.

103

00:06:21,480  -->  00:06:22,670
But anyway.

104

00:06:23,160  -->  00:06:26,520
All right so we have this now and now we can edit this.

105

00:06:26,640  -->  00:06:27,540
All right.

106

00:06:28,140  -->  00:06:32,870
So we're sending the I.D. to the update method.

107

00:06:33,720  -->  00:06:34,370
OK.

108

00:06:34,500  -->  00:06:37,860
And now we catch a here we catch him with a request of the form as well.

109

00:06:37,910  -->  00:06:38,680
Right.

110

00:06:38,820  -->  00:06:43,760
So we're going to have a lot of fun in the next lecture of dating this data in the database.

111

00:06:43,770  -->  00:06:45,900
Anyway thank you so much guys for watching.

112

00:06:45,900  -->  00:06:47,850
And I see you in the next lecture
