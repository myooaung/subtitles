00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:03.720
All right welcome back my students I hope you guys are having a lot of fun with Laro.

2

00:00:03.740  -->  00:00:08.110
Well I know all of you already are trying to do this on your own but that's OK.

3

00:00:08.490  -->  00:00:14.340
I'll suggest to actually continue with the course and finish it and then start on your own but you're

4

00:00:14.340  -->  00:00:15.360
welcome to explore.

5

00:00:15.360  -->  00:00:15.930
All right.

6

00:00:16.050  -->  00:00:19.610
So on the last lecture we create a couple of fields here.

7

00:00:19.630  -->  00:00:24.750
But on this lecture we're going to work on the select for a role or for status or I think we should

8

00:00:24.750  -->  00:00:26.670
tax status since it's easier.

9

00:00:26.820  -->  00:00:33.090
And then at the end we can actually attacked role because we got to we've got to pull information from

10

00:00:33.090  -->  00:00:33.960
the database.

11

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:40.170
One thing that I that I wanted to actually let you guys know is that every time we use the Form class

12

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:45.680
we are actually also creating an input field of type hidden as a talking.

13

00:00:45.690  -->  00:00:46.410
All right.

14

00:00:46.410  -->  00:00:53.070
Just remember that that if you're creating this as in a static version make sure that you have a function

15

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:56.080
to create that not talking.

16

00:00:56.100  -->  00:01:03.150
OK so if you go to a form you can see this hitting input here with a value of this long string in numbers

17

00:01:03.580  -->  00:01:04.630
or right type hit.

18

00:01:04.650  -->  00:01:05.300
All right.

19

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:11.670
So if we are creating this statically for some reason make sure that you own your form you have either

20

00:01:12.500  -->  00:01:18.640
C-s our field method or this is our talking in your input the value.

21

00:01:18.750  -->  00:01:22.530
All right if Now your phone would now work.

22

00:01:22.710  -->  00:01:24.390
Ok cool.

23

00:01:24.480  -->  00:01:26.840
So let's work on the status here.

24

00:01:26.850  -->  00:01:28.940
Let's make this first let.

25

00:01:29.320  -->  00:01:29.720
All right.

26

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:31.440
And there are a couple of ways of doing this.

27

00:01:31.440  -->  00:01:34.350
And you can find out more information if you have one.

28

00:01:34.650  -->  00:01:41.300
If you want more you want to dig deeper into this in the law of a Web site XTi a mail and forms are

29

00:01:41.310  -->  00:01:42.090
I.

30

00:01:42.690  -->  00:01:44.540
So the select we're not going to have a no.

31

00:01:44.550  -->  00:01:47.630
Here we could actually.

32

00:01:48.230  -->  00:01:53.340
Well we're going to have an array and this is how it works.

33

00:01:53.340  -->  00:01:54.260
All right.

34

00:01:55.140  -->  00:02:06.130
So this array is going to be status free and we're going to have a couple of inputs here.

35

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:12.040
First of all Actually I'm just going to do it and then explain and they explain it to you OK.

36

00:02:12.090  -->  00:02:20.190
So the key right here would be the value and the value here and this array would be what people see

37

00:02:20.190  -->  00:02:20.640
.

38

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:25.500
So people are going to see they're active right here.

39

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:36.680
You see that they were going to make another space for the net value and is going to be zero for now

40

00:02:36.690  -->  00:02:38.430
active.

41

00:02:38.610  -->  00:02:42.550
That's what the users are going to see.

42

00:02:42.570  -->  00:02:44.170
OK.

43

00:02:45.360  -->  00:02:49.250
So of course we don't need this here.

44

00:02:50.790  -->  00:02:55.410
Let's go and look at the forum real quick and let's see where we have

45

00:02:59.370  -->  00:03:01.150
gone awry.

46

00:03:01.530  -->  00:03:04.680
All right as you can see active not active.

47

00:03:04.800  -->  00:03:06.600
And if we expect it

48

00:03:11.790  -->  00:03:16.700
we can see that that value was one for active and the other one is zero here.

49

00:03:16.740  -->  00:03:19.150
We could set a default if we wanted to.

50

00:03:19.680  -->  00:03:22.400
And that's why there's no value is for.

51

00:03:22.410  -->  00:03:26.160
All right so you can say that before I got to 74 for an active.

52

00:03:26.250  -->  00:03:28.410
My putting has zero.

53

00:03:28.410  -->  00:03:29.780
All right.

54

00:03:30.820  -->  00:03:36.960
Antar as you can see that change to that and that's very useful guys very useful.

55

00:03:36.960  -->  00:03:38.190
All right.

56

00:03:38.340  -->  00:03:40.160
Because sometimes you want to use yours.

57

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:46.410
You know if they click on something to make sure that you know that this is set up to not active just

58

00:03:46.410  -->  00:03:51.100
in case you don't want the user to be you know active right away that the one you're creating.

59

00:03:51.240  -->  00:03:52.330
Ok cool.

60

00:03:52.410  -->  00:03:56.740
So I think we're done with this section that was pretty easy right.

61

00:03:56.760  -->  00:04:03.120
We're going to work on the next one which is the role ID or the role for the user will be pulling that

62

00:04:03.120  -->  00:04:07.620
information from the database is going to be a pretty exciting lecture and you can learn a whole bunch

63

00:04:07.630  -->  00:04:07.750
.

64

00:04:07.860  -->  00:04:09.830
Thank you so much for watching guys.

65

00:04:09.830  -->  00:04:11.600
So great for that you guys are here.

66

00:04:11.610  -->  00:04:12.730
Thank you for your support.

67

00:04:12.750  -->  00:04:14.490
I'll see you next
