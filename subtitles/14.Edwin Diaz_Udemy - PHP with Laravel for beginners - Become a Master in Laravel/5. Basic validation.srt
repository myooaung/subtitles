00:00:00,120  -->  00:00:01,400
Welcome back to this tour.

2

00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:07,650
So in the last couple lectures we have been creating forms and we have been also using packages to or

3

00:00:07,650  -->  00:00:12,730
package this class right here to create this functionality.

4

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:19,550
Right now we have not discussed very much in valuation.

5

00:00:19,560  -->  00:00:22,800
We have not touched that subject yet.

6

00:00:22,800  -->  00:00:24,240
And I told you we will do it.

7

00:00:24,240  -->  00:00:25,640
So let's go ahead and do that.

8

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:28,030
Let's find out how to validate.

9

00:00:28,050  -->  00:00:34,770
Right now we go to create and we insert it we actually leave a blank and we do create pools.

10

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:40,080
It will create a blank record in our database we don't want that right.

11

00:00:40,080  -->  00:00:42,540
So how do we value the way a lot of it.

12

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:45,530
Well there are a couple ways we can do this.

13

00:00:45,610  -->  00:00:46,200
All right.

14

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:55,680
First we create it we use a method called validate or we can make a request class or I would which we

15

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:57,970
can do with BHB artisan.

16

00:00:57,990  -->  00:00:58,770
All right.

17

00:00:58,770  -->  00:01:00,030
Which is really cool.

18

00:01:00,030  -->  00:01:00,990
All right.

19

00:01:00,990  -->  00:01:13,720
So let's go ahead and do this let's go and do where we create this valley the method is in the controller

20

00:01:13,720  -->  00:01:13,770
.

21

00:01:13,770  -->  00:01:19,620
So let's go to controller and right here in the create.

22

00:01:19,980  -->  00:01:20,390
Right.

23

00:01:20,400  -->  00:01:26,940
Actually not in the create in the store because this is where the information goes inside the database

24

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:27,630
right.

25

00:01:27,630  -->  00:01:31,410
This is where we define the little value the function.

26

00:01:31,410  -->  00:01:32,100
All right.

27

00:01:32,350  -->  00:01:34,940
So is part of this controller.

28

00:01:34,950  -->  00:01:41,100
So we're going to say this valley the Mantid that's where we find this.

29

00:01:41,100  -->  00:01:44,780
And of course with closing we pass a couple parameters.

30

00:01:44,800  -->  00:01:45,420
All right.

31

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:52,320
So the first parameter is going to be the requests which is this guy there.

32

00:01:52,350  -->  00:01:56,050
The second parameter is going to be an array.

33

00:01:56,550  -->  00:01:56,950
All right.

34

00:01:56,980  -->  00:02:06,630
And array of values keys and values so the key for this one here what we want to valy the right now

35

00:02:06,630  -->  00:02:07,310
is a title.

36

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:08,060
All right.

37

00:02:08,370  -->  00:02:10,380
So we want to make sure that I don't have something there.

38

00:02:10,380  -->  00:02:15,460
So we're going to say that title and we're going to say I want you to required

39

00:02:17,910  -->  00:02:19,890
this title.

40

00:02:20,020  -->  00:02:20,500
All right.

41

00:02:20,640  -->  00:02:22,110
If you want to pass another rule.

42

00:02:22,110  -->  00:02:26,950
These are called rules by the way you put a pipe.

43

00:02:26,980  -->  00:02:29,820
All right that's close to the backslash in your key word.

44

00:02:30,270  -->  00:02:39,510
And then you pass something like Max colon and then the value let's say Max 60 characters or something

45

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:40,310
like that.

46

00:02:40,660  -->  00:02:41,430
All right.

47

00:02:41,490  -->  00:02:45,170
And you can find out more in the larger bail Web site.

48

00:02:45,180  -->  00:02:50,370
And of course at the end of the section I will always give you a link if I don't make sure that you

49

00:02:50,370  -->  00:02:51,580
look for it.

50

00:02:51,580  -->  00:02:53,360
It's called validation rules.

51

00:02:53,460  -->  00:02:54,340
All right.

52

00:02:54,610  -->  00:02:58,950
Now where you can find more rules that you can set you can say unique and you can do a lot of things

53

00:02:58,950  -->  00:02:59,400
with rules.

54

00:02:59,400  -->  00:02:59,830
OK.

55

00:02:59,960  -->  00:03:02,010
We're you going to do it for required.

56

00:03:02,010  -->  00:03:03,790
We're going to do require just the title.

57

00:03:03,810  -->  00:03:04,420
OK.

58

00:03:04,610  -->  00:03:12,780
Well you can of course pass more keys and values and you can say content if you had a content in there

59

00:03:14,370  -->  00:03:21,030
and you can go here and you can say required and then you can keep going OK as many as you like.

60

00:03:21,030  -->  00:03:30,000
Now if you have a more complex form with a lot more fields I recommend using the requests.

61

00:03:30,050  -->  00:03:32,820
And we're going to check that the leader in the course.

62

00:03:32,820  -->  00:03:33,270
OK.

63

00:03:33,390  -->  00:03:36,970
Actually probably after this lecture but let me show you how this works.

64

00:03:37,020  -->  00:03:37,400
OK.

65

00:03:37,410  -->  00:03:42,810
So all right let's go here to create.

66

00:03:44,010  -->  00:03:45,490
And now let's try to do it.

67

00:03:45,930  -->  00:03:49,390
And now you can see that it refreshes and it doesn't go anywhere.

68

00:03:49,390  -->  00:03:49,850
All right.

69

00:03:49,860  -->  00:03:57,100
Now when you do this automatically there is a variable that is available call errors.

70

00:03:57,190  -->  00:03:59,570
It does very well is available.

71

00:03:59,620  -->  00:04:01,380
While the whole application.

72

00:04:01,380  -->  00:04:04,260
Any way you want to display any errors.

73

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:07,940
You will be able to access that very well in display.

74

00:04:07,980  -->  00:04:08,220
All right.

75

00:04:08,220  -->  00:04:11,820
Right now the variable has this error.

76

00:04:12,270  -->  00:04:17,310
OK in the next lecture I'll show you how to display it but right now is displaying an arrow has a value

77

00:04:17,320  -->  00:04:17,450
.

78

00:04:17,670  -->  00:04:18,950
But we've got to display it.

79

00:04:19,060  -->  00:04:19,920
All right.

80

00:04:19,920  -->  00:04:23,190
So this is how you value the forms using Claribel.

81

00:04:23,520  -->  00:04:25,010
And I'll see you in the next lecture.

82

00:04:25,020  -->  00:04:26,420
I hope you having a lot of fun guys.

83

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:26,820
Take care
