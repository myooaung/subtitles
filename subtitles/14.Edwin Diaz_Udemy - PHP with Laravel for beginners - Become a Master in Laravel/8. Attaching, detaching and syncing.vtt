00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:06.830
All right welcome back my students so it's time for us to start learning some other methods built in

2

00:00:06.830  -->  00:00:13.510
function ID from our avail that allows us to attach rules detachable sync.

3

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:20.490
I mean it's going to be a really really awesome lecture OK I'm going to try to try to do all three methods

4

00:00:20.490  -->  00:00:23.150
right now right here on this lecture.

5

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:25.410
So let's go and try to do them.

6

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:25.880
All right.

7

00:00:26.010  -->  00:00:37.290
So right now if we go to our our BHP miasmic our database right we only have two rules right altering

8

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:39.610
administrator and you can have more.

9

00:00:39.690  -->  00:00:40.340
OK.

10

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:45.420
Like I said before my data might change from yours but the lecturers are saying I am showing you how

11

00:00:45.420  -->  00:00:46.620
to do one thing.

12

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:52.040
So let's go and learn how the attachment rolls right out of the box.

13

00:00:52.380  -->  00:01:03.280
Right out of a method instead of doing all this create stuff right here we're just going attach it.

14

00:01:03.300  -->  00:01:03.890
Right.

15

00:01:04.140  -->  00:01:14.040
And I'll show you right now how this works but just know that this functionality will create the method

16

00:01:14.250  -->  00:01:16.020
at the same time.

17

00:01:16.020  -->  00:01:16.420
All right.

18

00:01:16.440  -->  00:01:19.550
We'll actually assign it to a user.

19

00:01:19.590  -->  00:01:23.610
So this is going to be a really cool lecture.

20

00:01:23.610  -->  00:01:24.150
All right.

21

00:01:24.300  -->  00:01:25.750
Because this are right here.

22

00:01:25.770  -->  00:01:26.440
All right.

23

00:01:26.760  -->  00:01:31.890
We are doing the same thing but we have to do all this and I mean it's one way of doing it.

24

00:01:32.070  -->  00:01:35.060
All right but watch this.

25

00:01:35.070  -->  00:01:35.960
So let's.

26

00:01:35.970  -->  00:01:41.280
First thing is we always have to find the model or the user or whatever

27

00:01:43.740  -->  00:01:45.390
relationship we're dealing with right.

28

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:47.500
Let's do or fail.

29

00:01:47.560  -->  00:01:52.700
It makes more sense to have some type of exception thrown if it doesn't work right.

30

00:01:53.010  -->  00:01:53.830
All right cool.

31

00:01:53.970  -->  00:01:55.400
So we find the user.

32

00:01:55.680  -->  00:02:00.760
And then all we have to do is look at this how simple it is user.

33

00:02:01.670  -->  00:02:07.550
All right roles and use attach method.

34

00:02:07.820  -->  00:02:12.300
And now just tell it which one do you want to attach.

35

00:02:12.300  -->  00:02:19.140
All right so I want to attach the one with the number two to this user.

36

00:02:19.170  -->  00:02:22.460
So the role has a number two.

37

00:02:22.470  -->  00:02:23.750
OK.

38

00:02:24.600  -->  00:02:24.890
All right.

39

00:02:24.890  -->  00:02:26.810
Watch this.

40

00:02:28.110  -->  00:02:30.520
Let's go to the browser.

41

00:02:31.960  -->  00:02:36.770
So Id actually know we need Rule Number six.

42

00:02:36.870  -->  00:02:46.470
So we go to all user right now we have a couple rules attached that we have to their user we have several

43

00:02:46.470  -->  00:02:48.180
IDs seven rules right here.

44

00:02:48.270  -->  00:02:49.350
OK.

45

00:02:49.350  -->  00:02:54.000
So we should have eight when we come back and we should have just eight.

46

00:02:54.000  -->  00:02:54.360
All right.

47

00:02:54.360  -->  00:03:00.440
Let us make sure that we attach number sits to it.

48

00:03:02.080  -->  00:03:02.640
All right.

49

00:03:02.830  -->  00:03:06.840
And that was Arthur.

50

00:03:06.990  -->  00:03:07.540
OK.

51

00:03:07.860  -->  00:03:08.730
That's going to be all right.

52

00:03:08.730  -->  00:03:11.870
Cool let's go and do this now.

53

00:03:12.640  -->  00:03:14.140
CH.

54

00:03:14.610  -->  00:03:15.870
And we get no errors.

55

00:03:15.870  -->  00:03:17.170
That's a good sign.

56

00:03:17.300  -->  00:03:25.720
Let's come back here to roll user I eurozone and we have on the record you see that and we have roll

57

00:03:25.720  -->  00:03:30.600
number sets attached to user number one with ID number one.

58

00:03:30.810  -->  00:03:31.390
So there.

59

00:03:31.620  -->  00:03:38.360
That's beautiful but if you keep doing this enter again and refresh you're going to attach the same

60

00:03:38.360  -->  00:03:40.400
rule again right here.

61

00:03:40.920  -->  00:03:42.450
OK.

62

00:03:42.450  -->  00:03:44.850
So that's that's one of the downfalls of that.

63

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:45.670
All right.

64

00:03:45.670  -->  00:03:47.840
You can also the tace.

65

00:03:48.510  -->  00:03:52.110
All right so let's use copy all this because it makes no sense to write it.

66

00:03:52.110  -->  00:03:53.850
We already know how to do it right.

67

00:03:54.480  -->  00:03:56.080
Unless you want to keep practicing.

68

00:03:56.460  -->  00:04:02.800
So we detach we find the the user and we detach.

69

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:09.700
So we say the here with attached data record or Dayrell from each user.

70

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:14.260
So this too will be gone.

71

00:04:14.260  -->  00:04:19.690
All right let's do this detach.

72

00:04:20.280  -->  00:04:26.910
Enter refresh and as you can see those rules are gone from the user.

73

00:04:26.910  -->  00:04:27.520
All right.

74

00:04:27.520  -->  00:04:29.650
Yukking also the Tadg.

75

00:04:29.730  -->  00:04:35.070
I believe if you don't pass any parameters you can take all of them off.

76

00:04:35.130  -->  00:04:41.960
All right enter you come back here and all the rules from the users are gone.

77

00:04:41.960  -->  00:04:43.450
All right.

78

00:04:43.670  -->  00:04:47.090
So you might want to put a come in here and what its function does.

79

00:04:47.100  -->  00:04:48.070
Exactly.

80

00:04:48.090  -->  00:04:51.140
So he attaches a role to a user right.

81

00:04:51.450  -->  00:04:54.850
And you know if in the same way the tap.

82

00:04:54.860  -->  00:05:03.020
Well actually this is the detach one so they attach attach as a rule to a user if it if it's not attached

83

00:05:03.080  -->  00:05:06.150
it will actually create the attachment.

84

00:05:06.240  -->  00:05:08.430
Azer as another record in the database.

85

00:05:08.450  -->  00:05:14.220
So you've got to be careful with that because it would not just attach it of data it will it will create

86

00:05:14.210  -->  00:05:15.440
another record.

87

00:05:15.610  -->  00:05:17.430
All right even if he already has it.

88

00:05:17.900  -->  00:05:20.380
So make sure that you put that in your comments.

89

00:05:20.390  -->  00:05:26.880
Now this detach will detach whatever ID you give it of the role or whatever relationship you have right

90

00:05:26.880  -->  00:05:30.730
here or if you take it off it will detach everything.

91

00:05:30.750  -->  00:05:34.540
All right so make sure you have that they are the one that we're going to do on this lecture here and

92

00:05:34.550  -->  00:05:37.650
I think we have some time.

93

00:05:37.660  -->  00:05:40.560
It's sync.

94

00:05:40.560  -->  00:05:41.310
All right.

95

00:05:41.570  -->  00:05:45.480
So I'll explain to you in a minute what this one do would do.

96

00:05:45.750  -->  00:05:51.410
But let shows Bill the route for it.

97

00:05:51.410  -->  00:05:53.650
All right cool.

98

00:05:53.660  -->  00:05:54.840
All right.

99

00:05:55.310  -->  00:05:57.200
So again we find the user

100

00:06:01.190  -->  00:06:07.210
we we are so used to doing this right guys so simple now.

101

00:06:08.940  -->  00:06:09.320
All right.

102

00:06:09.360  -->  00:06:17.110
So we find the user and we say hey listen I want to actually we don't have no rules now.

103

00:06:17.630  -->  00:06:21.160
So are we is better that we create a rule for this.

104

00:06:21.180  -->  00:06:21.580
All right.

105

00:06:21.620  -->  00:06:24.920
BHP mad men where is these rules.

106

00:06:25.190  -->  00:06:26.740
Well actually we do have some rules.

107

00:06:26.810  -->  00:06:27.790
I'm sorry.

108

00:06:28.010  -->  00:06:30.940
Well we were detaching the rules from the user.

109

00:06:31.070  -->  00:06:34.330
It will come up empty it out from the roll user table.

110

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:37.060
Now from the rules it would not delete the rules.

111

00:06:37.060  -->  00:06:39.930
It would just detach you take it off from the roll user.

112

00:06:39.930  -->  00:06:40.860
All right.

113

00:06:40.860  -->  00:06:41.960
I just want to make that clear.

114

00:06:41.990  -->  00:06:44.820
But let's go to sinking.

115

00:06:45.020  -->  00:06:52.720
So what sinkings going to do is we're going to give it an idea let's just write the first we're going

116

00:06:52.740  -->  00:06:57.160
to give you an idea or in many an array of ideas.

117

00:06:57.200  -->  00:07:04.060
So he's going to sink whatever ideas we give it to this specific user and if it doesn't exist.

118

00:07:04.250  -->  00:07:08.250
If he's not here in this array let's just create an array.

119

00:07:09.290  -->  00:07:14.260
If it's not here in this array it will delete the rest.

120

00:07:14.700  -->  00:07:15.220
OK.

121

00:07:15.360  -->  00:07:24.020
So for example if I go to rules right now and we want to sync alter way of the user.

122

00:07:24.410  -->  00:07:35.020
Watch what happens if let's say let's go to use a real quick roll user less insert a roll into the user

123

00:07:35.030  -->  00:07:35.360
right.

124

00:07:35.450  -->  00:07:41.120
Right away you know I'll show you I think it's number seven.

125

00:07:41.120  -->  00:07:41.780
All right.

126

00:07:41.950  -->  00:07:50.220
Let's touch a real quick insert some information here so that we they use as a rule.

127

00:07:51.160  -->  00:07:51.710
OK.

128

00:07:51.850  -->  00:07:55.520
He has a rule with the number 7 that's administrator.

129

00:07:55.520  -->  00:08:04.340
So for example if I want to sync number sets it already has number 7 but watch what happens if I say

130

00:08:04.350  -->  00:08:05.480
you know what I want to sing.

131

00:08:05.490  -->  00:08:09.680
And when you pass out of one value you don't have to create an array for it.

132

00:08:09.810  -->  00:08:10.450
All right.

133

00:08:10.790  -->  00:08:15.410
So let's make sure we have a coma here.

134

00:08:15.440  -->  00:08:17.590
You will understand that once it does it guys.

135

00:08:18.060  -->  00:08:23.490
But I want you to be very clear on what the sync would do.

136

00:08:23.490  -->  00:08:29.360
Then we say sync oops actually it must be a type of a race.

137

00:08:29.370  -->  00:08:31.750
Guys it must be an array.

138

00:08:32.360  -->  00:08:36.000
All right so that you can pass one value without consequences.

139

00:08:36.000  -->  00:08:37.100
But I was wrong.

140

00:08:37.350  -->  00:08:38.510
Maybe they changed it.

141

00:08:38.660  -->  00:08:41.440
Sync refresh.

142

00:08:41.660  -->  00:08:47.110
Well right here RHO user as you can see it took the other.

143

00:08:47.250  -->  00:08:48.780
All right.

144

00:08:49.880  -->  00:08:54.550
It took the other roll from there.

145

00:08:54.890  -->  00:09:01.860
So now it gave us a roll of one but we don't have the rules so we need to go in and do the rules sit

146

00:09:01.880  -->  00:09:03.890
again here.

147

00:09:03.890  -->  00:09:05.150
Let's do it.

148

00:09:05.310  -->  00:09:15.720
And for now she can see it related that rule number sets to their user ID number one but he deleted

149

00:09:15.720  -->  00:09:24.010
all the ones so now if you attached to them two rolls six and seven we pass it in as a barometer.

150

00:09:24.240  -->  00:09:25.190
And then we come here

151

00:09:27.890  -->  00:09:31.970
enter and refresh as you can see it attach.

152

00:09:32.000  -->  00:09:33.560
Well I think the other one.

153

00:09:33.710  -->  00:09:43.410
So if you don't pass the roll like here whatever rules you have the database will delete.

154

00:09:43.430  -->  00:09:49.850
So make sure that whatever rules you want they are here in this Arev not lose that attachment.

155

00:09:49.890  -->  00:09:52.060
All right that relationship.

156

00:09:52.250  -->  00:09:55.810
But anyway I think it's enough for today with this method.

157

00:09:55.880  -->  00:10:03.480
Anything else would be fun or Clarabelle Larrabee has tons of other methods and functionality that will

158

00:10:03.990  -->  00:10:05.960
help you when you are creating an application.

159

00:10:05.960  -->  00:10:07.580
Make things a lot easier for you.

160

00:10:07.830  -->  00:10:12.140
Thank you so much for watching guys and I hope you learn a lot from this lecture.

161

00:10:12.140  -->  00:10:18.870
All right we did a pretty pretty cool stuff from these lectures attaching detaching sinking those from

162

00:10:18.880  -->  00:10:21.530
challengers are going to help you build really complications.

163

00:10:21.530  -->  00:10:24.210
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
