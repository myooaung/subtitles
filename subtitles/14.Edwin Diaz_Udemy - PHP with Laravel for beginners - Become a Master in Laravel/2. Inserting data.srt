1

00:00:00,110  -->  00:00:02,020
They're all right welcome back and by the students.

2

00:00:02,040  -->  00:00:05,900
It's time for us to start learning how to run queries in our application.

3

00:00:05,900  -->  00:00:09,110
We are going jumping into the database which is really cool.

4

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:15,150
There are a couple ways of inserting reading and doing the crawl basically which is create a read up

5

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:23,630
day in the lead or destroy in BHB that's what it means right for my school or any other application

6

00:00:23,640  -->  00:00:24,130
right.

7

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:29,790
So it's time for us to learn how to do is there are a couple ways of doing this in allowable we have

8

00:00:29,790  -->  00:00:34,410
things called Rauh square Aquarius which is the first thing that we are going to be learning because

9

00:00:34,410  -->  00:00:37,080
I want you to learn the hard way of doing things.

10

00:00:37,080  -->  00:00:44,000
There is another way of using the model which is the class that takes care of the database interaction

11

00:00:44,000  -->  00:00:44,190
.

12

00:00:44,280  -->  00:00:45,280
Right.

13

00:00:45,450  -->  00:00:52,740
And there's another way of doing that model has different methods like say Oh they'd destroy or I mean

14

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:57,080
the lead in a has different methods that we can use right right out of the bots.

15

00:00:57,090  -->  00:00:57,570
Right.

16

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:03,990
But we also have something called the eloquent model that we can also use to do differing database interaction

17

00:01:03,990  -->  00:01:09,000
which is really cool you're going to see a lot of this and we're going to be doing a lot of queries

18

00:01:09,030  -->  00:01:11,420
to our application is going to be pretty cool right.

19

00:01:11,490  -->  00:01:15,540
I hope that you are really excited because I am all right this is really cool stuff.

20

00:01:15,750  -->  00:01:18,030
But anyway so I want you to learn the hard way.

21

00:01:18,030  -->  00:01:23,040
Like I said before because I want you to be ready for anything and I like to show you as much as I can

22

00:01:23,060  -->  00:01:23,190
.

23

00:01:23,310  -->  00:01:24,180
All right.

24

00:01:24,390  -->  00:01:29,370
So we're going to pack this course with a lot of information that way you know where you are when you're

25

00:01:29,370  -->  00:01:30,420
building an application.

26

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:31,950
You can always find your way around.

27

00:01:31,950  -->  00:01:37,200
If you get in trouble so I'm going to come in this hour I mean routes by the way routes that BHB and

28

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:38,990
you should know how to get there by now.

29

00:01:39,150  -->  00:01:43,020
If not if you are in BHB store I'm using a Mac shift shift.

30

00:01:43,020  -->  00:01:49,320
Then you can type in your abbreviation to get here your name of that class.

31

00:01:49,320  -->  00:01:53,430
So I'm going to comment that our roads are going to come in this hour and we're going to create a road

32

00:01:53,430  -->  00:01:59,250
related to what we are doing and what we're going to be doing is inserting some data into our polls

33

00:01:59,280  -->  00:02:00,770
table that we created.

34

00:02:00,880  -->  00:02:02,670
I remember the migrations.

35

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:03,210
All right.

36

00:02:03,450  -->  00:02:12,450
So now I'm going I want to create a little comment there and BHP story has shortcuts for comments if

37

00:02:12,450  -->  00:02:16,260
you want to learn how to use is in the PH B-story Web site.

38

00:02:16,380  -->  00:02:22,050
And by the way if you're wondering if they pay me money to actually mention their grade ID they're not

39

00:02:22,110  -->  00:02:23,380
actually pay me any money.

40

00:02:23,380  -->  00:02:25,260
I just like their idea or recommend it.

41

00:02:25,260  -->  00:02:26,170
All right guys.

42

00:02:26,310  -->  00:02:29,560
You can find the link in my web site.

43

00:02:29,660  -->  00:02:30,870
And when does that come.

44

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:31,610
It's pretty cool.

45

00:02:31,650  -->  00:02:36,880
But anyway you can also look it up online guys BHB storm.

46

00:02:36,960  -->  00:02:44,820
You know let's go and create a route a get request.

47

00:02:44,830  -->  00:02:47,320
I remember that's just what his function does.

48

00:02:47,520  -->  00:02:51,450
And let's say when people click insert.

49

00:02:51,460  -->  00:02:54,540
Of course we're not going to do this for real in a production environment.

50

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:57,980
This is just an example right guys for you to learn.

51

00:02:58,260  -->  00:03:03,410
So we're going to create a closure function here so that way when we visit this you are out here these

52

00:03:03,450  -->  00:03:06,370
insert we execute some type of code.

53

00:03:06,390  -->  00:03:07,490
Right.

54

00:03:07,500  -->  00:03:14,640
So what we're going to be doing is using a method a static method from the DB class or Faqih as they

55

00:03:14,640  -->  00:03:16,440
call it.

56

00:03:16,870  -->  00:03:23,760
Then you can look it up right on line is F A C A D E array for.

57

00:03:24,370  -->  00:03:26,230
C.A.T..

58

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:34,860
So let's use the insert static method and if you don't know what a static method is please take my ph

59

00:03:34,860  -->  00:03:44,490
B P class which is a basic for B of Jerry into programming for BHP because you will now understand is

60

00:03:44,550  -->  00:03:50,340
if you have not taken of Jerry into programming class you don't have to specifically specifically take

61

00:03:50,340  -->  00:03:55,560
mine but I'm hoping that you like me by now and you take my classes but if not you can take any other

62

00:03:55,560  -->  00:03:58,050
classes it's OK.

63

00:03:58,410  -->  00:04:03,490
So what we going to be doing is we're going to say insert this like a normal Querrey.

64

00:04:03,510  -->  00:04:06,590
All right we're going to be running wrote querist and this is what it is.

65

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:13,720
Insert into pools and we're going to say we're going to put a couple of values in.

66

00:04:13,740  -->  00:04:15,950
If you remember we have the title I believe.

67

00:04:15,950  -->  00:04:16,610
Right.

68

00:04:17,130  -->  00:04:29,770
So let's just open it up and we say I want you to insert that title and I believe this content.

69

00:04:30,840  -->  00:04:31,750
And what else.

70

00:04:31,890  -->  00:04:35,570
And now values would be.

71

00:04:36,600  -->  00:04:39,690
And if I leave it like that that's OK.

72

00:04:39,750  -->  00:04:48,230
So the values would be and this is like this because this is PDL remember that we need to put the placeholder

73

00:04:48,420  -->  00:04:49,770
question marks.

74

00:04:49,800  -->  00:04:53,120
We can also use we can also use a placeholders.

75

00:04:53,730  -->  00:04:55,340
The did the colon.

76

00:04:55,380  -->  00:05:01,550
OK so I'm going to be using this question marks.

77

00:05:01,590  -->  00:05:08,810
So once we have this then we can run the second parameter here and put an array.

78

00:05:09,310  -->  00:05:10,120
OK.

79

00:05:10,140  -->  00:05:12,540
And this is where we put the values.

80

00:05:12,540  -->  00:05:20,550
So the value for the first one would be BHB Claribel something like this.

81

00:05:20,880  -->  00:05:21,920
Right.

82

00:05:22,050  -->  00:05:28,550
Then the second That's the first parameter second parameter would be the content ph B.

83

00:05:28,630  -->  00:05:31,980
Clarabelle is the best thing

84

00:05:36,060  -->  00:05:37,080
that has happened

85

00:05:40,380  -->  00:05:45,770
to PGE her Hey cool if I got it correctly.

86

00:05:46,000  -->  00:05:50,250
Sounds about right is actually correct and he says Aley you don't spend Larabee like that.

87

00:05:50,250  -->  00:05:51,350
Look at that.

88

00:05:51,700  -->  00:05:52,440
All right.

89

00:05:52,530  -->  00:05:53,720
Happened.

90

00:05:54,210  -->  00:05:57,670
He has even the grammar.

91

00:05:57,690  -->  00:05:58,450
All right.

92

00:05:58,490  -->  00:06:00,870
Decide these gray I tell you I love you guys.

93

00:06:00,930  -->  00:06:02,540
So this looks about right.

94

00:06:02,550  -->  00:06:04,420
Insert into pulls.

95

00:06:04,470  -->  00:06:08,490
We have the values here.

96

00:06:08,490  -->  00:06:11,760
This has to be close right here.

97

00:06:12,450  -->  00:06:12,810
OK.

98

00:06:12,810  -->  00:06:15,130
So we need a parentheses there.

99

00:06:15,140  -->  00:06:16,630
There we go.

100

00:06:17,530  -->  00:06:18,050
OK.

101

00:06:18,060  -->  00:06:24,780
Title values Dand here is making sure we got to correct the guys.

102

00:06:25,260  -->  00:06:27,000
Yeah this sounds about right.

103

00:06:27,000  -->  00:06:28,530
This looks about right.

104

00:06:29,130  -->  00:06:30,020
OK.

105

00:06:30,030  -->  00:06:31,880
I think I'm forgetting something but that's OK.

106

00:06:32,070  -->  00:06:37,550
So once we run this we can just run that query Now let's try it let's go and I'm forgetting something

107

00:06:37,560  -->  00:06:47,320
hopefully this would give us the exception so that way we know insert and then enter that we go where

108

00:06:47,340  -->  00:06:52,160
we assuption now found see a mess both those exist.

109

00:06:52,380  -->  00:06:52,770
All right.

110

00:06:52,770  -->  00:06:57,360
So for some reason it did not find it enough find the table.

111

00:06:57,390  -->  00:07:01,050
All right of course that's OK.

112

00:07:02,520  -->  00:07:05,920
The base table view now found.

113

00:07:06,200  -->  00:07:08,700
All right let's see if we're spending the table correctly.

114

00:07:08,700  -->  00:07:15,930
Let's click here and Lara Stone has this really cool stuff where if you see if you see like you have

115

00:07:15,930  -->  00:07:22,170
a problem like a highlighter statement and you use put your mouse over it.

116

00:07:22,230  -->  00:07:28,160
Wait for this libel click it and you can choose from different options here.

117

00:07:28,500  -->  00:07:31,660
I'm going to choose to import this class.

118

00:07:31,830  -->  00:07:34,110
Now let's run this again.

119

00:07:34,890  -->  00:07:37,040
Enter as to how the problem is.

120

00:07:37,040  -->  00:07:39,160
It wasn't that that was OK.

121

00:07:39,180  -->  00:07:41,450
So he's saying that he can't find the table.

122

00:07:41,510  -->  00:07:42,070
All right.

123

00:07:42,180  -->  00:07:48,240
So that's because probably we don't have the table so let's go to BHB Miami and check that out real

124

00:07:48,240  -->  00:07:48,770
quick.

125

00:07:48,800  -->  00:07:52,030
I want you to go there real quick before I even get there.

126

00:07:52,080  -->  00:07:53,500
And let's check it out.

127

00:07:54,060  -->  00:07:55,470
Probably we need to run

128

00:07:59,050  -->  00:08:01,010
migrate or something like that.

129

00:08:01,650  -->  00:08:07,170
Let's just go to law Bill see a mass as you can see.

130

00:08:07,260  -->  00:08:10,000
We need to roll migration.

131

00:08:10,050  -->  00:08:11,840
All right cool.

132

00:08:11,910  -->  00:08:22,970
So let's go to our terminal right here and let's just say BHP Ortiz and agree.

133

00:08:23,550  -->  00:08:24,960
Well there we go.

134

00:08:25,020  -->  00:08:28,350
Now let's take the poor out.

135

00:08:28,350  -->  00:08:29,950
I think it would work without it.

136

00:08:30,120  -->  00:08:36,440
Let's just take this out leave it like this and let's go and do it again anther.

137

00:08:36,970  -->  00:08:38,240
OK looks like it worked.

138

00:08:38,250  -->  00:08:39,760
Let's go back to that.

139

00:08:39,770  -->  00:08:41,730
Here we have the polls.

140

00:08:41,790  -->  00:08:43,910
We click on it and we have some information.

141

00:08:43,910  -->  00:08:45,370
Look at this.

142

00:08:45,510  -->  00:08:52,020
All right of course winning with the not created the time or the updated that we could if we wanted

143

00:08:52,020  -->  00:08:52,380
to.

144

00:08:52,380  -->  00:08:52,770
All right.

145

00:08:52,770  -->  00:08:56,440
You can put a time function in there and you have the time.
