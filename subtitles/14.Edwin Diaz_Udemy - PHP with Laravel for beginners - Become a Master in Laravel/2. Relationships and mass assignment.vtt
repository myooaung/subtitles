00:00:00.210  -->  00:00:05.260
All right welcome back my students so it's time for us to start setting up the relationship right.

2

00:00:05.310  -->  00:00:08.920
So let's go to the motto here and nature of this model here.

3

00:00:08.970  -->  00:00:15.480
For example if I want to remember that tag is going to be the the table that we are going to be using

4

00:00:16.380  -->  00:00:22.770
to share where we're going to share the tax between pools and videos.

5

00:00:22.770  -->  00:00:23.410
All right.

6

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:29.400
And we're going to do this relationship in tangible or in this model so that we're going to we've got

7

00:00:29.400  -->  00:00:37.400
to give it that name later that as a parameter in lowercase But anyway so here on each of this you should

8

00:00:37.400  -->  00:00:40.170
find the tax method.

9

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:40.820
All right.

10

00:00:40.980  -->  00:00:46.860
So we're going to say Public Function tags.

11

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:49.450
This is the polic method called tags.

12

00:00:49.510  -->  00:00:53.290
We can call it whatever we want with that's that's what it makes sense right.

13

00:00:53.490  -->  00:00:59.200
And we're going to return more with buy one more with too many actually.

14

00:01:00.150  -->  00:01:00.560
All right.

15

00:01:00.570  -->  00:01:00.870
We're going to.

16

00:01:00.870  -->  00:01:01.770
More too many.

17

00:01:01.910  -->  00:01:02.670
Wow.

18

00:01:03.080  -->  00:01:05.020
That tag right.

19

00:01:05.490  -->  00:01:12.410
All right in day here that's where we've passed in that name of that model Tiger wall.

20

00:01:12.480  -->  00:01:15.680
All right that's where you come from.

21

00:01:15.720  -->  00:01:17.600
All right cool.

22

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:21.330
So now if you want to act for your

23

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:29.530
videos you come here and you do the same thing as well.

24

00:01:30.060  -->  00:01:31.560
All right.

25

00:01:31.770  -->  00:01:32.190
Beautiful.

26

00:01:32.190  -->  00:01:35.590
And then make sure that you have your math assignment.

27

00:01:35.700  -->  00:01:37.730
If you're going to create data as well.

28

00:01:37.860  -->  00:01:38.720
OK.

29

00:01:38.850  -->  00:01:44.040
So if you're going to create tags make sure that you have your protected

30

00:01:48.330  -->  00:01:54.770
and I do this for all of them actually because I have they all have the same thing name.

31

00:01:54.830  -->  00:01:56.180
That's the only thing you can modify.

32

00:01:56.180  -->  00:02:02.250
Well you can modify the dress but Lauber does that updated they created of data for us so we don't need

33

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:05.280
that just in case we want to do that.

34

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:09.750
And we want to do this right.

35

00:02:09.950  -->  00:02:10.780
Cool.

36

00:02:11.250  -->  00:02:11.770
All right.

37

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:16.830
So we set up the relationship and I think we're good for now.

38

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:22.530
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
