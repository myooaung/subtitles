1

00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:02,060
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:02,060  -->  00:00:08,340
It's time for us to start pulling out do Orner all of our polymorphically relation.

3

00:00:08,340  -->  00:00:11,810
So what is the owner of this.

4

00:00:11,930  -->  00:00:13,340
Whatever tag we want.

5

00:00:13,470  -->  00:00:16,860
Well the owner of that could be a POSSO could be a video in this case right.

6

00:00:16,860  -->  00:00:20,510
So let's come in this hour real quick and let's find out how we do that.

7

00:00:20,570  -->  00:00:22,270
All right.

8

00:00:22,410  -->  00:00:23,310
All right.

9

00:00:23,760  -->  00:00:28,510
Let's create a roll real quick and you can create Israel however you want right.

10

00:00:29,520  -->  00:00:34,660
Right now we're not putting much importance on it because we're not building an application right.

11

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:42,510
Well let's say we want the tag for polls for the polls.

12

00:00:42,510  -->  00:00:49,550
Usually I will have tag and maybe a the name of the post or something here.

13

00:00:49,710  -->  00:00:50,380
OK.

14

00:00:50,760  -->  00:00:53,490
But anyway we're now building an application.

15

00:00:53,490  -->  00:00:56,060
Yes are we not going to bother with that.

16

00:00:56,770  -->  00:00:58,610
So let's go here.

17

00:00:58,620  -->  00:01:01,860
And for us we're going to find the tag.

18

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:03,680
So let's find tag number one.

19

00:01:03,670  -->  00:01:06,440
I believe that was P-H being Ark. in my case.

20

00:01:06,790  -->  00:01:08,950
Whoops.

21

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,890
Let's put it a little.

22

00:01:13,270  -->  00:01:16,910
Let's go do it for each so we can loop through the method.

23

00:01:16,920  -->  00:01:21,230
Or in this case that namak property remember that Laro is doing that for us.

24

00:01:21,230  -->  00:01:21,720
OK.

25

00:01:21,810  -->  00:01:32,300
So we will say tag pose as post and all we got to do here is say let's pull out.

26

00:01:32,340  -->  00:01:36,320
Let's see the title without pause.

27

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:38,390
That's pretty cool right.

28

00:01:38,400  -->  00:01:42,580
Let's make sure we import this tag on top.

29

00:01:42,720  -->  00:01:47,970
I remember that that's going to add the namespace all the way on top of this file.

30

00:01:48,010  -->  00:01:48,350
All right.

31

00:01:48,350  -->  00:01:52,980
And then you show you he's even highlighted because we are using those and the ones that are great ours

32

00:01:53,010  -->  00:02:00,210
because BHP star knows that we now use in those so he graze it out for us.

33

00:02:00,210  -->  00:02:02,850
All right cool.

34

00:02:02,940  -->  00:02:12,310
So let's go back here and this time we just say tag puls answer.

35

00:02:12,990  -->  00:02:17,190
And we're not getting any response from here that's because

36

00:02:23,880  -->  00:02:28,120
let's check it out real quick please

37

00:02:31,730  -->  00:02:38,610
.

38

00:02:42,700  -->  00:02:44,350
That is the tag.

39

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:51,900
Let's go to the tag motto that we forget to put the pools in gear no there.

40

00:02:55,020  -->  00:02:55,740
And

41

00:03:01,960  -->  00:03:03,270
here

42

00:03:08,170  -->  00:03:09,860
we are forgetting something here guys

43

00:03:16,890  -->  00:03:19,770
let's go back to route and let's inspect it a little bit.

44

00:03:19,860  -->  00:03:21,750
OK.

45

00:03:21,750  -->  00:03:29,320
All right so here this is trying to find the tag number one which is BHB we know that.

46

00:03:29,460  -->  00:03:41,070
And here we are trying to pool that tag the Poles for each call and Echo would do the senting as returning

47

00:03:41,120  -->  00:03:41,920
.

48

00:03:42,430  -->  00:03:54,890
Or I mean almost ascending with one value so it's not that it's just not doing anything there.

49

00:03:56,040  -->  00:03:59,630
Let's return let's see if we get some type of object here.

50

00:03:59,760  -->  00:04:04,530
All you know why we work where it can be that pulls those and half.

51

00:04:04,950  -->  00:04:08,790
Let's just return the object to see if we at least get that.

52

00:04:09,680  -->  00:04:15,920
Let's get the poles returned and see what we get.

53

00:04:16,890  -->  00:04:17,180
OK.

54

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:23,910
We don't we're not even getting that so we're not getting anything.

55

00:04:25,880  -->  00:04:28,930
Tag.

56

00:04:31,340  -->  00:04:32,820
That's we're.

57

00:04:33,600  -->  00:04:35,070
Let's find out.

58

00:04:35,080  -->  00:04:43,010
We get these return we'll get this object here.

59

00:04:43,250  -->  00:04:44,890
All right.

60

00:04:46,030  -->  00:04:48,060
All right we always get the tag.

61

00:04:48,380  -->  00:04:48,840
OK.

62

00:04:48,910  -->  00:05:00,270
Taghavi we get that but for some reason it's not giving us the pose that answer we're not getting that

63

00:05:01,320  -->  00:05:01,610
.

64

00:05:03,210  -->  00:05:07,210
Some reason so let's go back to the tag model.

65

00:05:07,350  -->  00:05:09,030
Let's inspect a little bit.

66

00:05:09,030  -->  00:05:16,550
So this is more of by many more by many we're good here is for the Poles tag of all for the video tag

67

00:05:16,550  -->  00:05:17,990
of war.

68

00:05:18,650  -->  00:05:19,130
All right.

69

00:05:19,140  -->  00:05:20,910
I don't see anything wrong here.

70

00:05:20,910  -->  00:05:23,160
They are both returning data.

71

00:05:23,160  -->  00:05:25,080
So we are good on that.

72

00:05:26,670  -->  00:05:27,480
And

73

00:05:37,130  -->  00:05:40,240
we should be getting something.

74

00:05:41,790  -->  00:05:48,930
Let's go and check those taxes see that leaves the tax have the same ID ID number one and the number

75

00:05:48,930  -->  00:05:51,030
two.

76

00:05:52,340  -->  00:05:59,340
So we are guys this is the type of stuff that you are going to encounter when you're doing this stuff

77

00:05:59,340  -->  00:06:00,110
.

78

00:06:00,240  -->  00:06:05,980
So we Taggert Y.D. or you know what.

79

00:06:06,520  -->  00:06:10,260
It's now one is too.

80

00:06:11,070  -->  00:06:14,070
That's why we can't find it.

81

00:06:14,100  -->  00:06:15,150
There we go.

82

00:06:15,160  -->  00:06:17,550
Mangalam that I left his video guys.

83

00:06:17,970  -->  00:06:18,650
All right.

84

00:06:18,870  -->  00:06:22,780
Because we're never going to find it like that with the wrong ID.

85

00:06:22,780  -->  00:06:24,480
And there we go.

86

00:06:25,320  -->  00:06:27,390
OK.

87

00:06:27,630  -->  00:06:30,210
That's why we couldn't find it.

88

00:06:30,270  -->  00:06:31,140
He had a differing I.D..

89

00:06:31,140  -->  00:06:33,950
Now this was the tag ID number one.

90

00:06:34,000  -->  00:06:36,850
We will be able to find out polls.

91

00:06:36,870  -->  00:06:37,450
All right.

92

00:06:37,470  -->  00:06:43,500
I mean that tag would go awry.

93

00:06:44,070  -->  00:06:47,630
ID number one but was number one was number two.

94

00:06:48,270  -->  00:06:48,990
OK.

95

00:06:49,260  -->  00:06:50,430
So that's why we couldn't find it.

96

00:06:50,440  -->  00:06:59,790
I was just so weird for a minute there but you see one little mistake it cost you not to not to get

97

00:06:59,790  -->  00:07:04,780
the stuff working so make sure that you have all that data in the right place.

98

00:07:05,070  -->  00:07:08,910
So post title as well post title real quick and then we get to see this.

99

00:07:08,910  -->  00:07:12,580
Now as you can see it's javascript pools one.

100

00:07:12,630  -->  00:07:13,570
All right.

101

00:07:14,130  -->  00:07:14,690
Beautiful.

102

00:07:14,700  -->  00:07:15,950
So we got it to work.

103

00:07:15,960  -->  00:07:16,610
No biggie.

104

00:07:16,660  -->  00:07:22,020
So thank you so much for watching guys and keep active kid motivated you doing something really good

105

00:07:22,020  -->  00:07:24,000
for your career and your life.

106

00:07:24,000  -->  00:07:28,730
And you know eating a few frustrated keep practicing you've got to get it.

107

00:07:28,730  -->  00:07:29,590
Don't worry.

108

00:07:29,610  -->  00:07:33,400
This is going to happen but you need to practice practice and practice OK.

109

00:07:33,530  -->  00:07:38,190
Remember that we also going to have a Facebook for this cause we sure already have a Facebook.

110

00:07:38,370  -->  00:07:40,590
So make sure that you sign up if you have any issues.

111

00:07:40,590  -->  00:07:47,490
It's sometimes faster to do to go to Facebook because there are a lot more people sometimes that can

112

00:07:47,490  -->  00:07:48,100
help you.

113

00:07:48,300  -->  00:07:49,750
And they are always checking their phone.

114

00:07:49,750  -->  00:07:54,420
So but if you don't like facebook don't worry we've got that discussion on the course and we can help

115

00:07:54,420  -->  00:07:54,940
each other out.

116

00:07:54,930  -->  00:07:55,280
OK.

117

00:07:55,320  -->  00:07:57,800
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures
