00:00:00,180  -->  00:00:03,760
All right welcome back my dear Mac users.

2

00:00:03,760  -->  00:00:11,160
Now on this lecture here I want to recommend BHB storm as our editor as our ID is so little different

3

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:18,750
than some brackets and all those editors out there why ph be so different because this is NITV integrated

4

00:00:18,750  -->  00:00:24,290
development environment this is a whole software packaged ready to use ph.

5

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:27,110
I mean this is an awesome really awesome editor.

6

00:00:27,270  -->  00:00:31,430
And if you have some money I suggest you buy the product if you don't have any money.

7

00:00:31,440  -->  00:00:34,350
You can download it and evaluate it for 30 days.

8

00:00:34,350  -->  00:00:35,070
All right.

9

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:39,910
And David have discounts for students for teachers and for certain companies.

10

00:00:39,930  -->  00:00:47,220
So if you click on buy real quick right now let me assure you you can pay for a yearly all right for

11

00:00:47,220  -->  00:00:52,610
individual 89 bucks a first year 71 this second or $53.

12

00:00:52,640  -->  00:00:57,420
This is worth it the guys so if you have the money and you can do it is worth it to you can also pay

13

00:00:57,420  -->  00:01:00,000
monthly if you can pay every year.

14

00:01:00,000  -->  00:01:01,520
All right.

15

00:01:01,650  -->  00:01:02,980
Pretty cool stuff.

16

00:01:03,040  -->  00:01:08,890
Now you can get also discounts for start ups companies for students and teacher education and training

17

00:01:08,890  -->  00:01:08,910
.

18

00:01:08,910  -->  00:01:14,760
They have a lot of different discounts they really try to help people out there get their software and

19

00:01:15,080  -->  00:01:23,550
I mean this is one of the best ideas that I can find out there for Ph.D. and they also have ideas for

20

00:01:23,550  -->  00:01:25,180
other full.

21

00:01:25,190  -->  00:01:30,930
Dean for the mail I mean they have a whole bunch of different ideas out there but this is the cool the

22

00:01:30,930  -->  00:01:33,330
best ID that I could find ph be out there right.

23

00:01:33,330  -->  00:01:37,960
But anyway we can go ahead and try this for 30 days and that's what we're going to be doing anything

24

00:01:38,010  -->  00:01:38,860
like it.

25

00:01:39,120  -->  00:01:42,610
Then you can get a better price later.

26

00:01:42,720  -->  00:01:44,190
You try one of these options All right.

27

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:45,520
So we can download it.

28

00:01:45,540  -->  00:01:48,810
We click on download are you going to get redirected to this page.

29

00:01:48,810  -->  00:01:50,470
Click on download right here.

30

00:01:50,580  -->  00:01:52,770
That's going to download BHB storm.

31

00:01:52,770  -->  00:01:54,300
Go ahead and double click it.

32

00:01:54,310  -->  00:01:59,240
Once he finishes install it I already have installed in this computer.

33

00:01:59,280  -->  00:02:01,180
So I'm not going to do that.

34

00:02:01,200  -->  00:02:05,280
So once you have an install he's going to ask you if you want to try a software right so I'm going to

35

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:10,480
go right here go to my launchpad and look for it.

36

00:02:10,890  -->  00:02:13,900
You can also place it in your dock here just drag it down in place it.

37

00:02:13,910  -->  00:02:18,150
So because you're going to be using it a lot and then you're going to click on evaluate for 30 days

38

00:02:18,150  -->  00:02:22,020
and click OK recept and you're good to go.

39

00:02:22,020  -->  00:02:22,350
All right.

40

00:02:22,350  -->  00:02:26,530
That's what we're going to be doing with this but I'm going to cancel this because I'm going to.

41

00:02:26,610  -->  00:02:31,110
And you can go hunting aseptic later on we're going to create a new LaRocco project and we're going

42

00:02:31,130  -->  00:02:31,770
to open it up.

43

00:02:31,770  -->  00:02:33,690
But right now we're not going to open it up.

44

00:02:33,690  -->  00:02:35,200
You can if you wanted to.

45

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:36,130
All right.

46

00:02:36,150  -->  00:02:39,170
Once you have it installed you're set to go for this lecture.

47

00:02:39,290  -->  00:02:44,660
And now again remember that you can use any editor you wonder differing editors if you have to blind

48

00:02:44,660  -->  00:02:45,500
does good.

49

00:02:45,720  -->  00:02:46,690
So blinds are really good too.

50

00:02:46,690  -->  00:02:50,000
You can install some plug ins and make subline ID if you want.

51

00:02:50,030  -->  00:02:55,320
All right is very Blaine's really good a lot of people use it for Clarabell but I like to use PSP storm

52

00:02:55,740  -->  00:03:00,640
you can use any editor remember that you don't have to get BHB storm but I really do recommend it.

53

00:03:00,780  -->  00:03:01,370
All right.

54

00:03:01,410  -->  00:03:04,260
And you can tell on that as we recommended you to be storm Edwin.

55

00:03:04,260  -->  00:03:05,610
Edwin Diaz from you to me.

56

00:03:05,610  -->  00:03:06,270
All right.

57

00:03:06,480  -->  00:03:10,070
If you want to get a discount something I think they might be able to do something with you.

58

00:03:10,110  -->  00:03:14,340
But anyway thank you so much for watching these little guys and I'll see you in the next one.

59

00:03:14,340  -->  00:03:14,730
Take care
