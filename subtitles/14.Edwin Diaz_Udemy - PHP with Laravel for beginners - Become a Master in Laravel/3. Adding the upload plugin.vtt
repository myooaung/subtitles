00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:00.560
All right.

2

00:00:00.560  -->  00:00:08.580
Welcome back my dear student just because I want to add a really cool functionality here to all blow

3

00:00:08.580  -->  00:00:14.250
media and want to do it in a quick way and I want to actually upload multiple files.

4

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:16.130
Let's actually use a plugin.

5

00:00:16.200  -->  00:00:23.870
So let's go and let's go and use drugs or I think I used that in one of my courses.

6

00:00:23.880  -->  00:00:25.310
Pretty cool plug in.

7

00:00:25.330  -->  00:00:28.570
Let's see if they stay or if they are still available dropsonde.

8

00:00:28.700  -->  00:00:29.900
Yes.

9

00:00:29.950  -->  00:00:30.150
All right.

10

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:32.400
They are still available if they're not.

11

00:00:32.400  -->  00:00:34.200
Let me know we'll use another one but

12

00:00:37.390  -->  00:00:39.030
it looks pretty cool right here.

13

00:00:39.030  -->  00:00:39.630
OK.

14

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:41.750
So that's what we're going to be using all right.

15

00:00:42.030  -->  00:00:46.210
You can you can check it out see how it works.

16

00:00:46.240  -->  00:00:47.720
Oh blow far here.

17

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:50.790
It's pretty cool stuff but I already know how it works.

18

00:00:50.790  -->  00:00:53.430
So I got to do that.

19

00:00:53.610  -->  00:00:56.960
So I got to say Drop Zone see the m because I had to do this fast.

20

00:00:56.970  -->  00:01:02.100
I don't want to download the library and this go to the first one there.

21

00:01:02.700  -->  00:01:05.370
Let's see if we can find another one here.

22

00:01:05.930  -->  00:01:07.200
Oh this is fine.

23

00:01:07.830  -->  00:01:15.060
And going to copy can do the mini version.

24

00:01:15.060  -->  00:01:16.900
Let's copy it there.

25

00:01:17.700  -->  00:01:18.950
All right.

26

00:01:19.800  -->  00:01:20.690
All right cool.

27

00:01:20.730  -->  00:01:33.350
And I'm going to come here to my Create blade file and I'm going to see a section footer or I could

28

00:01:33.350  -->  00:01:38.150
say scripts actually if I want to like the scripts.

29

00:01:38.190  -->  00:01:38.990
All right.

30

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:42.040
And like I say stop here.

31

00:01:44.790  -->  00:01:46.090
And then you sign up pasted in there.

32

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:50.580
And this script is C S C R

33

00:01:58.290  -->  00:01:59.010
script

34

00:02:02.190  -->  00:02:04.340
.

35

00:02:05.310  -->  00:02:08.560
That's weird.

36

00:02:10.140  -->  00:02:11.790
Source.

37

00:02:11.800  -->  00:02:13.830
There we go.

38

00:02:13.830  -->  00:02:19.910
I was wondering why did they not do it and let's do it again because I lost my clipboard.

39

00:02:20.970  -->  00:02:23.690
All right so I'm going to paste that in there.

40

00:02:24.840  -->  00:02:25.470
OK.

41

00:02:25.740  -->  00:02:32.970
Now I want to go here and say we're going to open another section

42

00:02:38.700  -->  00:02:40.150
section.

43

00:02:40.400  -->  00:02:46.540
I'm going to call this stylus.

44

00:02:46.540  -->  00:02:52.980
And the reason why I'm doing this is so that this style is only run on this page and we don't have a

45

00:02:52.980  -->  00:02:54.640
lot of requesting our application.

46

00:02:54.640  -->  00:03:01.140
OK link see SS And let's go and get this CSSA version of it

47

00:03:04.190  -->  00:03:07.950
to him.

48

00:03:09.780  -->  00:03:16.830
What does it mean if my version of C says right here right beside the one you don't have to get.

49

00:03:16.830  -->  00:03:19.460
I mean if I versions you don't want to.

50

00:03:20.530  -->  00:03:21.130
All right.

51

00:03:21.240  -->  00:03:21.970
Cool.

52

00:03:21.990  -->  00:03:27.940
So now here for content I'm going to open up a form of form.

53

00:03:28.200  -->  00:03:30.590
I don't need the whole form.

54

00:03:30.690  -->  00:03:32.310
We're going to go to the store.

55

00:03:32.400  -->  00:03:44.440
And we're going to go to an medius controller and we've got to give this a class here.

56

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:49.270
So this is do it right here.

57

00:03:49.290  -->  00:03:55.300
Class drop zone and the well the reason why we give it a class is so that way.

58

00:03:55.300  -->  00:03:57.690
Dropzone can actually work.

59

00:03:57.720  -->  00:04:08.200
That's the way we link it right post and this would be we don't even need actually this button here

60

00:04:08.420  -->  00:04:10.220
we just need that.

61

00:04:11.220  -->  00:04:13.100
OK.

62

00:04:14.850  -->  00:04:18.410
And let's try it.

63

00:04:20.190  -->  00:04:20.760
All right.

64

00:04:21.070  -->  00:04:27.180
That's one thing that we got to do we've got to do golpe actually do we we don't need to do golpe for

65

00:04:27.180  -->  00:04:30.900
some reason it's not working here.

66

00:04:30.980  -->  00:04:36.290
This is Inspector real quick.

67

00:04:36.750  -->  00:04:42.190
It's looks like he's working as do you pitch sores

68

00:04:43.660  -->  00:04:46.710
.

69

00:04:47.140  -->  00:04:48.890
We don't got us down there.

70

00:04:48.900  -->  00:05:00.240
Well we have we don't have the styles so let's actually do go up here.

71

00:05:01.090  -->  00:05:06.450
All right Steve that makes it work in our application.

72

00:05:06.450  -->  00:05:10.520
Real quick right.

73

00:05:11.610  -->  00:05:16.860
No no no that's not gonna make it work we're not compiling anything but this is we're that is not

74

00:05:21.090  -->  00:05:24.870
unless we have it in the wrong page you know we have it in the right page.

75

00:05:25.290  -->  00:05:31.500
We should be seeing something on our page as the page source again

76

00:05:41.760  -->  00:05:52.140
you see the form here for this to all Oh of course you know we're doing dropzone here.

77

00:05:52.550  -->  00:06:02.490
We're doing golpe for some reason I don't know why I'm thinking that we had a local local file.

78

00:06:02.490  -->  00:06:03.270
All right.

79

00:06:03.420  -->  00:06:09.260
And not only that but I was thinking that we had it in the assets directory.

80

00:06:09.270  -->  00:06:10.410
Sorry about that guys.

81

00:06:10.530  -->  00:06:14.310
Well we need to do is we need to go back in yield this without having you this yet.

82

00:06:14.340  -->  00:06:15.670
That's why it's not showing.

83

00:06:15.670  -->  00:06:16.280
All right.

84

00:06:16.500  -->  00:06:21.780
So that's what happens when you have a lot of hours like me today of coding.

85

00:06:21.780  -->  00:06:22.710
All right.

86

00:06:23.190  -->  00:06:25.590
And I actually have a lot of hours all the time.

87

00:06:25.610  -->  00:06:31.430
So let's go to see I went blank there for a minute.

88

00:06:31.450  -->  00:06:38.100
That happens resources fuse layouts.

89

00:06:38.640  -->  00:06:43.090
And then we go to admin and this is where we yield.

90

00:06:44.130  -->  00:06:44.640
OK.

91

00:06:44.670  -->  00:06:51.200
So we want to yield that right after this lives.

92

00:06:51.210  -->  00:06:53.060
All right.

93

00:06:54.050  -->  00:06:56.790
Well we have a fuller one here.

94

00:06:57.770  -->  00:07:00.810
We should have just used that.

95

00:07:01.590  -->  00:07:02.920
That's OK.

96

00:07:03.870  -->  00:07:06.080
Let's use that this use footer.

97

00:07:06.840  -->  00:07:08.160
And this is this too.

98

00:07:08.170  -->  00:07:09.660
We're now using this anywhere else.

99

00:07:09.670  -->  00:07:13.850
Guys let's change that to scripts and see.

100

00:07:13.860  -->  00:07:17.470
Now if we can see it here.

101

00:07:18.030  -->  00:07:19.430
There we go.

102

00:07:19.440  -->  00:07:20.520
All right.

103

00:07:21.030  -->  00:07:38.760
Let's go back here and let's put the stylus here and there we go styles and let's refresh and you can

104

00:07:38.760  -->  00:07:40.080
see that that's there.

105

00:07:40.170  -->  00:07:43.990
We go back here and we got it.

106

00:07:44.100  -->  00:07:44.950
All right.

107

00:07:45.120  -->  00:07:47.940
All right guys I'm sorry for that little hook up there.

108

00:07:47.940  -->  00:07:49.520
I'm going to go get myself some rest.

109

00:07:49.530  -->  00:07:52.880
And I said yes if you've been courting for a while you had to get some rest.

110

00:07:52.890  -->  00:07:53.670
OK.

111

00:07:53.670  -->  00:07:55.040
Anyway it's been a pleasure.

112

00:07:55.050  -->  00:07:56.750
Thank you so much for watching.

113

00:07:56.910  -->  00:07:59.780
And I see you on the next lecture
