00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:05.550
All right welcome back to the soy stuff frost to start working on the replies section.

2

00:00:05.550  -->  00:00:06.440
All right cool.

3

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:08.580
Before we do that let's just fix it.

4

00:00:08.790  -->  00:00:12.710
Fix this up a little bit here especially.

5

00:00:13.960  -->  00:00:15.120
All right.

6

00:00:15.840  -->  00:00:20.250
Let's go to our polls and it's

7

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:30.030
and we don't have to create it.

8

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:34.290
You could put the Dave one there guys it's up to you.

9

00:00:34.290  -->  00:00:36.540
All right.

10

00:00:38.400  -->  00:00:41.330
What I'm not going to do there right now.

11

00:00:41.330  -->  00:00:41.910
I might.

12

00:00:41.920  -->  00:00:43.510
I might do that later.

13

00:00:43.740  -->  00:00:44.370
And

14

00:00:47.930  -->  00:00:49.410
you will see it in the screen.

15

00:00:49.410  -->  00:00:53.840
And you you would probably be like why in the world he just changed that.

16

00:00:54.140  -->  00:00:54.940
There we go.

17

00:00:55.170  -->  00:00:55.610
All right.

18

00:00:55.620  -->  00:00:59.920
And we could just leave it actually pushes.

19

00:00:59.940  -->  00:01:10.740
Do you guys just do it just for reference of the day that she's doing.

20

00:01:10.750  -->  00:01:11.390
There we go.

21

00:01:11.430  -->  00:01:15.950
Now you don't have to say oh my god he just do it now you know that I did it.

22

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:18.370
All right cool.

23

00:01:18.730  -->  00:01:20.810
Created out of date.

24

00:01:21.500  -->  00:01:22.280
That's OK.

25

00:01:22.530  -->  00:01:23.600
All right cool.

26

00:01:24.210  -->  00:01:27.570
Let's start with the replies.

27

00:01:27.570  -->  00:01:38.460
So right now if we go to that individual post we see here that we have the comments right now those

28

00:01:38.460  -->  00:01:39.150
comments

29

00:01:43.320  -->  00:01:46.120
are not approved so we can't see them.

30

00:01:46.140  -->  00:01:48.030
Now we see our next show one here.

31

00:01:48.210  -->  00:01:52.800
Well now let's fix this and make it so that where we can see the actual comment.

32

00:01:52.820  -->  00:02:01.390
All right before we walk on the reply so let's go to that post and here.

33

00:02:02.010  -->  00:02:04.230
Actually we do have a condition here so

34

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:09.810
let me see

35

00:02:10.290  -->  00:02:18.300
.

36

00:02:19.630  -->  00:02:21.230
We will be nice to see this.

37

00:02:21.240  -->  00:02:27.420
If we were logged in for some reason I don't have in mind it's not there.

38

00:02:27.420  -->  00:02:31.800
So if you don't have this make sure that you only see this if you're logged in guys.

39

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:32.380
All right.

40

00:02:32.580  -->  00:02:35.500
So I'm going to do that right now for some reason.

41

00:02:35.580  -->  00:02:37.250
Now here I think I did it in the video.

42

00:02:37.250  -->  00:02:39.760
If not do it with me right now.

43

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:44.100
So this check we're going to see this.

44

00:02:44.160  -->  00:02:45.240
All right.

45

00:02:45.810  -->  00:02:51.700
If the user is logged in does well if they are checked means.

46

00:02:51.790  -->  00:02:52.880
All right.

47

00:02:53.490  -->  00:02:59.820
So I think I did that and another video there but.

48

00:03:00.960  -->  00:03:03.170
So we are able to see it because we are logged in.

49

00:03:03.170  -->  00:03:06.030
So if we locked down of course we won't see that.

50

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:08.030
I thought I did this in an hour lecture.

51

00:03:08.250  -->  00:03:14.730
But anyway so we have the comment right here so we could say something like

52

00:03:19.470  -->  00:03:26.140
If comments and let's actually County

53

00:03:30.600  -->  00:03:31.830
comment.

54

00:03:32.700  -->  00:03:34.050
It's bigger than zero.

55

00:03:34.050  -->  00:03:41.040
I want to show I want to see it.

56

00:03:42.260  -->  00:03:43.960
All right.

57

00:03:44.850  -->  00:03:49.610
So we can.

58

00:03:49.610  -->  00:03:49.970
All right.

59

00:03:49.980  -->  00:03:52.330
I thought I did this already.

60

00:03:53.340  -->  00:03:58.440
I had recently a my computer crashing.

61

00:03:58.440  -->  00:04:05.970
For some reason again this is the third time and I don't know what's going on.

62

00:04:05.970  -->  00:04:06.590
I got to check it.

63

00:04:06.610  -->  00:04:13.770
But anyway so let's go to our admin posts

64

00:04:16.470  -->  00:04:18.760
and we are passing that way there.

65

00:04:18.990  -->  00:04:31.290
I mean we're passing the comments the active comments so there let's go back to admen let's prove them

66

00:04:31.290  -->  00:04:33.600
and let's refresh and you can see he's not there anymore.

67

00:04:33.600  -->  00:04:35.020
Ok cool.

68

00:04:35.260  -->  00:04:37.770
So just we're showing just the active comments.

69

00:04:37.790  -->  00:04:38.940
I'm just double checking here.

70

00:04:38.940  -->  00:04:41.880
I think you guys already have this material.

71

00:04:41.880  -->  00:04:44.950
But in my case I don't.

72

00:04:45.020  -->  00:04:46.260
All right.

73

00:04:46.960  -->  00:04:48.430
If not there you have it now.

74

00:04:48.420  -->  00:04:48.840
All right.

75

00:04:48.840  -->  00:04:49.470
Cool.

76

00:04:49.740  -->  00:04:50.260
All right.

77

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:57.530
So let's actually show the comment photo here if we can come in.

78

00:04:57.660  -->  00:05:00.280
If we have any.

79

00:05:02.340  -->  00:05:03.600
Let's see.

80

00:05:04.080  -->  00:05:05.510
I think he's going to be too huge.

81

00:05:05.520  -->  00:05:08.170
So let's make it.

82

00:05:08.670  -->  00:05:09.960
Let's see what size is this

83

00:05:14.730  -->  00:05:16.660
I think you said they are 64

84

00:05:19.510  -->  00:05:25.940
so Height's 64 right.

85

00:05:26.560  -->  00:05:29.360
I don't know if we have any picture there.

86

00:05:30.580  -->  00:05:34.120
Let's go to Aardman and approve them.

87

00:05:34.210  -->  00:05:38.140
Let's see if we don't get an error as we get a narrow undefined comment

88

00:05:42.310  -->  00:05:45.250
because we don't have a loop.

89

00:05:45.340  -->  00:05:50.920
All right this comments last comment

90

00:05:53.150  -->  00:05:55.050
.

91

00:05:56.500  -->  00:06:00.190
And for each There we go.

92

00:06:00.600  -->  00:06:05.100
So let's check in now and see what's going on.

93

00:06:05.110  -->  00:06:06.530
All right we don't have the picture.

94

00:06:06.530  -->  00:06:11.890
Let's inspect then we probably don't have nothing in the database for that and I'm right with words

95

00:06:11.950  -->  00:06:12.890
empty.

96

00:06:13.300  -->  00:06:19.340
Maybe the database is 90 but our photo is well it is empty.

97

00:06:19.420  -->  00:06:19.970
All right.

98

00:06:20.170  -->  00:06:28.600
So when we send out comments for some reason the photo is not being sent is now being placed in the

99

00:06:28.600  -->  00:06:29.460
database.

100

00:06:29.470  -->  00:06:31.360
So we've got to find out why.

101

00:06:31.360  -->  00:06:33.440
All right.

102

00:06:33.440  -->  00:06:39.420
Cool let's go to our man Paul's comments controller.

103

00:06:40.030  -->  00:06:43.160
Let's talk to the guy who's in charge.

104

00:06:43.570  -->  00:06:48.410
And as you can see he's trying to get for the front and the user.

105

00:06:48.420  -->  00:06:50.370
But these are those who have a photo.

106

00:06:50.590  -->  00:06:54.450
Then they have a photo to take in.

107

00:06:54.490  -->  00:06:58.350
So those comments are probably made by oh by Edwin.

108

00:06:58.380  -->  00:07:03.560
So and then it has a picture.

109

00:07:04.900  -->  00:07:08.730
Let's go back.

110

00:07:08.980  -->  00:07:13.570
There's a picture and it should have been sent.

111

00:07:13.570  -->  00:07:18.710
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment all of this.

112

00:07:19.030  -->  00:07:23.390
This is how wide the bog and all my courses I show you guys how I do it.

113

00:07:23.530  -->  00:07:28.940
So that way you guys can also do it less return.

114

00:07:28.990  -->  00:07:32.130
They use a photo.

115

00:07:33.970  -->  00:07:38.470
I wish I had an instructor that will show me his mistakes guys when I was learning.

116

00:07:38.760  -->  00:07:44.180
That way I could had taken a really big shortcut you know.

117

00:07:45.370  -->  00:07:50.730
So as you can see the image is being sent.

118

00:07:51.630  -->  00:07:55.140
So we're good there.

119

00:07:57.340  -->  00:08:04.520
Let's take the file and send and see if we can get just that.

120

00:08:05.400  -->  00:08:12.390
Let's go back and yes we can get the follow as well.

121

00:08:12.400  -->  00:08:13.760
So what does that tell us.

122

00:08:13.780  -->  00:08:17.820
That is not our functionality right here.

123

00:08:17.830  -->  00:08:20.290
Our function is working.

124

00:08:20.290  -->  00:08:21.520
Everything has been sent.

125

00:08:21.530  -->  00:08:27.650
But this photo for some reason here is now being updated.

126

00:08:28.150  -->  00:08:37.290
So a couple of things we've got to check our comment festivals and that's it.

127

00:08:39.070  -->  00:08:39.740
There we go.

128

00:08:39.750  -->  00:08:43.410
That's why I was sending it in.

129

00:08:43.410  -->  00:08:43.900
All right.

130

00:08:44.050  -->  00:08:47.150
Let's create a coming now.

131

00:08:48.220  -->  00:08:58.090
Let's go to the polls and let's just say this thing.

132

00:08:59.380  -->  00:09:04.630
Let's go back to the men comments and approve it.

133

00:09:05.250  -->  00:09:06.690
Let's go back and refresh

134

00:09:08.980  -->  00:09:11.180
.

135

00:09:12.390  -->  00:09:13.730
There we go.

136

00:09:13.890  -->  00:09:15.640
Now we get a picture.

137

00:09:16.250  -->  00:09:23.490
Yea I'm going to leave this too here because they're just taking a lot of space.

138

00:09:23.500  -->  00:09:24.150
All right.

139

00:09:24.150  -->  00:09:38.040
So let's go to our post and this comment was made by some unbelievable guy

140

00:09:41.560  -->  00:09:44.560
and his name was Arthur.

141

00:09:44.950  -->  00:09:46.270
No that wasn't his name.

142

00:09:46.270  -->  00:09:46.620
Guy.

143

00:09:46.620  -->  00:09:48.230
Come on.

144

00:09:48.810  -->  00:09:50.370
And this could be the creating

145

00:09:53.290  -->  00:10:03.190
and we could put a little tiff for humans functionality here.

146

00:10:03.340  -->  00:10:04.310
Right.

147

00:10:04.360  -->  00:10:09.580
And we take the body and put it right here

148

00:10:09.580  -->  00:10:16.780
.

149

00:10:16.780  -->  00:10:17.380
All right.

150

00:10:17.380  -->  00:10:19.720
We're replacing the data really.

151

00:10:19.830  -->  00:10:24.510
Really nice undefinable there and create it.

152

00:10:25.060  -->  00:10:29.470
That would be nice if we write down the object first

153

00:10:29.470  -->  00:10:40.410
.

154

00:10:40.400  -->  00:10:42.190
All right.

155

00:10:42.370  -->  00:10:42.850
All right.

156

00:10:42.880  -->  00:10:49.900
I don't know if you remember a couple years ago I told you that that I needed my coffee actually that

157

00:10:49.890  -->  00:10:51.680
was a lot of lectures ago.

158

00:10:52.090  -->  00:10:53.220
I still haven't got it.

159

00:10:53.240  -->  00:10:53.670
All right.

160

00:10:53.680  -->  00:11:00.760
I sent a family member to give me some coffee and they haven't come back anyways.

161

00:11:01.240  -->  00:11:03.170
You see is working pretty good.

162

00:11:03.220  -->  00:11:08.410
The next thing for us to do would be to work on the reply.

163

00:11:08.400  -->  00:11:15.580
This is the comment and we've got to work on replies are-I replies is going to be nasty like this one

164

00:11:15.580  -->  00:11:15.970
.

165

00:11:16.000  -->  00:11:20.550
So we got a nice one of these guys here and then we placed it data.

166

00:11:20.560  -->  00:11:21.200
All right.

167

00:11:21.250  -->  00:11:24.220
That would be the next step for that.

168

00:11:24.520  -->  00:11:26.460
So that way we can see the replies.

169

00:11:26.500  -->  00:11:33.190
But we also have to do some javascript or Jay Querrey here because it would be nice to have a little

170

00:11:33.180  -->  00:11:40.690
button right to click that way we can show the nets get short form instead of having to show all the
