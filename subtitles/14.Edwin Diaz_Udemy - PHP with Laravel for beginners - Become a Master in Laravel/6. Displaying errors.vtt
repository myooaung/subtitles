00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:04.110
All right welcome back to the students on the last lecture we discussed.

2

00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:07.600
We learned now how we can value the right.

3

00:00:07.680  -->  00:00:15.440
Let me open my BHB storm for some reason it was close so we had a valley day and we put this function

4

00:00:15.440  -->  00:00:21.920
idea in the post right here in the post controller right in the store method.

5

00:00:22.350  -->  00:00:32.940
So our post create was redirecting us every time we try to create a post without putting anything in

6

00:00:32.940  -->  00:00:33.250
there.

7

00:00:33.300  -->  00:00:37.170
As you can see right here now the problem with this is doesn't give that much feedback.

8

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:42.090
We don't know what type of errors or they use are those and know what type or where errors they are

9

00:00:42.090  -->  00:00:42.750
committing.

10

00:00:42.880  -->  00:00:50.340
Or making So if they had you know 100 lines of form inputs you know it would be hard for them to know

11

00:00:50.340  -->  00:00:51.760
which one is wrong.

12

00:00:52.110  -->  00:00:56.910
So to display errors and that's what I'm getting at.

13

00:00:56.910  -->  00:01:03.260
We need a functionality Now when this automatically fails.

14

00:01:03.330  -->  00:01:11.400
All these errors are going to be saved in a Errors variable like this.

15

00:01:11.400  -->  00:01:16.940
Errors are OK and that's going to be available throughout the whole obligation.

16

00:01:16.940  -->  00:01:21.060
Now the we need to create a group.

17

00:01:21.090  -->  00:01:22.060
All right.

18

00:01:22.290  -->  00:01:24.170
And I'll show you right now.

19

00:01:24.960  -->  00:01:25.860
After we create.

20

00:01:25.870  -->  00:01:28.010
Actually as a matter of fact let's go and do that right now.

21

00:01:28.020  -->  00:01:31.550
Let's go to routes right routes.

22

00:01:31.890  -->  00:01:36.180
We need to create a group array wasn't always like this.

23

00:01:36.180  -->  00:01:41.670
Would it have to do this before but each version of labo changes so right now correlated to 5.2 we need

24

00:01:41.670  -->  00:01:43.680
to create a group.

25

00:01:43.800  -->  00:01:44.330
All right.

26

00:01:44.370  -->  00:01:52.950
And if you guys even if you are in lecture 7 8 or 9 version or 20 or your version of Claribel or the

27

00:01:52.950  -->  00:01:58.710
end of this course I will always keep updating it so that way if we create another future course it

28

00:01:58.710  -->  00:02:03.040
will be updated to the recent version you know that is available that time.

29

00:02:03.090  -->  00:02:09.940
OK so always look at the last lecture's or the sections that say you know it was different than 5.7

30

00:02:09.940  -->  00:02:12.570
or Clarabelle cits was different.

31

00:02:12.570  -->  00:02:16.380
You know you're going to see those different sections when I will the Course are I always going to try

32

00:02:16.380  -->  00:02:18.570
to keep this updated as possible.

33

00:02:18.570  -->  00:02:22.260
All right so we need to create a group and we need to insert here a middleware.

34

00:02:22.260  -->  00:02:27.780
Now we have now this cost about made aware yet we just know that this is a security feature and I will

35

00:02:27.780  -->  00:02:30.570
explain to you more about that later.

36

00:02:30.660  -->  00:02:33.350
But right now the middleware is WEP.

37

00:02:33.600  -->  00:02:40.020
OK the second parameter that would pass is a function closure function and then would bring it down

38

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:40.710
.

39

00:02:40.730  -->  00:02:45.040
Now this raÃºl right here.

40

00:02:45.750  -->  00:02:47.570
OK.

41

00:02:48.870  -->  00:02:49.970
Would be.

42

00:02:49.980  -->  00:02:54.780
Now there's all these routes will be available in this middleware.

43

00:02:54.780  -->  00:02:56.160
Cold wet.

44

00:02:56.550  -->  00:02:58.470
OK and we got different kinds of made aware.

45

00:02:58.470  -->  00:03:00.990
This is a security feature for Clarabell.

46

00:03:01.050  -->  00:03:01.710
All right.

47

00:03:01.890  -->  00:03:05.250
So if you had another type of middleway here you can create your own.

48

00:03:05.250  -->  00:03:06.930
By the way I'll show you that.

49

00:03:07.230  -->  00:03:08.600
And you don't later lectures.

50

00:03:08.610  -->  00:03:10.140
But this is for the web.

51

00:03:10.140  -->  00:03:15.200
Everything that's going to be available for the web made aware would be available here.

52

00:03:15.300  -->  00:03:16.750
Everything that we putting sigh.

53

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:21.750
So if we had another one then there is one other one called off for three sation.

54

00:03:21.780  -->  00:03:23.530
This will be more secure.

55

00:03:23.550  -->  00:03:27.490
This will be for users that are already logged into our application.

56

00:03:27.490  -->  00:03:32.050
All right so right now making this web available to everyone to everybody OK.

57

00:03:32.100  -->  00:03:35.600
And this is just because we are creating a very simple application.

58

00:03:35.610  -->  00:03:41.910
I'm not going to make users slogan to do this now because we still have not created like a logging application

59

00:03:41.940  -->  00:03:43.510
or logging functionality yet.

60

00:03:43.640  -->  00:03:47.390
OK so anyway let's go back to where we were creating.

61

00:03:47.400  -->  00:03:48.930
So now this is available.

62

00:03:48.930  -->  00:03:53.960
The Aeros array or errors a variable is available to use.

63

00:03:54.030  -->  00:03:54.750
All right.

64

00:03:55.170  -->  00:03:56.740
For this routes.

65

00:03:57.010  -->  00:04:04.600
OK so let's go and let's go to the create here and here is super simple we got to do is do a couple

66

00:04:04.600  -->  00:04:07.110
of conditions here to make this work OK.

67

00:04:07.920  -->  00:04:14.400
So let's do if and this closer right away.

68

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:17.060
So we don't forget and little condition here.

69

00:04:17.070  -->  00:04:28.290
So I'm going to count when I use the function count from BHB going to see if the count of errors is

70

00:04:28.290  -->  00:04:30.160
actually more than 0.

71

00:04:30.390  -->  00:04:32.340
I want you to do something right.

72

00:04:33.030  -->  00:04:40.750
So let's create a little diff year I'm going to give it a class of alert and then another.

73

00:04:40.770  -->  00:04:44.130
This is a bootstrap class.

74

00:04:44.190  -->  00:04:44.960
OK.

75

00:04:45.450  -->  00:04:51.800
So it does create a you will and now we just loop through it.

76

00:04:51.810  -->  00:04:59.690
We're going to look through the variable on the end for each.

77

00:04:59.690  -->  00:05:02.990
You know I really don't like the indentation you guys really don't like it.

78

00:05:03.000  -->  00:05:12.540
But anyway so we're going to save errors when I look through it and I believe this is a all method as

79

00:05:12.600  -->  00:05:13.590
error.

80

00:05:13.890  -->  00:05:15.690
There we go I think I'm doing it correctly.

81

00:05:15.690  -->  00:05:16.580
I don't use it.

82

00:05:16.620  -->  00:05:21.060
I don't do this much like this by hand because I have a snippet.

83

00:05:21.060  -->  00:05:25.200
I'm going to show you in a minute how to do that how to create a snippet and BHP store so that way you

84

00:05:25.200  -->  00:05:29.350
don't have to keep writing the same thing over and over because as you know we use a lot of forms write

85

00:05:29.980  -->  00:05:34.000
applications so we're going to display this error.

86

00:05:34.860  -->  00:05:35.290
OK.

87

00:05:35.340  -->  00:05:36.860
And we go.

88

00:05:37.170  -->  00:05:38.340
All right I think we're good.

89

00:05:38.340  -->  00:05:39.210
We're set.

90

00:05:39.510  -->  00:05:41.000
Let's check it out real quick.

91

00:05:41.010  -->  00:05:42.310
All right.

92

00:05:43.410  -->  00:05:48.700
All right so if I don't write anything you can see that the title field is require and the content field

93

00:05:48.740  -->  00:05:49.970
is required.

94

00:05:49.980  -->  00:05:54.160
Now of course we don't have the input for the content there.

95

00:05:54.180  -->  00:06:03.400
We could if we wanted to do that and that is coming from here.

96

00:06:04.050  -->  00:06:08.610
So now if I do this we only get one there.

97

00:06:09.150  -->  00:06:10.580
OK.

98

00:06:10.620  -->  00:06:15.280
And of course you can customize the rules and I explain to you about that before.

99

00:06:15.610  -->  00:06:25.170
OK well you can just put mats on all four characters or something like that.

100

00:06:25.200  -->  00:06:33.210
So if I go and do this the title may be may now be longer than four characters you see that.

101

00:06:33.600  -->  00:06:39.200
Pretty cool stuff with a simple little cold.

102

00:06:39.220  -->  00:06:41.500
Right here you can make all that happen.

103

00:06:41.520  -->  00:06:44.190
All right so now you know how to create.

104

00:06:44.660  -->  00:06:50.330
All right is validation code and even display the errors already so you're golden guys.

105

00:06:50.340  -->  00:06:53.420
You're really doing awesome if you're following me and you learning all this stuff.

106

00:06:53.430  -->  00:06:54.990
Really cool stuff right.

107

00:06:54.990  -->  00:06:58.900
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
