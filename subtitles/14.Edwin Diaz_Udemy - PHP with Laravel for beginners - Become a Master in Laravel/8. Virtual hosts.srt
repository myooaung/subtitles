1

00:00:00,330  -->  00:00:02,650
All right welcome back my dear student.

2

00:00:02,760  -->  00:00:10,830
So now that we have Lara Vale working in our work environment here in BHB environment we can make different

3

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:11,780
projects right.

4

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:18,500
All we have to do is access them by you know by their folder name and Pawlick directory.

5

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:25,380
So if we have something else like maybe blog we'll put local holes for Slash blog for slash public and

6

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:28,030
we can access our project through the browser right.

7

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:31,650
Well I think it's easier if we do something like this.

8

00:00:31,650  -->  00:00:32,340
What do you think.

9

00:00:32,350  -->  00:00:41,400
Blog dot tv right now that we know we know that if we visit blacked out the TV we can see our project

10

00:00:41,400  -->  00:00:42,880
that we created last week right.

11

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:46,620
Instead of typing in local hosing blah blah blah blah blah blah.

12

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:47,110
Right.

13

00:00:47,130  -->  00:00:51,720
Just a lot of writing to do and it's just not very professional.

14

00:00:51,930  -->  00:00:56,660
Let's actually make a little change here make it so that way we can type it in just like a domain right

15

00:00:56,660  -->  00:00:57,130
.

16

00:00:57,150  -->  00:00:59,860
So where do we have to go.

17

00:00:59,880  -->  00:01:02,070
Let's open terminal.

18

00:01:02,270  -->  00:01:12,680
Right right here and let's just go to CD4 slash wherever you are in terminal to see the four slash.

19

00:01:12,690  -->  00:01:19,190
Now if your command line looks a little different than mine that's because I edit my bash file.

20

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:20,270
I edit it.

21

00:01:20,340  -->  00:01:21,980
So let me show you where it is.

22

00:01:21,980  -->  00:01:26,100
See the little till they're close to the number one on the keyboard.

23

00:01:26,100  -->  00:01:30,990
And for Slashdot bash profile.

24

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:31,590
Right.

25

00:01:31,770  -->  00:01:37,290
Whoops we've got to do pseudo pseudo Nano.

26

00:01:37,350  -->  00:01:42,610
And now you can see that where we created aliases we have I have this little piece of code here that

27

00:01:42,620  -->  00:01:49,870
says export business one equals double cold's backslash capital W colon.

28

00:01:50,070  -->  00:01:52,080
And that's why you see my command prompt like that.

29

00:01:52,080  -->  00:01:52,690
All right.

30

00:01:52,950  -->  00:01:54,390
I think I already told you how to do that.

31

00:01:54,390  -->  00:01:58,140
Just refresh in your mind if not then you have the information now.

32

00:01:58,230  -->  00:01:59,710
So control.

33

00:01:59,970  -->  00:02:04,510
We're going to come out of that window because we didn't edit anything.

34

00:02:04,560  -->  00:02:07,300
Ask for a date and give us a prompt.

35

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:08,680
Right.

36

00:02:08,760  -->  00:02:09,310
All right.

37

00:02:09,570  -->  00:02:11,450
So what we need to go from here.

38

00:02:11,490  -->  00:02:13,240
We need to say sudo.

39

00:02:13,420  -->  00:02:13,830
All right.

40

00:02:13,830  -->  00:02:16,320
Because that's going to be the super user remember that.

41

00:02:16,320  -->  00:02:19,980
And then Nanami's the editor that we are using we can use Venice well.

42

00:02:20,130  -->  00:02:35,190
I like to use nano and we've got to go to far Flash applications then zap and the TC and I'm also typing

43

00:02:36,090  -->  00:02:39,380
tab here all right because this autocomplete for me.

44

00:02:39,390  -->  00:02:39,970
Right.

45

00:02:40,260  -->  00:02:43,680
So now it's tab you see that.

46

00:02:44,010  -->  00:02:54,450
And then each HTP the high and the four slash I mean tab and then enter we're going to edit this com

47

00:02:54,450  -->  00:02:56,100
file.

48

00:02:56,100  -->  00:02:58,300
This is the first one we're going to be editing.

49

00:02:58,320  -->  00:02:58,980
Actually

50

00:03:02,310  -->  00:03:03,780
let's edit the other ones.

51

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:08,990
First of all where you can have a better idea let's do control ads and let's go sudo.

52

00:03:09,360  -->  00:03:09,720
All right.

53

00:03:09,740  -->  00:03:13,430
I want you to get very used to the command line is very important right.

54

00:03:13,740  -->  00:03:14,830
Suit on and on.

55

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:20,400
And I know that sounds strange to you but believe me the more you do with the easier it would get.

56

00:03:20,400  -->  00:03:20,750
All right.

57

00:03:20,770  -->  00:03:22,770
I want you to practice a lot with this.

58

00:03:22,770  -->  00:03:24,630
So let's do applications again.

59

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:35,850
Let's do zap again and let's do zem files actually.

60

00:03:37,110  -->  00:03:39,330
Well yes that's fine.

61

00:03:39,330  -->  00:03:40,420
Zap files it.

62

00:03:40,410  -->  00:03:42,540
See I'm doing good.

63

00:03:42,570  -->  00:03:46,010
HTP the dot com Antar.

64

00:03:46,050  -->  00:03:46,890
All right.

65

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:53,040
So in the line 400 something even though you don't see it here my editor is all the way almost in the

66

00:03:53,040  -->  00:03:57,900
bottom line who's going to scroll all the way to the bottom there almost to the bottom.

67

00:03:58,350  -->  00:04:04,990
And we're going to start seeing some hashes right here.

68

00:04:05,490  -->  00:04:08,110
You see this he says include include include.

69

00:04:08,130  -->  00:04:12,750
You're going to find a line that says virtual holes right here right below this.

70

00:04:12,750  -->  00:04:18,060
Make sure this little link right here this line that they have this hash.

71

00:04:18,060  -->  00:04:20,040
Make sure these are uncommented.

72

00:04:20,070  -->  00:04:21,810
All right.

73

00:04:21,810  -->  00:04:22,880
That's how it has to be.

74

00:04:22,870  -->  00:04:26,070
Right so that way we can activate that file.

75

00:04:26,470  -->  00:04:29,460
I actually TPD the holes right.

76

00:04:29,640  -->  00:04:32,920
So command X and then is going to say do you want to modify.

77

00:04:32,940  -->  00:04:34,770
Yes I do actually.

78

00:04:35,160  -->  00:04:38,740
So why for yes and then answer.

79

00:04:38,760  -->  00:04:51,920
All right so once you have that then we get to go pseudo Nano for a slash BTC and then hose like this

80

00:04:51,910  -->  00:04:55,980
when a mess and then enter in here.

81

00:04:56,060  -->  00:04:56,500
All right.

82

00:04:56,530  -->  00:05:05,520
We're going to type in 1 2 7 0 8 0 1 which is the IP address of zem our local environment server.

83

00:05:05,530  -->  00:05:06,670
Right.

84

00:05:07,450  -->  00:05:12,430
And then we're going to type whatever address we want to type in the browser when we want to open our

85

00:05:12,440  -->  00:05:13,120
application.

86

00:05:13,120  -->  00:05:17,170
So in this case we already have CIMS right.

87

00:05:17,180  -->  00:05:20,480
So let's use that lets do CMOS.

88

00:05:20,840  -->  00:05:22,020
Even for development.

89

00:05:22,030  -->  00:05:26,990
And you know while you can do whatever you want so if you want to put that app that's up to you.

90

00:05:27,120  -->  00:05:27,800
Right.

91

00:05:28,250  -->  00:05:28,910
Or whatever.

92

00:05:28,900  -->  00:05:32,940
Even dot com which I don't recommend that you don't want to confuse your browser right.

93

00:05:33,160  -->  00:05:35,730
But anyway the Evely There we go.

94

00:05:36,070  -->  00:05:40,820
And then control X and then Y and then enter.

95

00:05:40,810  -->  00:05:41,830
Beautiful.

96

00:05:41,830  -->  00:05:42,980
All right so that's done.

97

00:05:43,120  -->  00:05:45,860
The next thing is we want to go to.

98

00:05:45,860  -->  00:05:51,400
Now let me show you a trick if you press the the key the the arrow keys the up arrow key on your keyboard

99

00:05:51,400  -->  00:05:53,740
you can go in to the last command.

100

00:05:53,930  -->  00:05:56,410
So you don't have to type everything again.

101

00:05:56,410  -->  00:05:56,880
Right.

102

00:05:57,070  -->  00:06:05,980
So we got to go to this one actually to the holes all right and then enter because we already type Dawan

103

00:06:06,640  -->  00:06:08,400
and this grow all the way to the bottom here.

104

00:06:08,410  -->  00:06:10,070
And we got some dummy tÃªtes.

105

00:06:10,150  -->  00:06:12,970
This is what we need to wear it to make this work.

106

00:06:12,980  -->  00:06:16,690
This is where we're going to be placing our project on a different project.

107

00:06:16,690  -->  00:06:23,610
So if I have a seam CIMS that that death we're going to pull one of those for the DAT def and then if

108

00:06:23,620  -->  00:06:27,660
I have to do less outdoor to do less he another.

109

00:06:27,790  -->  00:06:33,670
Another block of this four to do less than and so on and so on for every level.

110

00:06:34,190  -->  00:06:40,100
Clarabelle project or big Claribel project would create one of these are-I we got an opening virtual

111

00:06:40,090  -->  00:06:41,920
host tag and we'll have a close in one.

112

00:06:41,930  -->  00:06:48,620
And then this cold in between now you don't have to type all everything inside there right.

113

00:06:49,330  -->  00:06:55,540
But anyway let's go up and right here and between this line here I want you to type in something for

114

00:06:55,540  -->  00:06:56,390
me right.

115

00:06:56,690  -->  00:06:59,620
So what we're going to be tapping in super simple.

116

00:06:59,620  -->  00:07:00,290
All right.

117

00:07:00,520  -->  00:07:02,530
Let me know when you ready.

118

00:07:02,530  -->  00:07:03,260
So you ready.

119

00:07:03,440  -->  00:07:04,380
All right.

120

00:07:04,900  -->  00:07:06,010
Let's go into it.

121

00:07:06,010  -->  00:07:12,620
So we're going to say name all right name virtual holes.

122

00:07:12,700  -->  00:07:13,690
Got it.

123

00:07:13,690  -->  00:07:15,930
All right name.

124

00:07:16,900  -->  00:07:22,180
And then virtual host you see camel case everything.

125

00:07:22,260  -->  00:07:24,120
The first word.

126

00:07:24,130  -->  00:07:25,540
All right make sure you spell it correctly.

127

00:07:25,540  -->  00:07:26,180
OK.

128

00:07:26,240  -->  00:07:31,900
And then the asterisk and then call in 80.

129

00:07:31,900  -->  00:07:34,050
All right cool.

130

00:07:34,120  -->  00:07:37,290
So now let's go to this one here first.

131

00:07:37,450  -->  00:07:41,780
As a matter of fact I forgot something but I'm going to do it in a minute but that's OK let's just do

132

00:07:41,780  -->  00:07:43,290
it like this first.

133

00:07:43,280  -->  00:07:43,900
All right.

134

00:07:44,140  -->  00:07:50,960
So we're going to let's see if we can edit this and make it work the way it is.

135

00:07:50,990  -->  00:07:57,930
Sometimes I really need to modify it a lot but let's see if this time we can make it work.

136

00:07:58,100  -->  00:08:09,460
So let's do the first ones here and then make this the localhost and we have to set the fourth one for

137

00:08:09,470  -->  00:08:11,040
that.

138

00:08:11,100  -->  00:08:17,990
So I'm going to do zem files H.T. talks.

139

00:08:18,400  -->  00:08:21,460
All right I'm going to leave this like this.

140

00:08:21,470  -->  00:08:27,630
Doesn't matter server name right is going to be local host.

141

00:08:27,640  -->  00:08:32,180
We don't even need an alias for that but it's up to you if you want to do it

142

00:08:36,390  -->  00:08:37,050
right.

143

00:08:37,120  -->  00:08:38,560
Do local host

144

00:08:42,820  -->  00:08:44,200
a.

145

00:08:44,240  -->  00:08:47,850
And you don't have to have a narrow log for that either.

146

00:08:47,870  -->  00:08:49,870
It's a matter of fact and take that off.

147

00:08:49,900  -->  00:08:54,620
I'm going to do control I'm going to put my cursor right in the first line of the control K to take

148

00:08:54,620  -->  00:08:57,790
up the whole line and you can see this instructions down here guys.

149

00:08:57,800  -->  00:08:58,630
All right.

150

00:08:59,120  -->  00:09:04,590
All right this is all control control why control the control cage you cut the tax.

151

00:09:04,630  -->  00:09:05,280
All right.

152

00:09:05,410  -->  00:09:12,250
So you have some instructions there you can go to the next page by control V at them etc..

153

00:09:12,280  -->  00:09:15,230
All right so I'm going to go here and control.

154

00:09:15,250  -->  00:09:17,260
OK.

155

00:09:17,310  -->  00:09:22,250
All right I think that's OK for this.

156

00:09:23,260  -->  00:09:25,020
And take that off too.

157

00:09:25,630  -->  00:09:27,620
If you want to leave there a log that's good.

158

00:09:27,620  -->  00:09:29,540
If you want that that's fine to use.

159

00:09:29,570  -->  00:09:35,690
Put the name of your site you do replace this with a name where your sight array.

160

00:09:36,110  -->  00:09:36,960
Very easy.

161

00:09:36,960  -->  00:09:42,840
I'm going to take it off and you can leave it very simple like this.

162

00:09:42,860  -->  00:09:43,510
All right.

163

00:09:43,660  -->  00:09:45,720
So the second one I'm going to make it.

164

00:09:45,860  -->  00:09:47,690
So it goes to my

165

00:09:50,410  -->  00:09:51,530
see a mess.

166

00:09:51,560  -->  00:09:53,950
All right.

167

00:09:54,200  -->  00:10:01,360
So to do the docs CIMS Pawlick.

168

00:10:01,390  -->  00:10:05,240
So it goes to our IT SEEMS Clarabelle project right.

169

00:10:05,840  -->  00:10:08,030
And the server name very important guys.

170

00:10:08,020  -->  00:10:09,650
Without this it will now work.

171

00:10:09,640  -->  00:10:10,220
All right.

172

00:10:10,460  -->  00:10:12,230
Let's do CMOS.

173

00:10:12,440  -->  00:10:13,840
The eevee.

174

00:10:14,620  -->  00:10:15,440
All right.

175

00:10:15,880  -->  00:10:21,110
You can change this if you want if you want to put your email address whatever.

176

00:10:21,110  -->  00:10:22,660
That's OK.

177

00:10:22,700  -->  00:10:23,510
All right.

178

00:10:23,840  -->  00:10:26,860
So this should work out of the box like this one not not at the bottom.

179

00:10:26,870  -->  00:10:29,090
I mean we've made some modifications here right.

180

00:10:29,350  -->  00:10:33,330
There's let's do control X and then yes Antar.

181

00:10:33,620  -->  00:10:38,030
Now the next thing we got to do is do a restart.

182

00:10:38,290  -->  00:10:45,060
And I hope we encounter some issues so that we I can help you with with the issues arising.

183

00:10:45,230  -->  00:10:47,240
You don't have to go and google or anything like that.

184

00:10:47,330  -->  00:10:51,910
If you have any problems you can always put posted in the discussion and we'll try our best to help

185

00:10:51,910  -->  00:10:52,460
you out.

186

00:10:52,660  -->  00:10:55,550
So I'm going to restart all right here.

187

00:10:55,890  -->  00:11:05,280
I'm a way for this to start and then I'm going to try and that address on my browser.

188

00:11:05,780  -->  00:11:06,970
And I want you to do the same thing.

189

00:11:06,970  -->  00:11:08,280
OK.

190

00:11:08,410  -->  00:11:09,920
All right let's wait for it

191

00:11:09,910  -->  00:11:15,880
.

192

00:11:15,880  -->  00:11:16,570
There we go.

193

00:11:16,750  -->  00:11:19,950
So let's do CMOS daddy the answer.

194

00:11:20,120  -->  00:11:21,940
And as you can see it's working.

195

00:11:21,950  -->  00:11:26,480
Now let's real quick create a new project just to make sure that this works OK.

196

00:11:26,500  -->  00:11:29,820
We don't want it to to be playing games with us.

197

00:11:29,990  -->  00:11:31,720
There's a local holes real quick.

198

00:11:31,730  -->  00:11:34,200
OK local's is working as well.

199

00:11:34,240  -->  00:11:35,130
All right.

200

00:11:35,450  -->  00:11:38,670
Let's do one more so let's go to terminal.

201

00:11:38,820  -->  00:11:41,960
All right and let's go to see the let's go to our

202

00:11:45,510  -->  00:11:46,960
HD docs right.

203

00:11:47,120  -->  00:11:52,610
So Zahm remember with tab you can auto complete it.

204

00:11:52,850  -->  00:11:58,760
So the docs see a mass actually right here and actually does that's what we want to be.

205

00:11:58,750  -->  00:12:10,780
And then we're going to say composer create project Laro Vale which is a name and the name of the vendor

206

00:12:10,780  -->  00:12:12,770
and the name of that package right.

207

00:12:12,980  -->  00:12:16,340
Because you can download different applications with composer.

208

00:12:16,340  -->  00:12:24,890
Now we want to name it something like I don't know to do app.

209

00:12:24,880  -->  00:12:25,740
All right.

210

00:12:26,020  -->  00:12:34,850
And then I use of are going to use 5.2 but you can use if you do the professor remember that I would

211

00:12:34,850  -->  00:12:38,050
download the latest.

212

00:12:38,130  -->  00:12:42,070
All right the latest Clarabell version.

213

00:12:42,080  -->  00:12:44,240
All right 5.2.

214

00:12:44,450  -->  00:12:49,610
That's where I'm going to do right here Antar.

215

00:12:50,430  -->  00:12:51,710
Now we've got a way for that.

216

00:12:51,710  -->  00:12:55,140
All right.

217

00:12:55,150  -->  00:12:56,310
Beautiful.

218

00:12:56,570  -->  00:13:01,720
So I hope you can see how easy this is I going to pause the video because this is going to take a little

219

00:13:01,730  -->  00:13:06,170
bit of time and I'll come back in a couple of seconds for you is going to be like one second.

220

00:13:06,170  -->  00:13:06,860
All right.

221

00:13:06,860  -->  00:13:09,670
So hold on tight.

222

00:13:09,670  -->  00:13:11,430
All right looks like he's done with mine.

223

00:13:11,430  -->  00:13:14,940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back.

224

00:13:14,960  -->  00:13:24,430
All right let's go and press our up arrow key and we edit our V h the TPD the horse.

225

00:13:24,430  -->  00:13:29,930
We also have to edit our host files so let's edit our host files first so sort of nano for was last

226

00:13:30,430  -->  00:13:36,430
E.T. see and then we let me just clear it for a minute so you can see the commands

227

00:13:38,920  -->  00:13:39,790
right there.

228

00:13:40,180  -->  00:13:43,100
Let's press our error up arrow key.

229

00:13:43,780  -->  00:13:45,810
Let's go to this one.

230

00:13:46,310  -->  00:13:48,290
Let's put a password.

231

00:13:48,320  -->  00:13:50,370
This is our computer password by the way.

232

00:13:50,530  -->  00:13:53,340
I have a password so that's why I have to type it in all the time.

233

00:13:53,410  -->  00:13:57,190
If it's a special file so I'm going to the one to seven.

234

00:13:57,220  -->  00:13:58,170
OK.

235

00:13:58,580  -->  00:14:00,110
And then whatever name I want.

236

00:14:00,110  -->  00:14:04,000
So I wanted to use to do web dot dev.

237

00:14:04,000  -->  00:14:04,880
All right.

238

00:14:05,310  -->  00:14:09,780
Then control x and y for yes and enter.

239

00:14:09,780  -->  00:14:10,090
All right.

240

00:14:10,120  -->  00:14:13,790
So the next one is going to press the up arrow key again my keyboard.

241

00:14:14,060  -->  00:14:19,000
And then I go to the videos file enter.

242

00:14:19,040  -->  00:14:20,920
Now let's go all the way to the bottom.

243

00:14:20,990  -->  00:14:23,810
I'm going to copy one of these guys.

244

00:14:24,310  -->  00:14:29,600
OK and you can put comments on these guys so just in case you don't get confused I'm going to command

245

00:14:29,670  -->  00:14:33,290
V it. so I'm going to basically paste it here.

246

00:14:33,350  -->  00:14:34,430
You can do something like this.

247

00:14:34,430  -->  00:14:40,270
All right so you don't get loss hash symbol and then you can put the name on your side whatever that

248

00:14:40,950  -->  00:14:41,170
is.

249

00:14:41,160  -->  00:14:44,570
So I'm going to say to do app.

250

00:14:44,740  -->  00:14:51,540
All right and this one is a C See mess.

251

00:14:51,760  -->  00:14:52,250
Def

252

00:15:00,160  -->  00:15:08,010
So we're going to do for this Wongs changed this for a year to name to do to be named in this one here

253

00:15:08,130  -->  00:15:08,250
.

254

00:15:08,270  -->  00:15:08,600
Do

255

00:15:11,780  -->  00:15:15,060
you also want to make sure that you have a folder with you.

256

00:15:15,240  -->  00:15:16,440
All right.

257

00:15:16,620  -->  00:15:21,900
Because many times I tell you that I have done this and I've been going crazy.

258

00:15:21,890  -->  00:15:26,020
Next thing you know I never created a project for some reason he failed.

259

00:15:26,250  -->  00:15:26,900
All right.

260

00:15:27,140  -->  00:15:31,880
So go to the dogs and make sure you have that for them there.

261

00:15:32,420  -->  00:15:33,330
All right.

262

00:15:33,730  -->  00:15:38,190
Anyway let's do control it's an wife.

263

00:15:38,220  -->  00:15:38,620
Yes.

264

00:15:38,620  -->  00:15:43,710
And then for now we have to restart zap again.

265

00:15:43,710  -->  00:15:44,200
All right.

266

00:15:44,250  -->  00:15:48,080
So I'm going to restart it.

267

00:15:50,580  -->  00:15:54,450
And then all we have to do after that is just try it out to see if it works ok.

268

00:15:54,600  -->  00:15:55,640
It should work fine.

269

00:15:55,640  -->  00:16:01,830
And other than that we've got to do some time to test that to make sure that it's working is that we

270

00:16:01,830  -->  00:16:08,540
have to go inside the project with our editor and make some type of edit to our home page so that way

271

00:16:08,540  -->  00:16:15,620
we know that it is working 100 percent because sometimes we redirect to Claribel 5 with every single

272

00:16:15,620  -->  00:16:20,850
domain name and you would not know if he's working on unless you make a change or one of them.

273

00:16:20,930  -->  00:16:28,050
All right so now it looks like he's working to do app that the enter and you see this.

274

00:16:28,130  -->  00:16:30,340
Now it's now working and let me tell you why.

275

00:16:30,360  -->  00:16:34,290
Because we're using the zap environment we have to give it permission.

276

00:16:34,280  -->  00:16:36,630
Remember the watcher you don't remember.

277

00:16:37,080  -->  00:16:37,700
Maybe you do.

278

00:16:37,710  -->  00:16:39,750
Actually we did it on this Mac installation.

279

00:16:39,750  -->  00:16:47,320
We gave it permission so we have to give to the owner of this server permission to write to the Zap

280

00:16:47,330  -->  00:16:47,400
.

281

00:16:47,390  -->  00:16:48,170
Right.

282

00:16:48,170  -->  00:16:49,500
So let's do that.

283

00:16:49,520  -->  00:16:55,280
So I'm going to go to my age detoxing and my command line that's where I am and I'm going to type in

284

00:16:55,280  -->  00:16:55,890
this command.

285

00:16:55,880  -->  00:16:59,840
If you remember them very simple let's do it.

286

00:17:00,060  -->  00:17:03,770
So let's do c h m all D.

287

00:17:04,010  -->  00:17:04,810
All right.

288

00:17:05,040  -->  00:17:12,910
Then we're going to do this recursively so we put the flag are all plus W. which means right.

289

00:17:13,130  -->  00:17:19,800
And then the application name which is to do app for Slash storage.

290

00:17:19,810  -->  00:17:22,040
All right answer.

291

00:17:22,120  -->  00:17:28,250
And now we go back to it.

292

00:17:28,350  -->  00:17:29,090
There we go.

293

00:17:29,100  -->  00:17:29,970
Now it works.

294

00:17:29,960  -->  00:17:30,840
All right.

295

00:17:30,890  -->  00:17:32,780
So beautiful.

296

00:17:32,790  -->  00:17:41,820
All right before I go I just want to say that if for some reason you have a problem you have a internal

297

00:17:41,820  -->  00:17:46,720
arrow 500 or four or four page or access Forbin.

298

00:17:46,880  -->  00:17:52,890
Something's gone gone wrong in our patch is now recognizing your requests.

299

00:17:52,880  -->  00:17:53,300
All right.

300

00:17:53,310  -->  00:17:58,440
I'm going to recommend to do something right now so that what you have you don't have any problems with

301

00:17:58,430  -->  00:18:05,600
permissions we most of these problems that you that you could have where your application is because

302

00:18:05,610  -->  00:18:11,730
of Apache now recognizing the user not having permissions to write to the files right.

303

00:18:11,900  -->  00:18:16,370
So your application does not have permission to write it to the files only certain people can do it

304

00:18:16,970  -->  00:18:18,100
and certain users.

305

00:18:18,120  -->  00:18:19,620
So that's why you might have a problem.

306

00:18:19,620  -->  00:18:23,900
So for that I'm going to recommend this.

307

00:18:23,900  -->  00:18:28,510
I want you to go to let me see if I have it right here.

308

00:18:28,560  -->  00:18:31,910
Your applications and folders and files etc..

309

00:18:32,010  -->  00:18:33,910
H.T. TPD dot com.

310

00:18:33,910  -->  00:18:37,080
That's a file you're going to edit enter.

311

00:18:37,220  -->  00:18:42,640
Make sure that you do Suro then OK to be an administrator a super user.

312

00:18:42,680  -->  00:18:44,860
Let's go all the way down.

313

00:18:44,880  -->  00:18:51,030
I'm going to scroll this file all the way down to where we can see the user right here you see right

314

00:18:51,030  -->  00:18:52,870
here says user daemon.

315

00:18:53,180  -->  00:18:56,270
All right that is the default user right.

316

00:18:56,360  -->  00:18:57,440
That's zem ports there.

317

00:18:57,440  -->  00:19:02,100
So that way this is a user that is allowed to do certain things in the server.

318

00:19:02,100  -->  00:19:02,730
Right.

319

00:19:02,760  -->  00:19:03,870
What are we going to change that.

320

00:19:03,890  -->  00:19:09,000
I'm going to put a hash there because I want to keep it just in case for future reference but I'm going

321

00:19:08,990  -->  00:19:14,960
to say I'm going to put it all in uppercase user and then the user that I'm using right now on this

322

00:19:14,960  -->  00:19:21,320
computer on this desktop I'm using coding faculty right here for this.

323

00:19:21,440  -->  00:19:24,380
This user's computer is called coding faculty.

324

00:19:24,380  -->  00:19:26,790
This is the guy or me right.

325

00:19:26,900  -->  00:19:28,870
There's going to be creating the application right.

326

00:19:28,880  -->  00:19:36,000
But now we get to basically give you access to right to files right and reef files and all really cool

327

00:19:35,990  -->  00:19:37,270
stuff in the server right.

328

00:19:37,400  -->  00:19:43,270
So coding faculty is going to be my user command x and y for saving enter.

329

00:19:43,330  -->  00:19:44,060
All right.

330

00:19:44,280  -->  00:19:48,990
Now the next thing is starting Apache restarting it.

331

00:19:49,190  -->  00:19:54,000
So I'm going to restart it right here.

332

00:19:54,620  -->  00:19:58,340
And as a matter of fact stop or I'm going to restart or.

333

00:19:58,340  -->  00:20:00,520
OK.

334

00:20:00,600  -->  00:20:01,550
All right.

335

00:20:01,640  -->  00:20:07,400
Once you do that let's go back real quick and let's just see if we don't have to give it permission

336

00:20:07,400  -->  00:20:14,090
like we used to do like you know the problem that we had when we had to give a permission to that specific

337

00:20:14,100  -->  00:20:18,170
for the let's create a new installation and check that out before we leave.

338

00:20:18,170  -->  00:20:18,790
OK.

339

00:20:18,870  -->  00:20:23,640
So let's go to zap.

340

00:20:23,720  -->  00:20:32,210
Actually applications zap and HD docs and writing actually docs let's create a new level of approach

341

00:20:32,240  -->  00:20:35,340
your real quick composer create

342

00:20:39,090  -->  00:20:52,950
project Clarabelle Clarabelle and we can call this this new application we can call it a we have to

343

00:20:52,940  -->  00:20:53,490
do that.

344

00:20:53,510  -->  00:21:02,300
We have a CMOS let's make it a crazy app just to give an example hereright crazy app and we're going

345

00:21:02,310  -->  00:21:05,110
to do use 5.2 steel here.

346

00:21:05,150  -->  00:21:08,780
And when I do prefer distro distribution.

347

00:21:09,350  -->  00:21:09,850
OK

348

00:21:11,240  -->  00:21:14,270
.

349

00:21:16,320  -->  00:21:18,940
Application just finished I just post a video real quick.

350

00:21:18,990  -->  00:21:29,480
So now let's go to to see the file to see if it is working without doing the the holes.

351

00:21:29,490  -->  00:21:30,060
All right.

352

00:21:30,260  -->  00:21:36,780
So let's go Lokos Ray localhost and is call crazy.

353

00:21:36,810  -->  00:21:41,260
So I have it right here enter in as you can see works and we don't have to give no more permissions

354

00:21:41,260  -->  00:21:44,120
so since we already have that permission.

355

00:21:44,260  -->  00:21:45,740
I'm good with it.

356

00:21:45,780  -->  00:21:46,650
OK.

357

00:21:46,660  -->  00:21:53,510
So if you do this this way if you give from the beginning you do this this way you're good to go I just

358

00:21:53,510  -->  00:21:55,610
wanted to show you both ways of doing it.

359

00:21:55,860  -->  00:21:56,570
All right.

360

00:21:56,760  -->  00:22:01,100
So that way you can defend yourself when you have a problem in another scenario OK.

361

00:22:01,290  -->  00:22:03,620
But anyway as you can see we're able to do it like this.

362

00:22:03,620  -->  00:22:05,760
And you know we can delete that of course.

363

00:22:05,760  -->  00:22:08,560
I'm going to go back in the lead that crazy app.

364

00:22:08,790  -->  00:22:09,690
Let's just check it.

365

00:22:09,710  -->  00:22:10,480
Let's just say.

366

00:22:10,490  -->  00:22:13,310
Or am I friend or F..

367

00:22:13,350  -->  00:22:16,240
And then crazy because I'm going to remove it.

368

00:22:16,910  -->  00:22:22,170
All right so now you know how to do it the hard way and the easy way.

369

00:22:22,170  -->  00:22:27,940
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
