00:00:00,270  -->  00:00:02,010
All right welcome back my sister.

2

00:00:02,010  -->  00:00:08,470
And so let's make sure that we are we've flushed down or sessions or right.

3

00:00:08,480  -->  00:00:15,180
Nothing there or is empty because what we're going to be learning here in this lecture is how to flash

4

00:00:15,180  -->  00:00:17,520
data now while we're flushing data eyes.

5

00:00:17,540  -->  00:00:19,300
They're very similar to sessions.

6

00:00:19,350  -->  00:00:24,720
The only difference is that flashy flashing data will only stay for one requests.

7

00:00:24,810  -->  00:00:31,080
So when you flush data if you have any experience on other frameworks I usually is when you create let's

8

00:00:31,080  -->  00:00:35,430
say some type of record in the database and you want to provide the user with some feedback on the form

9

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:35,940
right.

10

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:38,700
You want to display your post has been created.

11

00:00:38,970  -->  00:00:42,480
That's when you use Flash data and show you how to use it right now.

12

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:47,480
So we're going to access their requests and that is the method.

13

00:00:47,490  -->  00:00:53,610
And then we're going to change flash meant that here the first parameter is going to be why the key

14

00:00:53,610  -->  00:00:55,640
would be in that session.

15

00:00:55,650  -->  00:01:00,590
And the second is the message or whatever you want to type in for the value.

16

00:01:00,780  -->  00:01:08,420
So I'm going to say polls has been created or something like that.

17

00:01:08,430  -->  00:01:10,960
All right.

18

00:01:11,700  -->  00:01:17,080
So remember this is only going to be available for one requests or a very short period of time.

19

00:01:17,100  -->  00:01:25,020
I'm going to return session get message

20

00:01:28,890  -->  00:01:30,140
ready.

21

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:31,500
So

22

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:35,480
let's do it one time.

23

00:01:35,760  -->  00:01:36,810
Oops.

24

00:01:37,060  -->  00:01:38,340
We're out there.

25

00:01:38,340  -->  00:01:39,800
Let's look at it again.

26

00:01:40,260  -->  00:01:40,890
There we go.

27

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:42,210
Post has been created.

28

00:01:42,390  -->  00:01:43,160
All right.

29

00:01:43,410  -->  00:01:49,850
So now I'm going to do is I'm going to comment this out.

30

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:56,350
And now if it was a session you would still have that when you try to display it.

31

00:01:56,540  -->  00:02:04,170
But because this is a flash you can see that he's gone or I saw the second request you saw that he was

32

00:02:04,170  -->  00:02:05,310
gone.

33

00:02:05,400  -->  00:02:06,460
It's not there anymore.

34

00:02:06,510  -->  00:02:08,390
That's what Flash data is.

35

00:02:08,550  -->  00:02:09,630
All right.

36

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:13,890
So guys you're done.

37

00:02:13,890  -->  00:02:15,310
We're done with sessions.

38

00:02:15,330  -->  00:02:19,380
You know how did this play Flash data super easy to do.

39

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:23,780
You know how to play how to recreate sessions.

40

00:02:23,790  -->  00:02:29,850
I mean you know now let me show you a couple of more things about flash the night before we leave.

41

00:02:29,850  -->  00:02:30,500
OK.

42

00:02:30,990  -->  00:02:37,770
So let's say for example you want to keep the data around a little bit more or you have to do is use

43

00:02:37,770  -->  00:02:38,550
another method.

44

00:02:38,670  -->  00:02:41,450
And they have this into the station guys.

45

00:02:41,460  -->  00:02:42,650
All right.

46

00:02:43,380  -->  00:02:50,940
So you can say reflash and this will actually keep your data a little longer.

47

00:02:50,940  -->  00:02:56,350
We also have another Mentha that we can keep a specific type of data if you want to.

48

00:02:56,790  -->  00:03:00,770
So you can say session and this one.

49

00:03:00,780  -->  00:03:03,460
INSKEEP All right.

50

00:03:03,540  -->  00:03:09,270
And if you wanted to keep that same message you keep the message right here.

51

00:03:09,600  -->  00:03:11,040
All right.

52

00:03:12,120  -->  00:03:14,730
And then delete everything else Ray.

53

00:03:15,720  -->  00:03:21,100
So if you wanted to keep this flash data around just use the keep.

54

00:03:21,150  -->  00:03:23,700
But anyway this is all into the communication guys.

55

00:03:23,790  -->  00:03:29,340
If you wanna go back I'm going to give you the links but at the end of the sections like always but

56

00:03:29,370  -->  00:03:34,770
always go back check with the community and practice play around with it and see what your specific

57

00:03:34,770  -->  00:03:38,280
application needs and start you know applying it.

58

00:03:38,310  -->  00:03:39,600
That's the only way to learn.

59

00:03:39,840  -->  00:03:41,590
Thank you so much for watching guys.

60

00:03:41,610  -->  00:03:45,630
Being a pleasure and I see you on the net lectures or section
