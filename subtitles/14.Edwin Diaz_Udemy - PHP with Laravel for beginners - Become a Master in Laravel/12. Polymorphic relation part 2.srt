1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,860
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,870  -->  00:00:08,040
My students saw the last lecture we have migrated there and created a forest table where along with

3

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:14,970
the model now we still need a little bit we're a little bit more work to our migrations because impose

4

00:00:15,810  -->  00:00:18,540
We have the user id which we don't want anymore.

5

00:00:18,540  -->  00:00:19,220
All right.

6

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:24,360
We don't need a user ID here in polls because we are going to be using polymorphic relations so I'm

7

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:32,140
going to comment this out I'm going to roll back on my migration or do migration refresh.

8

00:00:33,130  -->  00:00:36,870
OK I'm going to be putting some data there you won't see me because I'm going to post the video.

9

00:00:36,870  -->  00:00:39,180
I want you to see me writing all that data.

10

00:00:39,190  -->  00:00:39,640
All right.

11

00:00:39,660  -->  00:00:45,630
But just to give an idea I'm going to be putting And I want you to do the same thing.

12

00:00:45,660  -->  00:00:46,300
All right.

13

00:00:46,590  -->  00:00:48,510
Let's go to Claribel CMOS.

14

00:00:48,510  -->  00:00:50,300
I'm going to be putting a forward path.

15

00:00:50,460  -->  00:00:56,100
This one Ali for last because I want you to see me doing it but I'm going to insert one or two pulls

16

00:00:56,110  -->  00:00:56,350
.

17

00:00:56,560  -->  00:00:58,480
I'm going to do some roles.

18

00:00:58,710  -->  00:01:02,480
I'm going to do a roll user and the user and one or two users.

19

00:01:02,550  -->  00:01:08,100
All right so if you want to go ahead and answer that data you can and I'll see you in one second.

20

00:01:08,560  -->  00:01:17,830
So I just finished inputting some information I put a country's D.R. in PR and I also placed to posts

21

00:01:19,230  -->  00:01:22,060
some roles I did.

22

00:01:22,120  -->  00:01:30,150
I related this user id. one we wrote like the one which is the administrator and that to the user number

23

00:01:30,150  -->  00:01:38,070
two with the role ID number two which is a subscriber as you can see we've got tools users here.

24

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:38,620
OK.

25

00:01:38,790  -->  00:01:41,290
So I just put some information on your photos.

26

00:01:41,370  -->  00:01:42,600
I wanted to do it with you.

27

00:01:42,600  -->  00:01:48,840
So I'm going to put the first photo that I'm going to relay is going to be my picture right.

28

00:01:49,340  -->  00:01:50,440
G g.

29

00:01:50,600  -->  00:01:51,570
G.

30

00:01:51,960  -->  00:01:58,800
The image ID is going to be the user ID for that specific photo rife with our table users.

31

00:01:58,800  -->  00:02:07,290
So is number one we know that and the image type is the address the name space the model right there

32

00:02:07,290  -->  00:02:07,570
.

33

00:02:07,610  -->  00:02:09,080
All right.

34

00:02:09,660  -->  00:02:16,900
For this one it's going to be a poll so I'm going to say something like a match or I don't know the

35

00:02:17,820  -->  00:02:18,810
Laro.

36

00:02:19,270  -->  00:02:27,250
Bill GBG and the image IDS is going to be number two.

37

00:02:28,050  -->  00:02:37,680
I mean the actually could be number one in NBA in a totally different area and image type is going to

38

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:44,130
be app post Reiser's going to be polls with ID of one.

39

00:02:44,310  -->  00:02:45,250
Right.

40

00:02:45,540  -->  00:02:47,360
Cool.

41

00:02:47,370  -->  00:02:48,160
All right.

42

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:49,950
So now we have some data here.

43

00:02:49,950  -->  00:02:57,000
And one thing that we need to do is that we need to double check that the user doesn't have a user ID

44

00:02:57,000  -->  00:02:57,780
field here.

45

00:02:57,810  -->  00:03:01,370
The polls no user ID.

46

00:03:01,370  -->  00:03:03,250
All right cool.

47

00:03:03,270  -->  00:03:08,640
All right so now that we have this we need to set the relationship right the polymorphic relationships

48

00:03:08,640  -->  00:03:08,970
.

49

00:03:09,120  -->  00:03:13,870
Let's look at the model real quick and I'm pretty sure we haven't done that yet.

50

00:03:14,070  -->  00:03:17,530
So for there we go.

51

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:18,820
All right.

52

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:21,190
So public function.

53

00:03:21,480  -->  00:03:27,480
And this is going to be called Image able I'm following combines conventions from the documentation

54

00:03:27,790  -->  00:03:34,470
in the allowable dot com Web site which I will always give you some type of the link at the end of each

55

00:03:34,470  -->  00:03:40,020
section of lecture's so that where you can refer back to the documentation and find some more information

56

00:03:40,020  -->  00:03:41,120
about them all right.

57

00:03:41,460  -->  00:03:42,870
All right cool.

58

00:03:42,870  -->  00:03:52,310
So this one here we're going to do this return this morph too.

59

00:03:53,280  -->  00:03:54,140
All right.

60

00:03:54,630  -->  00:04:01,770
So that's the first one now we've got to set the other tables because this is the main table now for

61

00:04:01,770  -->  00:04:09,260
this if we want photos out of you we need to create a method called photos right public function forwarders

62

00:04:09,300  -->  00:04:12,950
and you can name this whatever you want.

63

00:04:12,960  -->  00:04:20,830
So when I pull out the photo from here so I'm going to say return this more if

64

00:04:26,070  -->  00:04:28,620
I'm trying to remember more many.

65

00:04:29,070  -->  00:04:30,290
This is fine.

66

00:04:31,020  -->  00:04:40,110
And then here we are to morph what the photo and then

67

00:04:42,850  -->  00:04:43,800
image

68

00:04:47,290  -->  00:04:50,100
a match table there we go.

69

00:04:50,540  -->  00:04:52,520
OK cool.

70

00:04:52,510  -->  00:04:53,800
All right.

71

00:04:54,190  -->  00:04:57,250
And now we could do the same thing to the press.

72

00:04:57,390  -->  00:05:01,640
So they use a stable model right there to the user model.

73

00:05:01,910  -->  00:05:04,050
Beautiful.

74

00:05:04,060  -->  00:05:05,120
All right.

75

00:05:05,140  -->  00:05:07,770
I actually already had it there.

76

00:05:07,790  -->  00:05:11,360
Sorry about that guys right here.

77

00:05:11,360  -->  00:05:12,090
All right.

78

00:05:12,470  -->  00:05:18,920
I was doing a lecture and I had some issues with my computer and I had to redo the lecture so that's

79

00:05:18,920  -->  00:05:19,910
why I was there.

80

00:05:20,250  -->  00:05:20,770
OK.

81

00:05:20,990  -->  00:05:25,820
But anyway so that's there what else we need.

82

00:05:25,910  -->  00:05:26,590
That's about it.

83

00:05:26,600  -->  00:05:36,220
Now we can start pulling out information from this model so let's go back to the routes and let's create

84

00:05:36,230  -->  00:05:44,300
a little comment here and we're going to say let's see if we can spell it correctly polymorphic relations

85

00:05:44,300  -->  00:05:45,920
.

86

00:05:45,960  -->  00:05:49,810
There we go I think we spell it correct it was spelled correctly.

87

00:05:49,910  -->  00:05:58,470
Let's pulao a photo and let's see let's pull our users for the array.

88

00:05:59,000  -->  00:06:02,260
So let's first grab the user.

89

00:06:02,420  -->  00:06:06,660
So user find user number one.

90

00:06:06,790  -->  00:06:07,920
OK.

91

00:06:08,190  -->  00:06:15,980
And now we're going to going create a for each loop and we're going to pull that out real quick.

92

00:06:16,510  -->  00:06:19,990
Let's indent our cold a little bit.

93

00:06:20,000  -->  00:06:22,230
All right.

94

00:06:23,540  -->  00:06:29,770
So now we do this user very similar to what we did before with other relationships.

95

00:06:29,890  -->  00:06:37,160
The only thing that changes in most of these relationship is the way we were going to model and link

96

00:06:37,160  -->  00:06:40,620
them and create them all right this thing.

97

00:06:40,670  -->  00:06:41,800
This is what changes here.

98

00:06:41,810  -->  00:06:43,970
This meant that depending on the method.

99

00:06:44,490  -->  00:06:45,150
OK.

100

00:06:45,340  -->  00:06:51,380
We we have a different relationship but here most of the time we're going to always point them out like

101

00:06:51,380  -->  00:06:54,590
this with dynamic properties.

102

00:06:54,610  -->  00:06:54,920
Right.

103

00:06:54,920  -->  00:07:02,370
This would be the Med this name so user photos as forward on.

104

00:07:03,200  -->  00:07:04,800
OK.

105

00:07:05,750  -->  00:07:14,160
Now here you can just see this return photo array.

106

00:07:14,930  -->  00:07:21,100
And let's go and create a row for this.

107

00:07:21,110  -->  00:07:21,530
All right.

108

00:07:21,560  -->  00:07:23,090
Because we don't even have a route for it.

109

00:07:23,210  -->  00:07:26,840
So let's just make sure we have a route for you guys.

110

00:07:28,190  -->  00:07:32,160
And I told you a couple of years ago that I was going to get to go and get a rest.

111

00:07:32,210  -->  00:07:37,080
I did not just in case some of you are wondering.

112

00:07:37,170  -->  00:07:45,930
So user photos function beautiful.

113

00:07:46,060  -->  00:07:47,380
There we go.

114

00:07:47,920  -->  00:07:51,690
Let's just take that out and pasted in here.

115

00:07:51,830  -->  00:07:57,800
That's why my code was in Denton before because the HP story is really smart when it comes to indenting

116

00:07:57,800  -->  00:07:57,850
.

117

00:07:57,850  -->  00:08:02,000
So if it doesn't find the right code it won't indent it correctly.

118

00:08:02,000  -->  00:08:03,010
OK.

119

00:08:03,310  -->  00:08:06,290
So beautiful.

120

00:08:06,620  -->  00:08:08,930
Let's go and do this now in the browser.

121

00:08:08,960  -->  00:08:16,550
So see a mess and let me just bring that here user

122

00:08:19,630  -->  00:08:23,600
forums.

123

00:08:23,650  -->  00:08:25,110
There we go.

124

00:08:25,120  -->  00:08:26,440
Beautiful right.

125

00:08:26,690  -->  00:08:28,730
So we found the user's photo there.

126

00:08:28,780  -->  00:08:33,890
And when J.P. G and phone dies you can pull out the path of the image.

127

00:08:33,880  -->  00:08:36,490
All right so you know how to do that right.

128

00:08:36,590  -->  00:08:40,370
I mean I don't have to tell you that's super simple to do.

129

00:08:40,370  -->  00:08:43,370
You have to do is do this Ray.

130

00:08:43,630  -->  00:08:51,970
And we can follow the path that they look at that and there is where you would display the image of

131

00:08:51,980  -->  00:08:53,480
that of the user.

132

00:08:53,480  -->  00:08:58,310
Now the user has had multiple images you will display multiple images here.

133

00:08:58,660  -->  00:08:58,940
OK.

134

00:08:58,930  -->  00:09:00,180
That's what's cool about it.

135

00:09:00,250  -->  00:09:09,260
Not only that but you can also all right now pulao users the pose images as well.

136

00:09:09,400  -->  00:09:14,980
So we can say polls photos and we find the first polls.

137

00:09:15,570  -->  00:09:20,260
And let's just call these polls here.

138

00:09:20,330  -->  00:09:24,360
We're going to change this whole thing.

139

00:09:24,410  -->  00:09:27,890
We'll find the force first polls.

140

00:09:27,880  -->  00:09:30,870
And there we go.

141

00:09:31,420  -->  00:09:40,100
So now we go back here and we just changed this piece for a you know safe post.

142

00:09:40,100  -->  00:09:42,000
Now we got the post photos.

143

00:09:42,050  -->  00:09:43,250
You see that.

144

00:09:43,250  -->  00:09:45,080
That's beautiful isn't it.

145

00:09:45,080  -->  00:09:53,770
Now let's go back and add another picture to polls for example.

146

00:09:54,190  -->  00:10:02,920
So I'm going to insert a different photo for the post dodgy Biji image ID

147

00:10:07,100  -->  00:10:08,760
for the post number one.

148

00:10:09,430  -->  00:10:11,990
And they have the names.

149

00:10:12,010  -->  00:10:17,700
They would be that would be the model right there post.

150

00:10:18,090  -->  00:10:19,330
All right.

151

00:10:19,380  -->  00:10:19,940
Antar.

152

00:10:19,970  -->  00:10:24,220
Remember that we are making an image for this post right here.

153

00:10:24,290  -->  00:10:24,820
All right.

154

00:10:24,910  -->  00:10:27,740
So now if I refresh this well

155

00:10:31,930  -->  00:10:34,800
where is the photo right here.

156

00:10:35,380  -->  00:10:36,430
OK.

157

00:10:36,940  -->  00:10:44,300
Now if I come back instead of returning we do the echo because remember that return only returns one

158

00:10:44,300  -->  00:10:45,100
value.

159

00:10:45,190  -->  00:10:52,030
So we have to echo it and make sure that you would abrade tagging here so that way you can have a second

160

00:10:52,040  -->  00:10:54,150
line and see this in a very nice way.

161

00:10:54,430  -->  00:11:01,120
Enter And as you can see this post has two pictures.

162

00:11:01,250  -->  00:11:09,950
And of course you can customize this and do it like we did before like this and

163

00:11:12,690  -->  00:11:15,090
that and instead of the ridges.

164

00:11:15,640  -->  00:11:16,510
OK.

165

00:11:17,130  -->  00:11:17,700
So

166

00:11:23,750  -->  00:11:32,980
now we can just say oops for pulls one on one other of the photos and for post to.

167

00:11:33,030  -->  00:11:38,540
I want the photos for us to have no photo so we don't get any photos there and we could put a condition

168

00:11:38,540  -->  00:11:42,650
there a photo a post number two those doesn't have any photos just say.

169

00:11:42,740  -->  00:11:44,450
This post has no photos.

170

00:11:44,480  -->  00:11:45,380
You see what I mean.

171

00:11:45,430  -->  00:11:48,710
And we can do that very easily with eloquent as well.

172

00:11:48,700  -->  00:11:53,420
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture guys and it's been a pleasure showing you how

173

00:11:53,410  -->  00:11:54,970
to know how to make this happen.

174

00:11:54,990  -->  00:11:59,420
And I'll see you in the next lectures which you are going to enjoy as much as I enjoyed teaching them

175

00:11:59,420  -->  00:12:00,210
.

176

00:12:00,470  -->  00:12:01,750
See you.

177

00:12:01,750  -->  00:12:02,700
Bye bye.
