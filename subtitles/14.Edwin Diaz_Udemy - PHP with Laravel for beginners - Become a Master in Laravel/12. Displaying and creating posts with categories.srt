00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,230
All right welcome back my student.

2

00:00:02,280  -->  00:00:11,150
So on this lecture what we've got to do is we are going to be displaying the categories right here in

3

00:00:11,180  -->  00:00:20,100
the category names and we are also going to create the pull out the data pulao the categories from the

4

00:00:20,100  -->  00:00:22,550
database and put them here and put them here.

5

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:24,950
All right let's try to do that.

6

00:00:25,380  -->  00:00:25,850
All right.

7

00:00:26,010  -->  00:00:34,280
So we are in post and it's right here as you can see and here was his category ID.

8

00:00:34,440  -->  00:00:43,980
I'm going to modify this and I'm going to say if you find any category I want you to play it the name

9

00:00:45,120  -->  00:00:51,800
if you don't I want you to display something like categorize it.

10

00:00:51,800  -->  00:00:57,840
I think I'm spelling that correctly but it's actually telling me that it doesn't exist.

11

00:00:57,930  -->  00:01:00,710
Is this now a very good ph B storm.

12

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:04,740
I know categorize I exist.

13

00:01:04,740  -->  00:01:05,100
All right.

14

00:01:05,110  -->  00:01:11,460
So categorize as you can see and then with flame ph B because that's what this one has in mind are opposed

15

00:01:11,460  -->  00:01:11,580
.

16

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:12,930
All right cool.

17

00:01:12,930  -->  00:01:13,510
All right.

18

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:17,370
Let's go to admin post controller and and create

19

00:01:20,210  -->  00:01:22,910
an impulse control or create method.

20

00:01:22,920  -->  00:01:32,700
We are going to pass in the categories so we're going to say something like categories and we need the

21

00:01:32,700  -->  00:01:45,660
category model and the less we get a person the name and the ID makes sure that you you include your

22

00:01:45,660  -->  00:01:46,810
category on top.

23

00:01:46,830  -->  00:01:47,540
OK.

24

00:01:47,820  -->  00:01:50,220
Obviously I already did mine.

25

00:01:50,220  -->  00:01:53,000
But make sure that you import this right here.

26

00:01:53,580  -->  00:01:58,400
Your category make sure you have your photo you pulls all this in poultry imported.

27

00:01:58,410  -->  00:02:04,860
Now you're going to get an error OK but the error is easy rider error is very readable it's going to

28

00:02:04,860  -->  00:02:07,020
say the app category does not exist.

29

00:02:07,050  -->  00:02:12,110
The class category does not exist if it does not exist is because you're not including it.

30

00:02:12,120  -->  00:02:13,470
So make sure you include it.

31

00:02:13,920  -->  00:02:15,060
Let's use a compact

32

00:02:17,640  -->  00:02:18,390
function here.

33

00:02:18,390  -->  00:02:20,130
Very useful stuff.

34

00:02:20,460  -->  00:02:22,870
And this pass the categories.

35

00:02:23,530  -->  00:02:25,160
OK.

36

00:02:25,650  -->  00:02:30,900
All right let's go to our creative impulse and right here.

37

00:02:30,900  -->  00:02:33,630
This array we're going to change this a little bit.

38

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:35,990
We're going to make it a new type of array

39

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:44,020
right.

40

00:02:45,030  -->  00:02:56,950
Going to take this off here and we're just going to say choose categories and we we've going to concatenate

41

00:02:57,490  -->  00:03:01,370
the categories right here.

42

00:03:01,710  -->  00:03:03,290
Check it out.

43

00:03:04,500  -->  00:03:12,520
Create polls and we have supported open types.

44

00:03:12,520  -->  00:03:18,480
That means this is now working for some reason and that's because we forgot this little guy right here

45

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:18,500
.

46

00:03:18,510  -->  00:03:21,070
All Yep.

47

00:03:22,190  -->  00:03:28,690
See that if I don't get any arrows guys that will not show you much.

48

00:03:28,770  -->  00:03:30,980
But if I get errors it shows you how to fix it.

49

00:03:31,320  -->  00:03:33,090
As you can see we're pulling out all the categories.

50

00:03:33,090  -->  00:03:36,480
Beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful.

51

00:03:36,480  -->  00:03:41,470
Now let's let's choose another category here.

52

00:03:42,000  -->  00:03:44,330
Clarabell is the bomb

53

00:03:47,860  -->  00:03:49,300
right.

54

00:03:49,900  -->  00:03:51,310
I love Florida well

55

00:03:54,060  -->  00:04:00,750
and because it makes it easy for me

56

00:04:02,650  -->  00:04:04,810
.

57

00:04:06,060  -->  00:04:10,050
Leches to a placeholder there we are at the polls.

58

00:04:10,410  -->  00:04:16,200
And as you can see we have a new category there are our application is taking place.

59

00:04:16,200  -->  00:04:18,700
Guys is taking form.

60

00:04:18,870  -->  00:04:22,320
And as you can see things are just looking really good.

61

00:04:22,350  -->  00:04:24,660
All right thank you so much for watching this lecture.
