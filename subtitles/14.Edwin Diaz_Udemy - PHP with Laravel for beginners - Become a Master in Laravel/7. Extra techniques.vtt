00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.370
All right welcome back my students on this lecture and I'm going to show you a couple more little tricks

2

00:00:05.370  -->  00:00:11.740
here just in case you want to you know take our relationship off the polymorphic relationship.

3

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:15.750
Or you know just relate it in a different way.

4

00:00:15.750  -->  00:00:16.080
All right.

5

00:00:16.080  -->  00:00:18.470
So let's use Insert.

6

00:00:19.110  -->  00:00:21.850
We need a picture for the for this.

7

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:27.640
So let's just sort of picture a quick and we could use or create method I think that would do the trick

8

00:00:27.640  -->  00:00:27.690
.

9

00:00:27.690  -->  00:00:30.580
Listy create.

10

00:00:30.870  -->  00:00:31.860
All right cool.

11

00:00:31.860  -->  00:00:33.250
We have a picture.

12

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:38.340
OK let's do something with it.

13

00:00:38.340  -->  00:00:38.570
All right.

14

00:00:38.580  -->  00:00:40.680
Let's create a route real quick.

15

00:00:40.830  -->  00:00:47.300
And we're going to call this a signed sign like this hopefully I'm spelling it correctly.

16

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:53.640
Sign right.

17

00:00:53.940  -->  00:00:55.340
All right cool.

18

00:00:55.620  -->  00:01:02.850
So we're going to find this staff find or fail

19

00:01:07.770  -->  00:01:11.870
and we're going to find the photo as well.

20

00:01:12.480  -->  00:01:18.280
So let's do this though a different way of doing it.

21

00:01:18.630  -->  00:01:26.410
And for ideas number three so we can do or fail here too.

22

00:01:27.030  -->  00:01:33.680
Number three Why is this then we can grab the staff which is the main character here right.

23

00:01:33.930  -->  00:01:44.330
We can grab its relationship and we can say save and what are we saving the photo.

24

00:01:45.150  -->  00:01:48.210
Oh my God look at that.

25

00:01:48.510  -->  00:01:50.540
But now I want you to do this.

26

00:01:50.580  -->  00:01:56.920
We're not going to do anything here because we need another record to to to to show this demonstration

27

00:01:56.970  -->  00:01:57.410
.

28

00:01:57.880  -->  00:01:58.370
That's it sir.

29

00:01:58.400  -->  00:02:03.060
Now that we're real quick you're going to call this another dodge.

30

00:02:03.080  -->  00:02:08.680
B.G. if I can get it right that would be nice hopes.

31

00:02:08.850  -->  00:02:11.460
Whoops my bad.

32

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:12.640
All right.

33

00:02:13.230  -->  00:02:13.860
OK.

34

00:02:14.010  -->  00:02:14.960
There's nothing there.

35

00:02:14.960  -->  00:02:16.490
Let's see if it does anything.

36

00:02:16.860  -->  00:02:20.850
And let's just put this right here.

37

00:02:21.330  -->  00:02:22.200
So let's find.

38

00:02:22.200  -->  00:02:27.910
Number four actually do that.

39

00:02:27.990  -->  00:02:33.030
Let's come back here and sign enter.

40

00:02:33.390  -->  00:02:33.780
Whoops.

41

00:02:33.790  -->  00:02:35.110
It looks like it isn't.

42

00:02:35.220  -->  00:02:35.790
Watch this.

43

00:02:35.790  -->  00:02:39.890
This is all empty right refresh.

44

00:02:39.940  -->  00:02:49.110
And now as you can see we get updated at that staff the image type image able to type in the image I.D.

45

00:02:49.110  -->  00:02:50.480
everything is related.

46

00:02:50.770  -->  00:02:54.630
All right except this because we did not create that picture.

47

00:02:54.660  -->  00:02:57.510
All right we just updated it.

48

00:02:57.510  -->  00:02:59.370
All right cool.

49

00:02:59.460  -->  00:03:01.980
So what else can we do.

50

00:03:01.980  -->  00:03:03.340
Well you could.

51

00:03:03.340  -->  00:03:11.430
However if you want to create a custom method to attach photos if you know if it finds it on the cerned

52

00:03:11.660  -->  00:03:18.390
they say you create a function call or attach or method attach photos like this and you can pass this

53

00:03:18.390  -->  00:03:20.780
an array in whatever way you pass it.

54

00:03:20.860  -->  00:03:22.470
It will Tasha's for us to it.

55

00:03:22.500  -->  00:03:29.610
You can create a custom method to do that any sort of method and you would do this and say You model

56

00:03:29.610  -->  00:03:36.390
of course and whatever methods you know whatever you put inside this function and you say that you could

57

00:03:36.390  -->  00:03:45.250
put conditions saying OK if this idea is found within this model delete it and attached the new ones

58

00:03:45.250  -->  00:03:45.270
.

59

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:49.680
You know I mean you could I mean the possibilities are endless Clarabelle allowable just makes it a

60

00:03:49.680  -->  00:03:55.800
lot easier for us to create things like that or create really advanced functionalities.

61

00:03:55.800  -->  00:04:06.510
But anyway let's go now and let's just do a little something a little bit different here for a let's

62

00:04:06.510  -->  00:04:10.930
say on a site that's on the side one.

63

00:04:11.480  -->  00:04:16.170
And what you can do with a polymorphic relation and leave this like this.

64

00:04:16.170  -->  00:04:16.800
I think it's

65

00:04:20.280  -->  00:04:30.730
a sign here we what we can do here to want to sign is that and let's use.

66

00:04:30.810  -->  00:04:35.010
Copy this because I don't I don't feel like writing it right now since I already know how to write this

67

00:04:35.010  -->  00:04:36.880
stuff right.

68

00:04:37.260  -->  00:04:37.750
All right.

69

00:04:37.920  -->  00:04:45.600
Well we can do is we can you know give it a couple conditions here to the least said cerned feels too

70

00:04:45.600  -->  00:04:46.650
empty.

71

00:04:46.680  -->  00:04:56.100
So for example if one is on a sign this photo is number four we say where ID is where here where ID

72

00:04:56.100  -->  00:04:57.500
goes for.

73

00:04:58.050  -->  00:04:58.740
Right.

74

00:04:59.010  -->  00:05:03.700
Or we don't even I don't think we even need this for a year.

75

00:05:04.470  -->  00:05:04.770
I

76

00:05:07.860  -->  00:05:09.940
don't need that.

77

00:05:11.520  -->  00:05:11.790
OK.

78

00:05:11.810  -->  00:05:14.250
We're equals four in four rows.

79

00:05:14.340  -->  00:05:17.680
I want you to update the fields fields that we want to update.

80

00:05:17.700  -->  00:05:22.360
Well let's just pass an array here.

81

00:05:22.590  -->  00:05:27.540
I want to or they image able ID

82

00:05:30.420  -->  00:05:33.840
2 0 0 2 m delicious but empty.

83

00:05:33.930  -->  00:05:39.540
And then I want to update the image a will type

84

00:05:42.600  -->  00:05:44.720
to empty.

85

00:05:44.770  -->  00:05:45.410
All right.

86

00:05:45.690  -->  00:05:47.550
That's what we could do here.

87

00:05:48.300  -->  00:05:56.470
All right that's my alarm to go guys because I have an appointment with a Chinese restaurant right.

88

00:05:56.850  -->  00:05:59.330
All right so let's.

89

00:05:59.460  -->  00:06:01.490
It's happening here unassigned.

90

00:06:01.560  -->  00:06:06.790
Real quick on a sign enter.

91

00:06:07.110  -->  00:06:08.290
That's refreshing.

92

00:06:08.600  -->  00:06:16.230
And as you can see we've made everything 0 1 0 0 because this is an integer and this is not the here

93

00:06:16.230  -->  00:06:18.450
because it's a string.

94

00:06:18.460  -->  00:06:19.710
All right cool.

95

00:06:19.710  -->  00:06:26.520
And then you can also make this empty because you know you don't want to have a they are available if

96

00:06:26.520  -->  00:06:31.120
you just want to leave that picture along and have it available so you can sign the friend.

97

00:06:31.350  -->  00:06:35.590
You can send that picture to another staff member later on or something like that.

98

00:06:35.700  -->  00:06:36.090
OK.

99

00:06:36.180  -->  00:06:38.010
So I mean the possibilities are endless you guys.

100

00:06:38.010  -->  00:06:38.980
I mean there is.

101

00:06:39.050  -->  00:06:43.080
Just be creative when you're doing these things and you should be good.

102

00:06:43.140  -->  00:06:48.960
Anyway I think we're done for now and unless I get requests for some of the features and I'll see you

103

00:06:48.990  -->  00:06:51.640
in the next lectures.
