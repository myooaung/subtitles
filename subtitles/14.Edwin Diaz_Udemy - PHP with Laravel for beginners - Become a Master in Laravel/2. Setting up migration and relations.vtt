00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.640
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02.640  -->  00:00:05.350
So it's time for us to start setting up our migrations.

3

00:00:05.350  -->  00:00:05.930
All right.

4

00:00:05.940  -->  00:00:12.810
So what we're going to do is and we can actually do the relationship on this lecture so I'm going to

5

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:19.030
try to do this as well so I'm going to go back to see a mass application to your Larabee installation

6

00:00:19.710  -->  00:00:21.870
and I'm going to clear this out.

7

00:00:22.050  -->  00:00:26.310
The first thing that we've got to do is make sure that our migration is ready so what we're going to

8

00:00:26.310  -->  00:00:33.090
do is we're going to create a little small application where we can and we can as a matter of fact we're

9

00:00:33.090  -->  00:00:34.920
going to use this one already.

10

00:00:34.940  -->  00:00:43.740
The CMOS installation that we have done and we're going to create is create we can show we can edit

11

00:00:43.830  -->  00:00:48.000
or delete a post using forms right.

12

00:00:48.300  -->  00:00:51.400
So we need outpolls table ready.

13

00:00:51.420  -->  00:00:51.940
OK.

14

00:00:52.260  -->  00:00:54.140
So let's go to the post table.

15

00:00:54.150  -->  00:00:58.750
Make sure that you comment this since we were playing around with it.

16

00:00:58.910  -->  00:00:59.540
All right.

17

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:01.600
Uncle Mentha and they migrated.

18

00:01:01.610  -->  00:01:13.450
So BHP migrate not into migrate let's do BHP artists and migrate refresh.

19

00:01:14.310  -->  00:01:16.900
There we go and.

20

00:01:17.520  -->  00:01:19.970
And it just migrated all the tables again.

21

00:01:19.980  -->  00:01:22.590
But we have the posti was available right.

22

00:01:22.800  -->  00:01:28.590
So now we go to the user because we're going to see the user has what many posts and we already have

23

00:01:28.590  -->  00:01:30.090
the relationship already there.

24

00:01:30.150  -->  00:01:34.800
What I'm going to do is if I have another puls function take it away.

25

00:01:34.800  -->  00:01:36.170
No I don't have one.

26

00:01:36.180  -->  00:01:37.400
OK.

27

00:01:38.060  -->  00:01:41.140
I got to leave this this way like this here.

28

00:01:41.520  -->  00:01:47.880
But you if you want to clean it up you can and if you want to go ahead and lead the rest of this migration

29

00:01:47.890  -->  00:01:47.930
.

30

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:49.180
You're welcome to do it.

31

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:52.630
But I suggest to leave it there just for reference OK.

32

00:01:53.220  -->  00:01:53.510
All right.

33

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:54.120
Perfect.

34

00:01:54.120  -->  00:02:00.690
So we got the migration we got the relationship right here and on the next lecture we're going to continue

35

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:01.020
with this.

36

00:02:01.020  -->  00:02:01.370
All right.

37

00:02:01.410  -->  00:02:02.800
Thank you so much for watching.

38

00:02:02.790  -->  00:02:04.260
I'll see you in the next lecture
