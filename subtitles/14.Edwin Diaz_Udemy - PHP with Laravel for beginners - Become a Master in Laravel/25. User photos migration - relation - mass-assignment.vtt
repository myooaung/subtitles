00:00:00.240  -->  00:00:07.980
All right welcome back my students so the time has come for us to start actually relating the user with

2

00:00:07.980  -->  00:00:08.970
photos.

3

00:00:08.970  -->  00:00:09.500
All right.

4

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:12.120
So we need a migration for that.

5

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:18.490
We need to set up our relationship and let's do try to do all that in one lecture right.

6

00:00:18.510  -->  00:00:23.170
You guys already know that's all going to go a little fast on this so don't don't get scare.

7

00:00:23.190  -->  00:00:24.860
Everything is going to be OK.

8

00:00:24.870  -->  00:00:25.530
All right.

9

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:30.180
You can always rewind the video a positive even put it in slow motion and you can hear me going like

10

00:00:30.180  -->  00:00:31.410
this.

11

00:00:31.410  -->  00:00:35.160
Now we are going to migrate.

12

00:00:35.160  -->  00:00:38.760
All right so you can put this in slow motion if you like.

13

00:00:38.820  -->  00:00:41.760
Even though my students always want me in fast motion.

14

00:00:41.810  -->  00:00:42.610
Oh hey.

15

00:00:42.640  -->  00:00:48.450
Anyway BHB artists can make migration we're going to make a migration as a matter of fact let's make

16

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:52.130
a model right away and we name a photo.

17

00:00:52.230  -->  00:00:55.820
Yeah I think that's a good name for our model right.

18

00:00:56.040  -->  00:01:01.350
And then the M for creating the migration at the same time.

19

00:01:01.830  -->  00:01:09.090
So we're going to make that model and let's go and synchronizes.

20

00:01:09.230  -->  00:01:09.960
All right cool.

21

00:01:10.020  -->  00:01:12.750
Database migration.

22

00:01:12.930  -->  00:01:13.950
There we go.

23

00:01:13.950  -->  00:01:14.440
All right.

24

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:19.590
But anyway before we do that now that we have this working guys this is I think this is a good time

25

00:01:19.590  -->  00:01:21.210
to make a commit.

26

00:01:21.210  -->  00:01:23.220
All right.

27

00:01:23.910  -->  00:01:29.670
We can make a commitment and make a comment saying OK we've got other users we can persist data to the

28

00:01:29.670  -->  00:01:32.410
users without photos.

29

00:01:32.650  -->  00:01:33.220
All right.

30

00:01:33.420  -->  00:01:35.120
I think this is a good time to do that.

31

00:01:35.220  -->  00:01:41.100
So let's do that because just in case we get stuck on the next lecture for some reason with the migration

32

00:01:41.100  -->  00:01:46.260
with the relationship or something doesn't work we can always roll back to this where everything is

33

00:01:46.260  -->  00:01:47.280
working right now.

34

00:01:47.280  -->  00:01:47.900
All right.

35

00:01:48.060  -->  00:01:54.260
So let's go into some Russian control get ADD.

36

00:01:54.360  -->  00:01:55.950
All right.

37

00:01:56.670  -->  00:02:04.230
And let's just say good commit and message and we're going to aim for message and we're going to say

38

00:02:04.800  -->  00:02:05.790
users

39

00:02:08.910  -->  00:02:12.600
users able to persist

40

00:02:15.060  -->  00:02:15.900
persist

41

00:02:18.600  -->  00:02:22.360
or users.

42

00:02:22.980  -->  00:02:27.500
Bache working with no photos.

43

00:02:27.690  -->  00:02:28.770
Something like that.

44

00:02:28.770  -->  00:02:29.350
All right.

45

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:31.500
Anther beautiful.

46

00:02:31.530  -->  00:02:33.950
All right so we can always roll back to this.

47

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:35.040
And we know that

48

00:02:38.570  -->  00:02:40.140
you know everything was working here with it.

49

00:02:40.200  -->  00:02:44.190
Before we try to play around with the photos right.

50

00:02:44.850  -->  00:02:45.250
All right.

51

00:02:45.270  -->  00:02:54.720
So let's go ahead and go to the migration for photos and let's just give it a name or a path and guys

52

00:02:54.750  -->  00:02:58.350
and you can actually create more columns here.

53

00:02:58.350  -->  00:03:06.090
Like for sizing and I show you how to do that how do you get the size out of the image you know you

54

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:10.080
can plow a lot more information from the image and place it in your database if you want.

55

00:03:10.080  -->  00:03:10.460
All right.

56

00:03:10.460  -->  00:03:13.290
You can display that to the user and that's up to you.

57

00:03:13.290  -->  00:03:14.140
OK.

58

00:03:14.430  -->  00:03:17.090
We can name this file.

59

00:03:17.340  -->  00:03:24.680
All right or path like I've done in other licious change it up a little bit.

60

00:03:24.780  -->  00:03:25.550
Just name a file.

61

00:03:25.550  -->  00:03:26.520
Why not.

62

00:03:26.520  -->  00:03:28.260
All right.

63

00:03:29.700  -->  00:03:30.770
All right cool.

64

00:03:30.780  -->  00:03:34.000
So that's it.

65

00:03:34.050  -->  00:03:34.970
What else will we need.

66

00:03:34.960  -->  00:03:37.800
We need also a.

67

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:38.760
Which is me.

68

00:03:39.240  -->  00:03:41.320
Let's just do it right now.

69

00:03:42.520  -->  00:03:47.030
Let's do the fillable.

70

00:03:48.660  -->  00:03:53.540
Let's just have available guys arrive fillable and we name it.

71

00:03:53.550  -->  00:03:55.330
File.

72

00:03:55.620  -->  00:03:58.330
What else what else do we need here.

73

00:03:58.410  -->  00:04:00.180
We need also a

74

00:04:03.810  -->  00:04:05.460
relationship.

75

00:04:05.460  -->  00:04:09.110
I told you that we were going to be able to do all this in one lecture.

76

00:04:09.630  -->  00:04:12.840
Sometimes I don't want to make the lectures too long because I don't want you guys to fall asleep I

So it belongs to app.

93

And we're going to do photo.

94

00:04:55.920  -->  00:04:56.630
All right.

95

00:04:56.760  -->  00:05:02.700
So now that we know that we have a photo for the user you're beautiful we have the migration let's migrate

96

00:05:02.700  -->  00:05:04.230
it before we forget.

97

00:05:04.230  -->  00:05:08.550
So let's do BHB oops.

98

00:05:09.500  -->  00:05:10.210
All right.

99

00:05:10.590  -->  00:05:15.120
It's Fiore's and I agree.

100

00:05:15.140  -->  00:05:16.950
All right I think we've got everything here.

101

00:05:16.980  -->  00:05:21.070
We need an answer.

102

00:05:21.090  -->  00:05:22.470
All right cool.

103

00:05:22.470  -->  00:05:23.100
All right.

104

00:05:23.220  -->  00:05:25.080
So we got it down here.

105

00:05:25.080  -->  00:05:27.340
Beautiful So I think that's all we're going to do for this lecture.

106

00:05:27.350  -->  00:05:29.760
I think we did enough and I'll see you in the next one.

107

00:05:29.760  -->  00:05:30.900
Take care guys.
