00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:02,630
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:02,640  -->  00:00:05,450
So we have created our migration.

3

00:00:05,610  -->  00:00:12,390
We need to set up our relationships so that way we can you know use it and either do the crush create

4

00:00:12,390  -->  00:00:15,470
reading or are they in the league since we have to do the crowd.

5

00:00:15,510  -->  00:00:22,890
Why not start with creating information first creating related creating related relationships right

6

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:23,120
.

7

00:00:23,320  -->  00:00:24,510
It was kind of confusing there.

8

00:00:24,540  -->  00:00:30,090
But anyway so we're going to say that the user has one address where we need to start creating an address

9

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:31,170
for the user.

10

00:00:31,170  -->  00:00:34,810
So we're going to use a one to one relationship right.

11

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:39,210
So before we go into this I want you to notice something.

12

00:00:39,360  -->  00:00:46,140
We are creating a relationship between the users say one addresses the right is not enough just to create

13

00:00:46,140  -->  00:00:51,560
a model in this case because it's a one to one relationship we need to create a what Look at this table

14

00:00:51,560  -->  00:00:51,710
.

15

00:00:51,720  -->  00:00:53,500
Tell me what is missing.

16

00:00:54,420  -->  00:00:54,960
That's right.

17

00:00:54,960  -->  00:00:56,940
It's missing a user ID.

18

00:00:57,640  -->  00:00:58,600
Right.

19

00:00:59,280  -->  00:01:04,800
So we have two options either we king out of here and do a refresh or we King at the table.

20

00:01:04,890  -->  00:01:09,660
Now I would add that table another table I'm sorry the column I would add the column.

21

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:13,700
If I had a lot of data I wouldn't want to redo or refresh you know.

22

00:01:13,920  -->  00:01:18,690
But in this case we just refresh it because since we don't have data hopefully you don't have any data

23

00:01:18,700  -->  00:01:18,990
.

24

00:01:19,290  -->  00:01:24,180
But anyway this is an integer and his User ID my.

25

00:01:24,300  -->  00:01:25,310
This is the column.

26

00:01:25,500  -->  00:01:30,860
Let's make it on sign so that weighs all positive numbers on sign.

27

00:01:30,850  -->  00:01:33,090
I believe that's the way you spell it.

28

00:01:33,450  -->  00:01:36,490
Hopefully I'm correct if 9 is going to give us a problem.

29

00:01:36,540  -->  00:01:39,900
We're going to make inaudible so that way we don't have to really have a value there.

30

00:01:39,900  -->  00:01:40,970
We don't want to.

31

00:01:40,980  -->  00:01:47,640
So if this address is by itself somewhere in our application we can associate it with the user.

32

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:48,690
You see what I mean.

33

00:01:49,080  -->  00:01:50,660
So we can leave it along here.

34

00:01:50,670  -->  00:01:52,390
So that's fine.

35

00:01:53,340  -->  00:01:53,670
All right.

36

00:01:53,670  -->  00:02:00,240
So let's do my refresh BHB artists and migrate refresh.

37

00:02:00,270  -->  00:02:01,680
Now this is refresh.

38

00:02:01,680  -->  00:02:05,030
Now is time for us to do the relationship.

39

00:02:05,030  -->  00:02:05,710
All right.

40

00:02:05,880  -->  00:02:11,410
So Whoops.

41

00:02:11,420  -->  00:02:15,030
All right guys go back and to your user mark.

42

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:18,030
I'm going to go to the user model here.

43

00:02:18,180  -->  00:02:19,710
I have so many monitors.

44

00:02:19,710  -->  00:02:22,780
GUYS IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY AND I DOn't NEED ALL OF THEM.

45

00:02:22,860  -->  00:02:29,490
It's just that I just like monitors you know to have information all over the place so I have like five

46

00:02:29,490  -->  00:02:31,760
monitors right now all around me.

47

00:02:32,070  -->  00:02:37,830
And it's like when I switch to one screen thing I have a different resolution and another one because

48

00:02:38,130  -->  00:02:41,630
they're recording resolution and the resolution I use to develop are different.

49

00:02:41,630  -->  00:02:44,290
So that's why you see me sizing the screen sometimes.

50

00:02:44,300  -->  00:02:46,580
But anyway so we are in the user mode.

51

00:02:46,590  -->  00:02:53,010
This is a parent and the parent has to have a child and the child sees the address try dumbhead that

52

00:02:53,010  -->  00:02:59,430
is going to go and ask for the user id by default in that in this table right here.

53

00:02:59,430  -->  00:03:03,570
So we talked about that and we did it before public function

54

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:11,590
address and we're going to return the value out of the way we can use it right.

55

00:03:11,820  -->  00:03:17,530
So we say return this was a relationship one to one right.

56

00:03:17,820  -->  00:03:19,340
We don't have that remember.

57

00:03:19,590  -->  00:03:23,370
Is has one there with you.

58

00:03:23,490  -->  00:03:27,480
So the user is going to have one y address.

59

00:03:27,510  -->  00:03:29,410
Beautiful really good job guys.

60

00:03:29,430  -->  00:03:32,070
And you can set extra parameters here remember.

61

00:03:32,520  -->  00:03:33,240
OK.

62

00:03:33,660  -->  00:03:40,260
All right so cool we have this relationship where we fix star migration here.

63

00:03:40,270  -->  00:03:40,880
What else.

64

00:03:40,890  -->  00:03:45,330
Well on the next election we're going to continue with this and we're going to start inserting information

65

00:03:45,330  -->  00:03:50,560
creating information creating addresses for this specific user which is going to be pretty cool.

66

00:03:50,820  -->  00:03:52,820
Thank you so much for watching guys.

67

00:03:52,830  -->  00:03:55,590
You're doing an awesome job and I see you on the next lecture
