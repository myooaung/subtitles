00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.580
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.590  -->  00:00:04.220
Hopefully you got your relationships working.

3

00:00:04.260  -->  00:00:08.710
All right and I mean your eloquent relationships are right now your personal stuff anyway.

4

00:00:08.910  -->  00:00:13.040
So you're going to see me doing things a long way in this course.

5

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:16.110
And the reason why I do that is because I want you to think outside the box.

6

00:00:16.110  -->  00:00:18.500
I want you to think how can I do this better.

7

00:00:18.540  -->  00:00:23.460
And that's the mentality I want you to do half because I'm going to create things one way.

8

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:27.810
But then you might have a different mentality not than I do you might be faster in your mind than me

9

00:00:27.820  -->  00:00:29.130
you might be slower.

10

00:00:29.130  -->  00:00:31.040
So I want you to do it your own way.

11

00:00:31.290  -->  00:00:33.240
Once you finish a course of course.

12

00:00:33.240  -->  00:00:38.460
But I want you always think outside the box and always think how you can make the code better.

13

00:00:38.460  -->  00:00:44.760
Don't come in the discussion and say Edwin this way's better show me now right Edwin.

14

00:00:44.820  -->  00:00:46.260
This is the way I'm doing it.

15

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:47.340
What do you think.

16

00:00:47.340  -->  00:00:47.880
All right.

17

00:00:48.030  -->  00:00:52.980
So anyway I'm going to be using thinker a little bit here because I don't want you to forget about it

18

00:00:53.180  -->  00:00:53.490
.

19

00:00:53.580  -->  00:00:54.840
A very useful tool.

20

00:00:54.840  -->  00:00:57.890
I don't know if you remember that we try this a couple of times.

21

00:00:58.050  -->  00:01:00.360
BHB artisan thinker.

22

00:01:00.650  -->  00:01:01.160
Right.

23

00:01:01.170  -->  00:01:01.900
Cool.

24

00:01:01.920  -->  00:01:06.120
So now we are inside the thinker shell and let's just clear things out.

25

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:10.880
All right we're going to create an object and we already have a user so we have to do is fine.

26

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:13.630
So we're going to use a namespace user.

27

00:01:13.860  -->  00:01:22.730
And then right here we can actually use one of the methods we can say find number one.

28

00:01:22.860  -->  00:01:29.490
And once we do that automatically we have these user in is variable.

29

00:01:29.520  -->  00:01:32.120
All right.

30

00:01:32.120  -->  00:01:35.100
And we can find them all right now.

31

00:01:35.130  -->  00:01:37.630
We can actually check the relationship right.

32

00:01:37.650  -->  00:01:41.270
We can say user role enter.

33

00:01:41.400  -->  00:01:44.180
And now we can see that our user is an administrator.

34

00:01:44.340  -->  00:01:49.360
We can also insert records here remember that we can persist persist data with thinker.

35

00:01:49.620  -->  00:01:52.060
So he says a lot a lot of info.

36

00:01:52.320  -->  00:01:56.580
A lot of time by you know go into the browser and doing it manually like this.

37

00:01:56.580  -->  00:01:57.920
We can do it on command.

38

00:01:57.990  -->  00:02:02.280
All this stuff and we can actually even get more practice doing it this way.

39

00:02:02.280  -->  00:02:06.640
All right so now that we are testing our relationships everything is great here.

40

00:02:06.660  -->  00:02:07.220
Right.

41

00:02:07.230  -->  00:02:09.240
We can even create another user.

42

00:02:09.270  -->  00:02:11.030
If you remember how to do that right.

43

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:12.930
Can you remember.

44

00:02:12.930  -->  00:02:24.000
All right let's let's create a user right away and let's use NIXEY Kru user create a right

45

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:28.680
name and I'm going to leave it up to you guys.

46

00:02:28.680  -->  00:02:31.290
You thought I was going to do it.

47

00:02:31.800  -->  00:02:34.830
I'm going to leave this up to use if you want to go ahead and create another user.

48

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:35.730
Go ahead and try this.

49

00:02:35.730  -->  00:02:40.300
I will want you to play around with anger a little bit so you can get used to where right don't.

50

00:02:40.310  -->  00:02:44.170
Don't go lazy don't go lazy and try to do it this way.

51

00:02:44.260  -->  00:02:47.270
I do it this way and play around with think a little bit.

52

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:48.960
Anyway I see you and I like you guys.

53

00:02:48.960  -->  00:02:50.360
Take care.
