00:00:00,420  -->  00:00:05,110
All right welcome back my students so the first thing that we got to do here is install.

2

00:00:05,120  -->  00:00:05,850
Good.

3

00:00:05,850  -->  00:00:07,020
All right.

4

00:00:07,050  -->  00:00:12,150
For Windows user We already did that before because we installed the shell so that way you guys can

5

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:16,360
write command lines just like we do a Mac for Mac users.

6

00:00:16,410  -->  00:00:19,810
You can also install good in the good Web site.

7

00:00:19,910  -->  00:00:29,750
All right so if you type in get you go to this Web site get hyphen NCM dot com and you can install it

8

00:00:29,760  -->  00:00:34,490
or let me just make this very small here so that we can see it.

9

00:00:34,930  -->  00:00:35,410
All right.

10

00:00:35,420  -->  00:00:39,990
When you can download it right here once you download the then you can open your terminal and verify

11

00:00:39,990  -->  00:00:40,860
that you have it.

12

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:48,420
So I'm going to say get high foot high fence version and you can see that I have an older version I

13

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:50,810
have to obey my version that's OK.

14

00:00:50,880  -->  00:00:51,840
Or I have.

15

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:53,970
This is a very stable version and I've been doing.

16

00:00:53,970  -->  00:00:56,970
It's been very good for me but I will update my version.

17

00:00:56,970  -->  00:01:01,420
But anyway you can go ahead installed.

18

00:01:01,970  -->  00:01:02,420
Good.

19

00:01:02,430  -->  00:01:06,920
And once you have it installed check your version and you are up and running OK.

20

00:01:06,930  -->  00:01:08,510
All right cool.

21

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,700
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
