00:00:01,050  -->  00:00:05,130
Welcome back many students is time for us to learn about migrations and migration.

2

00:00:05,130  -->  00:00:09,210
So one of the coolest thing Clarabelle has available for us to use.

3

00:00:09,290  -->  00:00:09,910
Where are they.

4

00:00:09,930  -->  00:00:13,350
Well they are kind of table generators.

5

00:00:13,380  -->  00:00:14,720
Call them generators.

6

00:00:14,880  -->  00:00:22,620
Basically what we do is we find the table insight or application side Clarabell we define the table

7

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:29,100
and we find the columns in how we wanted the columns and then we run a PH BE adducing command and then

8

00:00:29,100  -->  00:00:33,360
we create a table where ever that table software is.

9

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:38,000
So if we are using my Escudero in that in this example you're going to be able to see that table in

10

00:00:38,000  -->  00:00:42,200
ph we my out me in whatever other program you use to see your tables right.

11

00:00:42,260  -->  00:00:48,900
Well if we are using the F-Secure light a file base database then you are a you're able to go and see

12

00:00:49,200  -->  00:00:54,150
those that information in those files is going to be pretty cool.

13

00:00:54,180  -->  00:00:55,190
You're going to love it.

14

00:00:55,290  -->  00:00:58,140
And why is it so important to do migrations.

15

00:00:58,230  -->  00:01:01,260
Because imagine that you have to share your project.

16

00:01:01,350  -->  00:01:06,240
Now you don't have to go to PH be my admin or support your database you don't have to do that or you

17

00:01:06,240  -->  00:01:09,390
have to do is just give the project to somebody else.

18

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:14,440
And what we do is they just run up BHP adducing command and Whyalla.

19

00:01:14,520  -->  00:01:17,720
They have their tables created for them automatically on their site.

20

00:01:17,730  -->  00:01:20,430
So it's going to be pretty cool if you're really tidy.

21

00:01:20,580  -->  00:01:23,630
I want you to get more excited because migrations are really cool.

22

00:01:23,670  -->  00:01:25,320
So if you're ready I'm ready.

23

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:26,020
Let's do it.

24

00:01:26,180  -->  00:01:29,030
And please go over there and do some work.

25

00:01:29,040  -->  00:01:29,690
Write the code.

26

00:01:29,690  -->  00:01:31,010
Don't just watch it right.

27

00:01:31,260  -->  00:01:31,720
Thank you.

28

00:01:31,810  -->  00:01:32,070
