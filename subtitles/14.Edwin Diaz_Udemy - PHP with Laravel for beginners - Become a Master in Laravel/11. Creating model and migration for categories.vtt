00:00:00.270  -->  00:00:00.820
All right.

2

00:00:00.840  -->  00:00:02.700
Welcome back my students.

3

00:00:02.700  -->  00:00:08.040
So in this lecture what I want to do is I want to create a migration and a model for category.

4

00:00:08.060  -->  00:00:12.960
The reason why is because I don't want to leave this like this here even though we're not going to be

5

00:00:12.960  -->  00:00:13.920
creating the pages.

6

00:00:13.920  -->  00:00:19.410
Now we're not going to create a forum for creating categories or any of them or anything like that we're

7

00:00:19.410  -->  00:00:20.780
not going to deal with that now.

8

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:25.950
But I want to create the table and put some data so that where we can pull it out here.

9

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:33.000
That way when we create the edit page for polls we have some data right now where we don't have to come

10

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:34.540
back and deal with this later.

11

00:00:34.920  -->  00:00:37.280
So let's go ahead and do that.

12

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:40.620
Let's create a migration real quick.

13

00:00:40.630  -->  00:00:44.490
And if you want to do some comments right now you're welcome to do it.

14

00:00:44.490  -->  00:00:46.370
All right we got the.

15

00:00:46.950  -->  00:00:51.810
As a matter of fact let's just do it because if I don't do it some of you were not doing either so I'm

16

00:00:51.810  -->  00:00:56.080
going to get ad and to get comment.

17

00:00:57.030  -->  00:00:58.350
And she's going to say

18

00:01:02.430  -->  00:01:07.500
able to create create polls which static

19

00:01:10.050  -->  00:01:13.950
category.

20

00:01:14.010  -->  00:01:15.310
OK.

21

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:17.970
There we go.

22

00:01:17.970  -->  00:01:19.070
All right cool.

23

00:01:19.530  -->  00:01:20.960
That way we know where we are.

24

00:01:20.970  -->  00:01:21.370
All right.

25

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:23.100
Good log.

26

00:01:23.100  -->  00:01:25.750
We've got a couple of comments here OK.

27

00:01:27.020  -->  00:01:27.380
Whoops

28

00:01:28.590  -->  00:01:32.000
.

29

00:01:32.940  -->  00:01:33.450
All right.

30

00:01:33.450  -->  00:01:41.620
So let's create the migration ph Fiore's and make it actually model.

31

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:48.300
And we're going to call this model the category or category.

32

00:01:49.010  -->  00:01:53.260
Cool.

33

00:01:53.290  -->  00:01:54.570
All right.

34

00:01:55.080  -->  00:01:57.570
There we go that's a moderate here.

35

00:01:57.570  -->  00:01:59.030
All right we're going to set it up right away.

36

00:01:59.030  -->  00:02:06.570
I swear to I don't want to come back to this later protected a level and we're going to have a name

37

00:02:06.570  -->  00:02:07.160
for it.

38

00:02:07.200  -->  00:02:08.310
That's it.

39

00:02:09.060  -->  00:02:09.550
OK.

40

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:14.090
Subregions you can see we're going to go to post real quick and we already have their relationship with

41

00:02:14.100  -->  00:02:14.680
category.

42

00:02:14.700  -->  00:02:17.130
OK great.

43

00:02:17.130  -->  00:02:19.710
So we have the migration is go to the migration real quick

44

00:02:25.200  -->  00:02:35.740
and let's just create a name column.

45

00:02:37.130  -->  00:02:42.640
Cool looks about right and it's migrating.

46

00:02:42.720  -->  00:02:45.260
And I agree.

47

00:02:45.270  -->  00:02:51.010
Let's go back here fresh and let's go to Gregorios now.

48

00:02:51.030  -->  00:02:54.190
Let's insert a couple of categories real quick.

49

00:02:54.390  -->  00:03:04.080
We're going to save THP of course as the main guy right here a category not category.

50

00:03:04.120  -->  00:03:10.590
Alero well and two to do.

51

00:03:11.250  -->  00:03:18.800
Let's go and say javascript and bootstrap

52

00:03:23.200  -->  00:03:25.930
oves I think ignore one of them.

53

00:03:26.080  -->  00:03:27.040
Check it out real quick.

54

00:03:27.060  -->  00:03:27.360
OK.

55

00:03:27.360  -->  00:03:28.920
We've got a couple.

56

00:03:28.950  -->  00:03:29.770
All right cool.

57

00:03:30.030  -->  00:03:34.890
All right so now that we have the migration we have the model we have the Master Simon we have some

58

00:03:34.890  -->  00:03:41.280
data we're good to go in the next lecture we're going to keep working on our posts and trying to bring

59

00:03:41.280  -->  00:03:43.450
this category to work here.

60

00:03:43.530  -->  00:03:44.250
OK.
