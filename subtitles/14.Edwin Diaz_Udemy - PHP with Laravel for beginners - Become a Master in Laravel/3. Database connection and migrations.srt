1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:04,780
All right welcome back my students so we got the installation ready up and running right.

2

00:00:04,920  -->  00:00:12,960
So it's time for us to demonstrate was time for me to demonstrate how easy it is to create a log in

3

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:15,570
system in larva is going to be pretty cool.

4

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:17,970
Let me clear this out real quick.

5

00:00:18,000  -->  00:00:19,200
All right.

6

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:22,350
Put it down to the way we can come back to it.

7

00:00:22,560  -->  00:00:28,920
Let's go and open it up right here.

8

00:00:29,380  -->  00:00:34,500
Open and he's the logons right up here.

9

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:35,760
All right.

10

00:00:36,660  -->  00:00:38,740
Cool.

11

00:00:39,010  -->  00:00:41,260
Or I remember We'll get to create a database right.

12

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:43,910
So we have to create that database connection.

13

00:00:43,980  -->  00:00:45,110
That's the first thing.

14

00:00:45,450  -->  00:00:47,930
And we have to do the migration.

15

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:48,620
OK.

16

00:00:48,960  -->  00:00:52,400
So let's connect that to the database first.

17

00:00:52,440  -->  00:01:06,210
So let's open up our BHB admin actually go Beechfield my admin and databases and I call this Claribel

18

00:01:06,650  -->  00:01:10,410
on the score logon answer.

19

00:01:10,470  -->  00:01:12,940
Cool let's go to the DMV.

20

00:01:13,300  -->  00:01:15,380
The EMV file.

21

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:17,400
Let's go here.

22

00:01:17,840  -->  00:01:21,420
Genesis to well on the score.

23

00:01:21,870  -->  00:01:25,110
Logan bruit

24

00:01:28,340  -->  00:01:29,980
empty.

25

00:01:30,210  -->  00:01:37,790
We go now we can come back here and we can say BHP areason migrate.

26

00:01:37,830  -->  00:01:39,870
That's all we got to do for this one OK.

27

00:01:39,870  -->  00:01:44,340
BHP Adisa and migrate enter they migrated.

28

00:01:44,370  -->  00:01:44,850
Beautiful.

29

00:01:44,850  -->  00:01:47,730
So we got the connection going.

30

00:01:47,730  -->  00:01:48,450
All right.

31

00:01:48,550  -->  00:01:57,150
We migrate or our table here on the next election going to show you how to create the logon system under

32

00:01:57,150  -->  00:01:58,100
one minute.

33

00:01:58,560  -->  00:02:01,590
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture is going to be pretty fun guys.

34

00:02:01,620  -->  00:02:03,320
So stay tuned.
