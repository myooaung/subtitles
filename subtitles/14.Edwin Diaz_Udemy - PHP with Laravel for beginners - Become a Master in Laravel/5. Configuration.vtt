00:00:00.150  -->  00:00:02.380
All right welcome back my students now there are.

2

00:00:02.380  -->  00:00:04.130
Cal has being activated.

3

00:00:04.530  -->  00:00:06.180
Verify.

4

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:11.340
Now I think for those of you out of the country I think that will work if you will your phone number

5

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:13.680
in there if for some reason it doesn't work.

6

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:17.230
You can always contact their support team and ask them how you can verify your account.

7

00:00:17.270  -->  00:00:19.670
For some reason it doesn't work on verify.

8

00:00:19.670  -->  00:00:22.010
I haven't tried it every time I open an account.

9

00:00:22.020  -->  00:00:27.570
I always verify it but you know you're welcome to try it to see if it works on verify if not just contact

10

00:00:27.570  -->  00:00:31.080
the support team if your phone number doesn't work if you are out of the country or something.

11

00:00:31.080  -->  00:00:31.630
All right.

12

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:38.820
But anyway so now that we have activated our account you can go to the right hand side here and you

13

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:41.160
have your app you have your API keys.

14

00:00:41.160  -->  00:00:46.530
Now every time you refresh here you see you click here it's going to refresh is going to give you a

15

00:00:46.530  -->  00:00:51.450
new API key so that's what I'm going to do to get new API keys to our record wall his videos.

16

00:00:51.470  -->  00:00:51.970
Right.

17

00:00:52.230  -->  00:00:58.860
So that way you guys will have my eyes I know some of you tried to you know hack into people's software

18

00:00:58.860  -->  00:00:59.360
and stuff.

19

00:00:59.370  -->  00:01:01.000
And that's not cool.

20

00:01:01.020  -->  00:01:05.760
I'm joking guys and Joe can know you guys are my students and you guys my students don't do that.

21

00:01:05.760  -->  00:01:06.100
All right.

22

00:01:06.120  -->  00:01:09.790
But anyway let's go and set this up in our project.

23

00:01:09.830  -->  00:01:19.770
Right so let's open up our BHB storm or whatever it is or you're using and let's open our our new project

24

00:01:19.770  -->  00:01:23.050
our new installations so our new installation is.

25

00:01:23.270  -->  00:01:26.630
Let's see if I can find the year somewhere.

26

00:01:26.980  -->  00:01:32.940
Me and applications actually.

27

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:36.900
So many things.

28

00:01:36.910  -->  00:01:42.540
It gets overwhelming to go to where I need to go.

29

00:01:43.140  -->  00:01:48.640
And let's go to our new installation which is mail way here.

30

00:01:48.650  -->  00:01:52.130
Cool.

31

00:01:52.200  -->  00:01:53.270
All right.

32

00:01:53.550  -->  00:01:59.880
So to send mail or either a couple of ways that we can do that and the best way to do this is setting

33

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:03.550
everything up in the data in the file.

34

00:02:03.560  -->  00:02:08.930
These are your environment your variables environment here.

35

00:02:08.990  -->  00:02:09.840
All right.

36

00:02:09.930  -->  00:02:14.510
Environment variables page or should I say.

37

00:02:14.550  -->  00:02:15.140
All right.

38

00:02:15.270  -->  00:02:16.350
So this is very safe.

39

00:02:16.350  -->  00:02:19.470
Every time you blow this or somewhere else this is going I get it.

40

00:02:19.620  -->  00:02:22.610
Ignore it especially if you're taking it to get help.

41

00:02:22.610  -->  00:02:23.270
All right.

42

00:02:23.550  -->  00:02:30.590
But anyway we're going to touch on that later about sending this to gay hub or you know using good.

43

00:02:30.930  -->  00:02:33.380
Hopefully we can add a section to this course for that.

44

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:40.310
But anyway so this is where your mail data your mail information goes.

45

00:02:40.320  -->  00:02:40.810
All right.

46

00:02:40.860  -->  00:02:44.880
So you want to put a here so that way is not available to anywhere else in your application you don't

47

00:02:44.880  -->  00:02:49.870
want to be sending this to somewhere where you're poor information is there right.

48

00:02:49.890  -->  00:02:51.370
You don't want to do that.

49

00:02:51.390  -->  00:02:52.330
All right cool.

50

00:02:52.350  -->  00:02:55.450
So how do we set up mail going.

51

00:02:55.800  -->  00:02:56.420
All right.

52

00:02:56.730  -->  00:02:57.240
All right.

53

00:02:57.390  -->  00:03:02.470
So the first thing is the mail driver here we got to change this to mail going.

54

00:03:02.700  -->  00:03:04.110
All right.

55

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:12.360
Then we change what we got to add a couple of variables here and I'll show you right now let's go to

56

00:03:12.360  -->  00:03:18.470
com Feg and we have this mailed out BHB here that we have to set up a little bit.

57

00:03:18.990  -->  00:03:26.940
And we also have this Services page where you can see the environmental variable here environment variable

58

00:03:27.350  -->  00:03:33.960
mail gun domain mail gun secret we need those we need those in the other side in the EMV file.

59

00:03:33.960  -->  00:03:37.790
So that way we can connect to their API.

60

00:03:37.950  -->  00:03:43.770
All right but let's let's start with let's start we mailed out BHB first and then we'll see it we'll

61

00:03:43.770  -->  00:03:45.880
go to EMV.

62

00:03:45.900  -->  00:03:51.540
So here the only thing that we have to change here we have the drivers give us the full tuus a.p.

63

00:03:51.990  -->  00:03:58.440
If it's not set up in the environment environment file if it's not set up in the DMV is going to go

64

00:03:58.440  -->  00:04:04.740
to US anti-people We already set it but set it up here so we don't have nothing to worry about.

65

00:04:05.100  -->  00:04:08.560
Then the hose is already set up by default to Melgen.

66

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:09.570
If yours is not.

67

00:04:09.570  -->  00:04:13.420
Make sure that yours is all right.

68

00:04:14.530  -->  00:04:22.410
We shouldn't worry too much about this here because we're going to have we're going to connect here

69

00:04:22.670  -->  00:04:23.680
.

70

00:04:24.510  -->  00:04:27.760
We're not going to even use his Mellowes.

71

00:04:27.780  -->  00:04:29.460
All right.

72

00:04:29.460  -->  00:04:34.650
So we are not going to use this a.p that's when you use and a.p then you can use these in environment

73

00:04:34.650  -->  00:04:35.650
variables.

74

00:04:35.670  -->  00:04:37.190
That's a.p.

75

00:04:37.480  -->  00:04:42.540
The poor the user name and password that's when you connect it to a.p we're not going to be doing that

76

00:04:42.540  -->  00:04:42.570
.

77

00:04:42.570  -->  00:04:48.570
So but if you wanted to this is where you would connect to a centipede like two to connect to Google

78

00:04:48.590  -->  00:04:48.660
.

79

00:04:48.720  -->  00:04:50.190
OK.

80

00:04:50.190  -->  00:04:53.230
But anyway so let's go back here.

81

00:04:54.270  -->  00:05:00.180
By default 587 That's OK let's put From address here.

82

00:05:00.180  -->  00:05:07.290
I'm going to put Edwin that courting and you can put or whatever yes you or I really doesn't matter

83

00:05:07.520  -->  00:05:07.830
.

84

00:05:07.890  -->  00:05:14.940
Faculty call and my name of course is ideas.

85

00:05:14.940  -->  00:05:16.040
There we go.

86

00:05:16.170  -->  00:05:17.610
And this is all we've got to do here.

87

00:05:17.610  -->  00:05:21.300
Everything else is done in the M.V. OK.

88

00:05:21.400  -->  00:05:31.260
We're not setting up a centerpiece So let's go to let's go here real quick and I'm going to take all

89

00:05:31.260  -->  00:05:36.680
this off are actually you know the only thing that I'm going to leave is the driver.

90

00:05:36.810  -->  00:05:39.500
So I'm going to use male gun.

91

00:05:39.870  -->  00:05:44.510
Actually it's like this male gun domain.

92

00:05:45.920  -->  00:05:46.930
Right.

93

00:05:47.580  -->  00:05:51.060
And we'll put the domain there later.

94

00:05:51.070  -->  00:05:53.890
But right now we need to set this up.

95

00:05:54.070  -->  00:05:57.940
Male gun secret FBI key.

96

00:05:57.940  -->  00:05:59.850
All right cool.

97

00:05:59.880  -->  00:06:07.470
So now let's go back to male gun real quick and let's find that so let's go to domain's and we're going

98

00:06:07.470  -->  00:06:12.150
to be using somebody for later on we're going to set this up to where it goes to our domain because

99

00:06:12.900  -->  00:06:18.360
in sandbox when you're using this sometimes you can get this to a spam folder you know it goes through

100

00:06:18.360  -->  00:06:21.230
the spam for that when you use this sandbox sometimes.

101

00:06:21.270  -->  00:06:27.180
Sometimes not all the time so it's better that you go and create your own domain and to create your

102

00:06:27.180  -->  00:06:27.690
own domain.

103

00:06:27.690  -->  00:06:28.710
We'll check into that later.

104

00:06:28.720  -->  00:06:32.490
But it's super easy but let's do it like this first and let's try it.

105

00:06:32.490  -->  00:06:38.400
And if he goes to spam we'll try to Domingue even if it doesn't we'll still try that domain see how

106

00:06:38.400  -->  00:06:38.760
it goes.

107

00:06:38.760  -->  00:06:39.620
OK guys.

108

00:06:39.630  -->  00:06:47.430
All right so let's get the domain right here.

109

00:06:47.430  -->  00:06:48.500
All right.

110

00:06:49.260  -->  00:06:54.650
Let's go to our application real quick song on that domain there.

111

00:06:54.660  -->  00:07:01.500
And the secret key is disarray here actually right here.

112

00:07:01.560  -->  00:07:10.640
So when I say show them a copy when I go back here we go.

113

00:07:10.890  -->  00:07:13.680
I always keep losing my editor.

114

00:07:13.690  -->  00:07:16.440
Where do we go.

115

00:07:17.070  -->  00:07:18.830
So we've got a driver mail gone.

116

00:07:18.840  -->  00:07:25.890
We have the domain and we have the secret key and we'll make sure that we put the little symbol there

117

00:07:25.890  -->  00:07:27.210
.

118

00:07:27.240  -->  00:07:28.710
All right.

119

00:07:28.860  -->  00:07:35.500
All right so after this all we have to do is set up our route and test route and see how it works.

120

00:07:35.520  -->  00:07:39.560
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
