1

00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:05,560
All right welcome back my students so are you ready to learn some more eloquent really cool right.

2

00:00:05,580  -->  00:00:07,020
I'm ready to teach you.

3

00:00:07,020  -->  00:00:08,360
So let's get it on.

4

00:00:08,490  -->  00:00:08,980
All right.

5

00:00:09,120  -->  00:00:09,930
Cool.

6

00:00:10,350  -->  00:00:15,350
So now that we know how to create data and we even know how to muscle science right.

7

00:00:15,600  -->  00:00:18,910
It's time for us to learn how to update it.

8

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:23,340
So let's create a role for that.

9

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:32,400
And this to date and now we did this before with a statement to write a statement that was able to create

10

00:00:32,400  -->  00:00:32,930
new data.

11

00:00:32,940  -->  00:00:35,190
We don't have it right here.

12

00:00:35,190  -->  00:00:39,270
And if we did have it and we just find the wreck and working on data so this is a really cool matter

13

00:00:39,270  -->  00:00:41,060
that uses most of that time.

14

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:48,030
But we also have an update mentor that I want to show you that's pretty useful and I'm going to show

15

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:49,150
you a little trick right now.

16

00:00:49,170  -->  00:00:57,120
So I'm always trying to show you something new in every lecture besides what I'm the main subject is

17

00:00:57,780  -->  00:01:03,970
so let's do something like OK let's just change some where statements on different conditions are better

18

00:01:03,970  -->  00:01:04,020
.

19

00:01:04,020  -->  00:01:07,050
You really know how to do that so I show you.

20

00:01:07,050  -->  00:01:10,530
So where Id cause to

21

00:01:13,080  -->  00:01:22,600
and where is at and men equals zero.

22

00:01:22,720  -->  00:01:25,870
We're going to update some information.

23

00:01:26,560  -->  00:01:27,270
OK.

24

00:01:27,740  -->  00:01:36,090
And now we can say we have the title waves so we put an array here OK because this this can take multiple

25

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:37,230
parameters.

26

00:01:37,350  -->  00:01:49,480
So Title 2 new BHB title or something like that and the content too.

27

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:58,140
I love my instructor.

28

00:01:59,040  -->  00:02:00,330
There we go.

29

00:02:00,330  -->  00:02:01,960
I know some of you guys love me.

30

00:02:02,340  -->  00:02:03,100
So.

31

00:02:03,270  -->  00:02:08,100
So we were right to a statement here right where Id go to and where is Admin the zero.

32

00:02:08,100  -->  00:02:12,350
So we're going to be updating this little guy right here.

33

00:02:12,360  -->  00:02:14,610
So let's refresh him make sure he's still there.

34

00:02:14,610  -->  00:02:16,800
So he's still there is zero.

35

00:02:16,800  -->  00:02:19,200
So those those conditions are SRU.

36

00:02:19,590  -->  00:02:26,550
So that is going to update if there were not you of course is not going to pass and he would not update

37

00:02:26,550  -->  00:02:26,760
.

38

00:02:26,790  -->  00:02:34,960
So let's try update enter.

39

00:02:35,320  -->  00:02:36,950
Whoops that's not it.

40

00:02:37,020  -->  00:02:38,670
Is this one.

41

00:02:39,540  -->  00:02:40,890
Beautiful.

42

00:02:40,960  -->  00:02:45,220
So now let's go and check out these Outman.

43

00:02:45,450  -->  00:02:46,310
Nice admin.

44

00:02:46,320  -->  00:02:51,800
But BHB my admin we go.

45

00:02:51,920  -->  00:02:52,970
And you'll be a spitfire.

46

00:02:52,990  -->  00:02:53,920
I know my instructor.

47

00:02:53,990  -->  00:02:59,920
When we get the time stamps beautiful low when the larva does this with either time stops automatically

48

00:02:59,910  -->  00:03:00,240
.

49

00:03:00,440  -->  00:03:05,880
I'm going to show you some pretty cool ways to deal with time stamps later in the course.

50

00:03:05,880  -->  00:03:06,380
All right.

51

00:03:06,510  -->  00:03:11,020
So I hope you are really excited and we are going to be learning a lot more in this course.

52

00:03:11,040  -->  00:03:14,760
I want you to keep up your energy and remember that you are learning something that is going to change

53

00:03:14,760  -->  00:03:15,500
your career.

54

00:03:15,540  -->  00:03:20,850
If you already have one if not it's going to allow you to get a better job out there or even a new job

55

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:21,270
.

56

00:03:21,540  -->  00:03:26,040
So be motivated wake up every day like you want to do this stuff because this is your.

57

00:03:26,280  -->  00:03:29,830
This could mean a life changing experience for you.

58

00:03:29,940  -->  00:03:30,600
OK.

59

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:35,670
So anyway thank you so much for watching my courses all the time in you know supporting me and I'll

60

00:03:35,670  -->  00:03:36,540

61

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:37,230
Take your guys
