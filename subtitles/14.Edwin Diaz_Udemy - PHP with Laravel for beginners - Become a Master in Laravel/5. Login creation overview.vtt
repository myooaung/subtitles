00:00:00.190  -->  00:00:07.590
All right welcome back my students so we build a blogging system from a couple of lines of code.

2

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:12.670
Actually one line of code right BHB areason make off that that's right.

3

00:00:12.690  -->  00:00:19.170
Well this system has been by default has been installed Claribel since the beginning arrays just been

4

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:19.890
there.

5

00:00:19.890  -->  00:00:23.200
The only thing that we had to do was activated by creating views.

6

00:00:23.210  -->  00:00:23.890
All right.

7

00:00:23.970  -->  00:00:26.900
So we already have a controller called auth controller.

8

00:00:26.910  -->  00:00:28.380
I'm going to show it to you in a minute.

9

00:00:28.560  -->  00:00:33.250
And that controller makes sure that we can create invalidate everything.

10

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:33.780
All right.

11

00:00:33.810  -->  00:00:40.590
That has to do with out indication right and I will show that to you in a minute but just know that

12

00:00:40.590  -->  00:00:47.120
we have created a we have built this we have put it together really quickly right.

13

00:00:47.430  -->  00:00:53.050
But I'm going to show you a couple of things because I want you to be aware of how it works.

14

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:56.750
I want you to be aware that you can do this from scratch and we're probably going to do that in a couple

15

00:00:56.830  -->  00:00:58.500
lectures after this.

16

00:00:58.500  -->  00:01:01.840
We're going to try to build a very simple logging system from scratch.

17

00:01:02.400  -->  00:01:07.390
Now all the way from scratch because of Araba you can Clarabelle that that the whole thing is this you

18

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:07.640
.

19

00:01:07.750  -->  00:01:09.800
You don't have to build everything from scratch.

20

00:01:09.960  -->  00:01:15.030
Many of the things are built for you but we going to very close to building building it from scratch

21

00:01:15.070  -->  00:01:21.290
OK because I want you to understand the fund the fund the foundation of our logging system Clarabell

22

00:01:21.340  -->  00:01:21.380
.

23

00:01:21.390  -->  00:01:28.290
But anyway so one of the first thing that I want you to know in this lecture here is that we got this

24

00:01:28.290  -->  00:01:33.180
creator for us when we did the make off command and this creator for us.

25

00:01:33.180  -->  00:01:39.210
All right we had a home controller for views and we have this routes.

26

00:01:39.270  -->  00:01:44.940
You see this little function right here creates a whole bunch of routes that we need now show you what

27

00:01:44.940  -->  00:01:46.190
I mean what routes are right.

28

00:01:46.190  -->  00:01:53.880
The HP Orison route to the list Antar and if you check your routes now you should have a whole bunch

29

00:01:53.880  -->  00:01:57.060
of routes that this thing created for us.

30

00:01:57.100  -->  00:01:57.720
All right.

31

00:01:57.910  -->  00:02:00.670
Looking there I'll try here.

32

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:02.460
All right.

33

00:02:03.630  -->  00:02:07.920
So now if you take that off this

34

00:02:12.960  -->  00:02:15.520
you see that.

35

00:02:16.970  -->  00:02:19.430
All right so that's why the little function is doing.

36

00:02:20.220  -->  00:02:21.010
Pretty cool stuff.

37

00:02:21.010  -->  00:02:22.060
They make it a lot easier.

38

00:02:22.080  -->  00:02:26.810
Now you would have to do this manually and that's a pain to do this manually manually.

39

00:02:27.120  -->  00:02:29.020
All right cool.

40

00:02:29.490  -->  00:02:31.230
All right so that's the first thing he's doing.

41

00:02:31.380  -->  00:02:32.670
The second thing of course.

42

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:33.610
Right.

43

00:02:34.110  -->  00:02:38.910
One of the things that he's doing is they created these folders with his files inside let's go inspect

44

00:02:38.910  -->  00:02:39.960
one of these files around.

45

00:02:39.960  -->  00:02:46.320
We're not going to inspect every Or every one of them because the principle is the same.

46

00:02:46.320  -->  00:02:46.970
All right.

47

00:02:47.340  -->  00:02:49.870
So I'm going to show it to you like this.

48

00:02:49.890  -->  00:02:53.570
All right so this is the log in that Bley file.

49

00:02:53.580  -->  00:02:59.090
We have some playful functionality we have some of course this is oberlÃ©.

50

00:02:59.300  -->  00:03:00.590
Has the curly brackets.

51

00:03:00.630  -->  00:03:02.550
We have are the errors.

52

00:03:02.570  -->  00:03:09.210
Here is the variable that is available to us in the hole in the whole application.

53

00:03:09.570  -->  00:03:10.140
All right.

54

00:03:10.500  -->  00:03:14.550
So is checking to see if it has a name email error.

55

00:03:14.560  -->  00:03:14.890
Right.

56

00:03:14.890  -->  00:03:22.010
If he if he has an e-mail where it's going I actually put a class has error in that field.

57

00:03:22.620  -->  00:03:23.700
So that's going to go red.

58

00:03:23.700  -->  00:03:25.260
So let's say for example.

59

00:03:25.260  -->  00:03:28.230
So if we don't we don't put anything there and we do this.

60

00:03:28.230  -->  00:03:32.240
We get this has error class in.

61

00:03:32.270  -->  00:03:34.840
So pretty cool stuff we issue an idea on how to do this.

62

00:03:34.830  -->  00:03:35.490
All right.

63

00:03:35.550  -->  00:03:38.940
This is an itinerary here and I can if condition.

64

00:03:38.940  -->  00:03:39.450
All right.

65

00:03:39.450  -->  00:03:45.270
So that's all he's doing here is checking to see if it the you know if he has the same error again if

66

00:03:45.270  -->  00:03:47.070
he does what can we do about it.

67

00:03:47.280  -->  00:03:49.510
And he displays here the.

68

00:03:50.120  -->  00:03:52.980
All right help block.

69

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:53.760
All right.

70

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:55.140
More stuffing here.

71

00:03:55.140  -->  00:04:02.000
I mean just checking for aero guys this is the log in or I would probably have a similar functionality

72

00:04:02.070  -->  00:04:03.970
for registration as well.

73

00:04:04.050  -->  00:04:04.770
OK.

74

00:04:04.770  -->  00:04:06.020
Very simple stuff.

75

00:04:06.030  -->  00:04:08.160
All right nothing big.

76

00:04:08.160  -->  00:04:09.670
All right.

77

00:04:10.320  -->  00:04:12.780
Let's go back here what else can we see.

78

00:04:12.780  -->  00:04:16.620
We have a whole array.

79

00:04:17.550  -->  00:04:24.950
So now let me just go and log into this application and show you something else.

80

00:04:24.960  -->  00:04:32.220
So right now you see that every time we log in we get redirected back to then that's all right.

81

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:38.420
And this is a home that that play that BHP file as you can see says load then.

82

00:04:38.820  -->  00:04:39.430
OK.

83

00:04:39.600  -->  00:04:41.810
Now how can we manage this.

84

00:04:41.820  -->  00:04:44.090
How can we get redirected somewhere else.

85

00:04:44.100  -->  00:04:51.520
Because you don't want to always get redirected to the what you call it to the home page right.

86

00:04:51.690  -->  00:04:55.600
Well we will deal with something called off controller OK.

87

00:04:55.620  -->  00:05:03.420
So let's go HTP controllers and Auth. is it's in its own folder.

88

00:05:03.630  -->  00:05:04.600
Double click it.

89

00:05:04.830  -->  00:05:09.680
And this is the controller that will tend to Gates and register users.

90

00:05:09.960  -->  00:05:10.580
OK.

91

00:05:10.580  -->  00:05:15.570
As you can see we have a property here that is assigned to that.

92

00:05:15.570  -->  00:05:20.790
This is after you get redirected after you log in you get redirected to the root because that's a forward

93

00:05:20.790  -->  00:05:22.080
slash that's what he means.

94

00:05:22.080  -->  00:05:26.160
So if you wanted to work with Areikat to admin you go this you go like this.

95

00:05:26.160  -->  00:05:27.680
All right cool.

96

00:05:27.900  -->  00:05:31.920
He's doing a lot of functionality if you look at him it just makes sense everything Laro those shoes

97

00:05:32.430  -->  00:05:37.240
look at the validator here makes sure that validates the user.

98

00:05:37.580  -->  00:05:40.260
OK you can't change this.

99

00:05:40.260  -->  00:05:43.700
This one creates the user for registration right.

100

00:05:44.550  -->  00:05:51.000
So this is very simple stuff and you can modify it if you if you want to do something when the user

101

00:05:51.000  -->  00:05:53.190
registers all those logs in.

102

00:05:53.430  -->  00:05:53.940
OK.

103

00:05:53.940  -->  00:05:55.850
Of course you have the password controller there.

104

00:05:56.040  -->  00:06:01.300
And we just passing a middleware guess to it in the construct.

105

00:06:01.710  -->  00:06:02.330
OK.

106

00:06:02.490  -->  00:06:12.090
And again if you want to go ahead and log in dip dig deeper into this command or control click.

107

00:06:12.120  -->  00:06:17.270
All right let's go to this one.

108

00:06:17.340  -->  00:06:20.880
The king came to that one as well.

109

00:06:20.880  -->  00:06:22.500
All right.

110

00:06:23.520  -->  00:06:28.680
So with that don't worry about this stuff too much as a lot of complexity first learn how to build projects

111

00:06:29.070  -->  00:06:34.350
and how to get very familiar with Clarabelle you know practicing in practice and then you start digging

112

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:37.490
deeper deeper into it once you know how to use a framework.

113

00:06:37.530  -->  00:06:44.010
OK but if you know all three it's just common sense if you're beginning this can get very overwhelming

114

00:06:44.010  -->  00:06:44.040
.

115

00:06:44.050  -->  00:06:51.950
OK so now let's go and inspect something else real quick.

116

00:06:51.950  -->  00:06:59.430
If you've got a Ph.D. my admin and we go to the Clarabelle logging system users you're going to notice

117

00:06:59.430  -->  00:07:01.180
that we've got this remember me talking.

118

00:07:01.380  -->  00:07:02.900
OK.

119

00:07:02.910  -->  00:07:03.180
All right.

120

00:07:03.180  -->  00:07:09.150
This is the talking that gets inserted when you when you use that functionality.

121

00:07:09.150  -->  00:07:15.150
So if I go like this let's go to the logging system again.

122

00:07:15.160  -->  00:07:19.830
Antar we are logged in are going to log out log in again

123

00:07:22.120  -->  00:07:27.880
use this for a quick and now let's have this thing handy.

124

00:07:27.890  -->  00:07:32.510
Let's just look at this 5G success for us.

125

00:07:32.520  -->  00:07:35.980
We go now let's refresh.

126

00:07:36.750  -->  00:07:41.550
You can see that remember me talking change.

127

00:07:41.550  -->  00:07:41.880
All right.

128

00:07:41.880  -->  00:07:46.000
That's it talking that gets answered every time we click on that little thing in there.

129

00:07:46.020  -->  00:07:46.730
All right.

130

00:07:47.100  -->  00:07:48.340
So that's all I remember of me talking.

131

00:07:48.340  -->  00:07:57.950
I mean if I close my browser I closed all my Chrome was there and I come back to that log in.

132

00:07:58.500  -->  00:08:00.710
And if you do this without doing that remember me.

133

00:08:00.840  -->  00:08:01.580
That's not going to work.

134

00:08:01.590  -->  00:08:06.300
You know that log in as you can see we are still logged in.

135

00:08:06.720  -->  00:08:10.300
So we even have the functionality there.

136

00:08:11.610  -->  00:08:13.020
Let's go back out

137

00:08:18.000  -->  00:08:24.340
let's log in and if you forgot your password we also have a password reset link functionality.

138

00:08:24.600  -->  00:08:25.040
All right.

139

00:08:25.080  -->  00:08:29.130
Now we do have to set up our e-mail for that so that's super simple.

140

00:08:29.160  -->  00:08:37.990
But anyway thank you so much and I hope this little tour into what's going on here was OK for you.

141

00:08:38.010  -->  00:08:38.850
All right.

142

00:08:38.860  -->  00:08:43.430
Again young and I always give you resources at the end of the sections or lectures.

143

00:08:43.560  -->  00:08:50.860
Always make sure that you check for links so that way you can dig deeper into this functionalities.

144

00:08:51.210  -->  00:08:52.530
Thank you so much for watching.

145

00:08:52.740  -->  00:08:55.090
And I see you in the next lectures
