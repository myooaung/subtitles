00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,980
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01,980  -->  00:00:07,680
So it's time for us to start inserting data into the database using eloquent which is pretty cool sold

3

00:00:07,930  -->  00:00:12,090
or stands for object relational mapper.

4

00:00:12,150  -->  00:00:17,270
I might say something different sometimes I quote a manager or mapping or something like that.

5

00:00:17,300  -->  00:00:17,770
Yes.

6

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:20,210
You know if you guys want the real definition just Google.

7

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:20,640
OK.

8

00:00:20,730  -->  00:00:24,020
But anyway so we are retrieving data.

9

00:00:24,060  -->  00:00:26,680
All right well one which is pretty cool using the word mad.

10

00:00:26,680  -->  00:00:31,490
Their first fail just to make sure that we find the first one if not we throw an exception right.

11

00:00:31,510  -->  00:00:35,690
It's time for us to start using eloquent to insert data.

12

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:37,110
Let me show you how easy this is.

13

00:00:37,120  -->  00:00:40,340
And the fighting make a comment make sure that you do OK.

14

00:00:40,440  -->  00:00:45,170
I think I made a comment right here but you should make a comment for every functionality so if you're

15

00:00:45,180  -->  00:00:48,160
going to read data find data make a comment for OK.

16

00:00:48,540  -->  00:00:50,300
All right so let's create a route.

17

00:00:50,340  -->  00:00:51,610
Real quick.

18

00:00:52,040  -->  00:00:55,220
And this rally is going to be for inserting right.

19

00:00:55,220  -->  00:01:02,990
So let's just give it a different name basic insert just a basic insert.

20

00:01:03,090  -->  00:01:04,770
OK.

21

00:01:04,770  -->  00:01:05,190
All right.

22

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:10,690
And let's get up into the closure function here.

23

00:01:10,700  -->  00:01:11,400
All right.

24

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:12,750
Beautiful.

25

00:01:12,780  -->  00:01:20,010
So for a basic insert all we have to do is call the the actually instantiate this cell we're going to

26

00:01:20,010  -->  00:01:27,530
see a post and we can say something like this new post.

27

00:01:27,930  -->  00:01:29,410
That's it.

28

00:01:29,400  -->  00:01:37,700
Right now we access each property or each column in our table like this.

29

00:01:37,830  -->  00:01:42,170
So if I want an update or now all day I want to insert something for the title.

30

00:01:42,270  -->  00:01:52,880
All I do is get the property out and assign a value to the new or am title or something like that.

31

00:01:53,300  -->  00:01:54,350
OK.

32

00:01:55,080  -->  00:02:08,790
Well you could you say eloquent eloquent title insert and then for the content we just do content and

33

00:02:08,790  -->  00:02:18,330
we'll say wow eloquent is really cool.

34

00:02:18,330  -->  00:02:24,320
Look at this content to get there.

35

00:02:24,480  -->  00:02:33,390
And then if I wouldn't just save it all I have to do is this safe or inserted right this save me the

36

00:02:33,440  -->  00:02:35,870
will insert the wrecker.

37

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:37,130
All right.

38

00:02:37,350  -->  00:02:40,300
And we'll also update it if you need to update it.

39

00:02:40,650  -->  00:02:42,040
All right.

40

00:02:42,720  -->  00:02:45,090
So you see it live with the way it is.

41

00:02:45,160  -->  00:02:46,710
Let's go to the browser real quick

42

00:02:49,410  -->  00:03:01,720
and right here which is a basic It's basic insert enter.

43

00:03:01,810  -->  00:03:02,930
All right cool.

44

00:03:03,030  -->  00:03:06,680
Let's go to the Peachtree my admin refresh.

45

00:03:07,260  -->  00:03:11,520
And we have actually inserted a record.

46

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:11,750
All right.

47

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:15,540
So this this this is going to insert it.

48

00:03:15,720  -->  00:03:16,750
All right.

49

00:03:17,460  -->  00:03:19,260
Now if you notice that

50

00:03:21,960  -->  00:03:28,860
this also what it did was that it also created it created at an all day they add stems.

51

00:03:28,950  -->  00:03:38,260
Now if you want to use a Save method as to update what you need to do is first you need to find find

52

00:03:38,260  -->  00:03:41,860
the record you want right.

53

00:03:43,980  -->  00:03:49,090
You find the record you want and then you can use the same method to update it.

54

00:03:49,170  -->  00:03:49,590
All right

55

00:03:52,770  -->  00:03:55,680
if you want we can do this right now and that's all.

56

00:03:55,740  -->  00:03:59,970
Let's actually do a real quick so that where you can see I'm just going to copy OK so that way we do

57

00:03:59,970  -->  00:04:11,110
this Fahs and we're going to find a record actually let's leave it like that's fine.

58

00:04:11,220  -->  00:04:13,140
We don't need a new we don't need to instantiate it.

59

00:04:13,140  -->  00:04:17,480
This is a static method the Rykes will find.

60

00:04:17,640  -->  00:04:28,500
We find that and I think we have you've got to look at your your your database table to see what views

61

00:04:28,500  -->  00:04:29,250
you have.

62

00:04:29,250  -->  00:04:31,390
So we got this wrong too.

63

00:04:31,410  -->  00:04:34,590
Let's update this one since this all has a small title right.

64

00:04:34,590  -->  00:04:40,650
So we're going to find number two and I'm going to change this to say new eloquent title.

65

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:42,030
Insert number two.

66

00:04:42,630  -->  00:04:44,390
And the Konting number two.

67

00:04:44,730  -->  00:04:45,540
OK.

68

00:04:45,780  -->  00:04:55,110
So now if I go to basic answer I'm going to put a number two here that way different come here and then

69

00:04:55,110  -->  00:05:00,870
I see the basic answer Number Two answer

70

00:05:03,590  -->  00:05:09,740
leads to two to go refresh.

71

00:05:10,290  -->  00:05:14,700
And as you can see number two has been updated.

72

00:05:14,710  -->  00:05:15,320
All right.

73

00:05:15,510  -->  00:05:16,600
Pretty cool stuff.

74

00:05:16,620  -->  00:05:20,520
Now we can also use the update method.

75

00:05:20,520  -->  00:05:22,140
We'll do that and then the next lecture.

76

00:05:22,140  -->  00:05:22,500
OK.

77

00:05:22,570  -->  00:05:24,410
Is going to be a pretty fast lecture.

78

00:05:24,600  -->  00:05:28,080
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture guys.

79

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:29,870
Very good job if you're following me.

80

00:05:29,880  -->  00:05:30,240
Take care
