00:00:00.140  -->  00:00:00.560
All right.

2

00:00:00.570  -->  00:00:05.760
Welcome welcome back my student it's staff for us to learn the other relationship allowable one of the

3

00:00:05.760  -->  00:00:08.430
others which is one too many.

4

00:00:08.430  -->  00:00:09.040
All right.

5

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:12.730
So we learned that 1 to 1 which is pretty cool.

6

00:00:12.750  -->  00:00:18.810
Now let's learn that one too many I think I had this uncommented before but anyway the first thing that

7

00:00:18.810  -->  00:00:25.550
we've got to do is just create a route right because we want the use that when they visit cerned.

8

00:00:25.730  -->  00:00:26.620
You are L..

9

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:28.720
We they get certain information right.

10

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:34.770
So the visit poses and then again all the polls are available for that specific user.

11

00:00:34.770  -->  00:00:41.340
So we have to first find the user of course find the user what ID number one because as on the user

12

00:00:41.340  -->  00:00:48.450
we got and we won all the polls for our user fun and let's just do it like this.

13

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:55.940
This is very similar to the one to one relationship I'll show you right now.

14

00:00:55.950  -->  00:01:01.870
Actually this is the user once we have the user object then we can do other things with it.

15

00:01:02.310  -->  00:01:10.160
Make sure that you have the user model added on top.

16

00:01:10.190  -->  00:01:11.130
OK.

17

00:01:11.880  -->  00:01:12.840
Right here you see the

18

00:01:16.760  -->  00:01:18.050
beautiful.

19

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:21.940
Let's just keep going down we brought it out of court already right.

20

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:24.210
Well we've still got some more to go.

21

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:27.920
So anyway I just wanted to make sure what we already did is here.

22

00:01:28.060  -->  00:01:33.330
Another thing that I want you to understand is that when you are returning something out of the med

23

00:01:33.720  -->  00:01:38.850
like we're doing right now sometimes you're going to get multiple value that you would not be able to

24

00:01:38.850  -->  00:01:45.570
get multiple results in some cases because remember that the return key We're only returns one specific

25

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:46.660
value.

26

00:01:47.000  -->  00:01:47.660
OK.

27

00:01:47.850  -->  00:01:49.530
So we would not be able to return.

28

00:01:49.560  -->  00:01:55.710
Let's say for example if I want to return all the users polls right now I won't be able to do that unless

29

00:01:55.710  -->  00:02:02.330
I use something else because return only returns one value back white anyway.

30

00:02:02.640  -->  00:02:05.020
So we got the user.

31

00:02:05.100  -->  00:02:13.980
Now all we got to do here is create a For Each loop to pull this information but we're forgetting something

32

00:02:13.980  -->  00:02:14.650
right.

33

00:02:14.680  -->  00:02:19.920
I want you to guess what we are forgetting but right now we're going to get the user and when I say

34

00:02:19.950  -->  00:02:29.640
I want to pull out all your posts and make it as post now we don't have this yet.

35

00:02:29.640  -->  00:02:30.060
Right.

36

00:02:30.060  -->  00:02:34.770
We have we created one for the polls right.

37

00:02:34.800  -->  00:02:40.590
If you go to a post for that I mean for the user we've got this one here but we haven't created the

38

00:02:40.710  -->  00:02:46.740
other one with the S or I remember that we have the one to one relationship right here and we using

39

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:48.420
We're returning to users right here.

40

00:02:48.420  -->  00:02:50.080
This is the one we created.

41

00:02:50.520  -->  00:02:55.050
But now a lot of it has a funny way of doing things and it makes it really simple for us.

42

00:02:55.200  -->  00:03:00.630
It makes the method as property so we can access method as a property.

43

00:03:00.660  -->  00:03:01.880
So it's pretty cool.

44

00:03:01.920  -->  00:03:05.050
You know these are this is we're we're now doing something like this there.

45

00:03:05.490  -->  00:03:06.430
OK.

46

00:03:06.950  -->  00:03:07.630
All right.

47

00:03:07.890  -->  00:03:08.790
But that's how it is.

48

00:03:08.790  -->  00:03:18.640
So now let's go back to the model the user model actually and this create function.

49

00:03:18.720  -->  00:03:21.000
And we can name it whatever we want to remember there.

50

00:03:21.000  -->  00:03:21.480
OK.

51

00:03:21.510  -->  00:03:27.790
Sometimes I repeat myself a lot and that's because I wanted this information to be there for you.

52

00:03:27.840  -->  00:03:31.200
Some of you my forgetting a couple more lectures some of you will never forget.

53

00:03:31.200  -->  00:03:34.000
But I want to be sure that you don't forget.

54

00:03:34.170  -->  00:03:41.120
So this has a maney is the new med that we are going to be using to do that one too many.

55

00:03:41.340  -->  00:03:47.120
And now we find the space the name space just like we did here.

56

00:03:47.430  -->  00:03:48.190
OK.

57

00:03:48.540  -->  00:03:52.040
So let's go back to routes and let's check it out.

58

00:03:52.290  -->  00:03:57.570
We find the user would have the number one and then we return all the user suppose we want to return

59

00:03:57.570  -->  00:04:02.820
all the polls titles for every pause our user has.

60

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:04.080
OK.

61

00:04:04.470  -->  00:04:05.160
And

62

00:04:08.580  -->  00:04:10.070
now I think I already did it.

63

00:04:10.080  -->  00:04:11.310
But I want you to do.

64

00:04:11.370  -->  00:04:15.260
Actually no I only have one.

65

00:04:15.360  -->  00:04:18.250
Let's create another role here.

66

00:04:18.510  -->  00:04:24.580
So let's insert another post with a user ID number one THP

67

00:04:27.210  -->  00:04:28.700
with Claribel

68

00:04:34.530  -->  00:04:35.430
content

69

00:04:48.620  -->  00:04:50.400
and everything else should be this.

70

00:04:50.430  -->  00:04:51.580
That's fine.

71

00:04:51.630  -->  00:04:54.150
So now we can pool two guys out right.

72

00:04:54.200  -->  00:04:56.510
We can pull two polls.

73

00:04:56.940  -->  00:04:58.560
All right.

74

00:04:58.560  -->  00:04:59.610
So let's see how this looks.

75

00:04:59.610  -->  00:05:06.570
First of all let's put let's make this an echo because we can actually return more than one value.

76

00:05:06.570  -->  00:05:08.050
Like I said before.

77

00:05:08.250  -->  00:05:10.260
So let's do a b or tag right here.

78

00:05:10.620  -->  00:05:10.910
OK.

79

00:05:10.920  -->  00:05:13.920
Let's check it out.

80

00:05:16.120  -->  00:05:16.650
There we go.

81

00:05:16.650  -->  00:05:22.650
As you can see we are returning to titles because we have to pause with a user ID with the same user

82

00:05:22.650  -->  00:05:26.220
ID if I wanted to return this.

83

00:05:26.440  -->  00:05:28.150
I'm saying we are echoing something.

84

00:05:28.170  -->  00:05:29.950
That's what I meant to say now returning.

85

00:05:29.970  -->  00:05:33.930
But if I do that I only return one title.

86

00:05:33.940  -->  00:05:35.110
See that.

87

00:05:35.880  -->  00:05:39.140
So make sure that you are doing ekal.

88

00:05:39.360  -->  00:05:40.060
All right.

89

00:05:40.200  -->  00:05:43.080
So now we know how to deal with one to many relationship.

90

00:05:43.080  -->  00:05:48.230
Let's make a comment here one to many relationship.

91

00:05:48.790  -->  00:05:49.580
OK.

92

00:05:49.860  -->  00:05:50.390
Beautiful.

93

00:05:50.460  -->  00:05:52.050
Thank you so much for watching guys.

94

00:05:52.070  -->  00:05:54.660
Is being a pleasure on the next lecture.

95

00:05:54.810  -->  00:05:59.260
We'll continue with our relationship and we'll keep enjoying this course right.

96

00:05:59.550  -->  00:05:59.990
Take care.

97

00:06:00.000  -->  00:06:00.930
See you in the next lecture
