00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.680
All right welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.680  -->  00:00:04.290
So today we're going to learn about how what is good.

3

00:00:04.320  -->  00:00:11.340
Well get up if you look it up online give up his online project holstering using good that's what it

4

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:11.520
is.

5

00:00:11.520  -->  00:00:17.090
His online project hosting this Web site right here Coalgate hub will host your project.

6

00:00:17.130  -->  00:00:20.480
But not only that but he would give you a lot of tools that you can use.

7

00:00:20.710  -->  00:00:24.230
And in a lot of tools that older people can use to contribute to your project.

8

00:00:24.230  -->  00:00:29.730
So let's say I want to build the next Facebook I create this new LaRocco installation and I push it

9

00:00:29.730  -->  00:00:33.810
to get hub using my command line and we're going to learn that and I'm in a little bit.

10

00:00:33.870  -->  00:00:36.890
We push it in to get help is available to the public.

11

00:00:37.110  -->  00:00:41.720
And you know that people can come and say listen you have a nice project can I contribute.

12

00:00:41.880  -->  00:00:44.020
I think I can help you out this new feature.

13

00:00:44.280  -->  00:00:46.110
And then they help you out a new feature.

14

00:00:46.110  -->  00:00:50.430
And if you like it you can accept that feature or not accept it you see.

15

00:00:50.440  -->  00:00:55.410
So not only can you push Prodgers and hosta there but you can put it so that people can contribute you

16

00:00:55.410  -->  00:01:02.280
can also have private repositories where you know anybody can look at the only people that you select

17

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:03.990
can contribute.

18

00:01:04.020  -->  00:01:11.730
So now free repositories I mean the public repositories are free private repositories are cost money

19

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:13.320
but they don't cost much.

20

00:01:13.320  -->  00:01:13.830
All right.

21

00:01:13.830  -->  00:01:18.080
You can have organizations you can have teams working on projects.

22

00:01:18.120  -->  00:01:21.350
I mean it's a has a lot of feature guys.

23

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:27.690
Now the first step for you would be to sign up is free sign up because you're going to need to sign

24

00:01:27.690  -->  00:01:27.830
up.

25

00:01:27.840  -->  00:01:32.520
That's what we're going to do in this lecture we're going to sign up I'm going to sign in on mine so

26

00:01:32.520  -->  00:01:35.940
positively re-assigning on yours and sign up with yours.

27

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:39.140
I'm going to sign in with my personal help account.

28

00:01:39.330  -->  00:01:46.110
I created one for this course right cause I have another gap account under a totally different name

29

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:47.610
that you would never imagine.

30

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:55.570
So that's why I'm not showing it right here because it's just a totally different name than my courses

31

00:01:55.740  -->  00:01:57.290
or my name anyway.

32

00:01:57.360  -->  00:02:02.580
So once you have the dash for here you're going to have a green bar and somewhere right now and this

33

00:02:03.360  -->  00:02:07.560
time that we are recording this video that bungs right here or maybe in the future we'll be here or

34

00:02:07.560  -->  00:02:08.880
here or anywhere.

35

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:10.230
They all change this interface.

36

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:13.430
One of these days the core concept is the same.

37

00:02:13.430  -->  00:02:19.510
You create a new repository which is going to be free and we can name it whatever we want.

38

00:02:19.530  -->  00:02:23.100
What are we going to name it we're going to name it.

39

00:02:24.040  -->  00:02:27.790
We're learning good or good.

40

00:02:28.550  -->  00:02:31.300
I'm going to name a good course.

41

00:02:31.320  -->  00:02:37.180
All right you can put a description if you want and it tells you that is available if it's not available

42

00:02:37.180  -->  00:02:37.200
.

43

00:02:37.200  -->  00:02:45.230
He's going to tell you it is going to give you a read sign or something you're read like let's say five

44

00:02:45.230  -->  00:02:46.170
dollar bill.

45

00:02:46.170  -->  00:02:53.780
Let me see that when he's available I guess he's available is checking to see also uses this.

46

00:02:53.820  -->  00:02:59.250
So that's where you can create basically anything if you don't already have the repository.

47

00:02:59.310  -->  00:03:02.190
If you don't have it is going to give you a green checkmark.

48

00:03:02.280  -->  00:03:05.750
So let's just say good of course.

49

00:03:06.090  -->  00:03:08.130
And he's going to be public.

50

00:03:08.130  -->  00:03:11.030
We're going to say create repository now is created.

51

00:03:11.350  -->  00:03:11.950
All right.

52

00:03:12.240  -->  00:03:18.090
So now if you go back to it if you go back to your dashboard click in the symbol here you have this

53

00:03:18.090  -->  00:03:25.230
new repository right here on parly repository or private repository I have private because I have a

54

00:03:25.230  -->  00:03:30.070
paid account but you should have this here.

55

00:03:30.120  -->  00:03:30.610
All right.

56

00:03:30.650  -->  00:03:38.690
On the next lecture we're going to learn how to clone repositories into your computer how to push.

57

00:03:38.760  -->  00:03:39.070
I don't know.

58

00:03:39.070  -->  00:03:42.530
We're going to do that in the next lecture at a push projects in together.

59

00:03:42.750  -->  00:03:44.940
But we'll get to that in the next lectures OK.

60

00:03:44.970  -->  00:03:48.180
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures.
