00:00:00.120  -->  00:00:01.770
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:02.300
My research.

3

00:00:02.310  -->  00:00:08.400
This is Edwin Diaz again with another beautiful tutorial or lecture.

4

00:00:08.400  -->  00:00:13.800
All right well in today's lecture we are going to be learning how to update or right using the many

5

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:15.200
to many relationship.

6

00:00:15.210  -->  00:00:16.830
So let's open our eyes the E.

7

00:00:16.830  -->  00:00:18.210
And I said it correctly this time.

8

00:00:18.210  -->  00:00:19.200
I d e.

9

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:20.630
Not just an editor.

10

00:00:20.940  -->  00:00:23.300
This is a powerful powerful powerful stuff.

11

00:00:23.310  -->  00:00:29.000
But anyway let's go and learn how to update.

12

00:00:29.280  -->  00:00:31.620
I hope I didn't say read.

13

00:00:31.950  -->  00:00:36.590
All right this is a lecture for learning how to update so I'm going to create a route and I got a call

14

00:00:36.590  -->  00:00:41.820
an update and here I'm going to show you a really cool thing that you probably did not know that you

15

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:43.740
could do with Ababil.

16

00:00:43.920  -->  00:00:47.220
All right we've done something similar but not like this.

17

00:00:47.220  -->  00:00:47.940
All right.

18

00:00:48.330  -->  00:00:53.370
So of course we find the user so that way we can find it's relationship.

19

00:00:53.370  -->  00:00:55.350
So we say fine or fail.

20

00:00:55.410  -->  00:00:57.700
I want you to get used to doing that one.

21

00:00:58.470  -->  00:00:59.520
All right cool.

22

00:00:59.640  -->  00:01:00.490
Find the user.

23

00:01:00.550  -->  00:01:01.460
We got other user.

24

00:01:01.460  -->  00:01:03.040
Now look at this.

25

00:01:03.060  -->  00:01:05.140
Now let's find out if the user has a role.

26

00:01:05.160  -->  00:01:08.370
So I'm going to say if user has

27

00:01:11.460  -->  00:01:18.870
rules now this is a method here that we can use to find out if the user has a relationship.

28

00:01:19.300  -->  00:01:19.750
OK.

29

00:01:19.800  -->  00:01:23.160
Has or it could have anything.

30

00:01:23.160  -->  00:01:29.190
Well if you go into the committee and look for that key word for that functionality Dometic could tell

31

00:01:29.190  -->  00:01:31.460
you other things as well.

32

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:37.380
I think this mentor could find other besides relationship we can find other things if you put it with

33

00:01:37.380  -->  00:01:41.690
something else you use it as another as a function or something like that.

34

00:01:41.760  -->  00:01:42.300
All right.

35

00:01:42.420  -->  00:01:46.100
But I know we can do this if a user has roles.

36

00:01:46.120  -->  00:01:52.620
All right then what we're going to do is we're going to loop through through that rule because remember

37

00:01:52.620  -->  00:01:58.170
now is a collection user roles as role.

38

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:02.960
And I bet you did not know this.

39

00:02:03.030  -->  00:02:03.730
All right.

40

00:02:03.990  -->  00:02:09.120
Let's actually even check this out real quick before I show you.

41

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:10.080
Let's do this.

42

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:19.620
If the wrong name equals two administrator and I don't know if it is right now let's just look at it

43

00:02:19.630  -->  00:02:19.800
.

44

00:02:19.950  -->  00:02:26.970
Let's go to bitchery my admen right here is my man.

45

00:02:26.970  -->  00:02:30.600
All right so let's check the many to many.

46

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:33.270
The rule is many should have would a capital A.

47

00:02:33.380  -->  00:02:42.480
OK so if this administrator with a capital A will uppercase a then what I want to do is I want to change

48

00:02:42.480  -->  00:02:46.940
the string and I grabbed the wrong name.

49

00:02:47.020  -->  00:02:51.790
Whoops Geez the wrong name.

50

00:02:51.990  -->  00:02:52.730
Wow.

51

00:02:53.070  -->  00:02:56.160
And I want to create a lowercase

52

00:02:59.100  -->  00:03:00.050
name.

53

00:03:00.060  -->  00:03:05.590
Now of course I could use a function of BHB function.

54

00:03:05.610  -->  00:03:07.210
Your SDR.

55

00:03:07.760  -->  00:03:08.070
I

56

00:03:10.910  -->  00:03:12.560
see you are two little words.

57

00:03:12.860  -->  00:03:18.850
And I could make what if this was a diner variable or something like that would pull it out right.

58

00:03:19.140  -->  00:03:22.470
I could just put it right here and we'll make it a lowercase for me.

59

00:03:22.470  -->  00:03:28.510
But in this case just demonstrating something.

60

00:03:29.220  -->  00:03:35.370
And we have a couple of other helper functions from Clarabelle as well which is really cool array that

61

00:03:35.370  -->  00:03:41.160
we can do allow a lot of things to make more sense than native BHB by the way.

62

00:03:41.160  -->  00:03:49.200
All right so once we change a role or we have to do is call that statement on the model that say okay

63

00:03:49.530  -->  00:03:50.080
look at that.

64

00:03:50.220  -->  00:03:52.320
That's beautiful.

65

00:03:52.320  -->  00:03:58.690
All right so we know that we know that A has it all uppercase a let's all let's make it sort of it's

66

00:03:58.700  -->  00:04:02.290
something different like this of scriber.

67

00:04:02.520  -->  00:04:05.290
That way you know exactly that word.

68

00:04:05.360  -->  00:04:11.910
OK let's see if we can find the browser lacking and outsing update.

69

00:04:11.910  -->  00:04:13.140
All right.

70

00:04:13.730  -->  00:04:16.510
Well there we go update.

71

00:04:16.560  -->  00:04:18.230
Enter La.

72

00:04:18.630  -->  00:04:19.360
Cool.

73

00:04:19.890  -->  00:04:24.590
Let's go and get it right here.

74

00:04:24.630  -->  00:04:28.740
Too many too many

75

00:04:31.770  -->  00:04:32.700
rules.

76

00:04:32.940  -->  00:04:35.490
And as you can see he has been change.

77

00:04:35.820  -->  00:04:37.290
Subscriber.

78

00:04:37.290  -->  00:04:38.860
Beautiful.

79

00:04:39.360  -->  00:04:40.160
Right.

80

00:04:40.530  -->  00:04:41.660
So as you can see you can.

81

00:04:41.670  -->  00:04:43.390
There's a lot of things that you can do a lot of.

82

00:04:43.410  -->  00:04:44.560
You can even put it.

83

00:04:44.700  -->  00:04:46.620
Of course we're worst any way you want.

84

00:04:46.620  -->  00:04:53.130
I mean as you can see you would get the collection and we get the object of that collection and we grab

85

00:04:53.130  -->  00:04:58.790
it by its property in a sign of a different value and then use the Save method in that model to save

86

00:04:58.790  -->  00:04:59.290
it.

87

00:04:59.670  -->  00:05:00.300
Beautiful.

88

00:05:00.300  -->  00:05:01.960
I mean does it really get better than that.

89

00:05:02.040  -->  00:05:03.120
Easy.

90

00:05:03.420  -->  00:05:03.970
All right.

91

00:05:04.110  -->  00:05:06.330
So anyway thank you so much for watching guys.

92

00:05:06.330  -->  00:05:07.120
It's a pleasure.

93

00:05:07.140  -->  00:05:11.790
Always remember that you can look this up in the documentation any time.

94

00:05:11.790  -->  00:05:14.520
Just look for links in your sections.

95

00:05:14.520  -->  00:05:15.050
Take care
