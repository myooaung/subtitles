00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.523
Hi.

2
00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:07.626
This is Craig Golightly, and welcome to Deploying to Elastic Kubernetes Service.

3
00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:10.693
Let's go through the demo application on AWS.

4
00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:14.156
We're going to open an account and show all of the

5
00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:16.273
commands step by step for creating, updating,

6
00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:19.984
and scaling your app on Kubernetes so you can go back and

7
00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:22.571
follow along in your own AWS account.

8
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:25.715
We'll check out the AWS web console,

9
00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:29.105
including the monitoring and billing information you can get there.

10
00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:29.436
Finally,

11
00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:33.236
we'll go through how to delete your cluster so you don't have any

12
00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:36.925
leftover resources adding to your monthly bill.

13
00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:42.205
To open and Amazon Web Services account, go to aws.amazon .com.

14
00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:45.806
You'll need to provide an email, name and address,

15
00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:47.933
and valid credit card information.

16
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.061
You'll also need a mobile phone number where you can

17
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.872
receive a code to verify the account.

18
00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:59.125
Let's switch to a web browser and create an AWS account.

19
00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:04.610
Go to aws.amazon .com and select Create an AWS Account.

20
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.781
Enter your email address, create a password,

21
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:11.548
and choose a name for your AWS account.

22
00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:14.433
Select Professional or Personal, then enter your name,

23
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.247
phone number, and address.

24
00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:20.590
Confirm the agreement, then select Create Account and Continue.

25
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.685
Enter your credit card information.

26
00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:26.374
You'll confirm your identity with a mobile phone number where you can

27
00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:30.732
receive a confirmation code and the robot security check.

28
00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:34.481
Check your mobile device for the verification code, then select Verify Code.

29
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:36.340
Select a support plan.

30
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.759
You can always go back and change this later.

31
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.408
I'm just going to go with the Free plan for now.

32
00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:44.661
Now you're ready to sign into the console.

33
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.063
Use the email address associated with your account,

34
00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:50.646
and the password you created.

35
00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.710
Now that you have an account created, let's initialize the tooling.

36
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.228
First, you'll install the AWS CLI.

37
00:01:57.228 --> 00:02:00.639
In the exercise files I've included a link to installation

38
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:03.156
instructions for different operating systems.

39
00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:08.635
Note that the AWS CLI required Python and you'll also need an access key

40
00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:13.406
and secret from your AWS account to configure the CLI.

41
00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:16.657
Next, you'll install the aws-iam-authenticator.

42
00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:17.237
Finally,

43
00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:23.471
eksctl; this is a tool that helps manage cloud formation stacks for

44
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:25.726
different aspects of your Kubernetes cluster.

45
00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:29.359
Confirm that you have Python in your environment.

46
00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.464
I'm on an Ubuntu machine so I'll update,

47
00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:35.434
then install the AWS CLI through apt get.

48
00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:41.130
You can confirm the installation by running aws --version.

49
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.835
From the AWS web console, select the username, then My Security Credentials.

50
00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.506
Confirm that you want to continue.

51
00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:53.351
Under Access keys, select Create New Access Key.

52
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.753
Note that in a production scenario you would not want to

53
00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:59.145
create an access key for your root user.

54
00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:04.738
Download the key file, then you will see an access key id and a secret key.

55
00:03:04.738 --> 00:03:07.734
To configure the CLI, run aws configure,

56
00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:12.112
then enter the access key and secret access key when prompted.

57
00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:14.840
You can also configure a default region name.

58
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.189
From the AWS console, select on the region,

59
00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.099
then you can see the region name next to each region.

60
00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.180
I'm going to use us-east-1.

61
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.032
Finally you can specify a default output format; I'll choose json.

62
00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:33.586
There are different options to install the AWS IAM

63
00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:36.339
Authenticator based on your operating system.

64
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:42.725
You can verify the installation by running aws-iam-authenticator help.

65
00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:45.602
Next, install eksctl.

66
00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:45.840
Again,

67
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.000
I've included links in the exercise files with instructions on how to do this. You can verify your installation by running eksctl version.
