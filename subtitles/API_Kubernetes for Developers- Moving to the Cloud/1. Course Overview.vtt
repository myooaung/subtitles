(Music) Hi everyone.

2
00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:10.090
My name is Craig Golightly, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.657
Kubernetes for Developers: Moving to the Cloud.

4
00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.138
I am a senior software consultant.

5
00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:18.620
You've created a Kubernetes app, and you're ready to run it in the cloud,

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.762
but where do you start?

7
00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.268
How do you determine the appropriate option for your needs.

8
00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:23.862
In this course,

9
00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.448
we are going to set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy an app on

10
00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:31.491
three major cloud providers so you can experience the process from

11
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:34.205
start to finish and see how easy it is.

12
00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.796
Some of the major topics that we will cover include:

13
00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:39.296
evaluating cloud options for Kubernetes,

14
00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:45.025
Azure Kubernetes Service for Microsoft, Elastic Kubernetes Service from AWS,

15
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.004
and Google Kubernetes Engine from Google Cloud.

16
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:49.204
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:52.652
you will be able to deploy and update a basic Kubernetes

18
00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:57.170
application running in a managed cloud service.

19
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.807
Before beginning the course,

20
00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.670
you should be familiar with Docker and Kubernetes and have an

21
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.900
environment with Docker and kubectl installed.

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.611
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about running your

23
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:15.000
Kubernetes app in the cloud with the Kubernetes for Developers: Moving to the Cloud course at Pluralsight.
