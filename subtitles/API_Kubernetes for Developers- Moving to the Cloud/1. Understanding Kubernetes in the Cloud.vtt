00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.236
Hi, this is Craig Golightly,

2
00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:06.733
and welcome to Kubernetes for Developers: Moving to the Cloud.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.577
When we talk about running in the cloud,

4
00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:12.069
we're talking about running your application on the hardware and

5
00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.279
infrastructure of a cloud service provider.

6
00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.191
These providers take care of securing a datacenter

7
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.525
location with the proper power and cooling,

8
00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:22.339
and setting up the physical machines, switches,

9
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.767
routers, firewalls,

10
00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.484
and internet bandwidth to support an extremely large number of customers.

11
00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:30.872
They take care of the physical security at the datacenter itself,

12
00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.999
as well as securing all of the equipment within the

13
00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.746
datacenter down to the last hard drive.

14
00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:40.932
They are also paying for the 24/7/365 staff to monitor and

15
00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:44.833
maintain all of these physical and virtual resources.

16
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:45.570
So basically,

17
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.409
everything that is required behind the scenes to actually run your application.

18
00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.970
In exchange, you will pay a small amount,

19
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.510
usually per second, for the resources you use when you use them.

20
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.833
Technically,

21
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.147
there are a couple of different ways you could run Kubernetes in the cloud.

22
00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:05.141
The first would be to set up your own Kubernetes

23
00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.411
infrastructure using cloud machines.

24
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:11.429
This would require expertise in the setup and administration of Kubernetes.

25
00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.296
You would need Kubernetes administration staff to maintain the Kubernetes

26
00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:18.083
infrastructure that you would use to run your application.

27
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.736
This is different than maintaining your application.

28
00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.315
Let me say that again.

29
00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.328
The Kubernetes cluster is separate from your

30
00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:29.230
application and requires its own maintenance,

31
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.749
troubleshooting, and optimization so that it can actually run your application.

32
00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.132
The other option is managed Kubernetes.

33
00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:41.102
This is where the cloud provider takes care of the underlying setup,

34
00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:41.557
maintenance,

35
00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:44.972
and troubleshooting of the actual Kubernetes infrastructure so that you can

36
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:49.364
simply use Kubernetes clusters to run your application.

37
00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:53.344
There are several advantage to using the Managed Kubernetes option.

38
00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:54.566
First, speed.

39
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.622
Kubernetes is ready to go.

40
00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:00.974
In this course you are going to see how quickly you can set up an account and

41
00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:05.307
have an application running on a managed Kubernetes cluster.

42
00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:06.135
Next, simplicity.

43
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:09.231
You can focus on your app, not Kubernetes,

44
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:13.560
and know that teams of experts are making sure your clusters can

45
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.305
stay up to date with features and security.

46
00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:17.688
Finally, scale.

47
00:02:17.688 --> 00:02:20.454
As your application grows,

48
00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:23.506
additional nodes and storage resources are ready and available

49
00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:26.449
for you to use when you need to use them.

50
00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.332
You'll have different options out of the box to ensure you have high

51
00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:34.262
availability and high throughput for your application.

52
00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:35.109
Then there's cost.

53
00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.003
Just by moving to the cloud, whether do-it-yourself or managed,

54
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.551
you get the advantage of pay-as-you-go pricing to start

55
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:44.311
running your application right away.

56
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.673
You won't need millions of dollars and several months to build up

57
00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:49.821
everything yourself just to launch your app,

58
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:53.154
and if your application has seasonal or periodic bursts,

59
00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.813
then drops in activity,

60
00:02:54.813 --> 00:02:58.590
you can scale down your cluster so you're not paying for idle resources.

61
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.505
With managed Kubernetes, you get all of the advantages of cloud,

62
00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:06.779
plus some cloud providers are only charging you for the compute and

63
00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.752
networking resources you actually use in your cluster,

64
00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:13.085
not for kube Master and other Kubernetes infrastructure

65
00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:16.029
overhead that is needed for the service to run.

66
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.045
These things tend to change often so be sure to check the pricing for

67
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.275
each cloud provider for current pricing models.

68
00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:27.087
Some providers also offer a serverless option where pods are

69
00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:31.431
provisioned to a service that provides resources on demand so there

70
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:34.336
is 0 VM machines to manage for your node pool.

71
00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:36.213
Depending on your requirements,

72
00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:39.660
that could be a good fit and reduce costs and overhead for

73
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.930
your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.

74
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.288
An important thing to be aware of as you move forward with

75
00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:49.924
Kubernetes in the cloud is how costs are calculated.

76
00:03:49.924 --> 00:03:53.678
Most cloud providers offer reserved instance discounts on nodes that

77
00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:56.494
you are going to use for an extended period of time,

78
00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:58.307
usually 1 to 3 years.

79
00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:03.349
This is purely an accounting concept tied to a particular node type,

80
00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.891
not an actual physical node.

81
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.510
For example, if you have purchased one reserved instance,

82
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.803
then one of your running instances of that type is billed at

83
00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:15.410
a lower rate than the on-demand price.

84
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.341
Using reserved instances can significantly reduce your monthly bill,

85
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:23.011
depending on how many nodes you are running all of the time.

86
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.729
It's not something to worry about as you get started,

87
00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.860
but once you are actively using Kubernetes in the cloud,

88
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.192
you will definitely want to look into it.

89
00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:35.280
We'll be looking at Managed Kubernetes services from

90
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.332
three different cloud providers.

91
00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.200
We're covering these in alphabetical order by the name of

92
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.122
the their Managed Kubernetes service.

93
00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:44.193
This is to clarify that we aren't playing favorites here.

94
00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:48.029
This isn't a ranked list or order of recommendation or anything like that,

95
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.898
it's just that someone has to be first so the dictionary

96
00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:52.678
seems like a good model to follow.

97
00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:58.825
We'll cover Microsoft Azure with the Azure Kubernetes Service or AKS,

98
00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:03.537
Amazon Web Services with the Elastic Kubernetes Service or EKS,

99
00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:08.610
and Google Cloud platform with the Google Kubernetes Engine or GKE.

100
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:17.000
To highlight the similarities and differences of the cloud providers, we'll use the same demo app to deploy to each managed Kubernetes cluster.
