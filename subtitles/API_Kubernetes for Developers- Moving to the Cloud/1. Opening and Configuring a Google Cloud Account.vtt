Hi.

2
00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:07.004
This is Craig Golightly, and welcome to Deploying to Google Kubernetes Engine.

3
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.536
Let's go through the demo application on Google Cloud Platform.

4
00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:13.531
We're going to open an account and show all of the

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.340
commands step by step for creating, updating,

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.159
and scaling your app on Kubernetes so you can go back and

7
00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.627
follow along in your own GCP account.

8
00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:23.192
We'll check out the web console,

9
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:27.810
including the monitoring and billing information you can get there.

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.954
Finally,

11
00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.309
we'll go through how to delete your cluster so you don't have any

12
00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.215
leftover resources adding to your monthly bill.

13
00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:37.274
To open a Google Cloud account, go to cloud.google .com.

14
00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:40.733
You'll need a Google account, either Gmail or G Suite.

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.690
If you don't have one,

16
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.594
you can create a Google account as part of the sign-up process,

17
00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:48.562
but you'll need a mobile phone number for that.

18
00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:51.005
For the Google Cloud account, you'll also need a name and address,

19
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.416
as well as credit card information to verify the account.

20
00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:59.354
Go to cloud.google .com and click Get Started for Free.

21
00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:03.172
If you have a Google account, you'll sign in here.

22
00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:08.812
If not, you can click Create Account and walk through the process there.

23
00:01:08.812 --> 00:01:09.565
Select your country.

24
00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:12.171
You can choose Individual or Business account,

25
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.422
then it will ask for a name and address for this account.

26
00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:19.255
You'll fill in your credit or debit card information so

27
00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:24.334
that they can verify the account, then click Start My Free Trial.

28
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.420
Now that you have an account created, let's initialize the tooling.

29
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.120
First, you'll need to enable the Kubernetes Engine API.

30
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.257
This will allow connections from the command line interface to

31
00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:38.989
Google Kubernetes Engine in your account.

32
00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:39.353
Next,

33
00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:43.501
you'll install the Google SDK G Cloud on the system you want to

34
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.770
use to interact with your Google Cloud Account.

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.666
Finally, you'll configure the gcloud CLI to match the account,

36
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:54.383
project, and region you want to use.

37
00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:56.857
To enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API,

38
00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:01.680
simply search for GKE on the Google Cloud Platform web console,

39
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.358
then select Kubernetes Engine.

40
00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:06.012
Notice that the Kubernetes Engine API is being enabled

41
00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:08.374
as we visit this for the first time.

42
00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:10.703
Okay, now it's ready to go.

43
00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:14.220
You're going to need Python for the Google CLI so make

44
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.705
sure that's installed on your machine.

45
00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:20.321
Next, download the appropriate cloud SDK for your operating system.

46
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:23.689
I'm on a Linux machine so I'll download that one.

47
00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.371
I've included links to the documentation in the exercise files.

48
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.097
Next, I'll run the install script.

49
00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:34.330
There may be different options depending upon your operating system.

50
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.220
Once you've got that, run gcloud init.

51
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.735
You'll need to allow the Google Cloud SDK access to

52
00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:43.137
your account so you can review these, accept,

53
00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:46.580
and get the code to complete the initialization.

54
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.602
Your account comes with a project that was created by

55
00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:52.262
default; I'm going to use that one.

56
00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:54.312
You can also configure your geographic zone.

57
00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:57.570
In general, use something that is close to you.

58
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.890
Gcloud projects list will list all of the projects

59
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.620
and the project id in your account.

60
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.890
Since we'll be using the project id quite a bit,

61
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm going to make an environment variable for that to simplify some of the commands.
