00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
Let's take a look at the A P I that we're trying to build as women that are application is

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.700
about e commerce application.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.410
One of the modules off e commerce application is to be able to manage product details,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.320
So we're going to expose a product a B I and somebody can actually manipulate with the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.750
resources by using following your batons along with that stupid methods.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.680
If somebody sends a request to product isn't get,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.980
they must be ableto see all the list off products.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.240
If somebody sends,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.190
I get request with unidentified air as a part variable,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.850
then they must be able to see details off a specific product with that specific I D.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.350
And if we send a post request to the same mural along with records perimeters,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.150
then we should be able to create a product.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.610
And in kids,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.950
if we wanted to update an existing product,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.050
we would use the put method to do the same.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.610
And in our FBI contacts,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.550
Objects on has the input,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.090
not a top date,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.970
a resource,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.510
and finally we will perform the delete operation using the yesterday Padilla.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.140
It mattered,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.140
so we will be able to delete a specific product with a specific I D and the idea would be

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.850
passed as a part of edible.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.710
I hope it makes sense.
