00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Let's talk about part extension,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.000
way off content,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.470
negotiation by default.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.040
That feature is disabled,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.300
and if you want to enable it,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.430
just have to have this property inside your application or properties file any to set this

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.580
flag to True.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.800
From this point on,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.350
it should be able to do content negotiation with extensions.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.350
And this will have presidents or the other two methods that we had talked when I tried to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.690
test our application.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.050
After configuring this,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.790
I noticed that our application is not working as expected.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.700
When I checked with one off my associate,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.320
he conform me that this is an existing bug in spring framework,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.050
and the team is actively looking at fixing it.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.700
But ideally,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.980
it should be able to append an extension like dot Jason or example,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.850
or pdf or whatever.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.120
And accordingly,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.770
you should be able to see the response in specified format.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.280
You can give it a try.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.510
Maybe by the time you're watching this video,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.250
it may have got fixed,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450
but do make sure that you got the latest washing off spring frame book
