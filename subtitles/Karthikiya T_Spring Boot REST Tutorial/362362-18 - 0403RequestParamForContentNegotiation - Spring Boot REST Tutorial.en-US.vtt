00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Let's take a look at how we can make use off.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.390
Request perimeter for content Negotiation by default.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.450
This feature is disabled,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.770
so we have to enable it with our configuration.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.730
If you're not using spring boot and you're developing spring applications the traditional

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.170
way,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.810
then you have to introduce quite a bit of configurations.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.750
Edgerrin Java Contra Gar in XML conflict.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.530
But with spring boot,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.650
things are going to be a lot easier.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.490
All you have to do is to add this properties inside application,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.610
not properties File.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.400
If you created the project isn't spring toe suit.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.800
You should be able to look at this file under resources folder.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.100
So with this property,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.750
we're trying to enable that feature.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.260
And with this property we can customize the name off that Param Eter.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.060
This is optional.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.130
If you don't specify this property,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.050
the default name would be format.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.860
But in this case,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890
the perimeter name has to be media type.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.310
Let's take a look at how we can use it.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.750
Let's relaunch our application.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:26.750
Got a postman this time I'm going to include this as a perimeter.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.960
Currently,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.490
I have Hester DP headers as well,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.250
and I'm tryingto except XML as the format.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.750
But let's see what's going to happen if I use a perimeter and make it Jason.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.900
Well,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.150
it looks like if you use the perimeter,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.160
then this will have preference over yesterday.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.950
Beheaders.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.360
So if I change the stool X Emma response Woodberry presented an XML format regardless off

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.610
what you configure in here.
