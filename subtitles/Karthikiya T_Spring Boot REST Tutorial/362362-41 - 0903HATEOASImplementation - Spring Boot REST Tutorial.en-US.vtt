00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So let's take a look at the running application that uses studios,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.800
um,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.250
equals walk you through the end result.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.320
With this year,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.750
I'm going to fetch all the list off products available,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.650
and the AP is going to respond back with all the list off products in Jason format.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.450
And if you notice each and every product have those links that correspond to that product.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.050
And in the end,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.270
we have a link that corresponds to this response.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.280
Would yourself so if I click this link and send the request that would yield the same

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.750
result What you're seeing in here.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.730
So let's click on one off this products I would like to populate protect with i d one.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.400
Let me send the request and for the sake of this demonstration of actually added a couple

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:06.780
off reviews for this product and hit all day and even give you objects,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.750
have some links that I feel are relevant.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.140
What is a product toe,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.010
which this rebuke,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.960
a response to and the other is self,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.420
which,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.250
if you click and send request,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.090
would yield the same result.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.120
So let's take a look at the code.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.350
First,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.570
let's try to explore what's happening with this?

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.180
You are I.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.250
So here we have the get products method,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.600
which will ultimately respond back with all the list of products.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.120
Along with that,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.950
we're also trying to populate the link.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.410
Hence is we're not just responding back with products.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.310
We have to rob the response with this additional link or links.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.500
For that reason,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.710
I have to use one of the classes available as part of the Hadiya's library,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.050
which is resources.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.550
And what this does is exactly what it describes a general helper toe easily create a rapper

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.630
for collection of entities.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.560
In this case,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.980
we have products which are collection of entities,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.090
and we want to wrap with some additional links,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.740
and that's what we're trying to respond back with.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.950
And here is the link that you just saw.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.060
And again,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.030
I'm using the Link Builder class to dynamically populate the You are a essentially,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.970
I'm trying to call the exact same method so this mapping would be populated as part of the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.850
response.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.890
And once after I click one off these products,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.460
you would get a response that looks like this,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.150
and this is something we had already explored.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.980
We pretty much have the same chord that we talked about earlier.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.970
We extended the class and that included all these links.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.920
This line here is a bad practice,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.290
and we're doing good here.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.150
So every time our a P is going to respond back with this object,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.160
that object would be wrapped with all this additional links.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.710
And finally,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.850
let's also take a look at the review spot,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:39.630
which is this So for this purpose of actually created another Beau Jo,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.220
they're correspond to product reviews and difficult.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.420
This would be an entity,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.290
since we're not using any database or anything of that sort.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.110
We don't have any foreign key mapping,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.890
etcetera.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.050
So I had to add everything explicitly.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.670
Let me go to the controller.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.390
And here is the method to fetch all the list of reviews.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.460
And if you take a look at the implementation,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.790
have manually populated the reviews in this manner,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.380
not catching it from a database.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.150
Ultimately,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.370
I'm using the same approach that I had used in gets off,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:29.810
get products in order to do send back list off reviews that goes born to the specified

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.350
product.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.650
I hope it makes sense
