00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
in this chapter,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.790
we're going to talk about hot Eos or some people pronounce it as hate aureus as if they're

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.770
hitting operating system whichever way you pronounce it here.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.060
Is that provision off the same?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.440
It's hyper media's engine off application state.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm pretty sure that this does not make any sense to you at this point.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.530
Months after I walk you through a real time scenario where hot ears can be useful and the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.230
problem that it is trying to solve,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.290
you will have a better picture off what disease and you will know when to use it and how to

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.880
use it.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.600
So let's try to understand hot deals with the real time scenario.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530
Imagine that you visited an e commerce website,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.850
something like Amazon here be shown with some products on the home page.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.180
He would click on one of those products,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.200
and then you'd be taken to a product specific page with some product specific actions like

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.650
had to cut by.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.250
Now are reviews.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.450
If you would like to check the reviews off the product,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.310
if you really contributes,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.680
you'd be taken to yet another view with all the list off reviews that corresponds to that

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.440
particular product behind the scenes the way it works is the moment you visit the website.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.270
Declined.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.970
Application would make a rest API call using this new or a baton,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.450
which would return list of products from the server and would be rendered on the U I.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.110
And once you choose one of the products,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.180
Este protocol would be made to the server with the product i D,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.550
which will fetch product specific information.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.980
And then if you click on reviews,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.240
the plant will make yet another rest.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.490
API.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.850
I call and retrieve review specific to that particular product.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.590
We have a couple of problems in here.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.670
The first problem is your heart courting the You are a patents in this manner,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.350
which means if there is any change on the silver side and there is change in this Patton,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.590
then that's going to break the client application.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.920
This is a problem because this is going to while it one of the principals off rest FBI were

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.650
client and server needs to evolve independently.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.100
If you hard court,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.280
you are in this manner then obviously changing that you are a baton on the solar side is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.350
not going to let the client application evolve and is going to break the application,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.350
which is clearly a problem.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.920
Another problem is not every time you want to render all these buttons.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.720
For example,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.770
what if the product when daughter off stock then you don't want to highlight or enabled by

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.540
now and add to cart button?

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.950
Just want to let the user see the reviews.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.210
Or maybe you don't want to allow the operation off by now are at to cut.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.850
If the user hasn't logged in,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.460
you want alot these operations to be present only to the logged in user.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.880
In other words,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.510
all these actions should be rendered depending on certain conditions.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.240
It's a difficult watch you would do is you would send the request from the client to the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.820
server to check to see if this action can be performed.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.930
If not,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.990
the new deserve Bleidt.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.590
If yes,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.520
you would enable it.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.650
You do that for pretty much all the actions that corresponds to a specific product,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.830
which of course,

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.780
means that you're going to be sending a lot off request to the server,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.250
which means there's going to be vested off bandwidth and performance.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.650
And although it's not very good user experience,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.550
So to address these problems,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.640
we have ha dios,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.660
which means Plant is not going to put any efforts to deter mine.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.180
The you are a patents.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.150
Instead,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.440
we would leave it up to the server to provide the client all the required actions that it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.110
can take.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.370
For example,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.460
if user clicks on product number one and if the user is eligible to perform,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.120
all these actions sober would provide with all those details in the response itself.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.950
Pissed on that client will render and let the user take those actions,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.880
for example,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.350
of product went out of stock,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.630
Summer is not going to provide links to I had to cut as well as by no,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.390
but would just provide only for reviews.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.480
If the product is in stock and if they use the logs in,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.380
then so is going to respond back with all the you are batons,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.290
using which we can perform all his actions.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.890
It's understand it by taking a look at another example there,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.750
but you'll have a better picture on this concept.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.310
Imagine that you logged into your banking application and you're fetching your account

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.650
details with the following acorn number and assume that you have $100 in your back on

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.450
balance.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.000
So here are some of the possible actions that you can take.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.980
You can deposit,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.330
you can withdraw,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.450
you can transfer the funds or you can close the account.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.950
However,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.910
if your application has zero balance,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.920
then withdrawing and transferring doesn't make sense,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.450
and you can only perform a the deposit or closure off account.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.940
If you don't have ha dios,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.170
then Plane has to verify but sending request as to what actions can you use a perform and

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.650
moreover,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.000
client has to hard code Urals toe fire.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.050
These requests.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.970
So with Ha Dios,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.470
so is just not going to respond back with thrill when details are require information but

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.530
is also going to provide What are all the possible actions that the client can take

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.850
depending on the constraint off the application.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.400
For example,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.870
if the balances 100 silver is going to respond back with the following links is in which

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.150
client can initiate requests and if balance is zero,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.410
then so is not going to respond with any operations that it cannot perform and is going to

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.160
respond back with only deposit and closure so on the clean side,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.640
instead of hard coding these euros the client is going to rely on this skin here which is

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.080
called relation,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.110
which explains how the lingual is to the object that you requested.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.130
For essentially what this means is client is not going to heart court this your instruments

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.710
going to fetch that you are depending on this relation so that in future of silver

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.670
introduces any changes in this You are a Patton.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.680
It's not going to impact declined application because it is relying on the relation.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.420
But of course there is some level of dependency and you shouldn't mess with relation.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.550
Name in here.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.970
At the same time,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.380
claim does not need to send the request to the server to verify if a particular action can

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.650
be performed or not.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.920
For example,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.990
in this case so far did not send the withdrawal option so client can check to see if the

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.330
drop shin is present.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.850
If it is not present,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.320
which is what in this case,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.520
then plane would just disable that operation Our action for that particular user.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.870
Another example which we can think off,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.210
is right here.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.520
I'm trying to retreat product information off his specific product and the silver is going

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.020
to respond back with the following links.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.760
So we have a bunch off relations as well as the U.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.000
R.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.970
I self would mean the current object which you have just requested,

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.380
which is this product itself.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.090
And here is the you are for the same.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.210
If you want to delete this product,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.690
then we're going to use this your eye if you want update this you are.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.720
If you want to check the reviews,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.810
then it is this.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.950
Your supply and application can actually sort of travels through all these relations,

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.070
and depending on that,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.850
it can decide as to how we want to render or enable or disable certain features.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.520
For example,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.760
we don't want delete and a bit operation to be present for a normal user.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.460
This is applicable only for admin users.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.640
If it is admin user who just logs in thin silver is going to respond back with all these

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.360
actions.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.590
One thing to note here is that a lot of people say that Ha Dios is to replace documentation

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:17.590
.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.010
But that's not the case put in the stands.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.930
If you observe the link for delete as well.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.850
Ass retrieving the product Information are bought Same.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.700
So we will not specify the actually people hub,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.550
for example.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.250
If you want to delete this product,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:38.090
then you have to use this You are I with history p delete.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.860
If you want to perform update,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:47.220
then you have to use Hester TV put So essentially all that client should require to get

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.460
started is an initial your And once the client gets the initial,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.520
you are all future applications.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.160
State transitions will be driven by the client selecting from the conditional links

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.890
provided by the server Hence the name ha Dios are hyper media as the engine off application

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:11.470
state and is essential part off uniform interface principal off rest FBI.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.390
So I hope with this you have 30% off understanding off.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.350
What is ha dios?

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.650
We will own the remaining 70% when we take a look at an example
