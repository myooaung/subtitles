00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's take a look at how we can perform an update.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.220
Often existing resource who went into just a matter inside out interface and this is going

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.850
to accept product has the matter argument that's also provide implementation.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.390
And all I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to find the product with the specific I D and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.280
find update its fields in this manner again,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.870
this is all core Java.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.550
Let's go to our controller.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.770
And this time we're going to introduce put mapping annotation because we're going to use

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.440
the actually put method in order to perform abdication.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.570
And here's something new.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.420
We're trying to use the sanitation request body because this time I'm not interested in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.430
sending because para meters like we didn't gets off post.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.300
But instead,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.040
I would like to send Jason as part of the request body.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.780
So by specifying the sanitation the Jason body would be mapped,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.050
our would be binding to this object in here.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.400
So ultimately the Jason would become rooted into product which will use in our cord.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.500
And I'm also returning the same object which will be rendered back in the form of Jason off

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.500
.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.280
Whatever the client requests Well,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.350
the tricky part is how do you send the Jason data from the client?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.040
Let's take a look.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.730
So I have to send Rick questions in this you'll.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.950
But this time it's going to be put history view method.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.150
But before that,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.570
let me make use off to get method to extract all the product information.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.850
I haven't started my application.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.050
And so you're seeing that editor.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:08.160
Let me quickly copy this control.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.650
See that said that I wanted to update this particular product iPhone.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.310
Maybe he wanted to change the name to something else,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.270
so I just cooperated.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:29.500
Let's go toe put method click on the wrong to enter the raw Jason.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.050
I'm just going to past in whatever I had copied.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:43.650
And I want to name this as maybe my phone or whatever the matter.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.550
One more mine and let's send the request.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.100
You seem to have problem and it stays content.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.890
I plain text not supported.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.770
Okay,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.810
The problem is,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.360
we're trying to send this as a plain text while on the other end is expecting Jason.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.950
So let's select the content type as Jason try to send it again,

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.250
and this time it worked.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.150
The field has been updated.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.850
Let me do get request again and see if it has indeed updated.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.030
Sure enough,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.490
it did.
