00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
with reactor program.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.890
It's even possible to stream the data live so that all interested parties can listen to

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.490
that stream without being aware of the start of the stream or the end of the stream.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.010
For example,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.340
he could have a Web service that streams live temperature are the life score so that all

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.320
the clients who want to listen to that stream can join or subscribe and listen to the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.870
current ongoing stream without bothering about the start of the stream or the end of the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.370
stream.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.690
Now the plane can be a browser,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.400
a client application and Andrew Rap.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.680
Whichever it is,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.850
they can listen to the ongoing stream.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.240
Has a wish.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.900
Amazingly,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.750
don't have to do a lot off work to start live streaming.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.880
All you have to do is to add one attribute,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.350
the one that you see in red Color.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.510
You had said,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.560
the media type toe text,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.850
even stream value.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.350
And that's all.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.810
And now whatever the data that we're sending from here would be livestreamed and in this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.100
case,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.540
though,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.350
who just streaming 10 products.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.740
But the example that I'm going to walk it through in eclipse is going to stream continues

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.210
data in an unbounded manner,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.950
and we're also going to see how we can apply back pressure.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.050
So let's go to eclipse.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.560
So this time,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.050
instead of returning products,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.460
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to gender to random number between 0 to 50 in order to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.420
simulate live temperature,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.050
and the rest of the court is pretty much the same as with the previous example.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.590
Off course,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.950
the written type is going to be not a product object would rather a string.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.860
And finally we have this attribute added.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.240
This is a tribute that does the magic that's from out application.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.670
And this time let me go to Broza.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:22.950
So we are having data streaming live,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:34.450
and it is and it is unbounded and will never end until we stop off course.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.780
And of course,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.950
temperature want proctor it so frequently.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.650
But this is just an example.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.400
Also,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.910
if you notice the data is being streamed once everyone second,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
so you go back to eclipse.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.200
We're a playing back pressure.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.840
With this method,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.710
call delay elements with a delay off one second.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.440
Imagine what would happen in real time applications.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.450
If this restriction is not there,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:24.110
then all the data would be streamed as a huge chunk and might goes over to go out off

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.650
memory
