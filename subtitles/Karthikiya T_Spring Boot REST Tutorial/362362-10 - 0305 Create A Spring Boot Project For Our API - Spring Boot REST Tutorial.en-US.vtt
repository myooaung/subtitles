00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
Alright,

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.520
it's time to create our first rest.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.560
AP I using spring boot.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900
I hope you're excited.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm assuming that you have installed Eclipse and Spring Toe sort already.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.790
So with that in mind,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.350
I'm going to click on the file menu,

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:22.450
click on other Search for Spring and I'm going to click Spring Starter Project.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.570
We've talked about all of these already.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.640
So in my case,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.700
these are the values that had entered.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.800
I'm going to change the artifact name,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.180
too.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.090
Spring Greste FBI.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:49.020
The only model that would be needing his spring starter web because your home your mouse

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.500
over there,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.410
you can see that it will help us build rest Philip services.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.170
However,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.920
if you're building so perhaps services,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.950
then you'd be needing this model,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.960
and we could actually include a database like a stream but a database.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.490
But I want to keep things simple for now,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.090
and we're not going to use any data.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.250
Best for the time being.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.500
Someone hit finish.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.980
It's going to take a while for spring to a suit to create the project and sort off

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.310
important indoor eclipse.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.920
And Roman,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.590
you can see the progress in bottom right corner.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.850
All right,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.680
Once you have it ready,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
we're going to be needing few packages.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.170
Some would expand source Main Java and inside here,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.650
I'm going to create a package to keep all our controllers.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.420
And in this case,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120
we're just going to have one controller.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.500
And whatever the traffic that we get from the dispatcher sold it,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.990
we will receive it in our controller.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.290
So that's going to be controller.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:16.530
We're also going to be needing another package to store our services.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.170
So this is where you would have your business logic.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.370
We're going to dependence.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.880
Inject these objects into our controller in order to manipulate with the data.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:40.490
So this is going to be a service layer and we're also going to be needing model.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:49.690
Although we're not going to interact with database,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.230
we're still going to create a model because this is the same object we're going to use.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.350
Has command object in order to map Dataquest's para Meters etcetera,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.560
you will see them.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.750
Why?

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.100
What I mean and that's it.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.460
We have everything in place to get started creating or estate.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.350
Be I I didn't be supposed to include one more layer,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.620
which is a repository.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.590
But since we're not using database,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.960
I'm going to ignore it.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.470
For now,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.060
I hope it makes sense
