X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
as I was mentioning before Web services is all about making use.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.370
Officially,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.460
the methods I get posed,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.790
delete,

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.650
etcetera.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.050
Unfortunately,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.380
browse.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.620
It is not the best tool in order to test our application,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.210
because browser is only capable off sending get and post requests.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.150
If you want to be able to use other s stripping methods,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.210
you either have to have an application that is capable off sending such requests.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.950
Who are he should be installing a tool like postman,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.250
which will help us do that.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.430
Postmen is a great toe.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.960
It's free for personal use,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.120
and you can just download and install it just as you were installed.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.520
Any other software harder for using chrome you have a postman plug in,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400
But in the reason past,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.880
they're claiming that their browser plug in is duplicated,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.950
and they were recommending us to download that application.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.150
You can download it real quick and install it were able to start application with the stool
