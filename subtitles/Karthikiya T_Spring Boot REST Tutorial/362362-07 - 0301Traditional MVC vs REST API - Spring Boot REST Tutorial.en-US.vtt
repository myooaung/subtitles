00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
here is the architecture off traditional spring embassy application.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.990
Initially that line or the Broza would send the request to these over server will take a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.590
look at Developed a maximal file in order to deter mined the front controller or the

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.650
dispatcher sold it.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.440
Now it is up to the dispatcher Sollett Predator mind relevant controller where it needs to

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.770
get the call to.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.600
And for that it will take a look at the handler map ings that we can figure Handler mapping

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.510
is nothing but a mapping between a your baton with this specific.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.400
So let or the controller the controllable then delegate the call to the model This is where

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.450
you would have so vicious repositories.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.810
Our model objects the goal off moralists toe take the input,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.410
process it and then just one back to the controller with the date or the model object The

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.470
controllable then handled the model object along with the name of the view back to the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.590
dispatcher Soviet,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.600
the dispatcher Solve it.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.990
We'll take a look at the view,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
dissolve or in order to deter mine The extension of the view.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.360
I mean in case of fair use and Js before in stance,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.250
the extension would be dark GSB,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.580
the dispatches,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.490
all that would happen,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.350
that extension to the View name and then forward argued that date are the model object to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.750
that view In order for it to render and guess off JSP,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.550
the JSP would be translated into equal and sold it,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.050
which will have went off printed on statements with HTML tags.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.350
And ultimately,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.940
the suburb would execute the soul it and respond back the HTML back to the client,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.560
which will be rendered on the browser in case of up services,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.090
though,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.060
we're going to get rid off all this view part because we're only interested in sending back

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.100
the data since RAF sending back the HTML as response.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.400
Who in descend the data as part of the extra duty response?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.880
And not to mention that since the reason Spring boot majority off these are auto configured

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.880
.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120
When I say we have to configure handler mapping,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.640
we really don't have to because it's all taken care automatically.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.300
You don't don't have to configure the dispatches.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.350
All that our web dot xml file pretty much everything is taken care by spring boot auto

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.350
configuration,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.450
and we can just focus on things that matter in our example application.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.690
The client.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.390
The client can be anything it could be mobile application or it could be a desktop

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.250
application.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.950
A Web application.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.300
Are another application running on another server.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.690
They will fire a suitably request toe arrest FBI.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.650
So it is where our application would be running,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.450
and the job off for FBI is to respond back.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.280
But data in the form of Jason or example,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.750
it is up to the plaint what they do with that data.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.650
But since we don't have any off this client,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.950
at the moment we don't have any client applications like angler Jails or Android App.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.150
We're going to use a tool called Postman that will allow us to test our FBI and in this

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.480
chapter will perform all the crowd operations so that we can understand how we can live

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.960
Ridge.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.600
Yesterday we get posed,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.450
delayed and put methods in order to manipulate a resource or the data hope it makes sense.
