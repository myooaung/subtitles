1
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.020
All right so let's give this limit a try.

2
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:33.090
We have a limit of a square root of x minus to everything over X minus 4 as x approaches 4.

3
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.450
So go ahead composite video and try this limit out.

4
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.260
All right.

5
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.890
So as you might have noticed this limit is a little bit unusual because if we try to find the limb by

6
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.350
plugging it in.

7
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.120
Then what happens.

8
00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:01.510
So we have square root of four minus two over four.

9
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.430
Mine is four.

10
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540
So we just plugged in the four into the function.

11
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.370
So this corrido four is two minus two is zero on the top over four minus four zero on the bottom.

12
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.830
So this is a problem if you have 0 0 that means you need to do something else.

13
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.040
And remember that when we have rules we can actually find something called the conjugate which is the

14
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.010
opposite of this expression with the roots.

15
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.660
So the conjugate for this example is going to be

16
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.660
cange you get.

17
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.030
So it's going to be the same thing but with a plus instead of a minus.

18
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.180
So it's this expression with a sign changed.

19
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.610
So the conjugate is squirted IVAX plus two.

20
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.590
Let's go ahead and multiply this whole fraction by the conjugate.

21
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.790
So we have lym as x approaches 4.

22
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.620
So we have square root of x minus two over X minus four.

23
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.810
This is just the same thing that we have here.

24
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.020
But now we're going to multiply both on top and bottom by the conjugate square root of x plus two square

25
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:44.260
root of x plus 2 on top and the square root of x plus 2 on the bottom.

26
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.920
And remember that what we do is we pretty much foil on the top so we can actually eliminate some terms.

27
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.220
So remember this is multiplying it's this fraction times this fraction.

28
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.230
So it's top Times top and bottom times bottom.

29
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.920
All right.

30
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.410
So if you remember foil tells you to multiply.

31
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:21.230
For example a plus b times c plus D you need to multiply the first.

32
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.040
So a times c then you need to multiply the outer a times D.

33
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.570
Then you need to multiply the enter B and C and then you need to multiply the last B and D.

34
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.530
And when I talked about first outer inner and last are just the positions of these letters.

35
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.010
So we have position 1 2 3 and 4.

36
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.340
So for example the first is the first of this expression and the first of this expression a and c the

37
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.370
outer will be the ones on the extremes.

38
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.590
So the A and the D enter are the two inner ones right here a b and c and the last is the last of each

39
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.330
expression.

40
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.970
B and D.

41
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.720
You probably know this by now but just covering it just in case.

42
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.470
So let's go ahead and do a foil on the top so we have the F which is for first.

43
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.649
So the first squirt of X times square root of x.

44
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.610
Remember that querido of X times square root of x is the same as saying

45
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.930
square root of x squared.

46
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.710
And remember that this square cancels out this route.

47
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.190
So that gives you x.

48
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:51.670
That's like saying a square root of four times square root of four square root of four is two times

49
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.530
square root of four is two two times two is four.

50
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.000
So it gives you back the number and the roots.

51
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.970
In this case we get back the X so that x and then we multiply the outer.

52
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:19.870
So the outer are a square root of x and positive to plus two times square root of x right and then multiply

53
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.250
that enter a negative two times square it of x.

54
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:34.590
So mine is 2 square root of x and then we have the last so negative two times to negative terms a positive

55
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.410
is a negative and two attempted to is four.

56
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.840
So it's minus 4.

57
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.690
And then for the bottom we're not going to multiply this.

58
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.400
We're just going to leave it as expressed.

59
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.770
All right.

60
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.440
So we're just going to say X minus 4 times.

61
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.260
Square root of x plus two.

62
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.730
And by the way in theory this is not the same as this because here we're finding a limit on this site.

63
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.450
But on the other side of the equal sign we don't have a limit.

64
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.860
So we'll just say that this leads to this but not exactly the same.

65
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:24.960
All right so what we can actually do here is if you notice we have two square root of x minus two square

66
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.150
root of x.

67
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.940
That's like saying five minus five.

68
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.530
We're just subtracting something from itself to that zero.

69
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.100
And we can cancel it out.

70
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.520
All right.

71
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.150
So what do we have.

72
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.930
We have limit as x approaches for

73
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.340
and then that's going to be equal to x minus 4 because we cancel out the stuff in the middle

74
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.740
and on the bottom we have X minus four

75
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.380
times square root of x plus 2.

76
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.390
This is the reason why we didn't do foil on the bottom.

77
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.350
We want to keep this X minus 4 so we can cancel it out with this X minus 4.

78
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.740
That's a reason why we only do foil where the conjugate is.

79
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.820
That's why we did foil on the top not on the bottom.

80
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.400
All right.

81
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.090
So we can cancel out the X minus 4 on the top and the X minus 4 on the bottom.

82
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.570
And that leaves those with limits of 1 because that's all we have left on the top.

83
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.290
Over square root of x plus 2.

84
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.670
That's all we have left in the bottom as x approaches 4 and check it out.

85
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.710
Now we can finally plug in the four into this function.

86
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:06.570
So that is going to be equal to what won over square root of four.

87
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.800
Plus two.

88
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:22.370
And let's finish it up down here 1 over square root of four is two then plus two.

89
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:31.250
And finally we have her answer one over two plus two is for the limit is 1 over 4 that is.

90
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.120
It's all right.

91
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.169
So we found out that it was 0 over 0.

92
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:42.120
That's why we had to find the conjugate again the conjugate is the same thing as the expression with

93
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.660
the roots only with the flip side.

94
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.450
So originally we had a minus so we had to put a plus if we had had a plus since that would have put

95
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.560
a minus for the conjugate.

96
00:08:53.730 --> 00:09:02.180
Then multiply this fraction on top on bottom by the conjugate and we do foil where ever the root is.

97
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:08.820
So it's going to be on the top that lets us cancel out a couple of terms then we can cancel out even

98
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.530
more terms.

99
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.450
Now on top and bottom and after that we'll just plug in the four.

100
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:20.990
Normally that is how we get our limit.

101
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.420
All right so here's another exercise for you.

102
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:33.600
Find the following limit limit of X minus 9 over x squared minus 81 as x approaches 9.

103
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.780
All right so go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

104
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.400
All right so let's see how it works.

105
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.460
So you already know to find the way.

106
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.500
Just plug it in and you probably notice that if you plug in nine in so this fraction what's going to

107
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.560
happen so nine minus nine that's on top.

108
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.950
And on the bottom we have nine squared

109
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.320
minus 81

110
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.100
so nine minus nine is zero on the top.

111
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.770
And nine squared is 81.

112
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.650
So 81 minus 81 is zero on the bottom.

113
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.390
Remember this is no bueno.

114
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.440
We need to go ahead and do something else.

115
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.380
So we actually talked about the difference of squares.

116
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.900
It's a way of factoring out terms

117
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.710
difference of squares.

118
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:53.290
And just to remind you this says that for example if you have A-squared mine is B squared.

119
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.410
You can factor this out as a plus b times.

120
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.030
A mine is Pete.

121
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.540
It turns out that we have this right here.

122
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:17.150
So let's go ahead and rewrite this limit limit x minus 9.

123
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.490
And then how do we do this on the bottom x squared minus 81.

124
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:28.080
So the rule says if you have A-squared minus B squared then it's a plus b times a minus B.

125
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.710
So what is the A and what is the B.

126
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:39.070
In this case remember the A is not X squared and B is not 81.

127
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.920
B and B is what you're square to get to X squared and to 81.

128
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:57.560
That means that the A in this case is just x and B has to be 9 because 9 squared is what gives you 81

129
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.570
right.

130
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:06.160
So what we're going to do is now that we have a and b is say a plus b times a minus beat.

131
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.680
So X plus nine times X minus nine

132
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.030
and as x approaches 9.

133
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.130
All right.

134
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.560
And check it out.

135
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:31.020
Now though we have X minus nine on the top and on the bottom they cancel each other out.

136
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.370
And that gives us what that gives us limits of 1.

137
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.990
There's nothing else on top over X plus nine

138
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.730
as x approaches 9.

139
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.780
And at this point we can go ahead and plug it in without a problem.

140
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:59.300
So we have one over nine plus nine

141
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.130
and that gives one over 18.

142
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.900
That is our limit.

143
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.390
All right.

144
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.280
So what we did is we had zero over zero.

145
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:19.720
We noticed that in the bottom we had a difference of squares and we use the rule to factor out this

146
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.800
difference of squares.

147
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.600
And by the way it's called the difference of squares because you're subtracting.

148
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:33.460
That's the difference and then the squares you're squaring both a and b and then after we factored out

149
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.950
that and we cancelled out on top and bottom the X minus nine we went ahead and plugged in the nine and

150
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.720
we are good to go.
