00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.950
All right.

2
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.450
So let's talk a little bit about the difference and their relationship between exponential functions

3
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.700
and logarithmic functions.

4
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:40.370
And just to remind you here's an example of an exponential function y equals e to the X remember in

5
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.230
an exponential function the input is the exponent.

6
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.020
OK.

7
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:56.470
So this is exponential.

8
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.670
And let's also do a logarithmic function so we can just say simply Elen of x.

9
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.040
All right.

10
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.840
So here are used as a base on purpose for the exponential.

11
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.980
Because we're going to use the natural log.

12
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:29.530
And remember that the base of the natural log is also e.

13
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.230
All right.

14
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.530
So it turns out that these two operations cancel each other out.

15
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.040
All right.

16
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.280
So exponential functions and logarithmic functions can so

17
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.160
each other

18
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.810
and you can actually use that to your advantage when you're solving equations involving one of these

19
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.560
two.

20
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.340
So let's throw one example let's say I want to find

21
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.750
the natural log of E to the X gha.

22
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.330
So you might look at this and you might think How do I do this.

23
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.870
I mean we have an X here which makes it seem like we need to put something into it but we really don't.

24
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.180
So let's break this down using our in a monic let's be real.

25
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.490
Right.

26
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.380
So Elby our.

27
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.060
So the logarithm is the natural log.

28
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.190
So just L.N.

29
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.690
our base because it's a natural log.

30
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.190
Remember the base is always the end.

31
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.630
We have our results what we want to get to which is E to the x.

32
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.230
All right.

33
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.160
So in other words we're trying to find an exponent so that when you raise the base e you get as a result

34
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.040
each to the next.

35
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.180
Did you pick it up already.

36
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.110
Did you pick up what's going on here.

37
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.780
We're asking to what xponent should I race to get the results.

38
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.920
E to the x The answer of course is X

39
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.770
doesn't make sense again.

40
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.910
We're saying to what exponents do we need to raise E to get the results of the X.

41
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.070
Well obviously the answer is X because if you raise this base to the X then you're going to have your

42
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.150
result already.

43
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.920
Let me put it to you in other words.

44
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.780
This is like saying the following.

45
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.860
Let's say that playing baseball makes you happy it makes you feel better.

46
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.700
Changes your mood overall.

47
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.190
It's a great activity.

48
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.390
And playing baseball just makes you happy.

49
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.980
So this is pretty much saying if playing baseball makes you happy what do you need to do to be happy.

50
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.880
The answer of course is playing baseball and I know this sounds very redundant like a very obvious thing

51
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.450
but that's exactly what this says.

52
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.670
So let me repeat it once more so that you actually get what's going on.

53
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.750
So if I ask you if playing baseball makes you happy why do you need to do to be happy.

54
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.530
The answer is going to be playing baseball.

55
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.250
Same thing here here.

56
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.340
The problem is asking too what number do need to raise E to get E to the X is just X..

57
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.170
Same thing.

58
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.630
It's very obvious.

59
00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.020
And this is an example of how logarithmic functions and exponential functions cancel each other out.

60
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.740
So the answer to this which is an exponents within a logarithm is just x.

61
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.040
So we don't have any more logs or we don't have any more exponentiation.

62
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.380
So this is a cool example again of how when you have exponentiation within logs or vice a versa that

63
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.630
they just go ahead and cancel each other out.

64
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:43.020
So let's do the opposite example let's say that we want to find E to the L-N of x.

65
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.420
So it's very similar to this one but in an opposite way.

66
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.690
And number one we have exponentiation within a logarithm.

67
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.290
In this case we have a logarithm within exponentiation.

68
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.940
So let's think about what's going on here.

69
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.150
We have as a base and we are racing E to the power of a line of x.

70
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.500
But again think about what's going on.

71
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.970
Remember what LNA X is.

72
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:21.240
So you're saying lot of X is a logarithm so that when you race e to that power element of X then it

73
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.880
gives you X. But guess what.

74
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.570
We're literally raising e to that power.

75
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.670
Right.

76
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:36.360
What we're doing here is we're seeing elevate E to the power so that when you elevate e to that power

77
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.300
you get X therefore the result here is also x.

78
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.460
I don't know if this is making sense.

79
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.490
Once you get it you're going to think wow that's really obvious.

80
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.840
Let me break it down for you.

81
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.220
Let's say that see equals.

82
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.110
Ellen IVAX

83
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.470
So what does this mean.

84
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.500
C is equal to the natural log of X.

85
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.460
In other words C is the number to which you need to raise the base to get to X.

86
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.480
So if you raise to this C then you're going to get X..

87
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.860
Well that's exactly what we're doing here.

88
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.540
We're saying to the seat.

89
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.480
So we're raising the to that exponents so that when you race e to that xponent you get X..

90
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.830
This is why again this is X. And again this is not something different.

91
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.920
This is just another way of looking at it going back to her baseball analogy let's assume again that

92
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.970
playing baseball makes you happy.

93
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.490
This is saying if playing baseball makes you happy.

94
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.120
How do you feel when you play baseball.

95
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.800
Well the answer is happy.

96
00:07:53.020 --> 00:08:02.910
You see how this is very similar to that racing to the log of X of base e gives you x because again

97
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.790
you're raising e to whatever number you need to race to get to X..

98
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.550
All right.

99
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.740
So again these two are examples of how exponential functions and logarithmic functions cancel each other

100
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.710
out.

101
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:25.440
So just to summarize in the first example we have an exponentiation within a logarithm in the second

102
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.350
example we have the opposite.

103
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.710
We have a logarithm within an exponentiation.

104
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.480
In both cases the answer is X.

105
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.520
We're actually going to use this to solve equations.

106
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.220
Let's check out an example.
