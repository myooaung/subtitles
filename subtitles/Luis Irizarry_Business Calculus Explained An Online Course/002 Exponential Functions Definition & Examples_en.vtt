00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
OK so here we have the definition of exponential functions.

2
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.920
They are functions that have a variable in other words a letter in the exponent part.

3
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.610
So again it's a function that has a letter in the exponent part and the generic form of an exponential

4
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.350
function looks like this.

5
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.760
Fallbacks equals

6
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.680
a to the X.

7
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.220
So notice that this function has a letter in the exponent part.

8
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.560
So A is a number

9
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.380
and X is the input.

10
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.340
But again x is the exponent of this.

11
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.110
So let me show you a couple of examples.

12
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840
So for example if we have something like this f of x equals

13
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.010
2 to the X this is an exponential function.

14
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.040
You have a letter in the exponents and the base is a number.

15
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.790
OK.

16
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.140
Another example would be.

17
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.670
So for example we can say 10 to the X.

18
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.980
So again we have a letter here in the exponent.

19
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.240
So the input is up here.

20
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.820
And another example would be f of x equals

21
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.550
4 to the 3 x.

22
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.470
So check it out.

23
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.770
This was a little bit different but it's still an exponential function instead of having just X in the

24
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.460
exponent.

25
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.380
Here we have three Yax.

26
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.390
So if you plug in a number into this function you're going to get that input you're going to multiply

27
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.260
it by three and that's going to give you your exponents and then you're going to raise this base to

28
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.830
that exponent.

29
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.410
And by the way let me just market here that this number that you're exponentiate ing is called the base.

30
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.890
All right

31
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.370
so for example here the base is to here the base is 10.

32
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.260
And here the base is for and all of these are examples of exponential functions.

33
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.210
Like I said for it to be an exponential function it doesn't mean that only the X is there.

34
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.460
You could have stuff like this you could have for example 3x OK.

35
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.790
And one tidbit of information about exponential functions is that they grow very quickly.

36
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.880
That is something to note.

37
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.840
And let me show you an example.

38
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.150
Let's actually pick this second one over here.

39
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.330
So let's say that X equals

40
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.280
10 to the X and let's plug in a couple of values.

41
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.140
So let's plug in for example one just to start with I was going to give us 10 to 1.

42
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.160
So that was 10

43
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.720
but what if we plug in.

44
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.370
All right.

45
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:15.340
So that's going to give us 10 to the three which is 10 multiplied by itself three times that's 10 times

46
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.240
ten is a hundred times ten more is a thousand.

47
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.050
So you see how we just increase the input by 2 from 1 to 3.

48
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.020
But then the output increase very quickly.

49
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.130
We went from 10 to 1000.

50
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.300
Let's try it one more number

51
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.500
of six let's say.

52
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.920
So we're going to plug in six over here.

53
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.540
So that's going to give us 10 to the 6.

54
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.020
So that's 10 multiplied by itself six times.

55
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.900
So it's going to be basically 10 to the three times ten to the three and that's a property that we'll

56
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.970
see you later on.

57
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.760
But that's going to be again a thousand times a thousand.

58
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:15.360
And that's going to be one million Juan 0 0 0 0 0 0 lots of zeroes.

59
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.300
So come here and come here.

60
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.770
So by going from one to six in the input we went from ten to a million.

61
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.960
So as you can see they definitely grow very quickly.

62
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.570
One more thing I wanted to talk about is that I actually considered creating a mnemonic to remind you

63
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.570
what an exponential function is.

64
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.540
However look at it the name itself says it exponential exponent.

65
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.770
So an exponential function has the input in the exponent.

66
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.640
All right.

67
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.600
That is how you remember.

68
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.190
And these are the basics of exponential functions.

69
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.720
Later on we'll find out or find derivatives of these functions.
