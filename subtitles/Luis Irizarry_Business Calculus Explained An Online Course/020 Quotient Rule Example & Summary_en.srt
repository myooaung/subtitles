1
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,650
OK so now that we have our mnemonic for the quotient rule let's try it out in a problem.

2
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,860
OK so f of x is going to be

3
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:44,990
3 x squared is 5 x over X minus 1.

4
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,960
All right so that is going to be your f x we want to find the derivative of prime X

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,940
and first thing we do is we identify OK which rule do we need to use.

6
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:06,290
The main operation here is a division we know it's the division because we have a dividing line over

7
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,540
here we have the function on top over the function on the bottom.

8
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,820
So for that remember we use our quotient rule.

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,220
So for the quotient rule we use the product rule minus the b s.

10
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,630
So remember our mnemonic which is

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,500
Hoopes.

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,250
All right let's try that again.

13
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,990
Pro mine is

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,960
the B-S.

15
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,640
All right.

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,080
OK so first let's through pro process that we're going to do place repeats.

17
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,040
And then the derivative of the outer So place repeats.

18
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:05,700
We're going to grab the top function 3 x squared plus 5 x times the bottom function X minus one.

19
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,970
And we're going to place it again.

20
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,930
So we have three x squared plus five x

21
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,100
times X Minus One

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,650
Remember we're just getting the top function and the bottom function and putting them side to side.

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,150
And we're doing that twice because it's plage repeats again.

24
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,740
It's the top function times.

25
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,580
The bottom function we put it once here and then once here again it's nothing new.

26
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,230
It's just the place repeats from the product rule right.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,920
And then after that we go to the O which is a derivative of the outer.

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,020
Remember the outers are the first function and the last function.

29
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:01,880
So we get the derivative of this first function and we get the derivative of X minus one.

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,450
All right.

31
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,610
So we have our product rule our pro.

32
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,640
Now we're going to do the minus the B.S. part.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,770
So remember the minus means is put a minus sign in between and you divide this whole thing.

34
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,980
All right and everything here.

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,990
Oh that's bad that line.

36
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,100
Let's try that again.

37
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,780
All right.

38
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,610
It's a little bit better.

39
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,730
So we divide the whole thing on top over B-S which is the bottom function squared.

40
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,100
What is the bottom function.

41
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,420
It is X minus 1.

42
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:47,230
So we'll do X Minus One squared.

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,690
All right so now we move on to simplify this beast.

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,690
How do we do this.

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,410
Well give it a shot prime of x.

46
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,870
First thing we do is we're going to get the actual derivatives of the outer which we actually already

47
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,710
marked.

48
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,730
So the derivative of this what do we have.

49
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,830
Well we have a sum and then we have some power rule with a constant multiple rule.

50
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,410
So let's take care of that.

51
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,899
Let's start with this term 3 x squared.

52
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,720
So a constant multiple tells you that you're going to have a 3 multiplying on front.

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,510
Then we do the power rule.

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,970
We bring down a dictator times 2 x substituted by a less powerful leader.

55
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,830
That gives us a one on top so we do not market that and move on to the next plus because we're doing

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,330
the sum rule because we're adding 5 x seconds to a multiple We have 5 on the front.

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,120
Then we have x 2 1 right.

58
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh by the way this is prime.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,670
Don't confuse it with a 1.

60
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,440
All right.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,630
So we have this x x to 1.

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,880
So when we take one from the exponent it becomes X to 0 which is 1.

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,080
So basically is five times one.

64
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,780
OK.

65
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,430
Close here.

66
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,780
Then we have multiplied by X minus 1

67
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,580
minus.

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,850
We just copy over this function to be X squared plus 5 x

69
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,310
and the derivative of X minus 1 all the derivative of x.

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,540
Remember that x is equal to x to the first power.

71
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,220
Right.

72
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,210
Same thing.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,910
So a derivative of X will bring down a dictator.

74
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,270
One

75
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,260
times x to the substitute by a less powerful leader.

76
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,610
So it's one minus 1 is 0 minus the derivative of a constant is zero.

77
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:11,390
So is mine is zero.

78
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,890
Remember we do everything over X minus 1 squared.

79
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,490
By the way you might be asking yourself whether you should expand this term here.

80
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,930
Maybe you can do something like foil and do X minus 1 times X minus 1 and then calculate that.

81
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,950
We typically don't we just leave it as it is.

82
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,220
So for the bottom part of the quotient rule don't worry about it.

83
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,970
OK.

84
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,410
If it's something like this you can just leave it like that.

85
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,590
Typically that's OK.

86
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,860
All right so let's finish up simplifying.

87
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,650
So we have three times 2 x is 6 x plus five

88
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:11,620
plus five times X Minus One minus.

89
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:20,190
By the way so one times x to the 0 just one time to one because anything to the zero power is one to

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,040
one times one is one.

91
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,210
Mine is zero still one.

92
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,260
So this whole thing becomes a one

93
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,590
right and we multiply one by this.

94
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,000
It's going to be equal to this by itself.

95
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:43,730
Mine is 3 x squared plus 5 x

96
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,320
and everything over

97
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,760
X minus 1 squared.

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,570
All right.

99
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,380
So you can see this is kind of a long problem.

100
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,750
Sometimes they get like this you might have like a whole page for a calculus problem.

101
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,490
You just need to make sure that you know you go detail by detail.

102
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,830
You make sure you carry over signs you multiplying.

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,210
Right.

104
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,200
They actually get in derivatives etc..

105
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,800
So the real long problems.

106
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,100
But don't fear if you do it slowly and you know what you're doing and you practice that.

107
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,600
It'll come to you right away.

108
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,370
All right.

109
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,570
So typically for a quotient rule problems we simplify the top here.

110
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,270
We're not going to do that for this problem.

111
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,870
I just wanted to demonstrate the concept of the mnemonic which is Preux.

112
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,800
Mine is the B-S that is in a Monnick for the quotient rule.

113
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,770
When we get to the practice problem section you'll have a lot of practice will actually do some huge

114
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,070
big problems.

115
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,290
We'll actually do some problems for the quotient rule up until the end.

116
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,990
So you can see how it actually works.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,970
We'll apply that mnemonic that will simplify and we'll get a final answer.

118
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,430
All right.

119
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,860
So that's coming up next on the problem section.

120
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,180
Now we're going to go to the summary and be done with the quotient rule.

121
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,080
Okay perfect.

122
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,910
So let's go for a quick summary of what we just covered about the quotient rule.

123
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,060
So first of all the quotient rule is used to find the derivative of a division quotient of functions.

124
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,160
And again how do we know there's a division.

125
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,260
Well there's a dividing line.

126
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:39,480
So it's always going to be something like 5 x over g of X..

127
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,240
OK.

128
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:47,050
Also the kosher rule says that the derivative of a quotient is a derivative of top Times bottom minus

129
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,450
tab times a derivative of bottom.

130
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,190
Everything over bottom square.

131
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,260
Boring.

132
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:59,640
Who wants to remember that nobody that's for we have our next bullet point which is our mnemonic mnemonic

133
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,320
says like the product rule minus the b.s..

134
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,490
Remember just like in the product rule in the quotient rule you're going to place repeats and get the

135
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,300
derivative of the outer and then you have the minus the B.S. part that means the B.S. part means that

136
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,600
instead of doing a plus in between the repeats like you would do in the product rule.

137
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:29,380
You actually use a minus and then remember you have to divide everything in top by the bottom squared.

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,090
That is the B.S. part.

139
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,610
All right.

140
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,920
So product rule minus the B S.

141
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:42,230
And finally for quotient rule problems you can typically leave the bottom squared as is without expanding.

142
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:54,530
So if in the bottom you get something like you know like X squared plus two squared.

143
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,970
And here it doesn't matter what you have here in the bottom you don't really have to expand.

144
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,430
You don't really have to do foil.

145
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,710
Typically you can just leave it as it is.

146
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,890
I mean if you're in doubt always check with your professor if you see that he or she does it differently.

147
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,380
But again typically that's how it works.

148
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,390
And that's pretty much for the quotient rule.

149
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,070
Now the question rule is going to take some practice.

150
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,650
So you have to sit down and you have to do the problems there long you know they're going to take you

151
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,360
a while you might you to make sure you make it right the first couple of times you might not get it

152
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,730
right.

153
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,850
You might forget the minus sign you might forget to square the bottom etc..

154
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,400
That's why practice is so important.

155
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,980
OK.

156
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:42,490
So just make sure that you do the problems and the next section will actually have a couple of problems
