00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.690
All right so let's do a second problem on the entrails of concavity and inflection points.

2
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.490
So let's find the intervals of concavity and inflection points if any for f of x equals x squared plus

3
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.060
33.

4
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.960
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

5
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.590
All right so let's go ahead and do it together.

6
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.910
So remember we're finding intervals of concavity and inflection points.

7
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.050
If we have our mnemonic sac we know that we need the second derivative because we're finding concavity

8
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.840
and inflection points.

9
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.930
All right.

10
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.480
So we need to get the second derivative.

11
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.880
The first step is to get the first derivative.

12
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.780
So first derivative of this is bring down dictators.

13
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.560
That's 2 x and less powerful leader.

14
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.790
In this case will mark the one plus the derivative of 33 which is zero.

15
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.360
In other words this is 2 x right.

16
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.380
That is the first derivative.

17
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.050
Now let's get the second derivative.

18
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:47.060
So we have constant multiple to two and then for the X we bring down a dictator which has a 1 x 2 0.

19
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.710
I remember one times X to 0 is just one.

20
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.940
So we have two times on equals two.

21
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.160
So when we put it down here or a second derivative equals two.

22
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.840
This is interesting because typically our second derivative is something with axes.

23
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.920
In this case it's two.

24
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.010
How can this be.

25
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.150
Well what if we went to the next step to find the critical numbers for the second derivative.

26
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.080
So we want to find the numbers that make the second derivative either equal to zero or undefined.

27
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.290
But do you see a problem here.

28
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.990
The second derivative is always true.

29
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.990
It cannot be undefined and it cannot be equal to zero.

30
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.460
So because this can never change it's always going to be two.

31
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.300
There are no critical numbers

32
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.810
so there are no critical numbers.

33
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.830
What happens when we go to Step Three with our number line 2.

34
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.950
Well there's nothing to test.

35
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.580
Laughter and right of the two we have no critical numbers.

36
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.400
That means that this function f of x has a positive second derivative.

37
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.470
All over the place to the left of the two and to the right of the two.

38
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.070
Right.

39
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:26.150
So this is always positive What does that tell you that tells you that this function because it has

40
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.480
a positive second derivative is always concave up right.

41
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.000
It never changes to concave down because this second derivative is always positive because it's always

42
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.430
two.

43
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.670
It's always positive.

44
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.720
It never changes.

45
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:56.190
This means that this function actually from negative infinity up to positive infinity is concave up.

46
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.430
You see that concave up for all x values from negative infinity to positive infinity.

47
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.050
So let me repeat it once again.

48
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.250
Because the second derivative is always positive.

49
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.640
It's a numbers so it never changes.

50
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.810
There are no critical values that we can find because this too is never equal to zero or undefined.

51
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.020
For that reason there's nothing really to plug in and it's always a positive second derivative.

52
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.750
In other words the function is always concave up.

53
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.680
So of course the functions always concave up.

54
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.670
That means that there are no inflection points right.

55
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.370
The concavity never changes.

56
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.290
It's always up.

57
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.230
So no inflection points and always concave up to be more formal.

58
00:04:48.230 --> 00:05:01.980
We say that from negative infinity to positive infinity in this interval the function is concave up.

59
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.120
And in fact just to give you a quick visual.

60
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.720
This function looks something like this.

61
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.740
It is just a parabola.

62
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.030
It goes up to here.

63
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.490
You see how this function is always concave up.

64
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.660
So it's always opening up towards the top.

65
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.950
This agrees with what we got here.

66
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.900
Always concave up and no inflection points.

67
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.130
So when your second derivative is a number if it's positive then it's always concave up and if it's

68
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.800
negative then the function is always concave down.

69
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.670
All right.

70
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.040
That is the main takeaway because the second derivative is not changing.

71
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:50.590
There are no critical points that we can test and that is why this function f of x is always concave

72
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.120
up.
