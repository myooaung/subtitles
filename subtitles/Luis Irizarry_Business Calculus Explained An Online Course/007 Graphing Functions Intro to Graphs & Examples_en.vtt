00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.710
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.100
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.940
Today we're going to cover graphs of functions.

4
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.670
Now the graph of a function is a very visual representation of how the function behaves.

5
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:43.290
So I'll put that here a graph is a visual

6
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.130
representation of a function.

7
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:05.330
So for example let's say that we would like to graph this function f of x equals x plus 5.

8
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.680
All right.

9
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.760
So we want to get the graph of that to try and get the graph of this function.

10
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.390
Let's build a table and pick a couple of points so that we can just plug them in into our graph.

11
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.940
So we have a table of x and y.

12
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.560
So let me pick for example.

13
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.450
Half of one is going to give me one plus five.

14
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.460
You call six.

15
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.540
So that's when X is 1.

16
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.370
Why is 6.

17
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.730
Let me pick another point.

18
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.760
Negative 2.

19
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.760
So we have negative two plus five.

20
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.380
And again if you owe three dollars and you pay five back then you are in positive three.

21
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.460
So for negative two we have three and let's do one more of 0.

22
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.130
So that's going to be zero plus five.

23
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.960
We're just going to give us five.

24
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.540
OK.

25
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.380
All right.

26
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.920
Our third point is 0 5.

27
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.320
So now we have three points for the graph.

28
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.180
How do we graph it exactly.

29
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.600
Remember that to graph functions we do it in something called the Cartesian plane

30
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.490
and the Cartesian plane is made up of two lines one horizontal representing the input and one vertical

31
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.050
representing the output.

32
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.990
So it's going to look something like this.

33
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:18.640
OK so our horizontal line represents X enter a vertical line represent why.

34
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.240
And we could have points composed of an x and y.

35
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.670
For example if we take our first point which is 1:06 the x values 1 the y value is 6.

36
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.620
So we start here at 0 0 0 remember that for the axes.

37
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.470
If you move to the right it's positive.

38
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.980
And if you move to the left it's negative so ever x value is 1.

39
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.880
We move one to the right.

40
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.740
So we're over here this is one.

41
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.430
And then for y values this one is 6.

42
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.110
And in general if it's positive it goes up and if it's negative it goes down.

43
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.640
So the point 1 6 will be one to the right for X and six up for y.

44
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.610
So that's 1 2 3 4 5 6.

45
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.040
And again it doesn't have to be perfect We're just pretty much eyeballing it.

46
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.230
This is going to be R6 for the Y.

47
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:34.200
So this point is basically one six.

48
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.520
All right let's get our second point.

49
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.130
So we have negative 2 and 3.

50
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.540
So x is negative too.

51
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.950
Let me rewrite the points right here.

52
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.410
So the point is basically the X and the y put together separated by a comma and put in parentheses.

53
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.110
That tells you where the point is located and four points x is always the first and then why's the second.

54
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.510
So just like here are points to look like X comma y.

55
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.880
OK so our second point is negative 2 and 3.

56
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.090
So we start always with the X failure because it's negative 2 instead of going to the right.

57
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.090
We're going to go to the left.

58
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.530
So that's 1 2 to the left.

59
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
So this right here is negative 2.

60
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.740
And then we're going to go up 3 because or why value is positive 3.

61
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.570
So it's going to be 1 2 3.

62
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.810
So this is three so negative to positive 3.

63
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.180
It's right here.

64
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.900
All right.

65
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.280
And let's do our final value.

66
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.430
Our final point which is 0 5

67
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.720
so X is 0.

68
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.820
That means you start here and you do not move neither laughs nor right you just stay here in terms of

69
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.310
left or right but are y value is five.

70
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.550
That means that even though we're not moving left or right we have to go up by five.

71
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.750
This is three.

72
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.530
And this is six so five should be somewhere around here.

73
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.770
All right.

74
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:29.290
Notice is actually on top of the y axis which by the way this horizontal line is called the X axis and

75
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.470
this vertical line is called the y axis.

76
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.510
So we have the x axis

77
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.310
and we have the y axis

78
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.230
and the x axis is a horizontal one

79
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.730
and the y axis is a vertical

80
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.080
OK.

81
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.400
So we have three points.

82
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.160
We have negative 2 3 0 5 and 1 6.

83
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.810
So if we try to link these points let's see what happens.

84
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.610
So as you can see there's some sort of pattern because you have a point here and you have a point here

85
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.400
and then you have a point here.

86
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:32.690
So what if we just drew this line through all the points.

87
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.230
And of course it's supposed to be a straight line as opposed to curve a little like I did.

88
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.340
My drawing is not perfect but you get the idea as you can see here.

89
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.530
This is basically a straight line that goes through all three points.

90
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.870
And this in pink is what we call the graph over function.

91
00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:02.580
So the graph of the function is a visual that satisfy this f of x equals x 5 for all of the domain.

92
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.240
So we only pick three points but you could pick any other point and plug it in here.

93
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.270
And the point is going to be exactly in this graph.

94
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.630
Let me repeat that again.

95
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.640
If you pick any point.

96
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:24.140
So if you plug in any x value here and you get a point x y and you plug it here it will be on this graph.

97
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.930
OK.

98
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.840
So to prove that to you let's say we pick 5 to plug in.

99
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.070
So we plug in 5.

100
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.150
So our x value is 5 and or Y value is five plus five or 10.

101
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:45.610
So if we go five to the right and then 10 up notice it'll fall right here.

102
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.430
And the graph as well.

103
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.290
So you might be thinking to yourself well do all graphs look like this.

104
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.710
Are all graphs straight lines.

105
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.520
The answer is definitely no.

106
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.020
Absolutely not all graphs are aligned.

107
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.490
In fact many graphs are actually curves.

108
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.080
So instead of looking like a straight line they actually curve like up and down kind of look like winding

109
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.780
as you go left to right.

110
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:19.220
So this is a very special type of graph because this function that we tried plugging in this X plus

111
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:26.780
five is actually what's called a linear function and we'll cover linear functions in a different section.

112
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.990
For now let's keep talking about other types of graphs.

113
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.160
Now of course math is not that easy.

114
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.780
We're all grads or lines.

115
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.230
Like I said you have some graphs that are curves.

116
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.320
For example you have something called and I'm sure you've heard it before a quadratic function.

117
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.100
So a quadratic looks something like this.

118
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:58.150
A squared plus B X plus C so I actually notice this last part is linear function right.

119
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:05.560
We're just calling it with different letters B X plus C but we typically call it X plus beat.

120
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.040
All right.

121
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.410
So this last part is the same as a linear function.

122
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.770
The only difference is is quadratic term and it's called quadratic because remember when you hear the

123
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.680
word quadratic it means to the second exponent

124
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.310
quadratic means you know you have something here squared.

125
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:30.870
OK.

126
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:38.310
So this is the essence of something that's quadratic squared and the graphs of quadratic functions actually

127
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:48.110
are called parabolas.

128
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.730
That's a graph of a quadratic function.

129
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.530
How does it look.

130
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.880
Well it's actually a curve.

131
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.410
So we don't have lines anymore.

132
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.880
We actually have curves.

133
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.940
So a parabola can look something like this

134
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.520
OK.

135
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:14.650
And this one actually opens up but you could have it opening up down if we have another parabola here.

136
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.220
It could look something like this.

137
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.120
So if it opens up we have a lowest point like this one.

138
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.860
And if it opens down you have a highest point like this one point is both of them are parabolas and

139
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.280
they're graphs of quadratic functions.

140
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.770
So there are also other functions.

141
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:45.880
For example like cubic cubic instead of to the second power means to the third power.

142
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.600
These are

143
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.090
quadratic

144
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.180
and let's do a cubic function

145
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.650
a cubic function looks something like this.

146
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.340
So it's actually a little bit different than a parabola because in the parabola you have a lowest point

147
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.620
or a highest point.

148
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.440
And this cubic function you don't really have a lowest point.

149
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.900
It goes down forever and it goes up forever.

150
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:34.070
And the important point is that there are actually curves so see how the curve over here is from curves

151
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:46.050
like this curves like this and let me market for you this is cubic Antz.

152
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:51.300
Again you could also have any sort of curve you could have some crazy curves.

153
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.510
You know something like this

154
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.140
you could have stuff like this as well.

155
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.650
Something like this.

156
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.520
And then it comes like is going down.

157
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.780
Etc. These two are a quadratic.

158
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.790
This one is Kubic And these are just other

159
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:34.210
Ok now graphing a linear function is very easy to just pick two points and join them together with a

160
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:34.620
line.

161
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.990
That's it.

162
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:43.360
Graphing other functions of higher exponents like quadratic or cubic or the fourth or to the fifth power

163
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:52.810
is more an art than a science because you can just grab two points and join them together.

164
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:59.560
So for example if we had grabbed this point in this graph and we had graphed this point if we joined

165
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.150
them together would that really be the graph of this function.

166
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.840
Absolutely not.

167
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.510
It actually looks like this.

168
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.610
If we would have thought it's graphed like a line we would have just joined these two together.

169
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.380
But this is not the graph of the function.

170
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.110
OK.

171
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.620
So we'll actually go more into detail later on and how to graph these sorts of functions and what tricks

172
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.820
we can use.

173
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:29.000
For now just know that linear functions have a graph of a line and you could have other functions which

174
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.220
are curves which look like this

175
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.620
one point I wanted to mention is that in calculus Robeson's graphs can be really useful in understanding

176
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.150
Bess's metrics.

177
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.110
And not only in calculus or byssus just in business in general.

178
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.140
So if you have numbers for example I'll tell you what the profits are every week.

179
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:11.400
You can see where the profits are trending upward which is good for the company trending downward which

180
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.090
is bad.

181
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.280
So something needs to be done about it or just being at the same place which probably means as well

182
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.460
that something should be done about it so we can increase profits.

183
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:26.250
So graphs are part of daily life even though for example you're never going to go into a business thinking

184
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:31.760
about a specific parabola or maybe look at cubic function where you're going to be thinking about is

185
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:39.000
OK what does this graph tell me and graphs are great to tell you the behavior of a function.

186
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.650
OK.

187
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:47.720
So if your profit function looks like this that means that your profits increased up to a certain point

188
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.160
and then it just went down to work word that is not good.

189
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.670
All right.

190
00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.700
Assuming this represents profit.

191
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.690
Now if your profits look like this for example.

192
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.000
Well they started going up.

193
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.010
And it kind of went down a little and they went up again down and now they're training upward.

194
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.020
So that's good.

195
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:11.160
In general grads are always good because they tell you how a function behaves and not only in math but

196
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.540
actually in real business applications.

197
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.570
It tells you how the business is doing.
