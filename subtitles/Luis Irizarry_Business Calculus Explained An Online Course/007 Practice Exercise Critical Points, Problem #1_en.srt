1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,830
So let's do a couple of problems on critical points or first one says find the critical points for F

2
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,760
X equals to x squared plus 2 x minus 5.

3
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,940
So I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,880
All right.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,310
So remember that to find critical points.

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,980
First we need to find the derivative.

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,480
So let's find the derivative of f of x.

8
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,700
So first term to x squared constant multiples so we leave it on the side.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,600
We bring down a dictator which is a 2 and new leader is one and we do plus the derivative of the other

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,390
one which has 2 x so constant multiple We put it on the side and the river of of X is just 1 because

11
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:24,560
we bring our dictator which is 1 and x 2 the 1 minus 1 and then finally minus the derivative of 5 which

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,510
is 0 because the derivative of a constant is always zero.

13
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,790
And let's simplify.

14
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,390
So two times two is four.

15
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,510
So that's 4 x at the beginning.

16
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,250
Plus two times 1 is two and then times x 2 0.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,970
Remember that X to the 0 is 1.

18
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,730
So it's two times one times one which is just two.

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,840
And then the minus zero we don't market because it doesn't do anything all right.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,470
So we found our derivative.

21
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,140
How do we find the critical points.

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,430
Remember that there are critical points whenever the derivative is zero or is undefined.

23
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,200
However in this case it cannot be undefined because there is no fraction.

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,850
So we're going to do is we're just going to set it equal to zero.

25
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,720
So we'll just set it equal to zero down here for X plus two equals zero.

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,800
And remember that we need to solve for x to find those values that make this derivative equal to zero.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
So let's start by moving this to to the other side.

28
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,630
So it's adding.

29
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,880
So it'll go as subtracting

30
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,370
two minus two cancels out.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:48,200
Bring down the 4 x and 0 minus 2 is negative 2.

32
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,890
All right.

33
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,290
And this 4 is multiplying.

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,380
So we need to divide by four on both sides.

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,880
Over four and over four X equals negative two over four.

36
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:09,110
But we can actually simplify this and we can divide by two on top so two over two is one and by two

37
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,840
on the bottom for over 2 is two.

38
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,430
So negative 1 1/2.

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:15,970
All right.

40
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,720
This is your critical number

41
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,330
so critical number.

42
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,980
Remember that a critical number is basically a value that makes a derivative either equal to zero or

43
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,290
undefined.

44
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,670
However are being asked to find the critical points.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,530
I remember a points is both an X and a Y.

46
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,800
So we have the critical number.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:54,210
Now we need to take this number and plug it in where it actually goes remember on the original function

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,720
because we're looking for critical points of the original function we know that there's a critical point

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,340
when X equals a negative 1 1/2.

50
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,020
So we just need to find the y value that corresponds to this x value.

51
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,820
If instead you plug in this negative one half into this derivative you'll get zero because that's exactly

52
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,490
what we solve for.

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,140
So remember to find critical points you once you know where the x value is of the critical points.

54
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,580
Then you just plug in this value into the original.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,040
And by the way negative 1 have is as negative zero point five.

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,650
All right so let's plug it in as such.

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:47,520
Negative 0.5 So we have to times negative 0.5 squared

58
00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:02,470
and then we have plus two times negative 0.5 mine is five.

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,000
You're right.

60
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,340
So we have negative 0.5 squared.

61
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,300
That means it's negative 0.5 times negative 0.5 negative times a negative is a positive.

62
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,660
Remember that in general anything elevated to an even root is positive.

63
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:27,190
2 4 6 8 x cetera so negative 0.5 squared is positive.

64
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,810
Point twenty five so it's going to be two times

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,520
points 25.

66
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,540
Let me put this here.

67
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,530
Half of negative 0.5.

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,490
Right.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,870
And then we have plus two times negatives are 0.5 so positive times a negative equals a negative.

70
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,630
So two times negative 0.5 is mine is one.

71
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,590
And then we have at the end.

72
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,880
Mine is five.

73
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,850
And let's see what we get.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:16,490
Of negative 0.5 to a Times point 25 is Joe's point five point five.

75
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,340
Mine is one minus five minus one of minus 5 becomes minus 6.

76
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:22,900
Right.

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,070
And positive point five minus 6 is negative five point five.

78
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,880
So this negative five point five is the y value that corresponds to this negative 1 1/2.

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,730
In other words are critical point is negative 0.5.

80
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,910
That's the x value comma.

81
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,070
Negative five point five.

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,980
That is the y value.

83
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,360
And this right here is our answer.

84
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,960
So again very simple to find critical points find the derivative set it equal to zero or undefined.

85
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,210
In this case there was no undefined.

86
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,540
So it was just equals zero.

87
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,220
We know there's a zero at negative 1 1/2.

88
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,580
So we take this negative one half and we plug it into the original to get the corresponding y value.

89
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,060
After that we have X and or Y and we are done.
