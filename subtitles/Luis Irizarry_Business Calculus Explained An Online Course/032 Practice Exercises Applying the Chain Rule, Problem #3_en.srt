1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,050
All right so this is our next problem.

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,560
So it says find Ephriam of X if X equals x cubed square root of 2 x.

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,920
So this one might be a little bit tricky.

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,260
But again just relax and think about what's going on here.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,140
What's happening.

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,540
Go ahead and pause the video.

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,780
Try to give it a shot and we'll do it together.

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,120
All right.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,570
So how did it go.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,400
Let's do it together now.

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,870
So what I said before is try to figure out what's going on in this function.

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,110
Maybe you noticed already that we have two functions that are multiplying.

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,840
We have x cubed multiplying squared of two x.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,590
And how do we know they're multiplying.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,790
There's nothing in between them right.

16
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,540
So that's a way you know that they're multiplying.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,960
There's not a plus sign or a minus sign.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,670
It's just this.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,980
So first let's go ahead and start with the product rule because that's how you find the derivative of

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,010
functions that are multiplying.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,080
So then a Monnick for our product rule is remember pro.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,240
So place repeats and derivatives of the outer.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:36,330
So let's go ahead and place repeats.

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:46,860
So we have x cubed square root of 2 x and let's place our second repeat x squared and square root of

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:55,190
2 x and after we placed our repeats we have the O which stands for outer derivatives so derivative of

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,570
this one and derivative of this one.

27
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,010
All right

28
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,090
so let's keep going let's find the derivative of x cubed again this is pretty easy as the power rule.

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:23,600
So we bring down a dictator X less powerful leader is a two times this square root of 2 x on.

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,980
By the way I forgot the plus sign here.

31
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,690
Remember that when you're doing the product rule you do a plus.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,870
And the way to remember that is product starts with P and plus starts with P right.

33
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,900
So product plus great.

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:48,880
So we have this first part plus x cubed times the derivative of the square root of 2 x.

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,620
Square root of 2 x.

36
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:58,490
Here we actually need to use the chain rule because we have this inner function to X being wrapped by

37
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,400
this square root function.

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,660
So let's do this on the side and we'll put it like this.

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,940
Chain Rule.

40
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,580
For square root of 2 x.

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:10,950
All right.

42
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,700
So let's give that a shot here on the side.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,280
All right.

44
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,730
So let's go ahead and find the derivative of this square root of 2 x.

45
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,310
Remember we have our mnemonic ugly daily x box so that you x.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,720
So for step one we have you equals to the inner function right.

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:36,410
So you equals two X then for step 2 D we have the derivatives right.

48
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,750
And I'll put it here you d x.

49
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,370
That's what we're doing.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,370
So step 2 is derivatives.

51
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:53,320
So remember we have cross D-y over ADX and then we have you on top and do you on the bottom here.

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,250
And so what we need to do is we need to said why in terms of you and find the derivative.

53
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,110
So this is why in this case.

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,000
Right.

55
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,860
So why in terms of you would be the square root of you right.

56
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:16,269
Because remember the whole thing is square root of 2 x 2 x we said it was equal to you.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,620
So this is corrido to x is the same as saying the square root of you are right.

58
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:31,560
So we're going to get the derivative of this times derivative of you in terms of x so you equals 2 x

59
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,920
so derivative of 2 x.

60
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,910
All right.

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,710
Now how do we get the derivative of square root of you.

62
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,730
Remember that when you have a square root and you want to get derivatives you need to change it into

63
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,350
fractional exponents.

64
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,350
Right.

65
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,130
So let me do it down here.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,140
If you have a square root of view that is equal to you to the one half.

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,070
Right.

68
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,400
Because this is you to the one and we're getting the square root.

69
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,320
So remember we do you two the one over two.

70
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,660
That's the way the rule works.

71
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,730
And we've covered this many times in the past.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,250
So we're really finding the derivative of you to the one half.

73
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:27,630
So how do we get the derivative of you to the one half so again what we do is we treat you as an X.

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,110
And we just go ahead and proceed to do the derivative.

75
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,950
So if you had access to the one half How would you get the derivative.

76
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,600
Again very easy powerful because you have a power function.

77
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:48,820
So you bring down your dictator there's one half you two and substitute by a less powerful leader.

78
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,670
So that's one half minus one.

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,940
Why does one have minus one.

80
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,630
Let's do it together and I'll put it over here.

81
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,910
One half minus one and I'm sorry.

82
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,290
I know.

83
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,320
All over the place in this exercise.

84
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,620
But there are several parts to it.

85
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,250
That's why I'm doing it this way.

86
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,990
So one half minus one.

87
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,100
How do we do this.

88
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,020
Remember that to subtract two fractions they need to have the same denominator the same bottom right.

89
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,220
So the bottom for this one for this one is just one right.

90
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,390
Because one over 1 is 1.

91
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:32,380
So if you have a number by itself you can always say that that is equal to that number over 1.

92
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,610
So 3 is the same as 3 over 1 here.

93
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,810
One is the same as 1 over 1.

94
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,920
So now they both have bottoms but they are not equal.

95
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,780
So to get from one to two what do we need to do.

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:53,990
We need to multiply both the top and the bottom by two.

97
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,870
Right so now we have 1 have

98
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:08,790
minus one times two is two and one times two is two and let me separate this.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
All right.

100
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,640
So what is won over to minus two over two.

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,250
Remember that the bottom stays the same.

102
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:26,690
So we get a bottom of two and we just work with the top one minus two is minus 1.

103
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,690
So the point is one half minus one is equal to negative 1 1/2.

104
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:40,380
So this is the same as saying one over to you to the negative one half.

105
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:46,510
Now remember something else when we have a negative exponent like this what we do is we can actually

106
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,020
bring it down and flip the sign of the exponents.

107
00:07:50,020 --> 00:08:00,370
So this is equal to 1 on the top because there's nothing else 2 on the bottom which was already there.

108
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,190
And then we bring down this you to the negative one half.

109
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:12,500
But we bring it down by flipping the sign of this exponent instead of it being negative 1 1/2.

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,870
Now it's only one half.

111
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,510
All right.

112
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,360
So that is finally the derivative of you.

113
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,290
All right.

114
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,870
So the reason why we did all this is because we wanted to get the derivative of the square root of you

115
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:37,559
which we already have and it's this so derivative of a square root of you is won over to you to the

116
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,730
one half times the derivative of 2x.

117
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:50,310
So we have a constant multiple to and the derivative of X remember is always one.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,140
So we have one over to you to the one half times.

119
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,710
Let's go ahead and bring that over here.

120
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:14,680
So one time is to us just to over to you to the one half but what do we have we have to over two.

121
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,510
Right.

122
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,910
So this becomes one over you to the one half.

123
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,940
And I just realized I had a lot of space here and I didn't use it.

124
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,500
So now we have to do like arrows pointing everywhere and so a little bit crazy but it should be a little

125
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,320
bit more organized in your notes hopefully.

126
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,110
All right.

127
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,730
So this is the end of our second step.

128
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,050
We multiplied our derivatives and we got this.

129
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:48,250
So for the third and final step which I'll put over here remember is the X step it means to put this

130
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,410
you back in terms of x.

131
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:57,660
So this will be equal to 1 over you to the 1 1/2.

132
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:07,940
Well now that's going to be 2x because we're substituting you by 2x to the 1 1/2 and of course we never

133
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,670
leave fractional exponents.

134
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,960
So that will be one over square root of 2 x.

135
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,060
All right.

136
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,930
So this right here 1 over square root of 2 x is a derivative of this.

137
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,840
Remember we're not done yet.

138
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,010
We need to go back and plug this derivative into this.

139
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,710
So see this happens sometimes you'll have a problem maybe it's a product maybe it's a quotient maybe

140
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,280
to some but at some point you will need to start doing the chain rule.

141
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:47,060
One of those terms and you will do like all of this just to go back to the original problem and plug

142
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,500
it in.

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,740
So let me separate this to avoid any confusion

144
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,240
all of this that we did over here is simply the derivative of a square root of 2 x.

145
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:08,120
So now we go back and we put the derivative that we found over here because remember we have x cubed

146
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:19,310
times the derivative of square root of 2 x which is 1 over square root of 2 x times 1 over root of 2

147
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,970
x.

148
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,670
And actually we'll just go ahead and leave it like that.

149
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,610
So let me write it again three x squared

150
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,440
square root of 2 x plus.

151
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,790
So here we have x cubed times 1.

152
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,690
So that's x cubed on top.

153
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,620
Over the square root of 2 x.

154
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:47,810
That is our derivative for the original function which was this one here.

155
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,100
So all of this got complicated because we had to use the chain rule on this term.

156
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,670
If this had been some other term like X to the two then it would have been a lot easier.

157
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,040
Right.

158
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,080
But again this happened sometimes times I wanted to show you an example of how sometimes you start doing

159
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,450
one rule and you have to sidetrack and do the chain rule and then come back to the original problem

160
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,330
with the answer from the chain rule to keep doing the problem.

161
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,930
All right.

162
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,210
So again we went ahead and did the mnemonic UTX on the square root of 2 x because it is a composition

163
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,430
of functions.

164
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:29,190
So we said you equal to the enter we find the derivatives and we multiply them and then we set back

165
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,090
in terms of x and see this problem even got a little more complicated because we had to get the derivative

166
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,200
of a square root.

167
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,850
So then you have to change it into one half.

168
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,560
Then we had to do a subtraction of fractions etc. etc..

169
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,920
So this problem Halik all the bits and pieces of a complicated problem and I cannot just give you the

170
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,140
easy problems because guess what.

171
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,730
When you sit down on a test and you get something like this you're going to freak out if we haven't

172
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,150
done anything even similar.

173
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,240
All right.

174
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,390
So I know that was a little bit long but that's the way it is with the chain rule.

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,130
Just remember to keep on practicing.
