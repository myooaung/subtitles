1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,380
All right.

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,330
So welcome to this lesson.

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:29,760
Right now we're going to talk about the heart and soul of this course and they are mnemonics.

4
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,820
So if you've never heard the term I have a definition here for you.

5
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,740
A mnemonic is a memory aid that helps you remember things easily.

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,800
All right so it's something that you think about that allows you to remember stuff when you need it.

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,430
And even if you've never heard the word mnemonic I'm 100 percent sure you have worked with mnemonics

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,720
in the past.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,640
For example here's a famous one

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
pandas.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,390
Ever heard of this.

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:13,040
Well pandas is a monarch used to remember the order of operations parentheses exponents multiplication

13
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,370
division addition and subtraction.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,020
So what do you think is easier remembering each and every one of those.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,380
Or simply remembering pandas and then getting it from there.

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,280
Of course Pandurs is way easier.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,010
That's why it's in a Monnick and something that helps you remember the order of operation without having

18
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,160
to learn so many words in sequence.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,510
Here's another mnemonic that we use in math and you've probably seen before foil

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,900
right.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,930
So if you are from an English speaking country then most likely you've seen this at some point.

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,700
And remember a foil is a mnemonic that's used to remind people how to multiply something like this.

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,850
So for example if you have a plus b times a minus B

24
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,750
then A foil tells you how you need to multiply this.

25
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,240
It's first.

26
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,470
So this term and this term than the outer this term.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,720
And then at the other extreme this term then you multiply the enter this one and this one and then you

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,860
multiply the last this one and this one will see that foil is a really awesome mnemonic because it tells

29
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,550
you right there what you need to do in terms of multiplying this and in fact mnemonics work.

30
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,850
If you don't believe me let me show you so here we are at Wikipedia and we have an article that's a

31
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,670
list of mnemonics.

32
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,460
Check it out.

33
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,050
There are mnemonics for all of these fields right.

34
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,410
We have mnemonics for art astronomy biology business chemistry computing all those things.

35
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,170
And it's for a reason they actually work.

36
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,870
So for example Check it out for arts to remember the elements of Arts base form texture shape line Valley

37
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,130
color.

38
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,370
Think about it how long would it take you to remember this.

39
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,500
And you might get confused at any point right.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,570
But check out this cool mnemonic.

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,260
Spaceships fly through space looking very cool.

42
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,000
Isn't that way easier to remember.

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,600
Right.

44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,530
And then every first letter of each word tells you what you're talking about.

45
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:44,420
So spaceships that's for space fly is for reform through is for texture etc. etc. you see that there's

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,850
a big big difference in how long it would take you to remember all of these and order versus remembering

47
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,000
this sentence.

48
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,600
And like I said we also have it for us Trauner me we have it for a biology basis in economics chemistry.

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,300
I mean there's a demonic everywhere.

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,270
And the fact that there are so many mnemonics should tell you something about them.

51
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,160
They actually work.

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,050
Do you think that if they didn't work there would be so many of them.

53
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,230
Absolutely not.

54
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,040
So what I'm going to do in the tutorial is for many key concepts I'll provide you with a mnemonic so

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,190
that it's easy for you to remember exactly how to do the problem or what a concept is.

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,890
For example the product rule says the derivative of f of x times g of X equals the derivative of f of

57
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,490
x times g of X plus f of x times the derivative of g of x.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,350
Do you think that if I tell you that will remember in 10 minutes what I just sent Now of course not.

59
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:57,480
However if I give you any money that says for the product rule you grab the first three letters of product.

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,460
So you grab pro and this stands for place repeats and then do the outer derivatives and that's it.

61
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,480
Then I'm sure you will remember this right.

62
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,320
Not the first thing that I said which is the actual rule but you'll remember pro.

63
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,190
So that's the beauty of mnemonics.

64
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,170
They are simple.

65
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,540
They're awesome and they can help you recall stuff in the middle of a test that otherwise you would

66
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,640
not recall.

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,510
By the way if you're a student and you're coming just for a specific lesson like for example you want

68
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,140
to know more about the chain rule and you go directly to the chain rule.

69
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,740
You might hear me talking about different random things.

70
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,250
So for example if we're doing a problem or we need to find the power rule you're going to hear me talk

71
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,840
about bringing down a dictator and substituting by a less powerful leader.

72
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,740
That's because that's in a money that's earlier in the tutorial.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,790
So if you jump into a specific lesson and you hear something that's maybe a little bit out of place

74
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:03,150
or something that doesn't make sense to you like place repeats our dictator or something like that just

75
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,390
go ahead and do the problem the way you know how to do it.

76
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,440
You do not have to use the mnemonic right.

77
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,420
I would say pretty much all of my students over the years I've liked the way I use mnemonics.

78
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,540
But if they're not for you you don't really have to use them.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,330
All right.

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,840
And one last thing not every lesson has a mnemonic I need to have a balance between giving you too many

81
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,860
mnemonics I don't want to give you 100 mnemonics right.

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,910
That's a lot to remember but I do give you mnemonics for the things that are either number one key concepts

83
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,740
or number two a little bit tricky.

84
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,710
All right.

85
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,080
The last thing I want to say is every time there's a mnemonic in the tutorial it's going to look like

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:55,930
this.

87
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,400
Right.

88
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,270
So any time you hear that music and it says it's mnemonic time you know a mnemonic is coming.

89
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,720
All right.

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,030
So take advantage of the mnemonics.

91
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,970
I hope you like them and I'm sure that if you study them they will help you remember stuff a lot easier

92
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,760
than not having them at all.

93
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:21,140
So whenever you see a mnemonic remember to take notes and to use it while you're doing problems right.

94
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,790
That's going to drill it in your brain and it's going to stay there.

95
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,280
Don't think that using the Monnick three times will be enough for you to learn it.

96
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,480
You have to put it in practice over and over and over again.

97
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,160
Practice is critical to learning mnemonics.

98
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,380
All right so let me know how you like then.

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,580
Manics I'll see you in the next video.
