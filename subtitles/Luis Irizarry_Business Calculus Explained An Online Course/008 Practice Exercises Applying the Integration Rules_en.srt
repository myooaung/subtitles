1
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,460
All right.

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,810
So let's go ahead and do a couple of indefinite integrals using the rules of integrals.

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,590
So let's start with the power rule here I'm giving you three problems for you to do.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:37,150
So it says find the following definite integrals integral of x cubed integral of x to the negative 2.

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,750
And and third rule of x to the nine.

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,030
Go ahead and pause the video and give that a shot.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,690
All right.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,860
So let's go ahead and do these integrals.

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,550
So remember because we're doing the power rule on each one then we can use our mnemonic increase and

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,170
divide.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,610
So starting with the first we have X to the let's increase the exponents.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:14,670
So that's three plus one over three plus one that's a divide part plus C and then that equals x to the

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,300
fourth

14
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,770
over three plus one in the bottom four as well.

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,020
Plus C and that is our answer.

16
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:37,190
All right so moving on to the second one again power to increase and divide so x to the negative two

17
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:50,460
plus one over negative two plus one plus C so if you two daughters and you pay one back.

18
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,130
Now you only know one daughter right.

19
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:03,630
So that's X to the negative on over negative 1 plus C.

20
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,260
All right.

21
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,260
And remember we don't like negative exponents.

22
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,290
So what we need to do is we take this x to the negative one and we bring it to the bottom and how do

23
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,910
we do that.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,450
We have to flip the sign of the exponent so we're going to have a one on top.

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,330
And we're bringing down this x to the negative one with a flipped exponent sign.

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:34,610
So instead of being X the negative one it will be X to the one or just X because remember that X to

27
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,540
the one is the same as X..

28
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,490
And very important.

29
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,930
Let's not forget that we had a negative one on the bottom.

30
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,990
We don't have to mark that one but we do have to make everything negative because if the bottom is negative

31
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:57,680
then the whole fraction is negative or if the tops are negative the whole fraction is negative as well.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,750
Now in this case the top wasn't negative the top itself only the exponents of the top.

33
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,120
But that doesn't make the whole thing negative.

34
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,830
However on the bottom we did have this negative one which makes whole fraction negative.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,960
All right.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,130
And then we finally add our plus C and that is our answer.

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,130
All right.

38
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,220
And let's do the last one.

39
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,140
So increase and divide.

40
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,930
We have X and we add 1 here.

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,490
So that's the increase part nine plus one.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,130
And on the bottom we have nine plus one as well.

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,370
Plus see.

44
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,110
All right so what is nine plus one it is 10.

45
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:53,360
So we have X to the tenth over 10 plus C and that is our answer.

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,880
All right.

47
00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:00,410
So very simple problems just power roll which we covered in the last exercise video.

48
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,690
All you need to remember is increase and divide.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,140
All right.

50
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,970
So moving on let's do a couple of problems using the constant rule for integrals.

51
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,930
So find the following indefinite intervals integral of three interval of 10 and this one down here is

52
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,540
an interesting one because you do not see anything but whenever you don't see anything.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,610
What does that mean.

54
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,070
What number is there.

55
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,280
All right go ahead and pause the video and give these three a shot.

56
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,510
All right so again the constant rule is very easy.

57
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,230
It tells you that whenever you're integrating a constant all you do is you take the constant and you

58
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,030
multiplied by X and then you do plus C..

59
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,670
And the reason why we do this I'll show you in the first problem at least.

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:04,420
So remember that integral of three is the same as saying integral of 3 x to 0.

61
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,900
Right.

62
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,410
So as to the 0 is 1.

63
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,920
Because anything to zero power is one.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,770
OK.

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,110
But if we have X to the 0 then we can do increase and divide.

66
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,110
So we have the three we increase and divide here.

67
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:39,590
So that's X to 0 plus 1 and 0 plus 1 on the bottom plus see and that gives us 3 x to the 1.

68
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:47,060
So we just put X and then over 1 we don't have to mark the over 1 because it gives us the same thing.

69
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:54,580
Plus see this is why the integral of a constant is that same constant multiplied by x.

70
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,340
Because if you look at it it's actually 3 x to the 0.

71
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:04,000
And when you do increase and divide on the X of the 0 that gives you this X..

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,120
So it's a row of three is three x plus C.

73
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,020
Let's do the second one.

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,390
Again same concept.

75
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm not going to do the x to the 0 again.

76
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,190
I'm just going to do it directly.

77
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:22,170
So integral of a constant is the same constant x plus C..

78
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,320
All right.

79
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,820
That is the answer for this one.

80
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,390
And this is the answer for the first one.

81
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,610
All right all right.

82
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,630
So what does this last one here.

83
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,540
Kind of looks weird because what are you integrating.

84
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,250
There's nothing in the middle.

85
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,860
Well remember that when there is nothing what it really means is there a 1.

86
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,440
So this is the same as saying integral of one dx.

87
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,560
So again we're integrating a constant.

88
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:01,200
All we do is we take the constant and when multiplied by X so 1 x plus C.

89
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,880
Now remember that one x is the same as saying X.

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,340
Right.

91
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,440
Because 1 times anything is that anything by itself.

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:18,640
So 1 times X is just X and then plus see and that is our answer.

93
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,570
All right.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,620
So again we use the constant rule for integrals or we need to do is take the concept that you're integrating

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,210
slap an X next to it and add the plus C and you're good to go.

96
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:34,660
Right.

97
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,590
So now let's move on to the logarithmic rule.

98
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:45,420
We have find the following indefinite integrals integral of one over X and the integral of x to the

99
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,200
negative one.

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,650
Go ahead and pause the video and give them one shot.

101
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:04,750
All right so let's see what we have so remember our logarithmic rule for integrals says that the integral

102
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:14,030
of one over X is L-N of the absolute value of x plus C.

103
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,220
And in fact there's nothing else that we need to do here.

104
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,520
This is the answer.

105
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,190
That's literally what the rule says right now.

106
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Moving on to the next one.

107
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:34,179
Well you might have remembered that actually x to the negative one is the same as 1 over X right.

108
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,400
Because if you have X elevated to a negative exponent you can bring that down by flipping the sign of

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,220
the exponents.

110
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,820
Right.

111
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:53,650
So this is the same as saying one over x to the one because we brought it down sine changes and X so

112
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,540
the one is just X so 1 over X right.

113
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,670
So at this point this is the same problem as this one.

114
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,340
Right.

115
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:09,100
And the answer is a line of absolute value of x.

116
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,230
Now typically we're going to solve problems.

117
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,540
If I give you a problem in this form one over x to the something what I typically recommend is for you

118
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,280
to bring it up and then find the integral.

119
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,440
So basically one over X would turn into X to the negative one.

120
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,350
And from here you would do the power rule for integrals.

121
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,300
Now remember that I mentioned X to the negative one is the only power function has integral.

122
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,890
We did not use the power rule for.

123
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,880
We actually just use a logarithmic rule.

124
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,180
In fact if we try to use the power rule here what happens.

125
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,460
So if we increase and divide we have negative one plus one.

126
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,830
So that's increase and then divide

127
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,570
x to the what is negative one plus one.

128
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,050
If you own daughter and you pay them back.

129
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,160
Oh nothing right.

130
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,600
So that zero extra zero and oops why do we have on the bottom.

131
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,340
We have division by zero.

132
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:21,370
So because this breaks down we do not use the power rule when we have X to the negative one.

133
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,590
So for example we had X of the negative 5 x and the negative 7 or X or the negative 10.

134
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,420
Then we can use that power rule.

135
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,080
But for X axilla the negative one there's this special rule that says that the integral of x to the

136
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,270
negative one.

137
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:45,590
Or in other words the integral of one of x which is the same thing is natural log of the absolute value

138
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,150
of x plus C

139
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,070
and that's it.

140
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,240
All right so let's finish up with the exponential rule for integrals.

141
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,860
So we have find the following indefinite integrals integral of each of the X and to grow of E to the

142
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,920
4 x integral of E to the negative 2 x and E to the 10 x.

143
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

144
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,090
All right.

145
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,130
So let's go ahead and do these four problems.

146
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:32,410
So for each of the X remember that in general the integral of each of the X is just e to the X right

147
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,280
X never changes remember that non-monic.

148
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,820
So each of the axes that special function where the derivative and integral are the same as the original

149
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,020
function.

150
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,340
Now let's actually just apply the rule to see how it works.

151
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,500
But we know that the answer needs to be to the max.

152
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:58,780
So remember that the exponential rule for integrals says that if you have E to the K x in this case

153
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,480
k is just one.

154
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:10,240
Because nothing is really multiplying the X just one that is equal to 1 over a K but k again is 1.

155
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,220
And then we keep this e to the X.

156
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,940
So we keep that each of the X and then plus C so 1 over 1.

157
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:31,740
We can actually take that out and we have each of the X plus C and that is our answer.

158
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,210
All right.

159
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,580
So moving on to the next one.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,370
So here we have each of the four acts OK.

161
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,080
In this case is four.

162
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,850
So remember that we divide by K.

163
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,360
So that's 1 over 4.

164
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,750
And then we keep the same thing.

165
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,940
We're integrating the two the 4 x plus C.

166
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,720
All right.

167
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,330
That is our answer by the way.

168
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:06,840
When you have one over four times each of the four X is the same as saying each to the 4 x over 4.

169
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,110
All right.

170
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,890
So don't let this one over four for you is just saying that you're dividing by four.

171
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,990
This whole thing.

172
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,750
So another way of writing it is like this.

173
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,460
All right but either way is correct.

174
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,960
All right so let's do the third one.

175
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:33,910
We have that K is actually negative 2 to remember K is always this number that's multiplying the X..

176
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:45,670
So we divide by k 1 over negative 2 and then we keep this original one the to the negative 2 x and then

177
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,590
we do plus C and again and let's rewrite it.

178
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,040
So we're dividing by negative 2.

179
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:02,180
So the whole fraction becomes negative so that's negative to the negative 2 x over 2.

180
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,580
And again this sign for the negative two just went to the whole.

181
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,250
Fraction because of the bottom or the top is negative.

182
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:17,700
Then the whole thing is negative then plus C and that is our answer.

183
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,010
But again if you left it as this then that's OK and let's do the last one.

184
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,460
So what is k k is 10 right.

185
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,200
So we divide by 10.

186
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,970
So that's one over 10 easy to the 10 x which is right.

187
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:48,210
What we have here plus C and again this is equal to to the 10 x over 10.

188
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:56,550
So we're just dividing by 10 and then plus C and at that point we are done.

189
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,460
All right.

190
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,830
So we used our exponential rule for integrals.

191
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:08,100
Again what we do is we divide by k ks the number of multiplying the X and then we just put this again

192
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,810
the function that you're integrating and then you add the plus C and you are done.
