1
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,660
OK.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,530
So we actually just found the indefinite integral for a function and ready.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,050
But let's formalize the process.

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,130
How do we indicate that we're finding an indefinite integral.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,300
It turns out there's a special notation for this.

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,030
And let's see what this says right now.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,110
By the way the notation is going to look a little bit weird a little bit different but as we do more

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,870
and more problems it will become very easy.

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,070
So to find the indefinite integral for a function it's going to look something like this.

10
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:03,230
So first you have the integral symbol which is kind of like an S but a little bit more deligated.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,410
So it looks like this.

12
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,950
All right.

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,110
This is the integral symbol.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,090
So always together with this integral symbol is the term dx.

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:27,180
All right so you always have this s DX right as d x always go together.

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,820
Then you have the actual function that you're finding the indefinite integral for all right.

17
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:42,240
So the function goes in the modal.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,690
OK so this is read as the integral of after tax income.

19
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,570
So this is read as

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,710
integral

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,830
of fallbacks

22
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,230
and then we say that this is equal to.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,639
Here we're going to put the actual indefinite integral.

24
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,500
So our briquets have X

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,260
plus C.

26
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,740
Right.

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,750
That is our actual indefinite integral

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,850
right.

29
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,960
So this is the notation.

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,760
So if you see what's on the left and you have integral of f of x then you know you need to find the

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
indefinite integral of this function.

32
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,530
And the result is going to look something like this.

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,050
This will be the antiderivative plus a constant OCHA.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
So let's do a couple of examples to put this in practice.

35
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:09,530
So we already know for example that the derivative of x squared is 2x.

36
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,280
So we're finding the indefinite integral of 2 x.

37
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:28,240
Remember your dx what is there's going to be equal to so indefinite integral to x is x squared plus

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,660
C All right.

39
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,570
And remember something to verify that your answer is right.

40
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,330
You just need to take the derivative of the indefinite integral to check if it gives you back your to

41
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,890
X..

42
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,640
All right so with indefinite integrals to check.

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,430
Answer.

44
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,550
You simply find

45
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,770
the derivative of the antiderivative.

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,830
So uppercase f prime of X if that makes sense.

47
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,470
So remember it when you're finding an integral finding a function whose derivative is this function

48
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,450
that you have.

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,910
So if you differentiate the answer it should give you back this original function.

50
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,190
That's all we said here.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,810
To check your answer just find the derivative of the antiderivative.

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:39,810
So let's take the derivative of this indefinite integral so x squared plus C and again it doesn't matter

53
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,430
the specific value of c..

54
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,890
It's just a constant.

55
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,700
So it's going to go away anyways because the derivative of a constant is zero.

56
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:55,800
So the derivative of x squared is to X and the derivative of a constant is zero.

57
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,860
All right so to X over here and 2 x over here.

58
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,190
So we did the problem right.

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,910
Let's do one other example.

60
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,300
So we have an integral and by the way drawing this line correctly it's probably going to take a couple

61
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,010
of tries.

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,910
Don't expect to get it right on the first time.

63
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,270
Again it's kind of like an --.

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,580
But Ellen gave it.

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,780
So it's a little bit longer than usual and it goes up kind of like this.

66
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,850
And by the way this is called the integral symbol.

67
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,750
OK.

68
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,760
And like I said this integral symbol always goes together with DX.

69
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:40,150
So another example is like we did before the derivative of 2 x squared is for X right.

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,990
So let's find the indefinite integral of 4 x.

71
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,850
All right.

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,880
So we do the integral for x dx and I don't like to give you extra information that you won't need.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,530
We don't need to know why this side looks like this or the DX come from.

74
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:07,420
Just know that when you see this notation interval of 4 x dx that means to find the indefinite integral

75
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:13,310
of this function for X and you could also put it in parentheses it makes it clearer.

76
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,300
Sometimes you can do that as well.

77
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,980
All right.

78
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:27,390
So again we know that the antiderivative of this function is 2 x squared.

79
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:37,650
And then remember that for indefinite integrals we always put a plus C all right.

80
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:50,650
So you always put the seat.

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,020
This is very important.

82
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,440
If you just say OK the indefinite integral of 4 x 2 x squared in theory that is not correct because

83
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
it's incomplete.

84
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:08,760
You always always have to include this plus C for indefinite integrals because again remember you're

85
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,210
finding a family of functions not a single function by itself.

86
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,050
All right.

87
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,900
So let's go ahead and check her answer.

88
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,940
We'll find the derivative of this indefinite integral.

89
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,710
And let's see what that gives us.

90
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:37,610
Two x squared plus C the derivative of this is going to be a derivative of the first term is for X and

91
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,870
again the derivative of a constant is zero.

92
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,480
All right.

93
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,310
And by the way here I said to check the answer find the derivative of the antiderivative.

94
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,690
In theory that's correct.

95
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,510
But what we actually did here is we found the derivative of the whole indefinite integral.

96
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,500
So we're including the plus C.

97
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,940
So let me go ahead and fix that so that we are consistent.

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,530
In theory both ways are right.

99
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:14,160
But let's take out the prime from here and let's go ahead and add the plus the.

100
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,530
And we'll get the derivative of the whole thing.

101
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:27,470
Trying to remember this is a comma for this word and this is the prime for this.

102
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:33,049
So in other words what we have is to check the answer you find the derivative of the indefinite integral

103
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,950
of the antiderivative plus C and that's exactly what we did here.

104
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:46,520
The indefinite integral for example of two X was X squared plus C and then to check or answer it we

105
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,330
found the derivative of this x squared plus C.

106
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,830
All right so the derivative of x squared is just 2 x and the derivative of a constant is always 0.

107
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,460
So remember this plus see when you get the derivative of this.

108
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,220
It's always going to give you zero.

109
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,820
Same thing for down here.

110
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,220
We found that the indefinite interval of 4 x is 2 x squared plus C and remember you always put the plus

111
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:21,170
C and then we found the derivative of this indefinite interval of 2 x squared plus the derivative of

112
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,900
2 x squared for X and the derivative of the C is zero.

113
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,840
So it's just for x.

114
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:34,310
If the answer that you get here is equal to the original function then you're integrating then you know

115
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,900
your answer is correct.

116
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
Same thing here here.

117
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,630
The original function was to X and when we tested it we got back to X.

118
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,470
So we know that the answer is correct.

119
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,560
Now you might be thinking OK so for these functions we knew them by memory that the antiderivative is

120
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,280
x squared and that for 4 x the antiderivative is 2 x squared.

121
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,890
So is there a process for finding these indefinite integrals.

122
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,750
In other words if I gave you a function can we find the indefinite integral.

123
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,390
The answer for the most part is yes.

124
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,030
So next we'll go over some properties and some rules for finding indefinite integrals.

125
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,420
Now in case you were wondering why they're called indef. it's because you have as an answer a family

126
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,240
of functions so an infinite number of functions that have this form X squared plus C for example.

127
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,130
Is there such thing as a definite integral.

128
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,240
You bet and we'll see that later on.

129
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,080
But for now though we'll keep working with indefinite integrals.

130
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,140
So again this is the notation for finding any definite end to rule.

131
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:52,430
It's this integral symbol V.L. unjaded as this one always goes with the dx and the function that you're

132
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,920
integrating goes in the middle.

133
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,330
This is read as integral of f of x dx.

134
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,770
All right.

135
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:08,520
And then the answer to that is simply the antiderivative of this function f of x plus the constant c.

136
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:17,750
Right and we always do plus C we did two examples we found the antiderivative and we put it plus C and

137
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,780
then we checked our answer.

138
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:26,120
And again you can always check your answer by finding the derivative of the indefinite integral.

139
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,290
So you find the derivative of uppercase f of x plus C and that should give you back this function that

140
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,180
you integrate it in the first place.

141
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,290
Don't forget Always put your plus C.
