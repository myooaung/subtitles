00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.940
All right so here we have our second exercise for relative extrema.

2
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.230
It says find the relative extrema for f of x equals x cubed minus 27 x plus 102.

3
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.280
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

4
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.400
All right so let's do it together relative extrema.

5
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.800
That's what we're finding.

6
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.970
So the first thing always that we need to do is to find the derivative.

7
00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.090
So let's go ahead and find that first derivative and let's get the derivative of each individual term.

8
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.280
And as you know we keep the sign in between.

9
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.599
So a derivative of this one.

10
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.760
Execute.

11
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.180
It's a power function.

12
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:18.400
So we bring down our dictator 3 X less powerful becomes a two minus constant moldable we have a 27.

13
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.830
So we leave it outside and derivative of X is we're bringing down a dictator which is 1 x 2 0.

14
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.540
And plus the derivative of this constant which is zero because one or two is just a number.

15
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.570
All right so let's simplify.

16
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.440
We have 3 x squared.

17
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.250
Mine is 27 times 1 times x 2 0.

18
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.840
And again this is one.

19
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.800
So it's 27 times 1 which is just 27.

20
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.840
And then the plus 0 we do not market because it doesn't do anything all right.

21
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.730
So we found the derivative of f of x.

22
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.320
Next step is to find the values that make the derivative either equal to zero or undefined.

23
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.640
But again in this example it cannot be undefined because there's no bottom and therefore we cannot have

24
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.770
a zero on the denominator because there is none.

25
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.340
So we're just going to find the numbers that make this equal to zero.

26
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:45.180
Three x squared minus 27 equals zero.

27
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.640
I want to show you something.

28
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.180
So in the video that will continue in just a second I explain that you have to solve for x by moving

29
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.880
this 27 to the other side dividing by 3 and then taking the square root of both sides.

30
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.640
However maybe you noticed this what happens if you factor out a three from this side.

31
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.780
So you put a 3 on the side.

32
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.090
And here you have X squared and minus.

33
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.780
So if you take out three from 27 27 over three is nine equals zero.

34
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.460
So maybe that's something that you notice that we could do.

35
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.220
Now what is this.

36
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.390
Remember this A-squared minus B squared.

37
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.300
That is a difference of squares.

38
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.250
Right.

39
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:50.140
And remember that difference of squares is equal to a plus b times a minus p.

40
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.170
Again this is difference of squares

41
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.170
right.

42
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.290
So the A in this case would be X and the B would be 3.

43
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:16.880
So this could be factored as 3 times x plus 3 times X minus 3.

44
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.990
You see that that's according to our rule for difference of squares and then you can look at this and

45
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.620
say OK this whole thing to be zero.

46
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.190
Either this one has to be zero or this one has to be zero.

47
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.630
And then you know you can just grab each term and say X plus three equals zero you move three to the

48
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.150
other side by subtracting right.

49
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.060
These cancel out x equals negative 3.

50
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.420
That's one of your answers.

51
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.170
So when you plug in negative three over here that's going to give you negative three plus three equals

52
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:04.020
zero or on the other hand if you have X minus three equals zero.

53
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.770
Which is this one here at 3 three and both sides

54
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.790
cancels out x equals positive 3.

55
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.810
All right.

56
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.980
And that makes sense because three minus 3 gives you zero.

57
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.220
In other words if you did the problem this way where you factor out the three and then you got this

58
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.240
difference of squares and then you factor.

59
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.730
That's great.

60
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.090
Or if you did it a different way and still got negative three and three then that's perfect as well.

61
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.510
Right.

62
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.510
It doesn't matter as long as you get the three and negative three.

63
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.850
I just show you the other way in the video to give you a different alternative because different of

64
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.970
squares we covered before but we hadn't covered getting square roots.

65
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.250
When you're solving for X..

66
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.330
All right so now let's go back to the original video.

67
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.920
So we only have one X here so maybe we can solve for it.

68
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.080
Let's give it a shot.

69
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.370
So let's move this 27 to the other side plus 27 and plus 27.

70
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:26.420
We bring down the 3 x squared negative 27 plus 27 cancels out and zero plus 27 is positive 27 right.

71
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.860
So we have this three multiplying the x squared.

72
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.050
So let's get rid of that 3 by dividing by three on both sides.

73
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.770
So we have three over three cancels out.

74
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.930
X squared equals nine.

75
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.360
OK.

76
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.030
So remember we don't want X squared we want x.

77
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.290
So what is the inverse of squaring something.

78
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.630
It has to be taking the root right.

79
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.880
And why is this.

80
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.360
Well think about it doesn't make sense why taking the square root is the opposite of squaring something.

81
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:14.040
For example if I tell you three squared that gives you nine but if you take the roots of that nine it

82
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.600
gives you three right.

83
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.140
So they're just opposites.

84
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.300
So this square root cancels out with this squared.

85
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.300
And we have X equals square root of nine which is three.

86
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.670
Now there is something about this that you need to know the answer is not only 3.

87
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.160
The answer is plus minus three.

88
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.650
What does that mean.

89
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.880
That means that both positive 3 and negative three are part of the answer.

90
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.690
We might have done our problem before where For simplicity's sake we just said that the square root

91
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.670
of nine was three.

92
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.920
But in reality the answer is going to be plus or minus three.

93
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.510
That means that you have two critical numbers positive three and negative three.

94
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.980
All right.

95
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.540
This is very important fact I'll put it over here.

96
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:22.850
Square root of for example 9 is plus or minus three square root of positive 16 is plus or minus 4.

97
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.680
Square root of 25 equals plus or minus 5 etc. etc..

98
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.370
All right.

99
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:41.730
And this happens every time you're doing for example a square root.

100
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:56.130
Now this is only true for even roots.

101
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:03.830
All right so even roots are 2 4 6 8 etc..

102
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:14.310
If you have an odd root something like for example the cube root of 27 then the answer is going to be

103
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:23.780
only three not plus or minus three because if you put it because a minus because negative three to the

104
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.870
third power is not 27 is negative 27.

105
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.790
That's the thing about odd roots.

106
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.830
They actually keep the sign of the original number.

107
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.430
In this case however even roots.

108
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.940
So this is a square root.

109
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.480
So that means he has a 2 but it could also have a 4 6 8 x cetera.

110
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:50.770
Let me cross out this odd route so this even route you have to account for both possibilities because

111
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:57.510
three squared is nine but negative three squared is also nine and so on and so forth.

112
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.090
So if you go down here and only put positive 3 Your answer is incomplete and you're going to get partial

113
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.070
points.

114
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.060
All right.

115
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:11.330
So even roots remember always give you plus minus answers.

116
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.440
So we have two critical numbers and what we'll do is we'll go to our third step

117
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.760
and we'll put our two critical numbers.

118
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.550
So that's negative 3 and 3.

119
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.940
So we have to test to the left of negative 3 between negative 3 and 3.

120
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.320
And to the right of 3.

121
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:46.350
So to the left of negative 3 loves to negative 10 it's typically an easy number between negative 3 and

122
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.880
3.

123
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.170
Let's do zero and to the right of 3.

124
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.490
Let's to also test.

125
00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:02.060
All right so let's grab these three test values and plug them into the derivative so prime of negative

126
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.270
10.

127
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.390
So we have three times negative 10 squared

128
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:22.350
minus 27 negative 10 squared is 100 because negative times a negative equals a hundred times three is

129
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:29.830
three hundred minus 27 is to 73.

130
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.670
So that means that to the left of negative three we have a positive value for the derivative.

131
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.200
All right.

132
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.030
Let's test the zero prime of zero into the derivative.

133
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.180
So we have three times zero squared.

134
00:11:50.180 --> 00:12:00.650
Mine is 27 so 0 squared is 0 times 3 just cancels out at zero and we have negative 27 as the answer.

135
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:09.190
So between negative 3 and 3 we have a negative derivative.

136
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.150
And finally let's test our last value which is 10.

137
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.850
Plug it into the derivative.

138
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:21.560
So we have three times 10 squared minus 27.

139
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.020
In fact that will give us the same answer as the negative 10 because we're squaring it.

140
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:32.360
So at the end of the day it doesn't matter if it's positive 10 or negative 10 10 squared is a hundred

141
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.260
times three is 300.

142
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.120
Minus 27 is to 73.

143
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.110
So the right of 3 we have a positive derivative.

144
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.900
There we go.

145
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:54.840
All right so what is the last step we need to classify our negative 3 and our 3 as either Max or mennes

146
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.170
or none.

147
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:01.350
Because sometimes if the sign doesn't change as you go from the left of the x value to the right of

148
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.460
the x value then it's neither a max or a min.

149
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.980
All right so let's go ahead and use our mnemonic.

150
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.380
I'll put it up here.

151
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.390
So remember we draw a max and a min

152
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.020
max and that's a min.

153
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.540
And let's draw a line to the left and right of each.

154
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.220
So that's one here and one here and one here and one here.

155
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:36.070
And for the max to the left of it we have a positive slope because it's going up and to the right.

156
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.910
We have a negative slope because it's going down.

157
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:45.910
And then for the men to the left of it we have a negative slope because it's going down and to the right

158
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.840
of it we have a positive slope because it's going up.

159
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:57.640
So again this mnemonic reminds you how the signs look for the left on the right of each type of extrema

160
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.560
for both Max and men's.

161
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.560
We're going to use these two to check out what the extremes are.

162
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.200
So negative 3 we have positive on the left and negative on the right.

163
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.690
So it looks like it's going to be a max right.

164
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.640
Positive on the left and negative on the right.

165
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.660
And then for three we have negative on the left and positive on the right.

166
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.590
So here we have negative on the left and positive on the right.

167
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.010
So it's a min.

168
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:37.790
So we have one Max and 1 min last thing we need to do is find the corresponding y values for each of

169
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.150
these critical numbers for this negative 3.

170
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.120
And for this three and remember to do that we plug them into the original function because we want the

171
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.200
y values for these two.

172
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:51.890
So let's go ahead and do that.

173
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.640
So we have f of negative 3.

174
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.270
So plug in entry into the original we have negative 3 cubed

175
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.200
minus 27 times negative 3 plus 102.

176
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:21.460
So mine is 27 which is negative 3 plus 1 0 2.

177
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:28.280
So that will give us negative 3 cubed is negative 3 times and negative 3 which is 9 times negative 3

178
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.370
again which is negative 27.

179
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:40.400
And when we do it down here actually negative 27 and then negative times a negative is a positive and

180
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.820
27 times 3 is 81

181
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:58.290
then plus one or two and again feel free to use a calculator for all of these it gives those 1:56.

182
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.100
All right so that's a y value for negative 3.

183
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.310
Let's find the y value for positive 3.

184
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.320
So that's three cubed.

185
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.820
Mine is 27 times three plus 102.

186
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.150
That gives us 27

187
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.390
minus.

188
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.940
This time it's negative times a positive.

189
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.240
So it stays a negative 27 times three.

190
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.190
We said it's 81 plus 102

191
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.380
which gives us 48.

192
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.300
So there we have her answer.

193
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.790
Let's put it up here.

194
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:53.640
So we said that for negative three we have a max write positive on the left negative on the right.

195
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.740
According to this so we have Max

196
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:06.730
at negative 3 comma 1 to 6.

197
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.319
That is a Y value for that point.

198
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.770
And we also have a men

199
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.670
which is the other one.

200
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:24.400
So three and we know Id say men because it's negative on the left and positive on the right.

201
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:33.870
Just like up here and it is located at x value is 3 and y value is 48.

202
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.040
And this is our relative extrema

203
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:46.560
right.

204
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:54.690
That is our answer right there.

205
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.320
All right.

206
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.430
So again the problem got a little bit long but it's the same concept.

207
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.940
You find the derivative find the numbers that make it equal to zero or undefined for each of these numbers.

208
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.600
You test left and right.

209
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.450
Plug it into the derivative.

210
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:16.290
Then you check the signs and you classify based on our mnemonic here where we draw a max and a min.

211
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.450
And we notice the signs to the left and right.

212
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:28.500
And finally you find the y values corresponds to those critical numbers which we got as 156 for negative

213
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.600
3 and 48 for three.

214
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:38.490
So Max at negative 3 you won 56 and men at 3 comma 48.

215
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.940
And again this is really important.

216
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.810
If you haven't even roots.

217
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:49.980
So the square root the fourth through the sixth root etc. and you get in the root of a number that's

218
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.470
going to be plus or minus the root.

219
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.620
Not only the plus because the minus could also work.

220
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.270
All right.

221
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.840
So don't forget about the even roots.

222
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.530
And don't forget about adding the plus and minus.

223
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.860
That's pretty much it.

224
00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.120
I'll see you in the next tutorial.

225
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.010
And remember practice practice practice.
