1
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:29,230
All right so it turns out that there is a special kind of logarithm called the natural logarithm.

2
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:36,650
So in the previous video we saw the common logarithm which has a base of 10.

3
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,450
This one though is another type of logarithm called the natural logarithm.

4
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:52,170
So you have two special cases the common logarithm and the natural logarithm and do you remember that

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,080
pesky little number that we talked about.

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,010
That is approximately equal to two point seventy one.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:09,900
Remember how that's called e e is approximately equal to two point seventy on.

8
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:18,160
So let's say for example that you have the log of let's say 10.

9
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:26,050
All right just to say number and let's say that the base is this number here.

10
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,460
All right.

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,340
So we have a log of 10 with pace.

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,100
That means or we're looking for a number so that when you exponentiate e to that number you get 10.

13
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,280
In other words this means that E to the something equals 10

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
something is the logarithm.

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,490
And of course we already know that this is nothing new.

16
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,540
What's new is using E as a base.

17
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,030
And it turns out that when e is a base of a logarithm then that's called a natural logarithm.

18
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,200
So let's go into the definition for natural logs.

19
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,980
All right so natural logarithms.

20
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,640
They are logarithms with the base e.

21
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,810
So I have a logarithm has base e.

22
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,760
It's called a natural logarithm.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,790
It's just a special type of logarithm.

24
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:42,300
So you know how logarithms we usually say for example log of base to ants let's say 16 something like

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,490
that right.

26
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,550
So log of 16 with base 2.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,820
This is how we usually denote logarithms for natural logs.

28
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:06,080
They are denoted with instead of the word L O G with the word l n so natural logs use l n so for natural

29
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:18,390
logs you can forget about this because for natural logs we're going to say for example Ellen of three.

30
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,550
And guess what.

31
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:28,460
For natural logs we do not specify the base because the base by definition is always right.

32
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,740
So putting an e here is actually redundant.

33
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,970
We don't really do that.

34
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:43,340
We just say L-N of 3 or L-N of 20 or y equals L.A.X..

35
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,860
If that's the actual function etc etc..

36
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,960
All right.

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,590
So when you see L.N. you know you're dealing with base e not any other base.

38
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,500
It's just like when you see a log by itself the base is 10 and by the way this is the equivalent of

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,510
saying a log of base e.

40
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,000
Of 3.

41
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,260
But again we don't really use this notation when the base is e.

42
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,960
We use the notation l n.

43
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,790
All right.

44
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,279
So this is not used at all.

45
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,700
And when you're calculating natural logarithms Well you're going to have to use a calculator right.

46
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,980
Because as we said that is an infinite number.

47
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,550
It never never ends.

48
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,370
It has an infinite number of decimal places.

49
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,330
So if you want to calculate something like this then you definitely need a calculator.

50
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,610
Let's do an example in Google and let's do a line of 20.

51
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,440
This one here.

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,790
So I plugged in Ellen of 20 into Google and it gives me two point ninety nine approximately right.

53
00:04:51,030 --> 00:05:01,960
So we have that line of 20 is approximately two point ninety nine.

54
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,610
All right.

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,330
So in other words this means that the elevated to the two point ninety nine

56
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,120
is approximately 20.

57
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:24,750
All right so two point seventy one to the two point ninety nine is approximately 20.

58
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,610
OK.

59
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,970
That is it.

60
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,220
So again this is a very special logarithm because you'll see it a lot.

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:32,820
OK.

62
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:41,120
So logarithms with base e They're called natural logarithms and their notation is l n.

63
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,610
And you do not specify the base because the base is always e.

64
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,580
And in fact these natural logarithms are so important.

65
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,380
I want you to remember them very clearly for that reason.

66
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,810
Let's go into another mnemonic this time specifically for natural logarithms.
