00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.160
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.190
So we already know what derivatives are and we know how to find them.

3
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.420
Now what are some of the applications of derivatives.

4
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.240
That's what we'll be starting to look at today.

5
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.890
The first application that we're going to look at is increasing and decreasing intervals of functions.

6
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.660
Let's jump in to a quick graph and I'll show you what I mean.

7
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.650
So for example we have our plane over here.

8
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.160
So this is only the graph of one function but I'll use two collars so we can differentiate between increasing

9
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.060
and decreasing.

10
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.620
So let me show you what I mean.

11
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.100
Let's say we have this curve that looks something like this.

12
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:15.490
And then after that it starts like that and then it goes back up

13
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.050
then it goes down a little

14
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.050
and then finally it goes back up.

15
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.730
All right so check this out.

16
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.930
Let's say that we were going to read this function from left to right.

17
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.880
You'll notice that the graph is pink as you go from left to right.

18
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.970
It is going up.

19
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.270
Right.

20
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.040
Because for example if you're here and you go from left to right you'll notice that the pink part is

21
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.110
going up.

22
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.290
Then you get to this point.

23
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.440
And at this point the function becomes blue and then it starts going down

24
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.750
up to here.

25
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:14.500
But then here again it turns pink because it comes back up and then it turns blue it goes down by a

26
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
little and then it goes back up as pink.

27
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:33.570
So the main point here is where the function is pink the function is increasing.

28
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.940
Why is it increasing.

29
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.130
Because as you go from left to right it's going up.

30
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.970
So the y values are getting higher and higher.

31
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.600
That's true here.

32
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.920
That is also true here and the other pink part and that is also true here as well.

33
00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:07.160
On the other hand when the function is blue then the function is decreasing.

34
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.240
All right so let's go to the blue parts.

35
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:19.010
See from here up to down here the function is going down as you go from left to right in the same way

36
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.670
from here to here.

37
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.590
The function is also going down as you go from left to right.

38
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.420
So the y values are getting lower and lower.

39
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.200
So pretty much you know like this is the y value of 0.

40
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.730
So are getting lower and lower and lower.

41
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.820
In fact over here they even go into the negatives.

42
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.360
So that's how small they keep getting.

43
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.270
All right.

44
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.650
So again pink is increasing because their y values are getting bigger and the blue ones are decreasing

45
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.090
because the y values are getting smaller.

46
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.050
So let's go into the definition for increasing and decreasing.

47
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.040
All right so here we have the definition of for increasing intervals.

48
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.020
By the way if you didn't know this an interval is simply a group of x values.

49
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:14.490
Ok so I'll put it right here the interval is just a group of x values.

50
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.290
Right.

51
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:33.560
So for example if I say the interval from 1 to 5 that means all the numbers between 1 and 5 and the

52
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.860
interval can either include the 1 and 5 or not include the 1 and 5.

53
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.650
OK.

54
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.980
So we have that an interval is increasing.

55
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.570
If the Y values are getting bigger.

56
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.870
So as the x values get bigger and bigger the y values get bigger and bigger as well.

57
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.380
In other words the graph goes up as you move from left to right.

58
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.340
And again let's draw this quickly.

59
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:14.610
Here's a function that's always going up.

60
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:22.570
So as you move from left to right and you trace your pencil through the graph the y values are always

61
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.330
going up.

62
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.950
See that.

63
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.350
So you're always always going up as you move from left to right.

64
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:45.000
That means that this graph is always increasing.

65
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.630
All right.

66
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.440
So this means for all egg's values in this graph it is always going up.

67
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.920
Now let's go to the counter-part which is decreasing intervals.

68
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.080
So just like we can have a graph that's increasing.

69
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.500
We can have a graph that's decreasing.

70
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.320
So an entry level is decreasing if the y values are getting smaller.

71
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.940
That means it's going down.

72
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:17.680
In other words the graph goes down as you move from left to right and let's draw this right here.

73
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.740
Here's an example of a graph that's always going down.

74
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:36.790
So if we actually trace our pencils and move from left to right you'll notice that the y values are

75
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.730
getting smaller because as you move from left to right the graph is going down.

76
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.220
Compare this with the other one that we looked at which is the increasing interval where the graph was

77
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.580
going up from left to right.

78
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.220
See how this one never goes up it just goes down.

79
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:12.970
So this is an example of a function that is always decreasing.

80
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.290
OK so we saw an example of a function that's always increasing and one that's always decreasing.

81
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:26.330
But you could have a function that actually has both increasing intervals and decreasing intervals.

82
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.530
So like I said you could also have both increasing and decreasing.

83
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.760
So in those cases you have a graph that goes up for some intervals.

84
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.050
In other words increases for some intervals and then it goes down for other animals.

85
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.240
In other words it decreases for others.

86
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.380
So let's just draw a quick example.

87
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.700
And it's going to be very similar to the one that we talked about at the beginning.

88
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.620
I'll draw the increasing in pink.

89
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.960
And then the decreasing part in blue

90
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.380
and then it increases again.

91
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.060
All right

92
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.780
so we can actually say the following.

93
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:31.910
Let's say that this is negative 3 for X and this is let's say five.

94
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.909
So to the left of negative 3 The graph is increasing.

95
00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:38.789
Right.

96
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.970
And remember you always measure this from left to right.

97
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:49.640
So to the left of negative three you have to come this way and say OK the graph is actually going up.

98
00:08:49.690 --> 00:09:02.710
So when X is less than negative three then it is increasing.

99
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.890
This will be your first interval.

100
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.110
Other numbers that are less than negative 3 are right.

101
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.810
And let's say between negative 3 and 5.

102
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.480
What is the graph doing.

103
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.670
It's actually decreasing.

104
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.070
See that it's going down between these two points.

105
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:43.510
So when x is greater than negative three and less than five then it is decreasing.

106
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.700
Finally what happens at five.

107
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.330
Well at five it actually starts to increase again.

108
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.320
So again we go from left to right and we see that it's actually going up.

109
00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:02.920
So we finally say when x is greater than five it is increasing again

110
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.710
all right.

111
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.080
So in this example it's easier to know when it's decreasing and when it's increasing because we have

112
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.020
a graph what happens when we don't have a graph and we want to find the intervals where a function is

113
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:30.590
increasing and the intervals where a function is decreasing and or derivatives we're going to use derivatives

114
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.440
to find out when a function is increasing and decreasing.

115
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.050
And when we don't have a graph.

116
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:43.310
So if we're given a function and were asked to find where the function is increasing and where it is

117
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.380
decreasing then we can use derivatives.

118
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.440
So here are the rules

119
00:10:54.130 --> 00:11:01.110
the derivative of f prime of x is positive.

120
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.420
So I'll put a plus

121
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.410
then the graph is increasing

122
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.690
on the other hand

123
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:29.710
if the derivative is negative is negative then guess what.

124
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:38.650
The graph is decreasing.

125
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:45.390
And finally if the derivative is neither positive or negative.

126
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:53.000
So in other words if it's equal to zero then it is neither.

127
00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:53.790
All right.

128
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.090
It's not decreasing nor increasing.

129
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.570
That's it.

130
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:07.520
So let's review if the derivative of a function is positive for a certain interval then the function

131
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.750
is increasing on that interval.

132
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.520
On the other hand if the derivative of a function is negative over an interval then the function is

133
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.860
decreasing at that interval.

134
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:26.330
And then finally if the derivative is neither positive or negative is 0 then it is neither increasing

135
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.300
or decreasing.

136
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.500
Let's see why that is.

137
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:37.380
So again let's draw our graph.

138
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:54.340
So we'll do paying for increasing and then blue for decreasing and then paying once again.

139
00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:02.720
So remember what derivatives measure it measures the rate of change and the rate of change is the slope

140
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.940
of a line tangent to the graph.

141
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.000
So when the function is increasing.

142
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.730
Let's pick a point on the increasing interval.

143
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.470
So for example this one.

144
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.590
And if we draw a line tangent to that.

145
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:24.880
This one here you'll notice that the line is going up as you go left to right.

146
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.830
That means the slope is positive.

147
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:33.920
In other words if the derivative is positive that means that the slope of the line touching the graph

148
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.910
at that specific point is also positive.

149
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:43.910
That is why when the derivative is positive that means the graph is increasing because the slope of

150
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.010
the line tangent is positive.

151
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.720
On the other hand let's pick a point on the decreasing interval.

152
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.650
So let's pick for example.

153
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:05.280
This point right on the decreasing interval if we draw a line tangent to that it's going to look like

154
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:12.250
this.

155
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.150
So what happens in this case.

156
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.610
Well the line turned into the graph is this and its slope is negative.

157
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.050
Why.

158
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.400
Because a rise over run is negative.

159
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:30.420
So for every unit you move to the right you have to go down in the positive one.

160
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.100
For every unit you move right you have to go up.

161
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.360
Right.

162
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:42.360
Right up right up right up on this green one it's right down right down right down.

163
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:49.890
So the slope of this line is negative therefore when the derivative is negative that means the function

164
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.910
is decreasing.

165
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:57.840
So positive derivative increasing negative derivative decreasing.

166
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:06.150
So that means there's a point somewhere where the graph goes from increasing to decreasing and then

167
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.920
another point where he goes from decreasing to increasing.

168
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.930
When does that happen.

169
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.520
It actually happens twice in this graph.

170
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.640
So first it happens here.

171
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.640
Notice that it was increasing and then it starts decreasing over here.

172
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:27.850
But it also happens here it goes from decreasing to increasing.

173
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:37.530
So what do we draw a line tangent to that point where the graph changes.

174
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:44.780
It's this line over here so remember that slope is right.

175
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.870
Overrun is this line rising at all.

176
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.400
Is it going up or is it going down.

177
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.120
Absolutely not.

178
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.100
It is basically a horizontal line.

179
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.660
So there is no slope.

180
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.500
That means that the slope is zero.

181
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.240
So m is zero.

182
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:11.220
So that's interesting because that tells you that when the derivative is equal to zero it is neither

183
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.960
increasing or decreasing.

184
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:21.660
It is simply a point where the graph can go from increasing to decreasing or in this specific case from

185
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.520
decreasing up to increasing.

186
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.340
All right.

187
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:32.510
So we need to find these points where the graph can change from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.

188
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:38.580
Then we have to test the value to the left of the point and to the right of the point that's when we

189
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:44.510
know for which intervals a function is increasing and decreasing.

190
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.460
Let's see how we can actually do this.

191
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.370
So to find

192
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.900
where the graph changes

193
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:13.329
from increasing to decreasing

194
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:28.700
or vice versa from decreasing to increasing we have to check for two cases first.

195
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:36.340
We need to find the values that make that top of the function equal to zero.

196
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.960
So in the first case we need to find the values that make the derivative equal to zero.

197
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:49.010
So we need to find values where

198
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.770
the derivative f prime of x is equal to zero.

199
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.040
Right.

200
00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:04.230
So just like we saw in the last example there are points where the derivative is zero.

201
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:11.830
So we need to test for values to the left of that and to the right of that and see when it is increasing.

202
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.200
And when it is decreasing.

203
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.050
And if this isn't and if this makes absolutely no sense.

204
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.440
Don't worry we'll do a couple of examples and you'll see it in action.

205
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.490
All right so the first case we need to check is for values were the prime of x is equal to zero.

206
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.900
And we also need to check for values

207
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.240
where the derivative

208
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.870
prime of X is undefined.

209
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.810
And of course we know that something is undefined when there's division by zero.

210
00:18:53.060 --> 00:19:01.820
So this only applies this second case only applies when you have the nominator to only

211
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.650
when you have

212
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:09.810
a bottom.

213
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:16.910
So if you have a fraction you have a top and you have a bottom and you only need to check for this when

214
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.490
you have a bottom part.

215
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:26.200
All right so now we know that we need to check for both values that make the derivative equal to zero.

216
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.110
And that make it undefined.

217
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:37.410
So let's put all of this together and let's find out how to find the intervals of increase and decrease

218
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.050
for a function with an example.
