00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,630
Hello everybody welcome to another session of limitless calculus in this session.

2
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,740
We're going to cover a very important rules called the product rule the product rule is used to find

3
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,720
the derivative of functions that are multiplying.

4
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,190
So in some rule the derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of each derivative.

5
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,940
Same thing for the difference rule but with subtraction.

6
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,780
What happens when we're multiplying functions.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
Is it the same.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:09,300
So for example if we have 4 x is equal to g of X times h of X and by the way if you're wondering how

9
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,180
do you know that these two were multiplying g of x and h of X..

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,840
Well there's nothing in between them.

11
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,100
So that means that they are multiplying.

12
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,250
That could be a weird concept to you because maybe you're used to seeing you know three times four.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,830
And then the X means multiplication.

14
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:37,010
Well however in calculus remember we cannot use x for multiplication because X is typically used for

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,020
the input of a function.

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,650
Right.

17
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:47,380
So this is not good so in calculus there are three ways to denote multiplication.

18
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,650
Let's go over that quickly because again we're doing the product rule.

19
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,520
So it's very important that we have this clear.

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,610
So for multiplication

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,620
it can either be nothing in between two things.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:24,480
So for example if we have a VAX g of X that means that f of x is multiplying with g of x

23
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:35,150
we could have a dot.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,240
So you could have something like Active-X dot g of x.

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:47,910
That means that you're multiplying and finally you could just have parentheses

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,920
and instead of doing F X and Audiovox let's do it with numbers.

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,180
So if you have parenthesis three close parentheses and parentheses for and close parentheses that means

28
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,140
that you're multiplying.

29
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,340
So again three ways.

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,860
When there's nothing in between.

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,040
Surprisingly yes they are actually multiplying.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,380
When there's a dot in between them means are multiplying and parentheses.

33
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,420
That means that they're multiplying as well.

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,250
OK.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,240
So going back to our original function we have f of x equals G x h of x.

36
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,250
So these 2 g of x and h of x are actually multiplying.

37
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,480
So you know like in the sum rule if you want to find the derivative of two functions that are adding

38
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,170
you simply add the derivative of each one.

39
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,920
Same in the differential.

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:59,380
How ever is it true that the derivative of f of x is just a derivative of the first times the derivative

41
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,520
of the second.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,910
Like in the sum rule and the differential it is not.

43
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,010
So this is g prime of X times h prime of x.

44
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,980
That is wrong.

45
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,200
That doesn't work.

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,140
That's not how calculus works.

47
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,959
It's not right.

48
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,820
So be very careful not to think oh we're multiplying two functions.

49
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,060
Let me just find the derivative of each and multiply those derivatives together.

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,640
That does work.

51
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,510
That's why we have a product rule and the product rule tells you exactly how to get the derivative of

52
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,650
two functions.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,720
Two or more actually functions that are multiplying.

54
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,780
So let's go into the product rule right now.

55
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,950
OK so here we have the definition of the product rule.

56
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:53,200
All my you are going to love this one the prog rule says the derivative of a product of two functions

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,220
equals the derivative of the first times the second plus the first time is a derivative of the second.

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,640
What's.

59
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,240
Yes that's what the pro-tobacco says.

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,590
Again do not worry we have mnemonics to come to our rescue.

61
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,830
I know this sounds like really difficult.

62
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,550
So let's try putting it in practice.

63
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,320
So you see how it actually works.

64
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:27,920
OK so first of all let's get our generic function f of x and we're going to make that equal to the multiplication

65
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,810
of two other functions.

66
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,690
So g of X times h of X

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,240
and let's find the derivative of f of x.

68
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,880
OK.

69
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,700
So let's go by the definition itself is the derivative of a product of two functions.

70
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:55,140
Remember by the way in case you do not know this or you forgot a product

71
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,980
is it product is the results

72
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,690
of a

73
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,190
multiplication

74
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,540
OK.

75
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,150
So the product of three and four is 12.

76
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,090
12 is the product.

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
So the product is a result of multiplying a couple of things together.

78
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,060
So when we say the derivative of a product of two functions it means that the two functions are actually

79
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:51,970
multiplying the derivative of a product of two functions equals the derivative of the first.

80
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,420
So in this case we're just going to call the first the one on the left.

81
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,760
So the derivative of the first

82
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,680
times the second.

83
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,600
So the second would be h of x.

84
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,850
It looks ugly right.

85
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,190
All right.

86
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,300
You know it's parentheses X parentheses to be like that.

87
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,070
Plus

88
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,640
the first.

89
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,160
So that's g of X

90
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,320
times the derivative of the second.

91
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,830
So the second is h of X.

92
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,850
We're going to get its derivative h prime of x y.

93
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,890
All right so now we got this big beautiful mess.

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,770
So we have the two regional functions g of x and h of x.

95
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:54,490
So here we have the derivative of G times h plus G terms a derivative of h.

96
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,080
So they're kind of like opposites because in the first term over here you get the derivative of the

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,660
first and then multiply by the second and you get the first multiplied by the derivative of the second.

98
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,160
OK this is the product rule.

99
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,860
And again do not worry we have a mnemonic coming up you're not going to have to remember this you know

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
without any references.

101
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,060
OK.

102
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,570
Just for the sake of it let's do a quick example.

103
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,510
Let's say that our function is as market as an example.

104
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:42,720
So let's say that our function is 2 x squared times 3 x 3 OK.

105
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,330
So here we have two functions.

106
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,310
We have 2 x squared is one function.

107
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,660
This is function 1 and 3 x cubed is function to right.

108
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,140
So I mean typically a function it's going to be a constant on the on the front and then some X to some

109
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,810
power.

110
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,710
That's typically what a function looks like.

111
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,720
So that's how we know that 2 x squared is one function and 3 x cubed is another function.

112
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,250
So let's try and find the derivative.

113
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,230
I'll do it on the side here because I don't have a lot of space.

114
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,370
All right derivative of this function f of x.

115
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,080
All right let's apply the product rule.

116
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,780
Because we're multiplying two functions.

117
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,170
So the overall size we're going to get the derivative of the first

118
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,540
times the second three x cubed

119
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,630
Plus the first

120
00:09:51,510 --> 00:10:01,370
two x squared times the derivative of the second derivative of three x cubed.

121
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,490
All right you you're getting long right.

122
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,430
I know.

123
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,240
So the derivative of the first.

124
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,370
Again we have constant multiple So we have to leave it on the side.

125
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:22,540
We bring our dictator down to X to the first power so we don't market that is going to be times the

126
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,040
second three x cubed

127
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,560
and now we're going to do plus

128
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:42,210
two x squared times a derivative of this constant multiple because we have a three.

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,580
So we leave it on the side.

130
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:51,430
We bring our dictator down which is three acts submitted by a less powerful leader that gives us a two.

131
00:10:51,650 --> 00:11:01,140
And finally we'll just go ahead and simplify this is two times two is four times this three is 12

132
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:15,390
and then x times x cubed is X to the four so just as a quick rule in case you forgot if you have a little

133
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,200
put it over here if you have a multiplication of powers.

134
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:33,200
So if you have for example x to the M times x to the end the result is going to be X to the AM plus

135
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,430
and.

136
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,950
OK that's just working with exponents as an example.

137
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:48,400
If we have X to the two times X to that three that's going to be equal to what.

138
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,550
Well they have the same base which is x.

139
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,760
So we can definitely add exponents.

140
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:01,030
That's going to be equal to x to the two plus 3 x 5.

141
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,150
OK so that's exactly what we're doing down here.

142
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,640
Again we multiply the numbers two times two is four times three is twelve.

143
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,860
And then we multiply the axes x to the one and again remember we did not market times x to the 3 is

144
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:26,670
just x to the one plus three or X to the four and now we're going to do our second part over here.

145
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:38,300
And again we just multiply the numbers together two times three is six times three is 18.

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:46,600
And then we multiply the axes so x squared times x squared is X to the four.

147
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,450
Interesting.

148
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:57,310
We actually have two terms 12 x to the 4 and 8 next to the 4 and check this out because they have the

149
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,500
same base to the same exponent.

150
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:11,980
We can actually simplify this whole thing and add the numbers 12 plus 18 that's 30 x to the four that

151
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,990
is our answer

152
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,060
and we are done.

153
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:24,150
So the product rule is basically the start of calculus where things get you know the problems get big.

154
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,150
You have a lot of terms a lot of multiplication a lot of adding a little subtraction going on.

155
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,850
So if you think this is you know if this is long then you better get used to it.

156
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,260
Calculus problems can get really long because of all these rules that we need to apply some rule and

157
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,110
different true and you know constant rule.

158
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,290
Those are the easy ones.

159
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,080
This is where it gets you know a little hairy but again do not worry we'll go over each step.

160
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,980
We'll teach you how to do it and you'll be good to go.

161
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,550
And again just to mention something here.

162
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:04,030
We can only add them the 12 x to the 4 and 80 next to the four because they are adding and they have

163
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,610
the same ax to the same power.

164
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,190
OK.

165
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,690
If this had been X to the three and this is X or the 4 we can not add them.

166
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,790
You can only simplify like this when they have the same base and the same exponent.

167
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,990
So again we just added the 12 on the 18.

168
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,180
That's 30 and we keep the x to the fourth.
