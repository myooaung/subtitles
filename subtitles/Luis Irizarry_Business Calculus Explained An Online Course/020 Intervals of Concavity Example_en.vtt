00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.440
All right so here we have for example and it says find the intervals of concavity and point of inflection

2
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.500
for f of x equals x cubed over to minus 3 x squared.

3
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.159
All right.

4
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.190
So we want to find concavity.

5
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.480
We know that we need to use the second derivative because concavity is found with the second derivative.

6
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.370
And remember the process is pretty much the same as the one for intervals of increase and decrease just

7
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.550
that we're going to use the second derivative instead of the first.

8
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.960
So the first thing we're going to do

9
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.060
is to find the second derivative.

10
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.480
So we're going to find

11
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.760
double prime of x.

12
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.370
This is double prime by the way.

13
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.600
All right.

14
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.720
So let's go ahead and find that out.

15
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.810
So to do that we first find the first derivative.

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.080
So prime of X and we're just going to go ahead and start.

17
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.400
So for the first term we have a power function but we're dividing by two.

18
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.160
So remember that if we're dividing by two that's like multiplying by one half.

19
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.440
So it's just the constant 1 1/2 multiplying.

20
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560
So we use the constant multiple rule.

21
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.790
We put it outside.

22
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.010
And then what we do is remember we bring down a dictator.

23
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.590
So we have a three X and we subtract one from the exponent.

24
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.180
So that's a two and I'll put it as three minus 1.

25
00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.370
So we can see the whole process minus again and we have a constant three.

26
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.650
So we leave it outside and we bring down this two multiplying times 2 x to the two.

27
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.220
Mine is one.

28
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.830
So that's equal to.

29
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.830
So we have 1 1/2 times 3.

30
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.150
So that's three over two.

31
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.050
Remember that when we multiply fractions we have top Times top and bottom times bottom.

32
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.840
So it's 1 times 3 on the top and two times the bottom here is one.

33
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.110
All right so if it's not marked It's always one or two times one is two.

34
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.370
And then we have access to the two.

35
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.970
That's the three minus one x squared.

36
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.350
Mine is three times 2 is 6 x 2 the ones the just 6 x.

37
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.750
All right.

38
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.460
So we have our first derivative Let's find our second derivative.

39
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.050
So remember the second derivative is just a derivative of the first derivative.

40
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.960
So we take the derivative of this function here.

41
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.850
So first of all we have the three over two as a constant multiplying.

42
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.750
So we put it outside.

43
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.550
We bring down this too.

44
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.530
So we bring down a dictator in power that's 2 x to 1.

45
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.710
Right because we subtract one from the exponent.

46
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.720
So that's just x to the one minus.

47
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.430
Again we have this constant outside's that we put it when we have the derivative of x.

48
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.750
Remember that's the derivative of X to 1 and 1 minus 1 and the exponent is 0.

49
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.130
So X to the 0 is just one.

50
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.870
In other words this 6 x when you take the derivative becomes only 6 because a derivative of this X is

51
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.800
just 1 and we'll simplify.

52
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.180
So what do we have.

53
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.310
We have 3 over 2 times 2.

54
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.400
So we have a 2 on the top and a two on the bottom.

55
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.720
So we can cancel out the twos and we have 3 X minus 6.

56
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.560
All right so there we have our second derivative 3 X minus 6.

57
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.959
Our next step is remember to find the numbers that make the second derivative either equal to zero or

58
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.060
undefined.

59
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.530
But again this function cannot be undefined because there cannot be any division by zero.

60
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.750
Therefore we're just going to say that it equals zero so step 2 is finite.

61
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.030
When the second derivative of double prime X equals zero.

62
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.870
So we're going to say double prime of x which is 3 x minus 6

63
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.300
is equal to zero.

64
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.720
All right.

65
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.940
And to solve this we're just going to add six from both sides because we want to solve for x and actually

66
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.530
let's bring it up here to this continues right here.

67
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.440
Actually let's do it over here.

68
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.830
And we have three X minus six equals zero.

69
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:32.590
So we had sex on both sides plus six plus six so this cancels out and we have 3 x equals 6 and we divide

70
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.990
by 3 right.

71
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.660
Because we have three acts and we want to find X so we have to divide

72
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.650
over three and X equals two.

73
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.770
So let me put it as a separate thing right here.

74
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.640
All right.

75
00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.250
So this is us solving for a number that makes the second derivative equals zero.

76
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.520
And that number is X equals 2.

77
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.990
All right great.

78
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.280
So now that we have the number that makes a second derivative equals zero.

79
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.220
Now we need to find and test values to the left and to the right of that 0.

80
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.860
So in other words what we do is we classify

81
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.560
the intervals

82
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.220
of concavity remember how we classified relative extrema.

83
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.010
So we had to find out whether we had relative Max or relative ments.

84
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.350
This is pretty much the same thing.

85
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:53.680
So remember that we had this number line right and then this number line back when we were doing the

86
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.620
relative extrema we needed to find the numbers that made the first derivative either equal to zero or

87
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.360
undefined and then plug them in here.

88
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.200
However in this case we found the numbers that make the second derivative instead of the first equal

89
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.020
to zero.

90
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.060
And remember we don't have any numbers for it to be undefined because there is no fraction.

91
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.910
And this case is very easy.

92
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.020
There's only one number and that's two remember.

93
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.090
We have to pick a value to the left of the two.

94
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.580
And to the right.

95
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.510
Let's pick easy numbers.

96
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.490
So let's pick zero to the left.

97
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520
So that is our first test value.

98
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.510
And let's pick 10 to the right.

99
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.710
That is our second test value.

100
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.740
And remember these go into the second derivative.

101
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.900
All right.

102
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.370
If you plug them into the regular function you're just going to get the y value of the graph.

103
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.460
And if you plug them into the first derivative then you're just going to be finding relative extrema.

104
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.000
Remember that to find concavity you need to plug into the second derivative.

105
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:09.980
So let's go ahead and plug it to 0 and 10 into the second derivative and let's go ahead and divide this

106
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.940
over here.

107
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.850
So we know it's different.

108
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.640
All right.

109
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:23.790
So we'll do half double prime of zero so we're plugging in zero into the second derivative.

110
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.420
So the second derivatives are here.

111
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.640
It's going to give us three times 0

112
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:38.039
minus six or 3 times 0 0 and we have negative six.

113
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.270
So it's a negative number.

114
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:50.180
That means that to the left of the two we have negative.

115
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.010
All right.

116
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.180
And let's plug it in our second test value.

117
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.930
So we have the prime of 10.

118
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.670
And again we're plugging that in into our second derivative right here so three times 10

119
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.530
minus six that's going to give us 30 minus 6 which is 24.

120
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.250
So it is a positive number.

121
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:25.160
That means that to the right of the two we have positives.

122
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.700
All right.

123
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.960
And remember our rules for concavity.

124
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:37.080
They say that if the second derivative is negative then a graph is concave down.

125
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.480
However if it's positive it's concave up.

126
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:48.080
So we can find or intervals of concavity with this to the left of the two we have negative.

127
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.530
So the graph is concave down.

128
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:56.620
In other words from negative infinity up to two

129
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.270
the graph is concave down

130
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:18.380
and starting from two and to the right of two the second derivative is positive.

131
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.050
Therefore the graph is concave up.

132
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:37.850
So from two to positive infinity in this interval the graph is concave up.

133
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.820
These are intervals of concavity.

134
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.480
All right.

135
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:48.320
So again we determine whether the graph is concave up or down based on the sign given by these test

136
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.650
values.

137
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.030
That too is the value in the middle.

138
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.680
So the two makes the second derivative equals zero.

139
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.170
And we tested to the left of that two to the right.

140
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.110
If we had had more numbers than two.

141
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:09.500
So for example if we had had two one for that we should have tested to the left to between two and four.

142
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:16.820
And then to the right of 4 but because we only had to just try one value to the left and one value to

143
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.250
the right perfect.

144
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.710
So let me ask you a question.

145
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.570
Is there a point of inflection when X equals to.

146
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.660
Well remember that a point of inflection is a point where the concavity of a graph changes as a concavity

147
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.600
changing as you go from the left up to to the right of two.

148
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:48.680
You bet and how do we know this well actually or intervals say so from negative infinity to it's concave

149
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.110
down but from two to positive infinity it's concave up.

150
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.150
And in fact if you look at the signs you'll know right away.

151
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.730
Right.

152
00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:05.690
You go from negative two positive the moment you cross two you're going into the positive second derivative.

153
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.560
But if you go to the left of two you have the negative second derivative.

154
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.480
So there is a point of inflection when X equals two.

155
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.610
Let's find the corresponding y value of that point of inflection.

156
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:28.760
Now the million dollar question is where do we plug this to to get the y value of the point of inflection

157
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.110
what do you think.

158
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.740
Do you plug it into the second derivative.

159
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.490
Well remember if you do you're going to get zero.

160
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.230
I'm not saying that to zero.

161
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.610
Could it be the points.

162
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.640
But however remember that we just found too because it makes that second derivative equal to zero.

163
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.690
So it doesn't make sense.

164
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.290
You plug it in there.

165
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:55.020
Remember that we're looking for the point of inflection of the original function.

166
00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:01.450
Right so if we're finding the point of inflection of the original function it makes sense that you would

167
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:09.820
plug it in here into the original in the same way that to find the y values of relative maximun relative

168
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.650
minima you plug the x values into the original.

169
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.440
Remember that all of this we're finding the intervals of concavity.

170
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.650
The point of inflection the relative extrema intervals of increase and decrease.

171
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.010
We're always finding all of those things for this function right here.

172
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:35.790
The first and second derivative are just tools that we use to find out stuff about this function.

173
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:44.890
That is why we plug in this to into the original function to get the y value of this point of inflection

174
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.810
right.

175
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.300
So I'll summarize it here as IP inflection point.

176
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.100
You can write it yourself the whole word.

177
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.940
I just need to save some space.

178
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.190
So let's find the y value of this point of inflection.

179
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.230
So we're going to plug in to which is where our second derivative changes from negative to positive

180
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.610
into the original.

181
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.890
So we're going to plug it in right here.

182
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:19.300
So we have two cubed over to minus

183
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:31.110
three times two squared.

184
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.600
All right.

185
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.120
So I'll just read the results because we don't have a lot of space.

186
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.940
So we have two to the three it's two times to attempt to is eight eight over two is four.

187
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:51.090
All right so we have four on this side minus two squared is four times three is 12.

188
00:14:51.100 --> 00:15:01.260
So we have for minus 12 is negative 8 is negative 8 is the output that we get when we plug into into

189
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.160
the original function.

190
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:13.030
Therefore we have a point of inflection adds to the x value and negative 8 the y value.

191
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.190
This is where our point of inflection is.

192
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.250
All right.

193
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.170
So this is it.

194
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:25.760
We have intervals of concavity right here that is the first part of our answer.

195
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.560
Oh man I feel like I'm going through a maze here.

196
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.890
All right there we go.

197
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.330
OK.

198
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.800
So was there.

199
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.650
Got it.

200
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:50.350
Again this is our intervals of concavity and this is the point of inflection.

201
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.550
Member a point always has an X and Y value.

202
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.730
So that's why we plugged in this to into the original.

203
00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:58.860
So again a quick summary.

204
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.240
We wanted to find the entrails of concavity and point of inflection for this function.

205
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.910
So the first step because we're dealing with concavity we need to find the second derivative.

206
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.270
So we found the first derivative and then we found the derivative of that.

207
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.170
That gave us 3 X minus 6.

208
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.550
Then we went ahead and found the numbers that make this derivative equal to zero.

209
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.590
It can never be undefined because there's no fraction.

210
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.710
So we just find the numbers that make it equal to zero.

211
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.480
We find this too by solving for x.

212
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.600
And after we have this too we classify the intervals of concavity.

213
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.160
So we need to find if there are concave up or concave down.

214
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.300
So we draw this number line and we have the two.

215
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.450
So we have to test one value to the left and one value to the right.

216
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:53.420
We picked zero and 10 and the 0 gave us a negative answer and the turn gave us a positive answer.

217
00:16:53.460 --> 00:17:00.070
So to the left of the two where the 0 is that's negative and to the right of the two where the 10 is

218
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.210
positive.

219
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:08.550
So again paysan this we know that to the left of two because it's negative the gravest concave down

220
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.480
on the other hand to the right of two because it's positive.

221
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.130
The graph is concave up.

222
00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.160
This gave us are intervals of concavity.

223
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:25.859
And finally we determined that there is in fact an inflection point because remember an inflection point

224
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.810
is a point where the graph changes concavity because it goes from concave down to concave up.

225
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.170
Then we know there's a point of inflection when X equals two.

226
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:43.350
And to find the corresponding y value for that to remember we plug in into the original because we're

227
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.410
finding the point of inflection of this function.

228
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:54.330
After all that gave us negative 8 and finally our point of inflection is at too negative 8.

229
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.640
This is the point where the graph goes from concave down to concave up.
