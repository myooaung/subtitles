1
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,720
All right so here we have our summary.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,250
Let's get started.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,590
The logarithm of x with base a is a number to which you need to exponentiate this base a to get to X.

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:39,000
So remember when you're asked to find a logarithm you're being asked to find an exponent and that exponent

5
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:49,200
is such that if you get the base A and you exponentiate it to that exponents you get the results x.

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,640
All right so the logarithm is this exponent over here.

7
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,020
OK the notation for logarithms is the following.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,510
So we have log

9
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,610
of x x is the whatever result we want to get to.

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,530
And then we have the base a.

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:16,710
All right so a log of x with base 8 that's how you read that.

12
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,480
So then you have come a logarithms that are written as a log of X..

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,940
So remember it when you see this log of X and no base then the base is implied and it's 10.

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,260
This is called a common logarithm.

15
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,550
So come a logarithms look like this with no base.

16
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,640
They have a logi at the beginning and the base then is always 10.

17
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,170
That never ever changes.

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,730
All right.

19
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,520
And we actually have a mnemonic here to remember what each of the components of a logarithm are.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:01,180
The mnemonic is let's be real and then let's be real stand for Al B.R. which is log Beys result and

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,410
if you look over here does what we have.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,720
We have a log then we have the base and then we have the results on the other hand.

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,540
We have natural logarithms they're written as a line of X and remember when you see something in the

24
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,450
form of X.

25
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,940
It is a natural logarithm and the base of a natural logarithm is the number each.

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,110
And again that's implied you never write e down here.

27
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,480
We just look at it and say OK it's a natural log.

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,810
The base is easy and we have a non-monic for natural logs.

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,440
They're just Canadian logs first because of Canadian nature.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,870
That's what I think about when I think of Canada.

31
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,790
Beautiful landscape lots of nature lots of green lots of beautiful places.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,420
So nature gives away the natural log.

33
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,210
And then what Canadians like to say sometimes at the end of a question the A tells you that the base

34
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,530
of these are actually OK.

35
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,240
So when you look at a logarithm I want you to think Is it a Canadian log or is it not.

36
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,560
If you the term that it is a Canadian log right then it is a natural log.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,530
And the base is then exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of each other.

38
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:30,070
So remember they actually cancel each other out and we went over the three steps to solve an equation

39
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,330
involving an exponential nation or a logarithmic function.

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:41,680
So the steps to solve these types of equations are first of all we isolate the logarithmic or the exponential

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,750
function.

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,290
Whichever one it is.

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,310
So we isolate it on one side of the equal sign.

44
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,850
Number two is apply the inverse process.

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,690
So if you have a logarithmic function you're going to exponentiate.

46
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,380
And if you have an exponential function you're going to apply a logarithm.

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:03:59,890
Right.

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,350
So there are just inverses of each other.

49
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:10,150
And after you've done that you shouldn't have any more logs or exponentials with X at this point you're

50
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,940
just going to go ahead and solve for x and that's going to give you your answer.

51
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,820
And finally there are four main properties of logs.

52
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,160
You can use them for multiplication division exponentiation or finding the root.

53
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,010
All right so that is it for now for logarithms.

54
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,360
I know we covered a lot.

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,300
Logarithms can be a little bit weird in the beginning but they should be making a lot more sense to

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,860
you.

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,790
I don't see you at the next tutorial.
