1
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,140
All right so we are ready for our mnemonic for the chain rule.

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:40,280
Now let me warn you this is going to be the most random mnemonic that we've done in the tutorials.

3
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,870
So for example for product rule we take the first three letters P R O and then for example for some

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,630
rule we know that some is ADD.

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:57,280
So we take those three letters a d d and stands for different derivatives and so on and so forth.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,300
That's a typical mnemonic now for this one.

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:07,150
It has nothing to do with the chain rule but it is so memorable that you will remember it and I know

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:13,720
that because I've taught this before to dozens of students over the years and they always tell me that

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,810
is so random that I actually remember just because it is so random.

10
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,060
So let me show you my personal mnemonic for the chain rule.

11
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,370
All right.

12
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,500
Here it is our mnemonic for the chain rule is you dx.

13
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,870
In other words ugly daily X-Box.

14
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,570
Again it's ugly.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,900
Daily X-Box.

16
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,950
I know what you're thinking.

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,620
LEWIS What the heck is this.

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,820
Are you crazy.

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,030
I want my money back right now.

20
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:52,790
Well before you tell me that I can assure you that this is so random that you will remember this.

21
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,900
If we do a couple of problems this thing tends to stick in your mind.

22
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,660
And again I know that because dozens of students over the years have told me the same thing so ugly

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,550
daily X-Box.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,950
All right.

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,360
That's funny that's great.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,020
But how does that relate to the chain rule.

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:19,480
So the initials for ugly daily X-Box are edX and UTX tells you what the steps are for solving a chain

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,290
rule problem.

29
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,130
So let's break it down.

30
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,690
All right.

31
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,010
So we have you the x.

32
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,900
So what does this stand for.

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,690
Let's do it step by step.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,100
The first step is you.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,720
So what does you stand for.

36
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:48,100
So this taps says we're going to set you equal to that enter function.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,820
So remember how we talked about Enter functions.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,990
You know when you have one function within another.

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,080
So the enterer function is the one that's being wrapped around the other function like we saw in the

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,110
examples.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,760
So first step is literally saying you equals the inner function you're just going to set them equal

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,470
to each other.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,430
Right.

44
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:18,310
And then for step two step two is typically where people get confused.

45
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,850
Actually not bad at all.

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,910
So let's go into it right now.

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:34,630
So the D stands for derivatives.

48
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,140
Remember that I said that in the chain rule you end up multiplying derivatives right.

49
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,830
So that's exactly what we're going to do here.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,830
So this step is called derivatives because all you're doing is you're multiplying two different derivatives.

51
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,730
Now before we do this one let me remind you that when we say something like D-y over GX

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,740
remember that D-y over dx is another way of saying find the derivative of Y.

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,740
Right.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,840
We mentioned this before

55
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,000
to you I overdye axis means derivative of why we're going to use something similar to D-y over ADX over

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,810
here.

57
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,320
So here's what we're going to do.

58
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,890
Do you guys always on top and D-Backs is always on the bottom.

59
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,530
They're going to stay that way but now they're going to be across from each other.

60
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,710
So we have D-y on top here.

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,130
And the cross from it like this is DX right.

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,060
And then in the end we just populate this part here and this part here with the you see you on the bottom

63
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:02,570
here and you on the top here so you see that the overreacts it's crossed and do you and you are crossed

64
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,310
as well.

65
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,600
OK.

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,340
And what the heck does that mean.

67
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:14,980
So what we're doing here is we're saying find the derivative of why in terms of you multiply that by

68
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,130
the derivative of you in terms of x and this might not be making any sense but I'll show you what it

69
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,390
means in a minute.

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
All right.

71
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:36,920
So this is how you remember it but the final form looks like this D-y over you do you over DX right.

72
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:43,680
I just put these lines here so that you remember that the D-y and DX which usually go together they

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,760
go across from each other D-y on top and the X on the bottom and then the use go across from each other

74
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
as well.

75
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,190
But this is the final form.

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,300
And what are these two derivatives doing.

77
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,580
They're multiplying.

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,040
Right.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Because there's nothing in between them.

80
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,030
So we have a derivative of y in terms of you times the derivative of you in terms of x.

81
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,990
I remember that you enter a function because we set it in step 1.

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,530
All right.

83
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,880
So I'll put this in parentheses.

84
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,140
Because this is a real deal.

85
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:28,910
But again the way to remember it is think about the D-y over DX which we covered are ready and put them

86
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,810
across from each other.

87
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,070
All right.

88
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,090
So I put it down here across

89
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,940
DUI over ADX across.

90
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,790
And then you fill the rest with two use one down here and one up here.

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,300
All right.

92
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,160
And finally we go to the third step.

93
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,660
Which is the X and this is pretty simple.

94
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,460
It just says Put

95
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,120
in terms

96
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,170
of X..

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,920
All right.

98
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:19,150
So again we have a three step process given by you the x you is set you equal to the enter the stands

99
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,420
for derivatives you are multiplying two derivatives this one times this one.

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,230
And finally you have X which says put it in terms of x.

101
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,660
Believe it or not this UTX is going to come in very handy when you're doing problems.

102
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,820
And in fact let's jump into a problem right now.

103
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,590
So you see how it works.

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,560
So let's say that I have a VAX equals

105
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,900
x squared minus five to the third power.

106
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,630
And I want to find the derivative of this.

107
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,450
So what is a prime of x

108
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,490
so by now you should be looking at these types of functions and thinking to yourself well what do we

109
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,150
have here.

110
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,500
We have one function x squared minus five with then another function that means that to find the derivative

111
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,670
of this of f of x I need to use the chain rule and then in the middle of the exam you're going to be

112
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,230
like whoa aguy daily X-Box I remembered.

113
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,450
Yes.

114
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,730
And then after that you're going to say OK.

115
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,530
Ugly has a U.

116
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,220
Daly has a D and x box has an X..

117
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,710
So you dx and we apply our process here.

118
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:52,440
So let's go through the UTX to solve this problem and all divided here to avoid any confusion.

119
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:06,620
All right so step 1 step 1 is for you and it says said the you equal to the inner function so you equals

120
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,830
inner function.

121
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,170
What is the inner function.

122
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,940
Remember the inner function is a function that's wrapped around the other function.

123
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,080
Right.

124
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:26,230
So in this case the inner function is x squared minus five x squared minus 5.

125
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,010
All right.

126
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,260
And see we're done with our first step.

127
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:39,240
So close to number two so we need to multiply the derivatives and always you need to write this down.

128
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,620
So remember we have D-y over ADX but cross.

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,460
So I have you over here.

130
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,580
And D-Backs down here right.

131
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,760
And why do we fill it up with next.

132
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,630
Which is do do you.

133
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,410
And do you.

134
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:58,920
All right.

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:06,730
So what is this going to be equal to first derivative says derivative of y in terms of you.

136
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,450
All right so what is y remember y equals f of x right.

137
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:18,120
So why is this whole thing X squared minus 5 to the third power.

138
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:29,030
However here's a deal where we say in terms of you we're saying that Y will be written using you only

139
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,820
Arite right now.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,770
Why is written using X right.

141
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,880
X squared minus 5 to the third.

142
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,530
But we want to rewrite this y in terms of you.

143
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,460
So think of it like this.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,300
And again once you get this you're going to think OK that was really easy.

145
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,470
If you is equal to the inner function and the inner function what you're doing with it is you're taking

146
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,630
it to the third power.

147
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:03,800
Isn't this the same as saying you to the third.

148
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,850
Think about it.

149
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:13,070
So we set X quarter minus five is the inner function which we set equal to you and what we do here is

150
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,670
we say enter to the third power.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,130
But you enter.

152
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,750
So this is the same as saying you to the third.

153
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,020
Right.

154
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:34,200
That's what we mean when we say let's get y in terms of you instead of using X we substituted this inner

155
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:42,380
function by you because in step 1 we did say that you was equal to the inner function.

156
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,920
All right.

157
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,560
So remember it what we're doing is derivative of y in terms of view.

158
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,270
So this is a why in terms of you know we need to get the derivative of this

159
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,680
so derivative of you cute.

160
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:07,010
And then we're going to multiply that by the derivative of you in terms of X. you again as the ener

161
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,880
function.

162
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,560
And it is already in terms of x.

163
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,380
So there's nothing else that you need to do you just say derivative of you

164
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,030
like this.

165
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,070
All right so let me repeat once more.

166
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,220
Here are multiplying two derivatives.

167
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,120
The top tells you why you're differentiating and the bottom tells you in terms of what you're going

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:44,750
to put the top you to the third is why expressed using only you and you in terms of x is you expressed

169
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,950
only using x.

170
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:55,600
So we have you to the third find the derivative times squared minus five derivative of that.

171
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,150
All right so how do we find the derivative of this you.

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,620
Well guess what.

173
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,500
Where are you going to do is you're going to treat it as if you had an X here.

174
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,210
Right.

175
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,450
Same thing.

176
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,800
So is this where X to the third.

177
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,200
How would you get the derivative of that.

178
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,710
Of course it's a power function.

179
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,070
So we bring our dictator down and we substitute by a less powerful leader.

180
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,330
That is exactly what we're going to do.

181
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,510
But instead of X we're going to use you so dictator rule let's apply it here.

182
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,120
We bring down a dictator that's three we keep the you and we substitute by a last powerful leader.

183
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,860
Three you squared right.

184
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,660
That's it for that.

185
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,010
That is the first derivative.

186
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:49,520
We're going to multiply that times the derivative of this and derivative of this is a derivative of

187
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,460
the first minus the derivative of the second.

188
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,040
Right.

189
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,060
It's just a difference of functions.

190
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:01,420
So are you going to get the derivative of each one and subtract those derivatives.

191
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,020
The derivative of the first one.

192
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,380
You know this already is just 2x right.

193
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,090
Well bring our dictator down.

194
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,390
Substitute a less powerful leader that gives us a one which we don't mark.

195
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,110
And finally mine is derivative of a constant you know zero.

196
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,900
So we're not even going to market.

197
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,700
All right.

198
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,480
So we have this weird looking thing which is three use squared times 2x.

199
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:37,670
Once we have this and we found our derivatives we go to the last tab which is put in terms of x.

200
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,300
So we want to put this result in terms of x this 2 x already has x.

201
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,030
We need to do is wherever there is are you were going substituted by whatever we got.

202
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,260
And step 1 right.

203
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,620
So we said you was equal to x squared minus 5.

204
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,010
So instead of putting you here we're going to put x squared minus five.

205
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,680
So we have three times you squared.

206
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,500
So again instead of you were going to use X squared minus five

207
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:30,700
to the second power times 2 x Arite and last is we can simplify this 3 times to X is 6 x

208
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:41,910
times x squared minus 5 to the second power.

209
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,860
And guess what.

210
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:56,690
This is our derivative 6 x times x squared minus five to the second power is our answer.

211
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,150
All right.

212
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,380
So see it's not even a long problem.

213
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,680
It just takes getting used to.

214
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,200
All right.

215
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,120
And we're going to do a lot of problems in the problem section so that you truly understand how this

216
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,490
chain rule works.

217
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:27,850
Not only that so that you can put this interesting mnemonic to put it that way to use ugly daily X-Box.

218
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,320
So let me summarize quickly what we did here.

219
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,620
We had a function x squared minus five to the third.

220
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,500
We know we need to use a chain rule because we have one function within another function.

221
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,200
So remember a derivative ugly daily X-Box That's you the x to check get out.

222
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:53,340
DX actually tells you right away set in terms of you find a derivatives put in terms of X..

223
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,600
All right I put the descriptions here but I mean just by looking at it you kind of know what it is right

224
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,120
away.

225
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,030
So you is set you equal to the inner function.

226
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,780
That's what we did over here.

227
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,160
We know that the inner function is x squared minus five.

228
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,619
So we say you equals x squared minus five.

229
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,319
That's it.

230
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,480
First step one step two derivatives again remember we're multiplying two derivatives and the way to

231
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,319
remember this.

232
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,720
Like I said is to start with D-y where ADX but you do it cross right.

233
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:36,040
So D-y on top here and cross you have the X on the bottom and then you fill the rest with a D you and

234
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,830
another do you.

235
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:46,050
So at the end of the day you're crossing D-y with DX and the do you with the other do you.

236
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:53,590
Like I said this means refining the derivative of y in terms of you and the derivative of you in terms

237
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,800
of x.

238
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,010
So why is why why is this right.

239
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,560
The whole function that we're finding the derivative for.

240
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:09,870
But we're trying to set y in terms of you so we don't want to have any access like we do originally.

241
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,990
But since you is equal to the inner function and what we're doing here is where a cubing the inner function.

242
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,140
Then why in terms of you simply you to the third.

243
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,640
All right.

244
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,500
And of course don't forget.

245
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,410
Very important.

246
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,540
We're getting the derivative of you to the third.

247
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,090
So it's derivative of y in terms of you so you to the third which is a derivative of that and then times

248
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,990
derivative of you in terms of X..

249
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,860
Remember you is simply the enter function.

250
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,980
It already is.

251
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,430
In terms of x.

252
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,600
So we just write it in terms of x x squared minus 5 and we get the derivative of that.

253
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,760
Finally we get the derivatives and we multiply them together.

254
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,380
So the derivative of this like I said you'd treat it as an X right.

255
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,840
Just like if you had an X instead of a you save you had x to the third.

256
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,960
What would you do.

257
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,130
Oh you would apply the dictator rule.

258
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,560
So you bring down your dictator and you substitute a less powerful leader.

259
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,970
That's what we did.

260
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,240
That's how we got the three of you to the second power.

261
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,740
And then we multiply by the derivative of this which you should already know is just to X.

262
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,050
Let's finish the summary of what we did in the next video.
