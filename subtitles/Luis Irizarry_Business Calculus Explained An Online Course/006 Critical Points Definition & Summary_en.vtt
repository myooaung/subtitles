00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.430
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130
I promise you this is going to be a short one.

3
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.180
I just want to go over a very important concept called critical points.

4
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.780
Let's jump right into the definition.

5
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:42.580
All right so critical points there are points for which the derivative of f of x is zero or undefined.

6
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:51.520
So for something to be a critical point of f of x either the derivative at that point is zero or is

7
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.900
undefined.

8
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.740
So let's go over an example.

9
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.050
All right.

10
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.660
So for example number one let's say that we have a function f of x and its derivative is

11
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.640
x.

12
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.430
So we're finding out the critical points of f of x.

13
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.040
So we need to make sure that we find the numbers so that this derivative is either 0 or undefined.

14
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.870
Now for the undefined case that's only when you have a fraction.

15
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.820
In this case we don't have a fraction.

16
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.370
So all we need to do is find the numbers that make the derivative equal to zero.

17
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.540
So when does 3 x equal 0.

18
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.490
While you're multiplying three times x.

19
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.560
So the only way for 3 x to be zero is when X itself is zero.

20
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.020
Right.

21
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.890
Because that's going to give you half of zero equals three times zero.

22
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.300
Equals zero.

23
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.630
All right.

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:07.170
So there is a critical point when X equals zero.

25
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.640
All right.

26
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.280
Let's do another example.

27
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.560
Let's say that the derivative of another function is

28
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.280
three over X minus five.

29
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.620
So again we want to find the critical points for the original f of x.

30
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.230
So we have to find the values that make the derivative equals zero and the ones that make it undefined.

31
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.250
In this case this derivative can never be equal to zero because remember for something to be equal to

32
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.670
zero it needs to be zero on the top.

33
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.640
However this top is always 3.

34
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.890
So we don't have to check for this derivative being equal to zero.

35
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.440
On the other hand this derivative could be undefined because it has a denominator.

36
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.440
It has a bottom and what is the bottom equal to zero.

37
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.280
Well as.

38
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.980
Find out.

39
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.490
So we grab the bottom part and we say X minus five equals zero.

40
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.360
And what we'll do is we'll solve for x.

41
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.800
So we need to bring this negative five to the other side.

42
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.070
So we'll do plus five on both sides

43
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.000
or bring down the x negative five plus five cancels out.

44
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.840
Bring down the equals and 5.

45
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.890
All right so according to this if we plug in 5 into this derivative we're going to get undefined.

46
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.110
Let's test that out.

47
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.450
And prime 5 equals 3 over and again we're plugging in five.

48
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.560
So it's going to be 5 minus 5 is 0 3 over 0 is undefined.

49
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.510
So that is true.

50
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:05.540
This means that there is a critical point when X equals 5.

51
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.930
All right let's do one more example.

52
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.980
So in the first case there's a critical point because a derivative equals zero.

53
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.490
And the second case there's a critical point because a derivative is undefined.

54
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.470
Let's see a case where the derivative can both be zero and undefined.

55
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.600
So let's say that the derivative of a function is given by this

56
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.440
OK.

57
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.670
So this is a derivative of f of x and we're trying to find the critical points of f of x.

58
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.890
So again for critical points we always check for two things.

59
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.510
Number one the numbers that make the derivative equal to zero and that numbers that make it undefined.

60
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.190
So here we have a fraction and we have access on both the top and the bottom.

61
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.400
So first we're going to check for the numbers that make the derivative equal to zero.

62
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.190
And remember that for a derivative to be equal to zero the top needs to be equal to zero.

63
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.220
OK.

64
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.940
So let's go ahead and grab the top so we have X times X minus 1

65
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.150
is equal to zero.

66
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.230
And I mean if you're going to look at it there are two ways this can be equal to zero.

67
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.520
So we have X times X minus 1.

68
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:48.940
You have a multiplication and you have two things that are multiplying this X and X minus 1.

69
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.550
Remember that if two things are multiplying and one of them is 0 then the whole thing is zero.

70
00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.690
So either this can be 0 this X or this X Minus One can be zero.

71
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:11.880
So our first answer is obviously when X equals zero because this outside X is going to be 0 0 times.

72
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.760
Something else is going to be zero.

73
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.680
OK so we're going to start building our answer.

74
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.450
I'll put it down here.

75
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.890
So there is a critical point when X equals zero.

76
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.810
Because of this x by itself.

77
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.790
OK where else is this going to be equal to zero.

78
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.020
Well let's look inside the parentheses.

79
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.700
One is the parentheses going to be equal to zero.

80
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.190
If you have X minus one.

81
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:48.440
Well obviously if you plug in one you're going to have what you're going to have one minus one minus

82
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.280
one is zero.

83
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.340
So you're going to have a zero in the parentheses.

84
00:06:52.350 --> 00:07:00.820
Therefore there's also a critical point when X equals 1.

85
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.220
All right so we plug in zero.

86
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.420
The whole thing is zero.

87
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.230
If we plug in one the whole thing is 0 as well.

88
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.200
So we have two values that make the derivative equal to zero.

89
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.420
Now let's find out what the derivative is undefined.

90
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.260
Remember it's undefined when the bottom is equal to zero.

91
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.600
So let's grab the bottom x minus 3 equals zero.

92
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.410
We'll set it equal to zero and we'll solve for x x minus 3.

93
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.060
And we do plus three on both sides to bring the three to the other side.

94
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.560
So we bring down the X again negative three plus three goes away.

95
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.990
And we have zero plus three which is three.

96
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.080
So according to this if we plug in 3 into our derivative that's going to give us undefined.

97
00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.820
And that's actually the case because if you do prime of three you're going to end up plugging in a three

98
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.260
on the bottom.

99
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.470
So that's three minus three equals zero.

100
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.480
So our third answer here is when X equals 3.

101
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.940
All right so you have critical points for all these x values when actually go 0 when it actually goes

102
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.800
1 and when X equals 3.

103
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.900
Let's make a quick distinction between critical points and critical numbers.

104
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.520
So when you hear the word point remember that you have an x in A Y.

105
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:30.970
Right.

106
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.990
You have an x value y value.

107
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.230
And number is just you know just a number.

108
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.450
So a critical number

109
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:58.140
is a number that either makes the derivative equal to zero or undefined.

110
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.620
So it's the x value by itself

111
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.960
that makes a derivative equals zero or undefined

112
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:25.990
that is what a critical number is.

113
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.480
All right.

114
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.640
So what we actually found on the last examples were the critical numbers.

115
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.190
They are the values that make the derivative equal to zero or undefined.

116
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.340
A point however is composed of an X on a y.

117
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.340
So this x value of the critical points is the critical number.

118
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:54.390
All right and let's do one more example so we can see how everything works together.

119
00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:07.230
So let's say that we have the function 3 x squared minus 12 X and we want to find the critical points

120
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.000
for this function.

121
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.650
So first of all we find the derivative and it's going to be 6 x minus 12.

122
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.890
Again we're just using the rules for derivatives.

123
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:25.760
So at this point you should know that you have a constant so that goes outside you bring down your dictator.

124
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.860
You keep the exponent of 1 and you have the differential.

125
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.210
So it's a minus.

126
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.870
And then here you have the constant multiple You have 12 and the X becomes X to the one minus 1.

127
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.320
So that's X to the 0 and it goes away.

128
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.410
All right so here we have our derivative.

129
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.440
So again to find the critical points we need to find values that make the derivative either zero or

130
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.470
undefined.

131
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.590
In this case there's no undefined because there is no bottom.

132
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.830
So we're just going to set it equal to zero.

133
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.750
And let's go ahead and solve for x.

134
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.710
So first of all we move this 12 to the other side.

135
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:13.400
So we have 6 x equals to 12 and then we divide by 6 from both sides.

136
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:24.490
And that is going to give us 6 over 6 goes away X equals 12 over 6 which is equal to 2.

137
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.020
So this x value is a critical number.

138
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:43.730
All right we said critical numbers are the numbers that make derivative equal zero or undefined to get

139
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.690
the actual critical points.

140
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.840
We need to grab this critical number and plug it in where.

141
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:56.430
Well you might think oh of course it has to be plugged into the derivative but that is not the case.

142
00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.300
Remember Actually that if you just plug this into the derivative you're going to get a zero right because

143
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.730
by definition this too is a number that makes a derivative equal to zero.

144
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:16.010
So to get the actual point you're going to have to plug in this to into the original function.

145
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.910
And if you think about it that makes sense we're trying to find the critical points of the original

146
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.050
function.

147
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:29.860
So if you have an x value you just need to go ahead and plug it into the original and find the y value

148
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.990
corresponding to that x value.

149
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:42.450
So we're going to say to because we're plugging in our two into our original function.

150
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:50.260
So we have three and then it's two squared.

151
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:59.030
Mine is 12 times to.

152
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.840
So two squared is four times three is 12

153
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.380
minus 12 times two is 24.

154
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:20.420
So we have 12 minutes 24 is negative 12 so we have a Y value for this x value.

155
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:28.580
That means that our critical point our call it C.P. is at 2 negative 12

156
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.030
and that is your answer.

157
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.580
All right.

158
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.660
Just wanted to make this distinction between critical number and critical point critical number is the

159
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.080
x value.

160
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.430
Critical point is both the x value and the corresponding y value.

161
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.140
And remember that once you get a critical point you're just going to go ahead and plug it into the original

162
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.890
function and that's going to give you the corresponding y value.

163
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:06.400
At that moment you'll have your point which is your critical point and again a very easy way to remember

164
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.380
to plug this into the original.

165
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.900
Is that actually if you try plugging it in into your derivative it's either going to give you zero or

166
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:20.710
undefined because by definition the critical number is that the value that makes the derivative equal

167
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.520
to zero or undefined.

168
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:30.130
So again you describe this to plug it into the original get your final critical points and you are good

169
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:30.430
to go.

170
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.790
My friend let's go into our summary.

171
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.470
All right so going into our summary we have the critical points of f of x occur when the derivative

172
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.210
equals zero or as undefined.

173
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.090
So we have these two checks.

174
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.970
Do not forget derivative equals zero or a derivative is undefined.

175
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.840
So in general you always check for the derivative being equal to zero.

176
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.150
So you set it equal to zero and you solve for x.

177
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:05.610
But for the other check the undefine one that can only happen when there's a fraction.

178
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.210
So if your derivative is a fraction then the top part corresponds to the derivative being equal to zero.

179
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.040
And the bottom part corresponds to it being undefined.

180
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.300
So for example if you have a over B

181
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.010
then this top part corresponds to the derivative being equal to zero.

182
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:36.320
And the bottom part corresponds to the undefined part.

183
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:43.280
So if this could be zero on top you have to look for the values that make it zero on top.

184
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:49.210
If it can be a zero on the bottom then you have to look for the values that make zero on the bottom

185
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.110
as well.

186
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.210
Because remember we have two checks.

187
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.520
One is for the top one is for the bottom.

188
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.980
If you don't have a fraction only check for a derivative being equal to zero because it can never be

189
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.440
undefined.

190
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.470
All right.

191
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:08.430
So the values that make the derivative equal to zero or undefined are called the credit card numbers.

192
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.240
I remember a number is just a number.

193
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.230
On the other hand to find the actual critical points you need to plug in your critical numbers into

194
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.080
the original function.

195
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.420
This is very important.

196
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.310
So if you're asked to find the critical points you can't just say oh the critical point is X equals

197
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:27.960
1.

198
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.780
That is not a point for a point.

199
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.090
You need both the X and the y value.

200
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.230
That is a point.

201
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:45.050
So again once you have your critical numbers all of your axes then what you do is you plug them into

202
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.740
the original function.

203
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.560
And like I said it makes sense because if you plug them back into the derivative you're either going

204
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.590
to get zero or you're going to get on the fines.

205
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.210
In other words division by zero.

206
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.630
So that is it for critical points.

207
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:04.910
I wanted to do a separate section for this because you're going to see them a lot and I don't know if

208
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:11.000
you noticed but if you did the last tutorial which wasn't increasing and decreasing functions we actually

209
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.069
find the critical points in order to find increasing and decreasing intervals.

210
00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:21.170
Remember that we did you know we need to find the x values that make the derivative equal to zero or

211
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
undefined.

212
00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:25.339
Well those are critical points.

213
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.800
So you've already done them.

214
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.460
If you did that section.

215
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.790
All right well I have a couple of examples for you to try out critical points.

216
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.250
So I'll see you in the next tutorial.
