1
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.070
All right.

2
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.880
So let's go ahead and put everything that we've learned together.

3
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.490
So we've gone over the properties and we've gone over the rules for integrals so and this video will

4
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.750
actually go ahead and do problems that require all of those.

5
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.220
And I know you might be thinking well there's you know too many rules or too many properties.

6
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.380
Well once you start getting used to integrals it will become second nature.

7
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.960
So do not worry about that at all.

8
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.810
So just remember that you know when you're adding integrals or subtracting you can break those apart

9
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.930
and that you could put Konstanz on the outside.

10
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.300
And further rules we cover that recently and another video.

11
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.630
So just go ahead try to give it a shot if you can make this one work then don't worry about it.

12
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.900
You know I'm going to give you more problems that use all of these rules.

13
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.680
All right so for now let's go ahead and have you try to find this one.

14
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.530
So it says find the following integral in a row of x cubed minus X squared plus five dx.

15
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.450
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

16
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.400
All right so what do we have here.

17
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.640
So let me just rewrite it again.

18
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.750
So x cubed mine is x squared.

19
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.410
Plus five dx.

20
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.180
So we actually have a couple of functions that are adding and subtracting right.

21
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.370
X squared is subtracting from x cubed and 5 is adding to the x squared.

22
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.570
So all we can do here is remember we have a sum and different rule for integrals.

23
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.600
That tells you that you can actually find each individual integral for each individual function and

24
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229
then keep the sign in between them.

25
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:22.790
So we can find the integral of this first one integral of x cubed DX minus the integral of x squared

26
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.420
and then plus integral of 5 dx.

27
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.200
All right so let's get each individual integral.

28
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.120
So for this first one we have a power function so we can increase and divide that will be X to the for

29
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.620
over 4 and we would typically do plus C but when you have different integrals like this what you do

30
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.440
is you do only one C at the end.

31
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.880
Right.

32
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.140
So we're just going to say X is the forth over for.

33
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.440
We're not going to say plus C because we'll add that at the end of everything.

34
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.250
All right.

35
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.030
So that is a first integral then we have minus.

36
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.430
Here we have a power function again.

37
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.520
So what we do is we increase and divide just like we did for the first one.

38
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.140
So X to the two becomes X to the three and then we divide by the same thing.

39
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.720
Right.

40
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.300
Perfect.

41
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.740
Right.

42
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.380
And then we do plus and then we have this constant remember that the integral of a constant equals the

43
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.580
constant times x.

44
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.450
So that is 5 x ends.

45
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.470
Now that we have three integrals we can finally do the plus C and this is our answer.

46
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.070
So for example in this one we had to use the sum and their friends property to be able to separate these

47
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.070
integrals and then we had to use the power rule for integrals for these two functions and the constant

48
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.220
rule for this last function.

49
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.880
So for integrals you're going to have to mix and match all these rules and properties.

50
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.140
But again it's really not too bad.

51
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.150
The main thing is knowing that you have to break these apart by using the sum and reference property

52
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.090
after that eschews power rule and constant rule.

53
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.970
Let's try another example.

54
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.760
All right so here's the next example.

55
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.990
We have integral of three over X minus X to the negative two plus three dx.

56
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.320
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

57
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.010
All right so let me just write it down here.

58
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.490
Three over X minus X to the negative two plus three.

59
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.920
All right.

60
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.150
So remember we're adding and subtracting functions so we can get the individual integral of each and

61
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.470
keep the sign.

62
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:24.320
So it was to the integral of this first one which is 3 overacts It's a three x dx and then we do minus

63
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.780
because we keep the sign the integral of x to the negative to

64
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.900
dx and then we finally do plus

65
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.020
interval of 3 dx.

66
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.930
All right.

67
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.570
So let's go ahead and check it out.

68
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.320
So for this first one integral of 3 over x.

69
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.970
So remember we have the constant multiple rule that says if a constant is multiplying your function

70
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.320
you can actually take out that constant to the outside and get the integral by itself.

71
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.720
And here we have this constant which is three That's multiplying this one over x.

72
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.400
So what we do is we take the three outside threes out here.

73
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:24.430
Integral of one over X so by the way I remember it kind of looks like the three on the X are at the

74
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.520
same level but in fact the three on the one are the same level.

75
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.830
Right.

76
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.550
Because the three was up here.

77
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.180
And we take it out.

78
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.810
So it disappears from the top.

79
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:43.740
So we have three times the integral of one of her x dx and then we have mine is so integral for this

80
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.170
one.

81
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.600
It's a power function we can use a power rule so we increase and divide.

82
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.710
Right.

83
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.140
So we have X to the negative 2 and then increase so plus 1 on the bottom.

84
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.930
Negative two plus one as well.

85
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.970
So that is increase and divide and we do plus And remember the integral of a constant is just the constant

86
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.140
times X so three which is a constant times x.

87
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.190
And remember we do a plus see at the end of everything but we're still not done.

88
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.430
We actually haven't done this interval yet.

89
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.710
So this will be three.

90
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.230
And what is the integral of one over x.

91
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.920
Remember this is the natural log of the absolute value of x.

92
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.500
This is a logarithmic rule.

93
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.920
So line of absolute value of x.

94
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:46.150
So we have this three times natural log of absolute value of x.

95
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.150
All right.

96
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.690
And then we have minus.

97
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:57.080
So what is X to the negative 2 plus 1 negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1 right.

98
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.390
Oh $2 and you pay 1 back then 0 1.

99
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:12.170
So this is X to the negative on over on the bottom the same thing negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1 plus

100
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.880
3x plus C..

101
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.040
All right and now let's simplify this a little bit.

102
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:26.620
This middle integral so we have three element of absolute value of x.

103
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.470
So what do we have here.

104
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.810
We have minus right.

105
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.730
But what happens is this fraction is negative as well.

106
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.380
Why.

107
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.400
Because the bottom is negative.

108
00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.659
We have a negative one.

109
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.530
So the whole fraction is negative.

110
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.670
And remember that negative times a negative becomes a positive.

111
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.900
So instead of having this negative a negative it actually becomes plus.

112
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:54.550
All right.

113
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.060
Thats very important.

114
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.140
And I'll repeat it again when you have a negative times a negative.

115
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.310
The whole thing becomes a positive.

116
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.960
I'm not talking about this negative in the exponents.

117
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.870
That is something else I'm talking about this negative here.

118
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.350
And then the sign of the fraction when these two are multiplied.

119
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.130
Then it becomes a positive.

120
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:14.650
All right.

121
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.990
So plus X to the negative one.

122
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.320
And we don't have to mark this one on the bottom anymore because you know anything over 1 is just one.

123
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.320
And again this one multiplied with this gave us a positive.

124
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.570
So it's not negative 1 anymore.

125
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.280
It's actually just one.

126
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.700
All right.

127
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:39.910
And then we have plus 3x Plus see.

128
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.820
And then the last thing we want to do is remember that we don't like negative exponents.

129
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:51.330
So what we do is we bring it to the bottom by flipping the sign of the exponent.

130
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:58.900
So we have three L.N. of the absolute value of x plus.

131
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.260
How do we do this again to bring it down flip the sign of the exponents.

132
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.890
So we have a one on top on the bottom we have X to the one positive one because we flip the sign.

133
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.260
But again if it's a positive one we do not need to market.

134
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.710
We just put x.

135
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.320
All right.

136
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:25.160
And then finally plus 3x Plus see and this point we are done.

137
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.380
All right.

138
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:38.520
So remember the secret to doing these types of problems is to know that you have to break apart and

139
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.880
get each individual integral.

140
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.400
All right.

141
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.140
Once you do that after that it's basically applying rules and taking out Constance.

142
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.390
That's it.

143
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.280
So for this first one we had a constant.

144
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:56.310
So we took it out and that left us with three on the outside and one over X and the integral of one

145
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.640
of her X is a natural log of the absolute value of x.

146
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.240
This one was just a power function and this one was a constant.

147
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.160
And like I said here we encountered a situation where we had a negative times a negative.

148
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.600
So the whole thing becomes positive.

149
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.740
And finally we brought down this exponents to the bottom by flipping the sign.

150
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.480
All right.

151
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.310
So let's go ahead and do another example.

152
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.450
All right.

153
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:36.050
So here we have another integral integral of an X Minus One plus E to the 3x minus E to the 4 x dx.

154
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.950
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

155
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.770
All right so let's go ahead and do it together.

156
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.580
Let me rewrite this.

157
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:58.860
So it's an X minus 1 plus E to 3 x minus E to the 4 x dx

158
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.460
right.

159
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.900
And I learned my lesson I'm not going to do the problem over here because I've run out of space.

160
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.600
I'll start it over here.

161
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.280
All right.

162
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.850
So we're adding and subtracting integrals as you can see.

163
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.720
So what we're going to do as usual is to break it apart into individual integrals.

164
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.980
So we have an integral of 10x yak's.

165
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.500
That's the first one.

166
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.070
And then mynahs we have a minus here.

167
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.790
Integral of one D-Backs then we have a plus

168
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.490
integral of the 3x.

169
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:52.720
And then we have a minus integral of B for X and that's it.

170
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.200
So let's do each individual one.

171
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.540
All right.

172
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.210
So integral of 10x.

173
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.830
So here we have a constant multiple right.

174
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.730
We have this constant 10 multiplying x.

175
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:11.950
So we take out this 10 over here and integral of x dx.

176
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:20.260
So we just took out the 10 from inside the minus so integral of one interval of a constant.

177
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:30.790
Remember that what we do is we just take the constant and multiplied by X so that one times x perfects

178
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.640
right and moving on to the next.

179
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.790
Here we have to use the exponential rule for integrals right.

180
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:45.580
So remember that that says that if you have E to the K x K in this case is three then you have to do

181
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.870
one over k.

182
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.160
So one of three.

183
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.390
And then you rewrite this whole thing to the 3x.

184
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.870
That's it.

185
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.720
All right and then mine is Whoa check it out.

186
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.520
We actually have another exponential rule.

187
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:10.300
So same thing if you have E to the K x then you have 1 over K which is 4.

188
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:18.040
In this case remember K is the number multiplying the X and then we have this whole thing again.

189
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:28.610
Each to the 4 X and at the end remember it we always do this plus C great.

190
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.680
All right so let's go ahead and simplify.

191
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.580
So we have 10.

192
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.880
And remember we still haven't done this interval.

193
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.650
So what is the integral of x.

194
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:44.180
Or remember the integral of x is like saying the integral of x to the one we just don't market.

195
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.510
But the ones there.

196
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:52.380
So it's a simple power function and we can use our power rule and do increase and divide.

197
00:14:52.930 --> 00:15:01.350
So X we increase it's a one plus one is two and divide by the same two.

198
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:09.460
All right and then minus one times X is just x plus.

199
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:15.730
And here remember that this would be OK if you have it as one over three to the 3 x.

200
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.160
But let's go ahead and put it another way.

201
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.530
Remember that multiplying by 1 to 3 is the same as dividing by three.

202
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:29.510
So on the top we have e 3 3x over 3.

203
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.070
All right.

204
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.330
This is the same as this minus.

205
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.870
And here will do the same thing.

206
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:45.130
Each of the four X on top which is this over four plus C.

207
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.810
All right.

208
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.340
Let's go ahead and simplify.

209
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.280
One last thing and that's the thing with these problems if you simplify one result then you have to

210
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.700
rewrite the whole thing.

211
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.550
Right.

212
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.590
But let's go ahead and finish that up.

213
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.920
So sand over to is five.

214
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.380
So we have five x squared.

215
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.570
And after that we just rewrite this whole part.

216
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:24.380
So a 5 x squared minus X plus E to 3 x over 3 minus E to the 4 x over 4 and then plus C and we are done.

217
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:38.070
All right so again key points is to break down the integrals and get the integral of each different

218
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.250
function.

219
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:44.610
Once you do that you know it becomes very clear where you need to do in this case we had a constant

220
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.030
multiple So you take it outside and then do the power.

221
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.920
In this case you have a constant.

222
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.920
So you just add the x and in these two other cases the last two we had the exponential rule.

223
00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.570
So we went ahead and applied it to each one and that's how we got our final results.
