00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,430
Hello what's going on.

2
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,760
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,190
We're going to continue the topic of linear functions linear functions is something that we touched

4
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,610
on a little bit on the graphing functions section but now we'll go a little bit deeper into what a linear

5
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,420
function is and how it works.

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,790
So as we learn before graphs of functions let us have a peek into how a function behaves.

7
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:53,020
In other words we can see how a function is changing as we know a function can be trending upward quickly

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,660
aboard that very slowly downward quickly or maybe not that quickly.

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,800
It can be unchanging etc..

10
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,460
So basically there are a lot of things that could be happening to a function at a given time.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,950
So let's talk about linear functions and how they're changing.

12
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,250
First let's go into the definition of a linear function.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,660
So here we have the definition of a linear function Ellenor function is a function in the form y equals

14
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,420
AirMax plus B where M is a number and B is another number.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,300
And I'll give you a mnemonic for you to remember it's going to be very easy for now just know that it's

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,320
y equals maximal speed.

17
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:43,600
If it's in this form then you know it is a linear function and something very important about linear

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,660
functions is that exponent.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,570
Their highest exponent is always 1.

20
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,110
So remember if X does not have an exponent it's assumed to be 1.

21
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,650
So if this were a 2 or 3 or a 4 then it would not be a linear function.

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,940
So that's why it's always y equals max plus b and x is the same as x to the one and we mark that here

23
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,640
x is equal to x to the one OK.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,830
So whenever you see an explosion that's not one you're not dealing with a linear function.

25
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:28,670
And something interesting about linear functions is that its graph is always a straight line.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,680
So so we have some examples here of linear functions.

27
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,300
So 2 x plus three is this a linear function.

28
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:48,030
Well it definitely looks like one because we have X plus B So remember the M is a number multiplied

29
00:02:48,060 --> 00:03:01,480
the x y multiplying the X here is a 2 so m equals 2 and B would be the last number at the end which

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,160
is 3 b equals 3.

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:16,810
Another example of a linear function would be 5 plus x.

32
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,490
So what's different about this one.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,010
Well the X is on the right but it really doesn't matter.

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,750
It could be on the left over here or it could be on the right as well.

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,160
So in this case remember that the number multiply the X is the M.

36
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,990
Here the number multiplying the x.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,120
There's nothing there so it's just the one because one times x equals X and equals one

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,480
and B is just a number by itself that constant at the end.

39
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,620
Which in this case is at the beginning.

40
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,780
So that's five

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,790
while the example of a linear function would be 3 x minus 2.

42
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,610
The fact let's make this negative 3 x minus 2.

43
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,450
Is that a linear function.

44
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,140
Sure is why it's in the form y equals m beat.

45
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,300
In this case the M the number multiply and the x is negative.

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:35,110
So is negative 3 and B is just the number at the end which would be negative 2.

47
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,670
All right.

48
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,770
And the second point its graph is always a straight line.

49
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,020
Well interesting because to graph a straight line all you need is two points.

50
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:54,340
So for example let's pick the graph of this one to X plus three.

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,870
So we'll do this over here.

52
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
We have a plane

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:10,080
X horizontal y vertical and since we only need two points what we'll do is we'll get a little table

54
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:23,540
for our function and we'll plug in two values into this function so half of X equals two acts plus three

55
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:33,850
let's plug in easy values like of 0 so that's two times zero plus three

56
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,940
times zero is zero plus three is just three.

57
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:46,420
So our first point is going to be 0 3 and let's pick one.

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:59,160
Again we're picking easy values so we have two times one plus three two times one is two plus three

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,950
is five so our point here is 1 5 OK.

60
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,510
So now we have two points.

61
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,140
Again remember to graph a linear function you only need two points.

62
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,670
OK.

63
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,340
So we have two points over here.

64
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,390
They are 0 3

65
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,660
and 1 5.

66
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:33,220
All right so let's plot our first point in 0 3 again X is 0 so you don't move left or right and you

67
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,200
go 3 up because it's positive 3 y value.

68
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,250
So we go one to three.

69
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,660
That is our first point and our second point is 1 5.

70
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:53,240
So the graph 1 5 we move one to the right because X is one and it's positive and we move 5 up because

71
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,180
Y is five and it's positive.

72
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,670
So this is three.

73
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,300
You do two more four and five.

74
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,440
This would be your second point.

75
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,920
So again we know it's a straight line.

76
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,220
We have two points.

77
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,620
And I'll repeat myself to graph a straight line.

78
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,440
All you need is two points and to join them together.

79
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,950
So we go ahead and we joined these two points together.

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,060
Something like that.

81
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:32,340
And this is the graph of lie equals 2 x plus 3

82
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,170
OK.

83
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,160
That's pretty much it for the graphs of linear functions.

84
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,020
Later on we'll move on and we'll see how other graphs look.

85
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,300
We'll have parabolas we'll have different types of curves etc..

86
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,310
That's where it really gets interesting.

87
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,150
As of right now a straight line it's not very exciting but we'll move on.

88
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,250
For now though let's move on into money.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,370
So you remember how to identify linear functions.

90
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,140
OK so here's a quick mnemonic for you.

91
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,710
It's actually two of them and they relate to linear functions.

92
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,910
So the first one is remember that the equation for a linear function is.

93
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,290
Y equals max plus B.

94
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,810
So how do we remember that.

95
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:33,760
Oh I invented this really cool mnemonic which is actually very easy to remember and that is why Mexico

96
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,409
abro So why Eco's exploits b.

97
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,640
Think of it like this.

98
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,110
So obviously the why is why this why over here this is why emacs is the abbreviation for Mexico so why

99
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,510
equals emacs plus B and B stands for the bro.

100
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,190
It's that simple.

101
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,800
You might be thinking wow this is so silly it is silly.

102
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,300
But precisely because it's silly is why you will remember this.

103
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,020
So linear function y Mexico bro.

104
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,240
You're not going to forget y equals emacs plus speak.

105
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,200
All right.

106
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,430
So think about it.

107
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,990
Think about it again.

108
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,410
It's going to go into your head and at the moment of truth during a test you'll be thinking to yourself

109
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,890
why Mexico bro.

110
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,490
And that is amazing.

111
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,800
All right and the second thing is remember that I said that the graphs of linear functions are aligned.

112
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,370
How do we remember this.

113
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,140
Very easy.

114
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,200
Just think of the name Lennier contains the word line.

115
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,690
OK so graphs of linear functions are always lines.

116
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,190
So this line refers to this line.

117
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,640
OK.

118
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,520
So graphs of linear functions are always lines.

119
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,370
Like I said to graph a line.

120
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,720
All you need is two points.

121
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,890
That's it.

122
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,350
So if you want to graph a linear function you pick two x values.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,280
You plug them into the function like we did in the last example.

124
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,790
You get your two points.

125
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,990
Then you just graph your two points and unite them together.

126
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,100
That's it.

127
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,030
You have a line for a graph of a linear function.

128
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,350
So before we move on I want to mention a special case of a linear function.

129
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:36,090
So again a linear function has the form why Mexico bro.

130
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:52,720
Now what happens when M is 0 y equals zero times x plus B Well zero times Exiguus zero so you just have

131
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,790
equals B.

132
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,530
In other words y equals b a b is a number.

133
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,280
This is called a constant function

134
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,810
will actually look at those later on when we do the derivatives of conc and functions.

135
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,740
But for now just know that a constant function is a function in the form y equals B.

136
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,260
So there is no axes.

137
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,030
It's only a number.

138
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,840
An example of a constant function is.

139
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,050
Y equals 3.

140
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,830
And if we try to build the table for this check this out

141
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,970
x and y.

142
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,000
So let's try plugging in zero into this function right.

143
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,690
So f of 0

144
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,460
Well is there really anything to plug in here.

145
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,780
There is no X..

146
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,450
So pretty much it's going to be equal to 3

147
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,620
right so no x nothing to plug in.

148
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,790
I just put this number that's there already is half of 10 again.

149
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,910
There's nothing really to plug in.

150
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,280
So it is again equal to three and three.

151
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,010
And I hope you're getting the point.

152
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,840
It doesn't matter which number you plug in you're going to get a three.

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,320
All right.

154
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,800
So for a constant function the y value is always the same.

155
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,710
By the way don't get confused.

156
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,120
We talked about how for every input There's only one output.

157
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,080
This right here does not violate that because for every input for example 0 there's only one output

158
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,380
which is three for another input 10.

159
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,590
There's only one output which is also three.

160
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,920
So it doesn't matter that they have the same outputs because they are different axes.

161
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,340
If you had that one x equals zero then why equals three sometimes but then seven other times than that

162
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,900
is not a function here.

163
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,080
It's OK because again you have one output for every input.

164
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,140
All right so that is a very special case of a linear function.

165
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,840
And again the form inches y equals B B's a number.

166
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,220
All right.

167
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:32,620
So a couple of other examples of constant functions y equals eleven point two.

168
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:39,970
It's only a number y equals pi which is approximately three point fourteen.

169
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,830
Y equals negative 2 etc..

170
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,980
These are all constant functions.

171
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:59,150
Because they are equal to a number with no variables no letters.

172
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,820
And that is what a constant function is.
