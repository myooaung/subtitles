00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:29,030
OK Guys welcome to another session of limitless calculus today we're going to cover instead of one rule

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,780
we're going to cover two rules.

3
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,900
And the reason we're doing that in the same tutorial is because they're very similar.

4
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,080
They're called the some rule and the differential.

5
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,620
Like I said the sum and difference will look very much alike.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,400
Often you will have to use these rules together in the same problem actually.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,220
So let's sort of with the same rule.

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,520
Many times you will find functions that are composed of other functions and these other functions can

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,560
be adding subtracting multiplying dividing etc..

10
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,470
So we used the same rule to find the derivative of two functions that are adding.

11
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,150
So let's say that we have a main function and that function is f of x.

12
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,790
Let's say that f of x is composed of two other functions.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,870
First one is Globex

14
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,220
and the second one is Age of X

15
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,340
OK.

16
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,110
So we have a main function f of x and it is equal to the sum of two other functions.

17
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,330
These two other functions are g of x and h of X..

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,370
This is function one and this is function to.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,250
In fact you could have more than two functions adding You could have for example

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,270
g of x

21
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,500
h of X

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,620
and let's call this one.

23
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,550
I have X remember the letters really don't matter.

24
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,960
Doesn't matter if you call that GeoEye X of H of X or it really doesn't matter at the end of the day.

25
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,340
Let's say these are all adding.

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,210
Well as you might have guessed we want to find the derivative of f of x which again is and we're talking

27
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,450
about this one now instead of the one on top.

28
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,590
But again it's the same concept.

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:49,430
So we want to find the derivative of f of x which is the sum of three other functions g of x h of x

30
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,750
and x.

31
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,450
So let's go into the same rule and see how these derivatives are found.

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,970
OK so now we have a some rule that some rule says that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

33
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,000
Again the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

34
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,150
What does that mean.

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,260
You might be thinking Lewis.

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,240
What the heck is this.

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,470
Is this even calculus.

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,870
Well yes it is.

39
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,290
Let me show you how it works.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:32,970
So let's say again that you have a function called f of x and x is composed of g of x x x plus X

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,710
so the rule says the derivative of a sum here if you want to find the derivative of vivax in essence

42
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:51,370
you're finding the derivative of a sum right because you're finding the derivative of g of X plus H

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,320
of x.

44
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,990
So it says the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

45
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,540
That means that you're going to find each individual derivative and add them up.

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,780
So the derivative of f of x is going to be a derivative of the first function.

47
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:21,930
Q Prime of X plus the derivative of the second function.

48
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,620
That's the rule again.

49
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,700
Let me repeat.

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:34,620
If f of x is composed of two functions that are adding g of x and h of X the derivative of f of x is

51
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,180
just the derivative of G plus a derivative of h.

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,300
So you basically go into the function and you find all the terms that are adding together and you find

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,880
the derivative of each.

54
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,580
Let's do a quick example here.

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:09,840
So if x equals X to that 3 plus 2 x to the two well this is a sum of functions right f of x is equal

56
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,590
to the sum of two functions which are x cubed and 2 x squared.

57
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,600
And they're adding because you see a plus sign in between.

58
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,680
So if you want to find the derivative of fallbacks again if we go back to a rule it says that the derivative

59
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,380
of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives.

60
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:40,100
So we're going to find each individual derivative So first we're going to find a derivative of x cubed.

61
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,970
And again if you don't remember one of the ways of saying that you're going to get the derivative is

62
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,400
by putting in parenthesis and then adding this apostrophe over here.

63
00:05:49,890 --> 00:06:03,140
So this is a derivative of x cubed Plus a derivative of two x squared.

64
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,210
Again you know how to do this already what is this.

65
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,330
Oh it's a power function right.

66
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,710
X to the N so the derivative is.

67
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,930
Remember a dictator rule.

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:23,070
We bring down our dictator we keep the X. we subtract 1 to substitute for one with less power.

69
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,410
So three minus one is two great.

70
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,410
Now we do plus and we find the derivative of this.

71
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,880
Here we use the constant multiple rule because you have two constant multiplying the x squared.

72
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,810
And for the X squared we're going to use the power rule because as a power function.

73
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,440
OK.

74
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,560
So the constant multiple rule tells you you keep the two and we bring out and we bring down our dictator

75
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
multiplying.

76
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,950
So this to the exponent comes down multiplying that two that was already there.

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,050
This too is the constant.

78
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,220
This too is the exponent that came down.

79
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:13,120
Keep the X and you subtract 1 from the exponent so to 1 is 1 is just 1.

80
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,670
And finally let's simplify.

81
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:29,070
We have 3 x squared plus two times 2 is just for an X to the one remember it is X because 1 is implied.

82
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,260
And this is your answer

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,470
pretty easy right.

84
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,660
Again when you have a function that's composed of the sum of two other functions just find the derivative

85
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,750
of each and add them together.

86
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,460
That is the sum rule.

87
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:53,050
Let's look at the differential which as you might guess is the same thing but except you're adding you

88
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,930
are subtracting OK guys.

89
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,270
One quick correction.

90
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,660
I notice I missed something in the last problem that I showed you.

91
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,730
So the problem I have F X equals x cubed

92
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,440
plus 2 x squared right.

93
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,860
And we want to find the derivative.

94
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,950
So we use the sum rule.

95
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,580
A derivative would be the derivative of the first one plus the derivative of the second one.

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:34,059
So in the other video I had execute prime which is OK but I missed the prime.

97
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,460
On the second function.

98
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,370
So it should be like this

99
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,650
put in parentheses and with the apostrophe.

100
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,870
So I miss the parentheses in the apostrophe.

101
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,090
So it looks like we're not getting the derivative but in fact we are getting the derivative of both

102
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,340
of these terms of the execute and 2 x squared.

103
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,200
If you're taking notes and you really should we can go back to your notes and add the parentheses and

104
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,950
the apostrophe on this second term.

105
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,780
And of course now let's go to the difference rule.

106
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,960
OK so now for the differential.

107
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,400
You'll see that it's very very similar.

108
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,440
That differential says the derivative of a difference is the difference of each derivative.

109
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,870
And again let's go over a quick example.

110
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:46,400
If I have a function f of x and that function is composed of g of X minus H of x so remember in the

111
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,920
some rule we apply it when there is a plus between the functions.

112
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,380
There is a minus then it's a subtraction.

113
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,080
And by the way I don't know why but mathematicians have sometimes like two names for the same thing.

114
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,530
So a difference

115
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,100
is the same as a subtraction.

116
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,850
By the way

117
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,620
when you see the differential it's because you're subtracting something from something else which is

118
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,200
exactly what we're doing here.

119
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,460
F of x equals G of X minus Age of X.

120
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,510
So what would be the derivative of.

121
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,750
I can't spell today.

122
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,780
What would be the derivative of f of x

123
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:46,730
Well it would be each individual derivative of the functions that compose it with the minus sign in

124
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,900
between.

125
00:10:47,900 --> 00:11:07,040
So it's basically you find the derivative of g of X minus the derivative of HMX.

126
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,780
OK so derivative of f of x equals G prime of x.

127
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,440
So the derivative of g of X minus H prime of x which is a derivative h of X.

128
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,520
Again very simple just like the some rule.

129
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,470
Let's do a quick example here.

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:45,860
So if f x equals 4 x to the 5 minus 10 x 2 3 and we want to find the derivative of f of x Well you just

131
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,590
take each individual derivative and you keep the sine.

132
00:11:50,640 --> 00:12:01,380
So you find the derivative first of first of the first function which is for X to the five prime minus

133
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,410
the derivative of the second function.

134
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,300
An X to the three prime

135
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,080
Let's actually so I'm getting ahead of myself here.

136
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,920
Let's do it on the side.

137
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,640
A derivative of the first function.

138
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,940
Again we do a constant multiple rule.

139
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:38,840
So we keep the four we bring our dictator down 5 x and minus one on top so that's four minus.

140
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
Again a multiple rule.

141
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,180
So we keep the 10.

142
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:51,620
We bring our dictator down comes down three X and subtract one for one with less power that's going

143
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,440
to give you two.

144
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,450
Finally we simplify.

145
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,800
We're going to get four times five is twenty.

146
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,980
So we have 20 x 4

147
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:14,030
minus 10 times 3 is 30 x squared.

148
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,570
All right.

149
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,000
So again very similar to the sum rule.

150
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,450
Instead of doing plus you're doing minors that is the only difference.

151
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,300
OK so now we have our mnemonic for the sum and different true.

152
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:46,310
So the mnemonic is actually based on the sum rule but it applies to both the sum and the differential.

153
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:58,180
And before we get into it what happens if we have one plus two we are adding one plus two right.

154
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,500
So we say that the sum of 1 and 2 is three.

155
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:11,170
Telling you this because we're going to use it for our mnemonic so when we have some we are adding numbers

156
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,890
right.

157
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,490
So some equals add.

158
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,480
And the reason why I'm doing this is because I couldn't come up with an acronym for some.

159
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,080
So I had to move it over to ADD or ADHD whichever way you want to call it.

160
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,820
And here in ADH is where we get our mnemonic.

161
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:39,100
So basically it says that add or ADHD is equal to add different derivatives.

162
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,050
OK.

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,740
So let me take this out.

164
00:14:48,740 --> 00:15:01,220
So again if we have fullbacks equals G of X plus H of x.

165
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:13,360
So again we have a function f of x this function is composed of the sum of g of X and age of x so using

166
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,100
our mnemonic we know that the derivative of

167
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,610
fallbacks where we need to do is you need to add the different derivatives.

168
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,640
So you basically get the derivative of each term and then you add them together.

169
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,600
That's what add different derivatives means.

170
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,670
OK.

171
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:48,400
So we're going to get derivative of g of X plus the derivative of age of X and this right here is your

172
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,190
answer to a derivative of f of X..

173
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,770
OK.

174
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:00,820
So again all we do is f f of x is composed of other functions that are adding we add different derivatives

175
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,070
of each function.

176
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,290
And then we are done.

177
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,430
So this is for some for the differential is exactly the same thing.

178
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,600
So you can think of the same acronym add put instead of add the different derivatives you subtract the

179
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,650
different derivatives.

180
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,350
OK.

181
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:30,190
So again let's say we have a function that's f of x equals G of X mine is h of x

182
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
so the derivative of f of x is going to equal again.

183
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,040
Think of the same mnemonic add add different derivatives.

184
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,210
But instead of adding we're going to be subtracting the different derivatives.

185
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:57,740
So we grab the derivative of each term derivative of g of X minus the derivative of H of x and there

186
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,290
you have it.

187
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:06,740
That is a derivative of f of x G prime of X minus H prime of X and again some difference there are the

188
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,550
same thing.

189
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:13,180
The only thing that changes is the sign in between them for the sum of course it's a plus sign.

190
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,750
And for the difference it's a subtraction sign a minus sign.

191
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,410
OK.

192
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,260
That's pretty much it.

193
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,310
Let's do a quick example here.

194
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,160
So if x equals 3 x squared

195
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,860
plus

196
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,540
4 x to that 3

197
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,420
those 5 What is a derivative of f of x.

198
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,010
So we have a sum.

199
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,630
So we're going to use the Add mnemonic and it says to add the different derivatives.

200
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,940
So you grab the derivative of the first one plus the derivative of the second one plus the derivative

201
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,950
of the third term.

202
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,150
OK the derivative for the first one again.

203
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:17,400
We keep our three bring down a dictator times to an X to the WAN is just X because we subtract 1 from

204
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,840
the exponent.

205
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,570
We move on to the second term.

206
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,960
Again we keep the plus sign.

207
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:32,980
So we keep our constant multiplying at the beginning as a constant multiple rule will bring down a dictator

208
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,190
for the power rule.

209
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,520
X and so substitute by a new leader.

210
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,290
It gives you two plus.

211
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,610
OK we have five here.

212
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,750
So what does that mean.

213
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,410
Well it's a concept.

214
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,980
And what is a derivative of a constant.

215
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,710
Remember constant rule constant temperature is not changing.

216
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,250
Therefore the derivative of a constant is zero.

217
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,220
This gives us your answer.

218
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,340
Let's simplify.

219
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:13,420
Three times two is six x plus four times threes 12 x squared.

220
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,120
And in the yet we have PLO's 0.

221
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,670
We don't really have to do anything there.

222
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,190
So we have our final answer.

223
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,040
Go right.

224
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,880
So that was an example of some rule being used on the next section.

225
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,850
We'll do an example of both the sum rule and the differential being used together because sometimes

226
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,770
you're going to have a function f of x that's composed of some functions that are adding some functions

227
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,690
for.
