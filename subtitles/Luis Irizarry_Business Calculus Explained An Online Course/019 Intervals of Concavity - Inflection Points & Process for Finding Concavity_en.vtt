00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.600
All right.

2
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.010
So whatever trying to find concavity for a function and we do not have a graph how do we do that.

3
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.480
Well we can use second derivatives for that.

4
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.380
And let me remind you of this section of increasing and decreasing intervals because this is so similar

5
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.880
to that that it's worth going back to that.

6
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.230
So for increasing and decreasing intervals

7
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.910
we had that if a derivative first formed by the way the first derivative is positive

8
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.900
then the graph is increasing.

9
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:13.790
Then we also said that is the first derivative is negative and the graph is decreasing.

10
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.650
Remember this from the increasing decrease in S..

11
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.560
It's going to come very handy now because this is again very similar to what we're about to do

12
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.820
so concavity used in second derivatives.

13
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.790
What are the rules.

14
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.360
Well the rules are this.

15
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.500
So if the second derivative

16
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.160
is positive and by the way when I say plus is positive it's the same thing as saying greater than zero.

17
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.920
OK.

18
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.220
Literally the same thing.

19
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.670
If something is greater than zero that is positive if it's negative then it's less than zero.

20
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620
Exactly the same thing.

21
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.560
Just again these rules say if a derivative is positive then the function is increasing.

22
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.040
And if the derivative is negative then the function is decreasing and that is the first derivative.

23
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.690
Now for concavity we use the second.

24
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.760
So if the second derivative is positive then the function is concave up on that interval

25
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.480
OK.

26
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.600
Now on the other hand it's the second derivative

27
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.400
is negative

28
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.250
then the function is concave down.

29
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.750
All right.

30
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.240
This is it.

31
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.320
And I want you to notice how similar this is to the increasing and decreasing intervals.

32
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.780
So for increasing and decreasing first derivative is positive it's increasing first derivative is negative

33
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.490
it's decreasing.

34
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.230
Here is the second derivative is positive.

35
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.210
It's concave up if the second derivative is negative it's concave down.

36
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.430
So they pretty much go hand-in-hand positive increasing positive concave up negative decreasing negative

37
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.550
concave down.

38
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.920
This is pretty much it.

39
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.390
Now there's one more analogy that we can get from the increasing and decreasing section.

40
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.400
So let's say that we have a max or a min

41
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.350
remember our max is here and there men is down here.

42
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.430
Remember that we said that for example if a function is increasing from left to right then it changes

43
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.660
and it starts decreasing when there is a max.

44
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.500
Right.

45
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.960
So it's increasing.

46
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.690
You get to the max and then you start decreasing in the same way if you're decreasing and then you get

47
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.550
to a min then you start increasing again.

48
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.030
See that.

49
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.640
So these Maxson Menz are actually the points where the function goes from increasing to decreasing and

50
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:40.310
vice versa in the same way we have points where the function goes from concave up to concave down and

51
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.120
from concave down to concave up and these points are called points of inflection.

52
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.060
I know it's a pretty ridiculous name but hey I didn't make it up.

53
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.790
All right.

54
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.960
So let's go into that now.

55
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.570
All right so here we have it a point of inflection is a point where the concavity of the graft changes.

56
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:08.190
So it goes from either concave up to concave down or vice versa and concave down to concave up and let's

57
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.440
see an example where an inflection points could be.

58
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.400
So let's say you have this graph.

59
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.990
This is the concave down part.

60
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.140
And then it switches to concave up right here.

61
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.960
And then once again it goes to concave down

62
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.760
and it just goes on forever.

63
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.140
All right

64
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:49.720
so let's hear with the concavity is this part is concave down because it opens downward then this blue

65
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.620
part is concave up because that opens up where it.

66
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.420
And finally this pink part is concave down because it opens downward again.

67
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.410
So we have that a point of inflection is a point where that concavity of the graph changes.

68
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:15.530
So Pink part is concave down up to about here this right here would be a point of inflection.

69
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.610
And do you see why.

70
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.640
Because a concavity is changing at that point.

71
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.070
All right.

72
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.230
By the way points of inflection are also called inflection points.

73
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.590
Obviously the same thing.

74
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.820
So I'll use both names here so that you get used to them.

75
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.910
All right so we were first concave down and then it became concave up right here.

76
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:46.950
Right.

77
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:54.610
So pretty much when we get to this point it stops being concave up and it starts being concave down

78
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.900
again.

79
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:07.210
So this point here and what the market likes is a point there is and we'll use the alternative name

80
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.820
which is kind of the same thing.

81
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:19.780
Inflection points.

82
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:26.330
So let me repeat it just like we have Max and mennes where the graph goes from increasing to decreasing

83
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.560
and vice versa.

84
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:35.930
We have inflection points where the graph goes from concave down to concave up and from concave up to

85
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.620
concave down.

86
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:43.490
Now do you remember the increasing and decreasing sections where we had to check for the signs to the

87
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.540
left of a critical number and to the right of a critical number.

88
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.320
And then if the signs were different then that means you had a max or a min for concavity it's going

89
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.970
to be exactly the same thing.

90
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:03.460
So again concavity is very very very similar to the increasing and decreasing interval section.

91
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.910
The only difference is that instead of using the first derivative we use now the second derivative.

92
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:15.780
So let's go into the process of finding concavity for a function.

93
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.150
Here's the really easy process for finding a cavity.

94
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.460
So let's say you have a function f of x.

95
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.040
The first thing you're going to do is to find concavity is find the second derivative.

96
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.070
Notice it has two primes.

97
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.610
That means second derivatives.

98
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.240
Then remember how for increasing and decreasing intervals we had to find the critical numbers for the

99
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.510
first derivative.

100
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.430
Well here we find the critical numbers and I put this in quotes because critical numbers typically referred

101
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.810
to the first derivative.

102
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.480
But here we're finding sort of like the critical numbers for the second derivative.

103
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:57.870
So remember that that means that we need to find the numbers that make the second derivative either

104
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.970
equal to zero.

105
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:06.930
Or on find.

106
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.750
All right.

107
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:14.670
And then once we have those numbers remember we have to classify the intervals on point of inflection.

108
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:21.120
So just like we did in increasing and decreasing intervals we need to test for values to the left of

109
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.980
those critical numbers and to the right of the critical numbers.

110
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:33.090
And like I showed you before if for example the second derivative is positive to the left of a critical

111
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.780
number.

112
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.980
That means that it is concave up to the left of that critical number.

113
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:45.870
And if for example if the second derivative is negative to the rights of a critical number that means

114
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.410
that the function is concave down on that interval.

115
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.770
So that way we can actually classify the intervals where it is concave up and the intervals where it

116
00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.030
is concave down and the last thing is points of inflection to remember inflection points are the point

117
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.890
where the concavity changes.

118
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:12.450
So for example if we know that the concavity is up to the left of a number and then down to the right

119
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:19.240
of that same number the concavity went from concave up to concave down if the concavity changed.

120
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.310
That means we have a point of inflection at that point.

121
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.700
So we've talked a lot.

122
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.920
Let's go straight into an example and let's find concavity and point of inflection for a function.
