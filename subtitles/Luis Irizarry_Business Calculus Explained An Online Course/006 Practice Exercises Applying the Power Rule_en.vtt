00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.750
All right so for the power rule will actually do a couple of exercises just because of how important

2
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.450
this rule is.

3
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.040
So let's get started with find prime vivax if f of x equals x to the sex let's you pause the video and

4
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.080
give it a shot.

5
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.390
All right so we're looking for prime IVAX.

6
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.410
So remember that we have a mnemonic for power rule and it is we bring our dictator down because it's

7
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.640
in power so our dictator is in power and it's the xponent.

8
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.860
So what we do is we bring it down and we substitute by a less power for leader.

9
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.690
So this six we subtract one from it.

10
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.180
All right.

11
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.850
So first thing let's go ahead and bring our dictator down.

12
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:25.730
So the six comes down multiply we keep the X and we substitute a less powerful leader.

13
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.350
So the exponent will be six minus one.

14
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.230
And that is equal to 6 x and 6 minus one is 5.

15
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.790
So 6 x 2 the fifth power and we are done.

16
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.100
This is our answer

17
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.670
see the power rule is extremely easy to do.

18
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.890
And once we do a couple of these problems it'll hopefully become like second nature to you.

19
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.290
All right.

20
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.910
Let's do a couple of others.

21
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.570
OK.

22
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.160
So find Ephriam of X if X equals x to the tenth power.

23
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.850
Again we use the power rule and I'll let you pause it and give it a shot.

24
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.910
All right so a derivative of

25
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.470
fallbacks and then we have the same thing so we bring our dictator down.

26
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.050
The 10 comes down multiplying X and we substitute by a less powerful leader.

27
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.760
So remember all we do is we take one out from the exponent so that becomes ten minus one

28
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.670
and we have 10 x to the 10 minus 1.

29
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.490
So to the ninth power and that is it.

30
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.720
That is our answer.

31
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.990
You see that the most important derivative role is as easy as this.

32
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.520
All right.

33
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.270
That's it.

34
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.410
All right.

35
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.030
So let's do another one find prime of X if half of X equals x to the negative 3.

36
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.570
So now we have a negative exponent.

37
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.640
I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

38
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.270
All right.

39
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.880
So

40
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.310
looking for private facts

41
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.500
the fact that this is negative does not change a single thing.

42
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.030
All right.

43
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.540
So we still bring down a dictator and we substituted by a last power for a leader.

44
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:57.560
So we bring down or negative three multiplying negative 3 x and then on the top we substitute a less

45
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.550
powerful leader.

46
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.480
So this becomes negative three minus one.

47
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.100
See the same thing.

48
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:16.579
So that equals negative three x two which exponents what is negative three minus one.

49
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.850
So if you vote three dollars and then you spend one more dollar.

50
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.840
Now you owe four dollars right.

51
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.060
So this becomes X to the negative for income.

52
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.160
So at this point we're technically done.

53
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.590
However something else you can do is you can actually take this to the negative four and you can bring

54
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.000
it to the bottom with a fliped exponent.

55
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.340
So that's a rule in algebra if we haven't looked at that yet.

56
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.220
We'll look at it later.

57
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.270
But just so you know we can go ahead and then keep the negative three on the top.

58
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.880
And this acts to the negative fourth comes to the bottom but it comes with a positive exponent.

59
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.240
All right.

60
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.360
So it comes like this.

61
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:21.690
And this is our answer.

62
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.090
All right.

63
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.860
So let's do a weird one.

64
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.790
All right so find prime of x f f of x equals 1 over x to the 7th.

65
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.310
So how would you do this one.

66
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.460
This can be a tricky one but I'll let you take a shot at it and see how you do.

67
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.330
So please pause the video and give it a shot.

68
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.140
All right.

69
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.550
So were you able to figure this out.

70
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.100
If not.

71
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.040
Don't feel bad.

72
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.120
It is a trick you want again.

73
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.190
So in the current form that we have we do not have access to the end.

74
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.200
Right.

75
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.390
Because this here we have access to the end.

76
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.830
But it's in the bottom of a fraction.

77
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.710
So before we do anything with derivatives we need to transform this one so that it looks like next to

78
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.250
the end.

79
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.090
And this is related to the last problem we just did.

80
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:21.110
Remember that if you have for example x to the end on the bottom to bring it to the top you can do it

81
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.200
but you need to flip the sign of this xponent.

82
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.110
All right.

83
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.770
So one overacts to the servants is the same as saying X to the negative seven.

84
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.830
All right.

85
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:42.010
And again this is exactly what we did in the last problem where we brought down the ax to the negative

86
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.800
four.

87
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:51.310
And we brought it down as a positive x to the for this case instead of going from top to bottom we're

88
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.920
going from bottom to top.

89
00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:00.110
But it doesn't matter if you're going either way you still have to flip the sign of the xponent.

90
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.500
So again to be able to bring this guy up here we can do it but we need to flip the sign of the xponent

91
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.410
first.

92
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:16.430
So this becomes X to the negative 7 and after you have this again it's the same process.

93
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.060
So we find a derivative.

94
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.790
Now it is in the power function form.

95
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:32.420
So we can just go ahead and apply the dictator mnemonic so we bring down or dictator negative 7.

96
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.110
And then we have X and we substitute a less powerful leader.

97
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.280
So we have negative seven.

98
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.470
Mine is one.

99
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.610
So it becomes negative 7.

100
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.140
X to the.

101
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.010
So if you owe seven dollars and then you spend one more.

102
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.610
Now you owe $8.

103
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.200
Right.

104
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:05.030
And like we said before in theory this is done but it's always better to not have negative exponents.

105
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.000
And we're going to do the opposite of what we did initially.

106
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.270
So we had to bring this guy up to be able to differentiate now that we got the answer we're going to

107
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.940
bring this guy down as to not have negative exponents.

108
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.430
So the negative 7 stays on top

109
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.980
and then we're going to bring down this ax to the negative.

110
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.750
And to do that we just flip the sign of the exponents.

111
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.880
So it becomes positive 8.

112
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.750
And this is our answer.

113
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.050
That's it.

114
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:51.150
Remember if you get a function in this weird form where the x to the N is in the bottom just bring it

115
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:57.060
up to the top by flipping the sign get your derivative and if you still have a negative exponent at

116
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:04.210
the end as part of your answer go ahead and bring it down by again flipping the sign of the exponent.

117
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:14.860
All right and finally let's do one more that has a fraction so find f prime of X if f of x equals X

118
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.190
to that 3 over 4.

119
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.740
All right.

120
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.820
So I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

121
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.360
All right so were you able to do this.

122
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:33.770
This problem is going to be hard if you do not remember how to add and subtract fractions.

123
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:40.090
So let's go over this step by step.

124
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.980
So we're going to find the derivative and again the mnemonic does not change because it's a fraction.

125
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.510
It's always the same thing.

126
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.810
So we bring down a dictator three over four

127
00:09:54.230 --> 00:10:03.200
and then we have X and then on the top we have three over four and substitute by a less powerful leader

128
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.030
minus one.

129
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:13.670
So the big question here is what is three over four minus one.

130
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.110
Right.

131
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.010
So if you didn't get this here's how you do it.

132
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:23.260
Remember that to add and subtract fractions you need to have the same bottom.

133
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.100
All right.

134
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.720
If not you cannot work with adding and subtracting fractions.

135
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.110
So how do we do this.

136
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.680
Well first of all this one doesn't even have a bottom.

137
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.580
So we'll add one and the bottom is literally 1.

138
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.660
Remember we have a number that number is the same as that number over 1.

139
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:56.380
So for example 3 is the same as 3 over 1 7 is the same as 7 over 1 also one is the same as 1 over 1.

140
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.610
So now we have a fraction of this right and a fraction of this right.

141
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.200
Now they don't have the same bottom.

142
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.330
So how do we make them have the same bottom.

143
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:13.430
What we do is we look at the bottom of this fraction and then we multiply both the top on the bottom

144
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.610
of the other fraction by the bottom of this one.

145
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.380
So what we do is look at the bottom of this fraction and say OK.

146
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:28.920
So to get to 4 from this one by what number do I need to multiply this one.

147
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.150
And the answer obviously is by 4 right.

148
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.300
Because if you multiply this one by four we're going to have the same bottom that this one does.

149
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.560
So we're going to multiply this by four and remember fractions.

150
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.620
Whatever you do to the bottom you have to get to the top or whatever you do to the top you have to do

151
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.630
to the bottom.

152
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.200
All right.

153
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.900
So we're going to multiply both top and bottom by four.

154
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.600
And that is going to give us the Reginald 3 over 4

155
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.460
Mine is.

156
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.950
So now we have 1 times 4 and ones I was 4 for the other fraction.

157
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.890
So it's four over 4 right.

158
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.470
And then remember that to subtract fractions we keep the same bottom.

159
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.480
So that's not going to change it's still going to be four.

160
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.020
And then we work with the top.

161
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:22.710
Right.

162
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.290
So it's going to be three minus four.

163
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.510
That's going to give you negative 1.

164
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.150
All right.

165
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.010
That is it.

166
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.150
So again for you to work with fractions adding or subtracting.

167
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.130
They need to have the same bottom.

168
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:47.080
So we went ahead and multiplied this fraction here by four on both top and bottom so that it has the

169
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.130
same bottom as this one here.

170
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.140
Now we have three over for minus four over for the bottom stays the same.

171
00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:02.110
When you're adding or subtracting fractions and you just work with the top so the tops are three minus

172
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.640
four.

173
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:10.910
That gives negative one and our result here is negative one over four so going back here we have that

174
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:15.230
3 over 4.

175
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:24.900
But then we have access to the negative 1 over 4.

176
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.810
And by the way again we have a negative exponent.

177
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.860
So just like we did in the last problem.

178
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:35.150
Let's go ahead and bring it down so that 3 is already at the top.

179
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.630
So we don't move that at all.

180
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.410
But then we have a four in the bottom.

181
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.170
And remember we're bringing down this guy to the bottom.

182
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.660
So to bring down this guy to the bottom the x to the negative one over four we need to flip the sign

183
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.480
of the exponent.

184
00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.770
So this becomes X to the one over for.

185
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.650
All right.

186
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.190
So we just brought it down by flipping the sign of the exponents and let's do one more thing.

187
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:16.250
I know this problem is a little bit long but we just have one more step to do so we have three over

188
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.040
four.

189
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:25.070
And then remember what we talked about where if you have X to a fraction elevated to a certain fraction

190
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.160
then you can change that and put it in for form.

191
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:38.200
So the way you do that is you keep the x to the one an X so the one is just X so we don't mark this

192
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.550
one.

193
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.530
And then you take the fourth route.

194
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.410
Right.

195
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.540
So let me repeat that again.

196
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.520
You keep the x to the top the top in this case is 1 so we don't market.

197
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.870
And then you do the root using the bottom as your root.

198
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.490
So the bottom here is four.

199
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:02.750
So we're going to take the fourth route and you indicate that right here.

200
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.290
All right.

201
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.580
This is your final answer.

202
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.500
And in theory this is an answer as well.

203
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.810
However professors would like to see that you actually take it to the next level and simplify it as

204
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.370
much as possible.

205
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.670
So again whenever you have either a negative exponents you have to bring it down or bring it up so that

206
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.820
it's positive.

207
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:34.090
Depending on where it is initially and after that if you still have a fraction as an exponent then you

208
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:40.850
need to go ahead and converted to a root and that is how we got this answer over here.

209
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.950
That is it for power rule.

210
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.440
Again not a hard thing.

211
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.080
It's actually very easy.

212
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.950
You can get a little bit more complicated with fractions or negative exponents but at the end of the

213
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.040
day it's all the same.

214
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:58.930
You bring down your dictator and you substitute by a less powerful leader.

215
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.740
That is it for the power rule.

216
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.640
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
