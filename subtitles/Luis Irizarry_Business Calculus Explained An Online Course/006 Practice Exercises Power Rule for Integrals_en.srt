1
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:18,990
All right.

2
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,180
So let's go ahead and do some exercises for indefinite entry rules.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,430
First one says find the following indefinite integral integral of x squared DX go ahead and pause the

4
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,680
video and give it a shot.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,810
All right.

6
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,310
So as you can see we're trying to find the integral of a power function.

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,080
It's a function in the form X to the N.

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:54,580
So for that we're going to use our mnemonic for indefinite integral which is I in d increase and divide.

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,060
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,050
So let me rewrite it again.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,790
Integral of x squared.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,660
So we increase and divide.

13
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:11,690
So this will become X to the two plus one we're increasing.

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,090
And then we are dividing by the new exponent which is also two plus 1.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,650
Don't forget the plus see and we have two plus one is three.

16
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:38,300
So that's X to the third over two plus one is three three plus C this is our answer and that is the

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,380
indefinite integral of x squared.

18
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,160
In fact let's test that out.

19
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,840
Let's make sure that when we get the derivative of this it gives us back x squared.

20
00:01:48,870 --> 00:02:00,540
So what is the derivative of X cubes over three plus C.

21
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,760
So we have a constant That's one third.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,479
So we put it outside 1 over 3 times then we use or dictator rule.

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,650
So we bring our dictator down comes on multiplying three X and substitute by one of less power.

24
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,880
So that gives us a two plus the derivative of a constant is zero.

25
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,300
All right.

26
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,120
And so we have three over three.

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:36,200
So it cancels out and we have x squared plus 0 which is just x squared and x squared is what we have

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,280
over here.

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:46,270
So in fact this right here is the indefinite integral of x squared and we just verified it down here.

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,350
Let's do another one.

31
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,610
All right so here we have our next problem find the following indefinite integral integral of one over

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,970
x to the fifth power.

33
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,130
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,740
All right so let's go ahead and do it together.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,270
So first thing you'll notice is we have 1 over x to the 5 so we can't really do it in the way it is

36
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,960
right now.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,350
We need to transform it into something else.

38
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:27,460
And remember that any time we have X elevated to a power here in the bottom of a fraction we can actually

39
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,950
bring it up by flipping the sign of the exponents.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:46,490
So this integral of one over x to the 5 dx we can actually rewrite it as integral of x to the negative

41
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,140
five dx.

42
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,220
So what are we doing.

43
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:57,550
We're taking this x to the five and we're bringing it to the top and we have to flip the sign of the

44
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,740
xponent.

45
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,380
So when it comes up it comes up as negative five instead of five.

46
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:10,420
Right now though we have this we have a power function so we can apply our power rule for integrals.

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,750
Remember it's increase and divide.

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,430
So we have X to the negative 5 and then increase.

49
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:33,510
So we add 1 to it plus 1 and then divide by this same New exponents negative five plus one.

50
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,750
Don't forget Plus see.

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,280
All right.

52
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,700
So what is negative five plus one.

53
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,850
Well think of it if you go $5 and then you pay one back.

54
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,420
Now you only owe four dollars.

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,000
All right.

56
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,960
So negative five plus one is negative for.

57
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,200
Same thing on the bottom.

58
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:06,270
Negative five plus 1 is negative for and then plus Plessey.

59
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,840
All right.

60
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,860
And now the last thing is remember as an answer we do not like negative exponents.

61
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,850
So we're going to go ahead and just like we brought it up.

62
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,800
Now we're going to do the opposite and bring it down.

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,370
And because the exponent has a negative sign we're going to have to flip that sign in order to get this

64
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,050
extra negative for on the bottom.

65
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,370
So when we continue down here on the top we'll have one because there's going to be nothing else here

66
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:40,550
in the top over the four that's already there.

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,680
And then we bring down the x to the negative 4.

68
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,410
But again we bring it down as a positive.

69
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,840
And remember this whole thing is negative right.

70
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,850
If the bottom here is negative then the whole fraction is negative.

71
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,800
So it's negative 1 over 4 x to the fourth plus see.

72
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,420
And this right here is our answer.

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,190
All right.

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,170
So remember any time you have this one over X to something at that point you're going to have to bring

75
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,800
it up by flipping the sign of the exponents.

76
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,900
Apply the power rule for integrals and then when you get your answer like we did here bring it down

77
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,310
again and that's it.

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,480
All right so here's another problem.

79
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,410
Integral of x to the 15th dx.

80
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,670
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:51,560
All right so let's go ahead and do this one together so we have a rule of X the 15th dx.

82
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,350
So again we have a rule because we have a power function.

83
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,360
Our mnemonic says increase and divide.

84
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,290
So we take this x to the 15th and we increase the exponent by 1.

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,540
So that's 15 plus one.

86
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,540
And then we divide 15 plus one as well.

87
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,160
And then plus see remember we always put a plus C on we're doing indefinite integrals.

88
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,700
Then we have X to the 16th right.

89
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:33,160
Because that is 15 plus one and we divide by 15 plus one which is also 16 as you might have noticed

90
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,620
this xponent is always the same as this that you're dividing by because you increase and then divide

91
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,360
by the same thing.

92
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,750
All right.

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,030
And then plus the.

94
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,340
And that is our answer.

95
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,320
Very easy

96
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,770
right.

97
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:03,540
So here we have one more find the following indefinite integral integral of x dx and I'll give you a

98
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,630
little tip.

99
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,730
Think about what is X being raced to.

100
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,360
In this case I'll let you go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

101
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,600
All right so let's see be able to do it a little bit tricky but not too much.

102
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,610
So we have integral of x dx.

103
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,070
Now what is X being raised to.

104
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,789
Well remember that I said several times over the tutorials that if you have x by itself that is the

105
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:47,510
same as saying X to the one right so x equals x to the one they mean the same thing.

106
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,700
So in this case we have access to the one we have a power function and we can use our mnemonic for the

107
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,610
power.

108
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,680
So this would become X to the increase and divide.

109
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,300
So we increase by 1.

110
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,620
This is the current exponents and we're increasing it by 1 and then we divide by the same thing.

111
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,470
One plus one plus see.

112
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,400
And finally we have one plus one is two.

113
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:27,010
So that's X to the 2 x squared over one plus one two as well plus see.

114
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,190
And this is our answer.

115
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,690
All right.

116
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,820
And let's see the last one and again I'm giving you a lot of these problems so you get used to the power

117
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,740
rule for integrals.

118
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,620
So find the following indefinite integral integral of x to the sevens dx.

119
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,840
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

120
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,090
All right so let's go ahead and check it out.

121
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,560
So we have integral of x to the 7th dx.

122
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,850
And again we have a power function so we can use our mnemonic for the power rule for integrals increase

123
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,780
and divide.

124
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,570
So we have X and we increase the exponent.

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:26,290
So it becomes 7 plus 1 and we divide by 7 plus one as well and don't forget we do the plus see and then

126
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,430
we have X to the seven plus 1.

127
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,870
So that's X to the eighth power and seven plus one on the bottom that's eight as well.

128
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,840
And here we do plus see.

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,460
So it's X to the 8th over 8 Plessey.

130
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,730
And that is our final answer.

131
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,000
All right.

132
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,380
So we did a couple of problems on the power rule for integrals.

133
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,230
Not too bad.

134
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,490
All you need to remember is increase and divide.
