1
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,140
All right.

2
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,710
So for our last exercise what do we have.

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:34,760
We have F X equals three x cubed times negative 2 x times 10 x squared.

4
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,560
I'll give you a chance to pause the video and try this one out.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,080
By the way let me give you a hint.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,770
Notice how many functions were multiplying here.

7
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,350
Is it true or is it more than two.

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,760
All right.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,440
Pause and give it a shot.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,820
OK.

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,550
So let's see how you did.

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,950
So I asked you how many functions were multiplying.

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,209
In reality the answer is three.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:11,850
We're multiplying three x cubed with negative 2 x and we're also multiplying 10 x squared.

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,470
So remember that our mnemonic only works with two functions.

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,980
So pro is play repeats and then do the outer right.

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,200
So what we can do before getting the derivative is rewriting this so that it's only two functions.

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,010
And the way we do it is we can grab any two functions here and multiply them together and then call

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,880
that the first function and then whatever's left is the second function.

20
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,450
All right.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:49,810
So for the sake of this example let's grab these two multiply them together and then do the derivative

22
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,010
of the whole thing.

23
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,370
So this is still f of x.

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,790
Right now the derivative we're just rewriting the original.

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,020
And those multiply these two.

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:09,509
So we have three times negative 2 is negative 6 and then we have X and remember what we do when we're

27
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,920
multiplying X as with exponents which is add the exponent and we keep the X..

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,050
So the exponent here is three and the exponent here is 1.

29
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,690
Remember we don't market but it's one.

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,610
So it's three plus 1 which is 4.

31
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:36,690
All right that times are second function 10 x squared.

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,040
All right there we go.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,500
There we have our second function.

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,780
Now we have a function number one and function number two.

35
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,930
Now we can definitely apply the product rule and we can use our mnemonic for that.

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,290
So in case you struggle with this problem I'll let you pause it again and apply the mnemonic to this

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,530
to find the derivative.

38
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,890
All right so let's go ahead and find our derivative using our mnemonic Pro.

39
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,970
So we're going to play repeats.

40
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,190
So we're going to play this function once and then we're going to do it again.

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:24,630
So negative six x to the fourth times 10 x squared.

42
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,370
Notice I drop the parentheses.

43
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,400
You can put them if you want to but it's not needed at all.

44
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,830
All right.

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,510
And then we're going to do negative 6 x to the fourth and x squared.

46
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,830
All right.

47
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,100
When you're doing these problems I don't want you to put for example if it's a negative and then thing

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,100
that you're just subtracting this from this.

49
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,020
All right.

50
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,320
Remember we have this empty space because here comes a plus after that.

51
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,140
All right.

52
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,860
So I'm just going to put it now not to confuse it with this negative.

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,510
And again you remember it's a plus because product plus both start with P.

54
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,260
All right.

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,070
So we placed our repeats.

56
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,330
We put a plus sign.

57
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,660
Now we're just missing to put our outers.

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,660
So for the Outers we're just going to get the derivative of the first function here.

59
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
And of the second function here.

60
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:32,460
All right now is go ahead and find the derivatives a derivative of this we have a constant multiple

61
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,510
which is negative six.

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:45,050
So we're going to multiply this negative six times our dictator which will bring down that 4 4 x substitute

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,150
by less powerful.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:56,650
So the new exponent is a three way multiply this by 10 x squared which is this.

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,170
And then what do we have.

66
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,050
Well we have plus negative so positive and negative is just a negative.

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,400
So we can put negative from here already.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,270
All right.

69
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:17,810
So we have 6 x 2 the fourth and we'll get the derivative of this last one.

70
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,050
So a derivative of this.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,030
We have a constant multiple That's a 10.

72
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,100
We bring down a dictator.

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,700
Times two.

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,360
And then you xponent it becomes a 1 so we don't market let's simplify a little bit.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,910
So we have this whole multiplication let's multiply the coefficients negative six times four is negative

76
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,190
24 negative 24 times 10 is negative to 40

77
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,110
and then let's go ahead and multiply the axes so x cubed times x squared.

78
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,800
Remember we add the exponents three plus two is five.

79
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,290
So that is x to the five and then we have minus here is to the same thing.

80
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,060
Let's multiply the coefficients.

81
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,330
So we have six times 10 is 60 times 2 is 120.

82
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:25,060
So that's mine is 120 x and then we have X to the fourth times x to the one we add the exponents that

83
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,760
gives X to the 5.

84
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,220
All right.

85
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,140
And can we simplify here.

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,920
What do you think.

87
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,700
Well we have X of the 5.

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,320
And we have X of the five.

89
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,740
So we definitely can.

90
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:45,120
We know that the answer is going to be something extra 5 because we're just simplifying.

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,040
So we have a negative number.

92
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,930
Mine is something else.

93
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,230
That means that the answer's going to be more negative.

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:00,070
As I like to say if you go two hundred and forty dollars and then you spend 120 more now you're going

95
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,990
to owe much more.

96
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,800
Right.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,340
So the answer is going to be negative negative to 40 minus 120 is negative.

98
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,230
360

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,710
all right that is going to be our final answer here.

100
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,660
All right.

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,410
So again for example we had to group two functions together by multiplying them.

102
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,410
This one time this one.

103
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,590
And after we read wrote the original function then we went ahead and got the derivative using our Parow

104
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,480
mnemonic.

105
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,550
That's pretty much it for the product rule product rule problems again.

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,490
They can be long.

107
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,180
Same thing for the quotient.

108
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:53,940
But hopefully this practice was good for you and remember practice practice practice and do your homework.
