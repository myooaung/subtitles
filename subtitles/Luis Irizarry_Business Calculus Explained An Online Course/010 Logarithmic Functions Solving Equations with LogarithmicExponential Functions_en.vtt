1
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.260
All right.

2
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
So how do we solve equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions.

3
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.100
So there are three steps.

4
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.710
Number one is isolate the logarithm or the exponentiation by itself.

5
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.150
That means put it on one side of the equal sign and everything else on the other side.

6
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.040
Number two is apply the inverse process.

7
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.320
So because exponential algorithmic functions cancel each other out if you have an exponential function

8
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.730
you're going to apply a log.

9
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.030
And if you have a logarithmic function you're going to exponentiate.

10
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.730
So inverses of each other.

11
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.410
And finally we're going to solve for x and remember it whatever you do to one side you have to do it

12
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.090
to another in case you have no idea what I'm talking about.

13
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.900
This is like solving for x.

14
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.560
So remember back in the for example the increasing and decreasing intervals that we needed to find the

15
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.320
numbers that made the derivative equal to zero.

16
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.460
So we had an equation and we had to solve for x.

17
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.990
This is exactly what we're doing here.

18
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.380
All right.

19
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.220
So let's do our first example.

20
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.530
Let's say that we have

21
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.620
two

22
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.710
L.A.X..

23
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.930
Mine is 12

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.280
equals zero.

25
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.920
All right.

26
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.680
So we need to solve for this x.

27
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.360
So Step 1 is isolate the logarithm or the exponentiation by itself.

28
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.520
In this case we have a logarithm.

29
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.970
So let's go ahead and isolate this.

30
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.630
Ellen IVAX I leave it by itself.

31
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.480
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add 12 on both sides to move this 12 to the other

32
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.320
side.

33
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.960
So we have two Ellen IVAX.

34
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.920
Mine is 12 equals zero.

35
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.170
So we're going to add 12 on both sides plus 12 over here and plus 12 over here.

36
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.330
So this cancels out and that leaves those with two LNA VAX equals 12.

37
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.850
All right.

38
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.330
So the element of X is still not by itself it's being multiplied by this too.

39
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.790
So we're going to divide by two on both sides.

40
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
And let's continue here on the side.

41
00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:05.280
So two over two cancels out and we're left with L.A.X. equals 12 over 2 which is 6.

42
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.970
All right.

43
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.680
So we're really isolated the logarithm by itself.

44
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.290
We have Alan Novak's on one side and six on the other one.

45
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.160
Next step is to apply the inverse process.

46
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.840
So if we have logarithm we're going to apply exponentiation and again here we have a natural log.

47
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.930
So we're going to apply exponentiation using E because that is the base.

48
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.500
If you had a different base like 10 or 5 or 20 we would use exponentiation with that specific base.

49
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.010
So what we're going to do is we're going to put E.S. a base on both sides

50
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.660
and we're going to put all of this in the xponent section.

51
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.290
Right.

52
00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:01.560
So on the left side you have E to the Allen of X and on the right side of the equal sign we have just

53
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.280
the six.

54
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.090
So this six comes over here did you see what we did.

55
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.030
We just basically exponentiate it everything.

56
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.510
So we put a base of e on both sides and then whatever we had we put it as an exponent on exponents of

57
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.480
this.

58
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.840
And finally again this is a baseball analogy all over again we're elevating e to a number so that when

59
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.740
you elevate it to that number you get x.

60
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.370
Therefore this is shows X on this side so that doesn't make a lot of sense.

61
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.570
I will ask you to go back a couple of minutes into the last slide and check out what we were talking

62
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.250
about.

63
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.350
We literally did this same example each of the line of x.

64
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.310
So again this is like saying a plane baseball makes you happy if you play baseball.

65
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.690
What's going to happen.

66
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.110
You're going to be happy.

67
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.660
That is the analogy.

68
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.220
And that is your X..

69
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.300
So on the other side we have each of the six so we could actually calculate what each of the 6 is because

70
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.290
that's a number it's 2.7 won approximately the 6.

71
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.210
But we're just going to leave it as E to the 6 and that is our answer.

72
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.140
See that we solved for x.

73
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.940
All right.

74
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.090
So let's quickly do another example.

75
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.880
But instead of using log's we're going to use exponentiation.

76
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.680
So we're going to do the opposite.

77
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.260
So example to let's say will want to solve for x here.

78
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.460
So 1000

79
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:54.220
equals e to the 2 x plus 5.

80
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.720
All right.

81
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.070
So again what we have in this case is exponentiation.

82
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.470
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to isolate the logarithm or the exponentiation by

83
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.560
itself.

84
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:12.370
In this case that step is already done because the exponentiation is on one side and then the 1000 is

85
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.630
on the other.

86
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.030
So let's go to Step 2 let's apply the inverse process.

87
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.420
So if we have exponentiation the inverse process is logarithms.

88
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:32.170
And because the base again is e We're going to apply the natural log and we'll do that on both sides.

89
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.360
So on both sides let's take the natural log.

90
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.270
We have L-N of 1000

91
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:52.070
ants L-N L.N. of E to the 2 x plus 5

92
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.520
right.

93
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:04.980
So again let's rewrite this line of 1000.

94
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.650
And I hope this is clear by now what will be the answer to this.

95
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:18.310
Well again we're saying find me an expression so that when I elevate it to that expression I get the

96
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.220
two x plus five.

97
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.640
Hey it's exactly that right.

98
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.940
It's exactly 2 x plus 5

99
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.350
Get So we apply the inverse process and we were able to get rid of the log.

100
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.300
Now we just have x.

101
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.540
And by the way we still have a log on this side of the Log on this side is a number right.

102
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.210
It's the number so that when you elevate e to that number you get 1 0 0 0 0.

103
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.970
So if we plug this in the car later we'll definitely get a number.

104
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:02.050
In this case though we actually had to get rid of this L-N because you have an X. You have a variable

105
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.260
in there.

106
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.990
Same thing for this.

107
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.610
We actually had to get rid of the logarithm because there's an X inside of it.

108
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.380
OK.

109
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.860
So third step is to solve for x.

110
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:22.090
So what we'll do is we'll move this five to the other side so we'll subtract 5 from both sides minus

111
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.480
five.

112
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.210
By the way this minus five is not for the 1000 it's for the whole expression.

113
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:28.750
OK.

114
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:36.110
You cannot say something like a thousand minus five is 995 Lague of 1985 doesn't work like that.

115
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.750
So we'll just leave it as L-N of a thousand

116
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:54.440
minus five equals Oh by the way this becomes zero equals to X which is what we have left on this side.

117
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.560
So we have 2 x ants to get the X itself.

118
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.340
We need to divide by two on both sides to remember it whatever you do to one side you have to do it

119
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:17.260
to the other two cancels out and we have X so I'm just bringing this X over here and on the other side

120
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.150
we have L-N of 1000

121
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.990
minus five.

122
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.550
Everything over to that is our answer.

123
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.270
All right there you go.

124
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:52.010
So we just did two examples of how to solve equations that have logarithms or exponentiation.

125
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.030
So the main takeaway from this is that if you have a log you need to apply exponentiation and if you

126
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.210
have exponentiation at some point you will need to apply a log.

127
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.970
So there are just inverses of each other.

128
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:11.760
The three step process is to isolate the logarithm or exponentiation by itself on one side.

129
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.930
That's what we did here.

130
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:18.570
So we move this 12 to the other side and then divide by two and same thing that we did here.

131
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.890
But for example two that was actually already done the way the problem was given.

132
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.420
And then once we isolate that logarithmic function or exponential function we just apply the inverse

133
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.750
process.

134
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:39.310
If you have a log a playgroup initiation if you have exponentiation you apply a log and that should

135
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.280
actually cancel out any logs and any exponentiation that you have.

136
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.110
All right.

137
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:52.180
And at that point you can just go ahead and solve for x and again like I said if you have for example

138
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.150
one of a thousand remember that is a number in the same way if you have each of the six that is also

139
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.420
a number it's only when the log or the exponentiation contains an X..

140
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.210
That's when you need to solve.

141
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.850
All right.

142
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:15.150
At this point each of the six and of a thousand are just regular numbers that you can get in a calculator.
