00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.670
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.310
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.570
Today we're going to talk about a very cool concept called concavity and it's related to the application

4
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.740
of derivatives.

5
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.190
You'll see why in a minute.

6
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:46.650
So let's dive into a graph and figure out what concavity is.

7
00:00:46.810 --> 00:01:21.540
So as usual we have a curve.

8
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.070
All right.

9
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.050
So we have this weird looking graph.

10
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.990
And again this is only one function.

11
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.900
I just draw it in different colors to make a point.

12
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.710
And what's interesting here is that look at the pink part.

13
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Well it kind of looks like it has a hole but towards the bottom right in the same way.

14
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.820
This one has a hole but pointing towards the top.

15
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.080
So this is pretty much what concavity is.

16
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.180
It's like a shape.

17
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.980
Right.

18
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.100
And a graph can be concave up or concave down.

19
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.530
So when we say that a graph is concave down it looks like this.

20
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.620
So it opens downward.

21
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.160
See that you see this big hole over here.

22
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.980
So the hole is pointing down.

23
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.260
This is concave

24
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.510
down

25
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.490
and on the other hand we have this blue piece right here which actually seems to be opening up so this

26
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.940
blue one here actually opens up

27
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:50.360
and of course it's called concave up.

28
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.610
So as you can see a graph can have intervals where it is concave down like up to here and then where

29
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.000
it is concave up like up here.

30
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.400
So remember how a graph can have intervals that are increasing in other intervals that are decreasing.

31
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.130
Same concept here.

32
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.790
Some intervals can be concave down some others can be concave up or the graph can be concave down everywhere

33
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.320
or a concave up everywhere.

34
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.480
So let's jump in to the definition for each of these terms.

35
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.560
All right so here we have the first type of concavity.

36
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.100
There are only two types either concave up or a concave down.

37
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.390
So a graph is concave up if it opens upward and re-open.

38
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.870
We're talking about what I showed you in the last slide.

39
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.120
Let me show you again and this time I'll show you with a graph that is always concave up.

40
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.530
All right.

41
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.570
This one is never a concave down.

42
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.070
And the best example of a graph that's always concave up is a parabola.

43
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.130
And remember a parabola is the graph of a quadratic function.

44
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.240
It kind of looks something like that like a big U.

45
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.270
All right.

46
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.020
And where is this opening up towards.

47
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.460
Well the bottom part here is closed but the top part is open right.

48
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.430
So this function is opening up towards the top that's where you have an opening right here.

49
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.230
All right.

50
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.530
So this graph is concave up

51
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.040
and actually this one is concave up everywhere.

52
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.530
All right.

53
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.800
This parabola is never a concave down.

54
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.610
Cool.

55
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.190
All right.

56
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.860
So let's go to the counterpart of concave up which is of course concave down.

57
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.360
All right.

58
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.610
So here we have concave down a graph as concave down if it opens downward.

59
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.370
And again we're going to do a parabola but this time we'll do an inverted parabola.

60
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.950
So one that opens down.

61
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.930
Let's say our parabola is actually something like this

62
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.060
care.

63
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.950
So again where does this parabola open towards.

64
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.490
Well the top right here is closed.

65
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.890
So you have an opening towards the bottom.

66
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.480
Therefore this graph actually opens downward.

67
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.700
So it is concave

68
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.560
down.

69
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:12.820
So in general concavity measures where the graph is opening up towards either up or down.

70
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.230
Now we just went through an example of a function that's always concave up and one that's always concave

71
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.900
down.

72
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:26.750
Let's review one more time a function that is both concave up and concave down for different intervals.

73
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.930
OK so concave up and down a graph can be concave up for some intervals and concave down for others.

74
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.250
Let's go ahead and check out a graph that is both concave up and concave down.

75
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.710
So the pink will be the concave up part

76
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:07.540
and the blue will be the concave down part.

77
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.470
And then we'll have a little bit more concave up

78
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:26.510
and then finally a little bit more of concave down up to infinity and concave up and this side up to

79
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.380
infinity.

80
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.450
All right so check it out.

81
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:41.320
This pink part is concave up because the opening is toward the top the blue part.

82
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.590
On the other hand is concave down because the opening is towards the bottom.

83
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:53.430
Again this pink one is concave up because it is opening towards the top.

84
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:02.230
And this one is concave down because it is open towards the down direction or downward.

85
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.940
All right.

86
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.390
So just to summarize.

87
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.050
Pink is up.

88
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.460
And blue is down.

89
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.300
So up and down

90
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:29.550
and this may look really familiar to you because remember that for increasing and decreasing intervals

91
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.400
we kind of had the same thing.

92
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:37.860
So we had some intervals where the function was increasing and some intervals where it was decreasing

93
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.710
You could have you know alternating intervals.

94
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:47.280
You have one increasing one decreasing one increasing one decreasing etc. etc. So it's kind of like

95
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.890
the same thing.

96
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:56.670
And you'll notice that the process for finding the concavity of a graph is identical to the process

97
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:03.930
of finding intervals of increase and decrease except for one difference and that difference is instead

98
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.800
of using the first derivative.

99
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.560
We're going to use the second derivative.

100
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.880
Well you might be thinking wait what what is the second derivative.

101
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.110
We'll go into that after our mnemonic.
