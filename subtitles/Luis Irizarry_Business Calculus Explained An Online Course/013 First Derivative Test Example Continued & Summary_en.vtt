1
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.490
Now that we have critical numbers.

2
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.630
We went ahead and we classified them.

3
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
So we drew a number line with the two under four.

4
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.940
And then we have to pick values to the left and right of each.

5
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.990
So to the left of two we pick zero between two and four we pick three.

6
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.630
Again you don't need to pick two values because this is the same interval to the right of two is the

7
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.810
same as saying to the left of four.

8
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180
And finally to the right are.

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590
We picked ten.

10
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.180
So we got our three test values 0 3 and 10 and we plugged them into our derivative here Prime of 0 F

11
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.940
prime of 3 and f prime of 10 this gave us for 0 8 24 4 3 negative 3 and for 10 144.

12
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.690
So we got positive negative positive.

13
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.520
We went ahead and went back to the number line and we said positive to the left up to negative between

14
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.620
204 and positive to the right of 4.

15
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.200
All right.

16
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.020
Based on these results that we got over here.

17
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.100
So finally to do the classification we use our mnemonic and we had and draw an example of them X and

18
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.530
an example of a minute and we draw our slopes and we draw our alliance.

19
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.100
So for a max to the left of it you need to have a positive slope going up and to the right of Max you

20
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.880
need to have a negative going down in the same way for a min to the left of the men.

21
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.960
It's going down.

22
00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.020
So you need to have a negative slope and to the right of the men you have a positive because you're

23
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.160
going up.

24
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.270
So based on that we could classify We have two to the left of the two we have a plus.

25
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.270
And to the right we have a negative.

26
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.490
Therefore it's a max in the same way in the four to the left.

27
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.300
We have a negative and to the right we have a plus.

28
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.650
So it's a min.

29
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.770
That's why we set we have a relative Max at X equals two and a relative meant Addicks equals four.

30
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.080
As a final step and this really depends on your professor whether they would require you to do this

31
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.750
or not.

32
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.870
But we found the corresponding y values to these 2 x values.

33
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.020
And again remember these are not plugged into the derivative.

34
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.170
If you plug these into the derivative you're going to get zero because these are critical numbers.

35
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.580
We actually go ahead and plug these in into the original function which is what we did on the top here.

36
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.630
So for two the y value is 20 and a 4 for the y value 16.

37
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.880
Therefore we know we have a relative Max at 220 and we have a relative of men at 4 Khama 16.

38
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.880
That is an application of the first derivative test or a quick summary of the first derivative test

39
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.410
to find relative extrema.

40
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.010
We actually have two things that we need to do first is to find the critical points.

41
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.150
Now I said critical point but what you really need to find is the critical numbers you find the critical

42
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.730
points at the end.

43
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.070
So in other words what you do is you find the numbers that make the derivative either equal to zero

44
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.650
or undefined.

45
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.700
And then you classify them.

46
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.420
So the first derivative test is actually a way of classifying relative extrema and you classify them

47
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.900
as either Max men or neither by using Tezz values in the derivative.

48
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.420
Remember that you use one as value to the left and a want this value to the right of each critical number.

49
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.800
Now to remember which ones which you can actually use the mnemonic which says that you draw a mountain

50
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.880
and a whole.

51
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.680
So you draw a max and a min with the corresponding slopes and signs.

52
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.820
So let me do this one more time.

53
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.470
So if you have for example this Max and this min.

54
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.950
So this would be airMAX

55
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.990
and this would be your men

56
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.720
then you would just draw a line to the left and the right of both the max and the men.

57
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.130
So here we have the max.

58
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.650
Let's draw a line to the left and line to the right.

59
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.110
And here we draw a line to the left and aligned to the right as well.

60
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.360
And based on the slope of these lines we know what the signs to the left and the right should be.

61
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.040
So for example for the max we have a positive slope because it's going up.

62
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.250
So he needs to be positive on the left and to the right of the Max we have a negative slope because

63
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.270
it's going down as you go left to right for the men on the other hand.

64
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.250
If you approach it from the left then you actually have a negative slope because it's going down.

65
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.500
Sorry that's supposed to be a negative.

66
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.350
And on the other hand to the right of the men you have a positive slope because as you go from left

67
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.210
to right it's going up.

68
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.060
So based on this you can actually classify your points.

69
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.910
If you get a critical number and to the left you have a positive slope and to the right you have a negative.

70
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Then you know it's a max based on this same thing for the men if you have a critical number and to the

71
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.170
left you have a negative derivative.

72
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.560
And to the right you have a positive then you know it's a mint.

73
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.510
So anytime you have to do a first derivative task problem all you need to do is draw your max and your

74
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.230
men draw your lines and put your signs so that after that you'll be able to classify them easily.

75
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.780
And then finally to find the actual critical points and remember here the keyword is points you plug

76
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.410
in the critical numbers that you found in the original function.

77
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.130
You do not plug in those critical numbers into the derivative.

78
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:26.390
If you do you're either going to get zero or undefined because that's what a critical number is and

79
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.310
that you're going to go ahead and you're going to plug them in.

80
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:37.560
So the original function to get the corresponding y value of that critical number then that x y points

81
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.130
is going to be your relative Max and your relative min.

82
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.530
All right so this probably was a little complicated.

83
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.900
It's a little bit new we haven't done anything like this before.

84
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.800
But again remember this is very similar to the increasing and decreasing intervals section.

85
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.400
All right.

86
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:04.080
So later on we're going to cover the second derivative test which is pretty much like the first derivative

87
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.660
test but instead of using the first derivative we're going to use the second derivative and I'll see

88
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.970
you in the next tutorial.
