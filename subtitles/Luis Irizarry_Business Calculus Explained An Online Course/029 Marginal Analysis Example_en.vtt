1
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.900
All right.

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.190
So here we have an example where we need to use marginal analysis.

3
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.740
It says a startup that manufactures high pressure water gun toys notices that the revenue brought in

4
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.310
by producing X water guns is given by.

5
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.620
And here we have the revenue function.

6
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:49.000
So our of x is a revenue function and it is equal to zero point zero or three x squared plus to 50 x.

7
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.300
So the first question that we have is estimate the revenue brought in by producing the one hundred and

8
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.160
first unit.

9
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.310
All right so how do we do this.

10
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.040
The first thing I want you to notice is that we have the word estimate as part of the problem.

11
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.580
So estimate the revenue brought in by producing the 100 and first unit.

12
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.770
Interesting.

13
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.480
So if we need to estimate remember that we need to use marginal analysis and we can use our mnemonic.

14
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:28.390
Its very easy It says marginal minus 1 if we want to estimate the revenue brought in by producing the

15
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:38.650
100 and first unit marginal minus one then we need to plug in 100 in one minus one into the marginal

16
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.140
revenue function.

17
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.710
Now lets do it step by step.

18
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.330
First we need to find the marginal revenue function and remember that that is equal to the derivative

19
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.000
of the revenue function.

20
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.090
So we have that marginal revenue.

21
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.820
So the derivative of the revenue function is equal to.

22
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.760
So here we have a constant 0.03

23
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.009
and then we have a power function.

24
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:21.450
So we bring down a dictator but to and X stays with the exponent of one right because we subtract one

25
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.950
from the exponent.

26
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.550
So this is X to the one which is just x plus.

27
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.620
Here we have a constant so constant multiple says leave the constant outside.

28
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.360
Thats a 250.

29
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.320
I remember the derivative of X is just one right because its X to the one and then when you get the

30
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.480
derivative is X to the 1 minus 1 x to the zero equals one.

31
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.420
All right so let's simplify this a little bit more.

32
00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:02.920
So we have a zero point zero at three times two that is zero point zero looks like something weird.

33
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.900
Zero point zero six x

34
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.460
plus 250.

35
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.310
All right so now we have our marginal revenue function.

36
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.140
I remember if this had been the profit function or the cost function we would have done the same thing.

37
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.000
First step is to find the derivative because we're estimating.

38
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.420
And then the second step is again marginal minus one.

39
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.890
We're going to go ahead and we're going to Plug-In what into the derivative.

40
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.260
Well remember it's whatever a unit you're looking for minus 1.

41
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.910
So instead of a 100 on one we're going to plug in 100

42
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.540
or we go.

43
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.130
So we're plugging in a hundred into this marginal revenue function.

44
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.390
So let's go ahead and do that zero point 0 6 times X..

45
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.640
So X is your input and it is 100

46
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.959
plus 250

47
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:44.080
so 0.06 times 100 is just 6 plus 250 and that is going to give us 256.

48
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.560
So we have the answer 256 What does that mean.

49
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:58.770
Well it means that the revenue brought in by the one hundred and first unit is estimated to be $256.

50
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.400
Okay.

51
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.550
So remember this is not the revenue of producing a 100 on one units.

52
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.330
No this is just the extra revenue of producing this single unit unit number 101.

53
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.420
Okay.

54
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.340
So theres a difference there.

55
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.710
All right.

56
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.280
Perfect.

57
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.480
So just to summarize we want to estimate the revenue brought in by a certain unit.

58
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.050
So we have the revenue function we just get the derivative of that to get marginal revenue because we're

59
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.620
estimating once we get the derivative we plug in one less than the unit we're looking for.

60
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.980
So if we're looking for a 100 on one then we plug in 100 into the marginal revenue function and we get

61
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.140
to 56.

62
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.950
That is our answer.

63
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:53.710
In other words this is an approximation of the revenue brought in by producing unit number 1 0 1.

64
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.130
All right.

65
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.320
So this is an approximation right.

66
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.700
We're just as to meeting what if we want to find the actual revenue brought in by Unit 101.

67
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.890
Let's go to that next.

68
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.350
All right.

69
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:14.540
So the first question we approximated the revenue brought in by producing Unit 101 here.

70
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.460
We're asking what is the actual.

71
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.800
All right.

72
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.470
So the real revenue brought in by producing Unit 101.

73
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.250
This is not an estimation not an approximation.

74
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.890
This is the real deal.

75
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.100
And sometimes you'll get this question in marginal analysis.

76
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.910
So how do we do this.

77
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.140
Let's copy again.

78
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:58.600
Our revenue function.

79
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.090
All right.

80
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.290
So remember this gives you the actual revenue for X number of units.

81
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.430
Now what happens if you go ahead and plug in 1 to 1 into this revenue function.

82
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:17.120
The problem with doing that is that you're going to get the revenue of producing a hundred and one units

83
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.060
in total.

84
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:26.420
So unit one unit two you need three unit for unit five etc etc. up to Unit 101.

85
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.930
So that gives you the revenue producing the whole batch of 100 and one units in this question.

86
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.110
What we need to find is the revenue produced by this single unit.

87
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.840
So Unit 101 is a single unit and we want to find the revenue brought in by this specific one not by

88
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.770
all the others.

89
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:54.430
So think about it so if I tell you that I went to the store and I bought a computer and a TV both of

90
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.930
them together my total was $3000.

91
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.700
And I tell you that the TV costs two thousand dollars.

92
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.060
It's a four K high definition 10 ATP whatever super awesome cool TV.

93
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.420
So in total I spent 3000 and the TV was 2000.

94
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:22.130
How much was the computer the computer is the difference between the total and what I spent on the TV.

95
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.760
Right.

96
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.730
So put it here is an example.

97
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.550
So total was

98
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:36.030
3000.

99
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:42.120
The TV was 2000.

100
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.910
How much was the PC Well it's going to be the difference between these two.

101
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.360
Right.

102
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:57.820
Three thousand minus 2000 which is going to give me 1000.

103
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.790
There you go.

104
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.160
So you can actually just scratch that.

105
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.260
So you don't get confused.

106
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.250
I'll actually go ahead and take it out if you want to scratch it in your notepad but what I want you

107
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:17.380
to notice is again that the price of the PC is a difference between the total and the TV right.

108
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.710
So

109
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:32.630
isn't it true that if you want to find the revenue brought in by producing unit 101 isn't that the same

110
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.730
as saying revenue

111
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.490
of 101 units in total.

112
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.440
So altogether

113
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.460
mine is the revenue

114
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:59.450
of 100 units.

115
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.860
Isn't that true that this is going to give me the revenue of Unit 101.

116
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:18.290
Revenue of Unit 101.

117
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.860
So let me repeat this again.

118
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:27.620
The revenue of producing 121 units minus the revenue producing 100 units if you subtract one from the

119
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:33.710
other you're going to get what's left which is the revenue producing Unit 101.

120
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:40.880
So remember revenue of producing a 100 on 1 units includes the revenue producing 100 units.

121
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.550
So if you take that out you're going to be left with the revenue of Unit 101.

122
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.760
That is exactly what we're going to do here.

123
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:53.010
We're going to find the revenue producing a hundred and one units we're going to subtract the revenue

124
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.510
producing 100 units and that is going to be our answer.

125
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.240
Now notice in this case we're not going to use the derivative.

126
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.680
We're just going to use the real revenue function because we want the actual revenue.

127
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.560
Remember derivative is for estimating.

128
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:17.240
So derivative in marginal analysis is only for estimation

129
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.050
or approximation.

130
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:33.090
Whichever way you want to call it it's the same thing.

131
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.740
All right that's very important.

132
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.390
I don't want you to go ahead and plug these numbers into the derivative that's going to give you something

133
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:49.150
else again just use common sense actual revenue of producing Unit 101 revenue of producing a hundred

134
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.210
and one units minus revenue producing a hundred units.

135
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.620
All right.

136
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.490
So let's do it.

137
00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:00.680
Let's go ahead and plug in these two numbers into this function and some tract one from the other.

138
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:07.740
So in essence what we're going to do is we're going to have our of 101

139
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:16.830
miners are of 100 that is going to be our answer.

140
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:25.030
So the revenue brought in by 100 and 1 units mine is the revenue brought in by 100 units.

141
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.480
Let's go ahead and plug that in.

142
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.330
So is plug into 101 into this function.

143
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:49.310
So we have zero points 0 3 times 1 0 1 squared plus 250 times 1 0 on that is our 101.

144
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:58.830
And then we're going to say mine is then we're going to plug in a hundred zero point zero three times

145
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:59.650
100

146
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:11.180
squared plus 250 times 100.

147
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.740
All right.

148
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.730
Let's find out what this is.

149
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:21.480
So 0.03 times 100 and one squared is actually and I'll bring it over here actually.

150
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:30.610
So let's do this.

151
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:45.090
So like we said 0.03 times 100 and one square is actually 3 0 6 3 0 6 point 0 3 plus.

152
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:58.370
And then we have to 50 times 101 is going to give us 25 thousand two hundred and fifty and then we have

153
00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.240
minus.

154
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.690
And I remember Feel free to use a calculator here.

155
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.180
That's exactly what I'm doing.

156
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.110
I'm just editing the video.

157
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.700
So we have minus 0.3 times 100 squared that is 300

158
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.930
plus 250 times a hundred.

159
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.650
And here remember we have our 101.

160
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.730
Mine is our 100.

161
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:32.750
So this is our of 101 and we need to put this one in parentheses right.

162
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:48.800
300 plus and it's two 50 times 100 which is 25000.

163
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.520
So what is this.

164
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.740
So the first parentheses is equal to

165
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:07.710
25000 five hundred and fifty six and zero three zero three.

166
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.470
And then we have.

167
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.820
Mine is whatever is the sum of the second parentheses.

168
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:24.460
Three hundred plus twenty five thousand and six that is twenty five thousand three hundred and six.

169
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.390
And finally for the final answer let's subtract this one from this one.

170
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.720
And remember this is our 101 and this is our of 100.

171
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.090
So the revenue producing 101 units is this.

172
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:44.640
And the revenue producing 100 units this difference will tell us the revenue of the hundred and first

173
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.110
unit which is two hundred and fifty

174
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.510
point zero three.

175
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.100
Check it out.

176
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.990
This is the actual revenue producing unit 1 0 1.

177
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.330
I want you to do something.

178
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:11.120
Compare this answer to the answer that we got in the approximation for question 1.

179
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.960
Are they close together.

180
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.530
You let me know.

181
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:20.270
So I want you to pause the video right now and go look up the answer for problem 1.

182
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.490
Compare it to this to 50 and 3 cents.

183
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.740
All right so hopefully you went ahead and check that out.

184
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.020
And do you like the results.

185
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.790
One was an approximation.

186
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.060
One was the actual results.

187
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.410
All right.

188
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:40.000
So just to summarize what we did for this question we're looking for the actual revenue brought in by

189
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.100
producing unit 101.

190
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:47.440
So remember you can just go in and plug in 100 on one into here because that's going to give you the

191
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.550
revenue producing a batch of a hundred and one units in this case.

192
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.650
We want to know the revenue of just this single unit Unit 101.

193
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:04.900
So like we said well we can do is we can find the revenue producing 100 on one unit and subtract the

194
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.900
revenue producing 100 units.

195
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.640
What's left is going to be the revenue of Unit 101.

196
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.970
And remember we do this in the original revenue function not in the derivative.

197
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.900
The derivative is only used for estimation and approximation.

198
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.790
So our of 101 miners are of 100.

199
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:27.400
I'm not going to go through these calculations again but of course if you have a question please just

200
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.390
let me know.

201
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.820
And the final answer that we got is two hundred and fifty dollars and three cents.

202
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.710
Great.

203
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:43.430
So again you should know already how this compares to the answer and number 1 and that is it.

204
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.540
So in this example we use revenue but it could be profit.

205
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.900
It could be cost it could be any of those.

206
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900
All right.

207
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.570
The process does not change the process is the same.

208
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:54.970
All right.

209
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.320
Awesome So let's go into our summary.
