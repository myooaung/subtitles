1
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,210
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,680
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,770
Today we're going to talk about logarithms and logarithms.

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,560
Maybe you've heard of them before.

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,610
Maybe not.

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,080
Maybe you've heard the word but you don't know what it means.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,120
I got you covered.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,190
We're going to go over a logarithms we're going to go over how they work and we're going to go over

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,200
some mnemonics so that it's easy for you to remember logarithms.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,650
All right.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:56,410
So when we think about logarithms it's kind of like the inverse of exponentiation.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,130
OK.

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:08,760
So again in exponents you have something like this to two to three equals eight right.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,300
That's because two times two times two.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,290
So two multiplied by itself three times equals eight.

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,670
Now assume for a second that we do not know that two or three equals eight and we want to find the answer

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,570
to the following.

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,450
We want to know to which number do we need to raise to.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,360
So why should the exponent here be if we want the results to be equal to 8.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,660
So we're looking for this exponent right here.

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,140
We already know it's three.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:51,070
But what if we didn't know and we wanted to find what this exponent of two should be.

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,730
So that to elevate it to this exponent equals eight.

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,040
This is the question that logarithms answer.

25
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,230
You have a base you have a result you want to know what the exponent of the base should be so that you

26
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,860
get to the final result.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,050
So let's go into the definition of a logarithm.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,890
All right so here we have a formal definition of logarithms.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,240
So we have that the logarithm of X was base a is the number two which you need to exponentiate a to

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,210
get to X.

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,370
That is a tongue twister right.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,140
Let's repeat that again.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,550
The logarithm of x with pace A is the number to which you need to exponentiate a to get to X.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,350
So think of it like this.

35
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:51,630
Logarithms always have a base OCHA this case we're saying that the base is a.

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,130
And remember this when you're asked to find a logarithm.

37
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:03,080
You're being asked to find an exponent because we're saying what is a number so that when you put it

38
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:11,020
as an exponent of a is going to give you X and let's do one example so that it makes more sense.

39
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,680
Now before we get into the example let me show you the notation for a logarithm.

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,080
So it looks like this you have the word logi right for log.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,610
That is for logarithm here.

42
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,580
Very small.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,500
You have the base

44
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:43,290
and next to a log you have the results.

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,890
So this says let's find a number so that when you take the base and you exponentiate it to this number

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,550
you get the result.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,630
So the generic function for logarithm is y equals log.

49
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,070
Then we have the base really small down here which we set is a

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,149
and here we're going to have x that is our final results.

51
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,019
Y equals log of x with base a.

52
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,530
All right.

53
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,350
So the base is down here.

54
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,480
This is probably not making any sense at all.

55
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,620
So let's go over a couple of examples.

56
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,360
So

57
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:52,160
for example if I say log of base 2 of 8 What are we saying we're saying to which number do we need to

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,930
raise this to.

59
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,870
So what should be the exponent of this too.

60
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,500
If we want the result to be eight's but we know this already right.

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:10,180
Because two to three equals two times two times two which is eight right.

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,410
So the answer to this logarithm is simply three.

63
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:25,960
I hope you see why again two to three equals eight.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,010
I told you when you're finding logarithms all you're finding is exponents.

65
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:38,680
Here we found the exponents so that the based elevated to this exponent gives you this result.

66
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,640
Let's do another one.

67
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
So log of Base Three

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,780
twenty seven.

69
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:04,180
So we're asking to which number do we need to exponentiate 3 to get the results 27.

70
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:16,480
So in other words 3 to the watt equals 27 Well let's see three times three is nine times three again

71
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,020
is 27.

72
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,320
So three 2 3 equals 27.

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:36,070
Therefore the log of 27 with Page 3 is equal to 3 because again three to the three right is 27

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,110
let's do yet one more example.

75
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,970
All right so another logarithm logarithm of a thousand with pays 10.

76
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:13,100
So we are asking to which number do you need to raise this 10 to get to 1000.

77
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:22,960
In other words tend to the what equals 1000.

78
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,770
By the way when I use this square over here it's just a placeholder.

79
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,230
Right.

80
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,390
It's because we're trying to find this number this exponent over here.

81
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,180
So we're looking for a number so that an exponentiate add to that number gives us a thousand.

82
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,660
What could this number be.

83
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:47,640
Well let's see ten times ten is a hundred times ten again is what is a thousand.

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,240
So if you multiply 10 by itself three times you get a thousand.

85
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,410
Therefore the exponent here is at three.

86
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,210
And the answer is also with three.

87
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,030
Now I gave you three examples and in all these examples the answer is three.

88
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,680
All right.

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,360
Because this pace to the third power equals what's in parentheses for each of these three.

90
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,600
Actually let's do one more where the answer is not three.

91
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,630
So let's do

92
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,590
here we have a log of 25 with base 5.

93
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:43,620
So again we're asking to which number do we need to exponentiate the base to get to 25.

94
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,520
This is an easy one

95
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,670
five to one equals 25.

96
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,350
Well five squared right.

97
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
Five to the two.

98
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:05,450
Therefore our answer here is to because the base to the two equals 25.

99
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:05,830
All right.

100
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,990
So hopefully that's a little bit more clear.

101
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,240
Again just remember when you're asked to find a logarithm you're being asked to find an exponent for

102
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,840
the base of that logarithm so that when you raise the base to that exponents it's going to give you

103
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,860
this result.

104
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,370
And this is the function right here for a logarithm.

105
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,160
Now this still might be a little bit confusing.

106
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,370
So let's go into the manege so you can remember the basic structure of a logarithm.
