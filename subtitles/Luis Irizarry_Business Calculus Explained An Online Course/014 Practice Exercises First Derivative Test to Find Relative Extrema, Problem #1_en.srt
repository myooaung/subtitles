1
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,110
All right.

2
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,450
So let's go ahead and find the relative extrema for a couple of functions.

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,610
Now I want to remind you you need to use the first derivative test.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:39,350
The problems themselves only say find their relative extrema of f of x but the point is for you to use

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,990
the first derivative test there's another one called the second derivative test.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,870
But we haven't covered that yet.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,790
All right.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,860
So one more time to find all these relative extrema.

9
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,740
You'll be using the first derivative test.

10
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,200
All right.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,950
So let's go ahead and do a couple of relative extrema problems find the relative extrema for f of x

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,650
equals negative x squared plus 2.

13
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,930
So we need to find the relative maximum and the relative minimums.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,290
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:19,920
All right.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,150
So let's go ahead and do it together.

17
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,010
So remember we're finding relative extrema.

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,850
So the first step is finding the derivative for IVAX.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,600
So let's find a prime of x.

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,960
So we have a constant multiple which is negative one way to mark the one right.

21
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:54,790
So let's just keep the negative on the side and let's bring down a dictator which is to negative times

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,290
to remember again this is like negative 1.

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:06,940
So X and less powerful leader that's going to be a 1 so we don't market plus the derivative of two which

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,789
is zero because it's a constant.

25
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:17,060
So plus 0 equals negative times a positive is a negative.

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,460
So negative 2 x

27
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,850
and then the plus 0.

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,380
We don't market because well it's zero.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,960
All right let's go ahead and find the critical numbers for this derivative.

30
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,290
So remember of critical numbers.

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,580
Either make the derivative equal to zero or undefined because we do not have a bottom here.

32
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,810
We do not need to check for undefined.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,850
We're just going to set it equal to zero.

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:52,560
So we're only checking for negative 2 x equals zero right.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,230
So how do we solve for x.

36
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,400
Well we need to leave it by itself and it's being multiplied by this negative 2.

37
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,820
So we can divide by negative two on both sides.

38
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,450
It goes away here.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,750
So we only have X equals zero over negative 2 0.

40
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,890
So this is a critical number.

41
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:22,330
Now what we need to do is pick a test value to the left and to the right of the critical number and

42
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,840
see what the signs are.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,550
Let's do that over here.

44
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,890
And as always we draw our number line so 0 is here.

45
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,880
Let's pick easy values and negative one to the left.

46
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,440
And one to the right.

47
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,190
And again what we do is we take these two values and we plug them into the derivative.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,790
So prime of negative 1

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,300
derivative is negative to x.

50
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:08,190
So this will be negative to times negative 1 so negative times a negative is a positive and two times

51
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,720
one is to.

52
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,290
All right.

53
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,580
So it is positive to the left of the zero.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:26,000
So we market as positive to the left of our zero because for the negative one is and when we plug in

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,450
negative 1 into the derivative we get a positive number.

56
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,970
Great let's try now on the other side of the zero.

57
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,260
So to the right of 0 on by the way I've mentioned this before but I'll mention it again.

58
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,100
Remember that in this number line we go from smallest to largest.

59
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,220
So on the left you have the small numbers and on the right you have the larger numbers so the zeroes

60
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,940
on the middle on the left you have negative 1.

61
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,580
And on the right you have one you can put one here and negative one here.

62
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,090
All right.

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,950
It's always from less to more.

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,010
All right.

65
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,770
Great.

66
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:12,990
So let's test out the other value which is one and we'll plug it into the derivative so negative two

67
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,100
times one

68
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:29,830
negative times a positive is actually a negative and two times one is two so negative two.

69
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,350
That means that to the right of the zero we have a negative derivative.

70
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,420
All right.

71
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,520
So remember relative extrema can be either a men or a max.

72
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,420
And how do we know which ones which.

73
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,840
Remember we have a mnemonic for this.

74
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:54,170
The mnemonic says that we actually have to draw both a max and a min.

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,580
So this would be a max over here and the men over here.

76
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,650
And you can look at the sign of the slopes to the left and to the right of each one.

77
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,400
So if you had a line here and here and a line here and here.

78
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,100
So for all Maxxis to the left you have a positive slope because it's going up and to the right you have

79
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,750
a negative slope because it's going down for all men's.

80
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:28,300
You have a negative slope to the left because you're going down and you have a positive slope to the

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,600
right because you're going up.

82
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,370
So what do we have here.

83
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:40,910
We have positive on the left and negative on the right which looks like a max right.

84
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:50,200
Positive on the left positive here and negative on the right because you're going down.

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,290
So it turns out this is actually a max.

86
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,280
We have a max when X equals zero.

87
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:05,280
Now the only last tab that we need to do is to go ahead and get the y value for this Max.

88
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,960
We already have the x value which is zero.

89
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,670
Let's get the y value and to get the y value.

90
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:17,450
Remember we plug in the 0 not into the derivative but to the original function because we want to find

91
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:24,410
the relative extrema for the original plug in and zero into the derivative just tells you how it's changing

92
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,700
at that point.

93
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,720
And again we know that the answer if we plug in 0 into the derivative is zero.

94
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,030
Right.

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,360
Because that's how we got the 0 in the first place.

96
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,120
So let's go ahead and plug in the 0 into the original.

97
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,570
So we have half of zero by the way this is the mnemonic remember this or here.

98
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,380
So after 0 equals negative 0 squared

99
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,370
and then plus two

100
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,910
so zero squared is zero negative zero is also zero.

101
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,310
So we only have the two.

102
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:19,830
So we have our answer which is there's a max at 0 comma to

103
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,480
this is the relative extrema of the function.

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:34,720
We only have one relative extrema and it is a max and it's located at this point 0 2 and we are done

105
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,630
again.

106
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,559
That was a really easy problem because the function was pretty simple.

107
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:46,180
And again to find relative extrema all we do is we find the derivative we find the numbers that make

108
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,900
the derivative either zero or undefined.

109
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,370
And then we test to the left and to the right of those critical numbers.

110
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,550
So here we test that with negative 1 and 1.

111
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,340
Then we got the signs to the left and to the right of the 0 we classified based on our mnemonic because

112
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,610
in this case we had positive on the left negative on the right.

113
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,420
This is a max right.

114
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,770
Positive on the left and negative on the right.

115
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:21,090
Finally we plugged in the 0 into the original to get the corresponding y value for this Max.

116
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,040
And it turns out to be two.

117
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,070
So we have a max at 0 2 that's it.
