1
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,590
All right.

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,660
So let's go ahead and get started with the Prochnik rule.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,100
Let me remind you of what our mnemonic is.

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,930
So remember for the product rule we grab the first three letters of product.

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,230
So that's pro p r o.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:46,690
And this stands for place repeats.

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,800
And then our All right.

8
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,410
So if you do not remember what this is please go back to the mnemonic where we actually look at this

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,430
with an example just putting it here so you can give it a shot.

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,760
So remember place repeats just means they are going to take the multiplying functions write them and

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,340
then write them once more.

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,580
That's what placing the repeats means and then you're going to get the derivative of the outer.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,580
Right.

14
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,260
And again if you have no idea what I'm talking about please go back to the mnemonic.

15
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,600
Otherwise go ahead and pause the video and give this problem a shot.

16
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,340
All right so how did it go that one wasn't too bad was it.

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,210
Let's do it together.

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,180
So we have that we want to find the derivative of this function f of x.

19
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,310
We know that these are multiplying because there's nothing in between.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,570
And we're going to use our mnemonic.

21
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,100
So we're going to place our repeats.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,640
So we're going to put it once and then put it again this function.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,950
So it's going to be 10 x to the ninth

24
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,150
3 x squared.

25
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,970
Now we're going to place our second repeat.

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,250
So that's 10 x to the ninth

27
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,290
3 x squared.

28
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,970
So we're just copying this function twice.

29
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,480
That's it.

30
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,050
And then we have for the second part of the mnemonic that we take the derivative of the outer.

31
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:33,060
So remember we have this whole expression the outer is the first function and then the last function.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,620
These are the outer ones.

33
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:43,950
So we take the derivative of this first 10 x to the ninth and the derivative of this last three x squared

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,210
and then remember that for product rule we actually add in the middle.

35
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,750
All right.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,850
So we take the derivative of this over here 10 x square to the ninth.

37
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,640
So a constant multiple We have attended the beginning times Power Rules so we're bring down a dictator

38
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,090
nine x it by less powerful.

39
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,670
So that's eight on top.

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,930
We multiply this by this three x squared

41
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,050
and then we do plus bring down the 10 x to the ninth

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,730
and we multiply by the derivative of three x squared.

43
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,050
So that's a 3 constant multiple we bring down a dictator which is a two and substitute by less powerful.

44
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,060
It gives us a win over here.

45
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,790
So we don't market.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:54,510
All right now let's multiply coefficients so 10 times nine is 90 90 times 3 is 270.

47
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,010
And now let's deal with the axes.

48
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,260
So we have X to the eighth times x to the two.

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,530
So remember when you're multiplying access like this what you do is you keep the X and you add the exponents.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,570
So I'll just mark it here.

51
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,019
So you see how it's done.

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,740
It's X to the eight plus two.

53
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,730
We're just adding this exponents and this exponent right.

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,050
And then we do plus then we have this other side let's multiply coefficients as well.

55
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,670
So we have 10 times three is 30.

56
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,850
Thirty times two is 60

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
and let's deal with the Xs.

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,240
So we have X to the ninth and X remember this X is to the 1.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:58,110
So we have X to the nine plus one.

60
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,540
All right.

61
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:14,020
So we have to 70 X to the tenth plus 60 x to the 10th and remember what I've said before that if you

62
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,300
have the same base and the same exponents so extra the 10th and next to the tenth you keep the x to

63
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:31,700
the tenth and you just add the coefficients to 70 plus 60 is 330 X to the tenth.

64
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,890
That is our final answer.

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,050
All right.

66
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,390
So I've mentioned this before but I'll put it here again.

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:53,810
When you have for example x to the a times x to the B that's equal to x to the A plus B to remember

68
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,690
when you're multiplying X's like this you just add their exponents and you keep the X. You're going

69
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,190
to have to do this a lot with the product rule.

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,960
OK.

71
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,450
Just like we did here.

72
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,680
So for example here we're multiplying X to the 8 times x to the two that becomes X to the 8 plus 2 or

73
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,910
X to the tenth.

74
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,500
All right.

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,520
So this rule really comes in handy for a product rule problems.

76
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,780
And finally at this step we were able to combine this term and this term because they both have access

77
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,020
to the tenth.

78
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,840
So we just keep the x to the tens and we pretty much add the coefficients.

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,330
And that is our final answer.

80
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,580
All right so here we have our second example.

81
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,910
We know that these two functions are multiplying.

82
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:53,030
And as a whole f of x equals 2 x squared plus three times x to the fourth of minus 1.

83
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,170
So we know they're multiplying because of the parentheses.

84
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,340
So here you have your first function and here you have your second function.

85
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,890
Go ahead and use the pro mnemonic to find the derivative of fallbacks.

86
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,880
So go ahead and posit and take a shot.

87
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,560
All right.

88
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
So let's do this one here.

89
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,310
Derivative of f of x.

90
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,040
So we use our mnemonic Pro.

91
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,570
So we place repeats and then we do the derivative of the outer.

92
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,030
So let's place our repeats.

93
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,980
So we have the first repeat to x squared plus three

94
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,970
and x q.

95
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm sorry X to the fourth.

96
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:57,200
Minus one and then we have same thing 2 x squared plus three and x to the fourth.

97
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,200
Mine is one.

98
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,160
So that takes care of her place repeats part.

99
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,680
Now we do the derivative of the outer.

100
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,130
So we do the derivative of this one here.

101
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:17,510
And this one here hopefully at this point it's made sense why these two are the outer if it hasn't.

102
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,990
Well think of it like this.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,570
So if you have like like like a string like this the outer parts of the string are this and this right

104
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,490
like the extremes.

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:38,559
So when you look at this whole thing the way we have it the extremes are the first function and the

106
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,630
last function.

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,830
So that's why we say outer right.

108
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,150
Let's take this out.

109
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,060
Perfect.

110
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,860
And remember that we do plus for the product rule.

111
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,440
And I didn't put this as part of the mnemonic but if you forget which sign goes in the rule.

112
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,140
So the name tells you product plus.

113
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,690
OK.

114
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:10,060
So if you're have a product you're going to put a plus in between these two same letter P for product

115
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,580
B for a plus.

116
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,120
All right.

117
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,700
All right let's try to solve this one.

118
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,800
So we have the derivative of this one here.

119
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
What would that be.

120
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,100
Well we have some.

121
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,800
So we're going to have to get a derivative of the first and added to the derivative of the second derivative

122
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:39,550
of the first is just we have a constant multiple So that's it to bring down a dictator to X so to bail

123
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,780
as powerful leader.

124
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,140
That gives us a one on the X or we're not going to market plus the derivative of three a constant is

125
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,740
zero.

126
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,760
Times X to the fourth.

127
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,380
Minus one.

128
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,080
All right.

129
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:08,150
And then we have plus we're just going to copy this one so to x squared plus three and then the derivative

130
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,920
of this one over here.

131
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,590
So it's just the power function.

132
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,450
So we bringing down a dictator as a four X and we substitute by a less powerful one.

133
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,020
So that's going to give us three.

134
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,490
Then Mine is a derivative of 1 0.

135
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,540
So that is zero.

136
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,460
OK so there's zero goes away and this one too because they don't do anything at all.

137
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,890
And let's go ahead and simplify.

138
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,920
So we have 2 times 2 x 4 X

139
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:49,040
and we have 4 x times x to the fourth.

140
00:10:49,170 --> 00:11:04,960
Mine is one that is this part over here and then we do plus 2 x squared plus three right this time for

141
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:11,110
execute.

142
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,360
All right so after this you're just done with the calculus part.

143
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,200
It's all algebra from here.

144
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:26,010
So if you have for example this part this 4 x times the x to the fourth minus one remember distributive

145
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,710
property.

146
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,310
You just need to distribute this to this term and also to this term.

147
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,720
All right.

148
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,070
So you pretty much take this for X and you multiplied by this and then by this let's do that now for

149
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,540
X times x to the fourth.

150
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,520
So to do this we're first multiply coefficients.

151
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,450
So it's four times the coefficient of this one which is just one.

152
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,090
So that's four times one is for X..

153
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,000
And remember that we add exponents when we multiply stuff like this.

154
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:12,300
So X to the one times x to the fourth is X to the one plus for so we'll do it step by step.

155
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,720
All right.

156
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,980
So we multiplied this one times this one.

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,050
Now let's multiply the 4 X times the negative one.

158
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,880
So we have positive times and negative.

159
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,060
That gives you a negative and 4 x times 1 is just 4 x 8

160
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,780
plus.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
And we're going to do the same process here.

162
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,550
There's 4 x cubed is going to multiply this one here.

163
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,790
And it's also going to multiply.

164
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,860
This one here.

165
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,620
All right so let's multiply that to x squared times a 4 x cube.

166
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:56,460
So we have first the coefficients two times for eights and then we have the axes which we add exponents

167
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:06,200
for x squared times x cubed is X to that two plus three.

168
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,590
All right.

169
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,190
We're just adding the exponents.

170
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,060
There's one here and this one here.

171
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,690
And finally we're almost there.

172
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,620
We have plus because a positive times a positive is a positive.

173
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,790
So we have three times four execute.

174
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:28,610
So three times four is twelve and we just keep the x cubed.

175
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,470
All right.

176
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,010
All right.

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,390
Now let's simplify this a little more.

178
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,530
So we have 4 x and this x is elevated to the Rumple's four.

179
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,060
So that's 4 x to the five.

180
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,620
Mine is 4 x

181
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,430
that we have plus 8 x 2 the 2 plus 3.

182
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:03,230
So applause 8 x 2 the 2 plus 3 is just the five.

183
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,640
And then we have plus 12 execute.

184
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,770
All right last step of this is to go ahead and simplify.

185
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,630
So remember we can only simplify the ones that have the same exponent.

186
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,910
The only ones that have the same exponent are 4 x the 5 and 8 x to the 5.

187
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,790
So we're going to simplify those two.

188
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:38,300
And remember when we're adding them up which is pretty much keep the x to the five and we add the coefficients

189
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,070
for plus 8 is 12 x to the 5.

190
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,240
And then we have plus 12 x cubed

191
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,240
and then we have minus 4 x.

192
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,030
So maybe you notice that I switched the order of the 12 x cube and the 4 x.

193
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,330
So the 4 x was first and then the 12 x cubed was last.

194
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,600
It's typical practice to put them in descending order.

195
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,370
So from the highest exponent to the lowest.

196
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,330
Really doesn't matter.

197
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,380
At the end of the day your answer is not going to change is going to be the same but it's something

198
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
that's typically done.

199
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,980
So here we have the highest power on the left than the second highest and then the third highest which

200
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,990
is just one all right.

201
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,230
And at this point we have our final answer.

202
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,380
I know you're thinking Prato rule problems can get kind of long.

203
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,420
This is one of them.

204
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,210
It happens sometimes you just gotta make sure that you know exactly what you're doing with the exponents

205
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,800
and the coefficients and you'll be OK.

206
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,150
So what we did here with these two terms is we actually simplified the 4 x to the 5 and the 8 x to the

207
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,700
5 because they have the same exponent.

208
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:03,630
So remember one thing is when we're multiplying exponents at that point you add the exponents.

209
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,190
Here are not multiplying.

210
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,180
We're adding two terms with the same exponents.

211
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:17,020
So we keep the x to the 5 and we just add the coefficients for an 8 which gives you 12.

212
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,570
All right that's it for this exercise.

213
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,480
Let's do another one.
