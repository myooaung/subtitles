00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.160
All right so let's do a couple of exercises on one side it limits so it says find the following one

2
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.560
sided limits and determine if the limit in general exists.

3
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
So here we have what we call a piecewise function.

4
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.410
And I forgot my arrow here.

5
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.540
All right.

6
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.180
So this is a function that's composed of other functions.

7
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.700
So for example when the inputs less than negative four we have this pink function between negative 4

8
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.010
and a 1.

9
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.400
We have this blue function and to the right of one.

10
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.540
So for numbers greater than 1 we have this green function.

11
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.730
So again it's all one function but within that big function f of x we have different functions for different

12
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.170
templates.

13
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.960
So go ahead and draw this the best that you can and write all these limits and then try to find them.

14
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.320
So I'll give you some time to pause the video and try it out.

15
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.160
All right so let's see what we have here.

16
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.880
First of all we have a limit of f of x as x approaches negative 4 from the left.

17
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490
So negative fours over here.

18
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.430
So as we approach it from the left so we go right we go right we go right.

19
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.540
And it looks like the y value is going to be 2 right.

20
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.440
And again let me remind you it doesn't matter that the y value is not to actually there but the fact

21
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.790
that it is approaching it.

22
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.860
So looks like it's going to be two.

23
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.340
All right.

24
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
Now we have a limit of f of x x approaches negative 4.

25
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.699
But this time from the right.

26
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.130
So again negative fours over here.

27
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.720
So if we approach it from the right it looks like the y value is going to be on by the way let's say

28
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.880
that this is seven.

29
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.260
So it looks like the y value is going to be 7.

30
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.450
All right so negative four from the right is seven.

31
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.820
Now as you can see the limit as we approach negative four from the left is two.

32
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.010
And as we approach negative four from the right is seven.

33
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.010
So the limit as x approaches the same number from the left and the right they are different if they

34
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.060
are different that means that the limit of f of x x approaches negative 4 in general does not exist.

35
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.320
Remember that for a limit to exist the limit from the left must equal the limit from the right all right

36
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.160
let's move on to the other ones limit of f of x x x approaches one from the left.

37
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.660
So we look for one.

38
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.010
One is over here.

39
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.630
So let's approach it from the left and we have as we approach it from the left it looks like the y value

40
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.430
is going to be three.

41
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.890
All right let's keep going.

42
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.760
And we have a limit of 5 x x approaches one from the right.

43
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.830
So again ones over here and let's approach it from the right.

44
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.800
So we get closer we get closer.

45
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.960
It looks like the y value is going to be negative 3.

46
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.460
All right.

47
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.640
So this is negative 3.

48
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.640
And we have the same thing.

49
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.800
So I say x approaches one from the left is 3 x approaches one from the right.

50
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.280
It's negative 3.

51
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.970
So as you approach the number from the left turn right the limits are different three is not negative

52
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.950
3.

53
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:24.980
Therefore the general limit of f of x x x approaches 1 in general again does not exist because the limit

54
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.240
from the left is different than the limit from the right.

55
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.620
All right.

56
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.180
And we have one last limit over here.

57
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.790
Limit of f of x.

58
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.190
X approaches 6 in general.

59
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.890
So here we have it in general.

60
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.720
That means that we need to check if the one from the left is equal to the one from the right so as x

61
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.190
approaches 6 6 is over here.

62
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.530
Let's approach it first from the left so to say The point is around here.

63
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.860
So as we approach it from the left it looks like the y value is going to be 5.

64
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.790
OK.

65
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.010
Now let's approach it from the right.

66
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.820
So again 6 is over here.

67
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.020
And as we approach it from the right it also looks like the y value is going to be 5.

68
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.270
So the limit from the left as x approaches 6 is 5 and the limit from the right as x approaches 6 is

69
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.860
also 5.

70
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.070
That means that the limit from the left and the right are equal and therefore the limit exist and the

71
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.830
limit is five.

72
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.460
All right.

73
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.620
This is the only example here where the limit actually exists.

74
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.800
So that is it.

75
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.380
Remember if the limit from the left is different than the one from the right as x approaches a certain

76
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.600
number then the limit in general as x approaches that number does not exist for it to exist.

77
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.270
The limit from the left must be equal to the limit from the right.
