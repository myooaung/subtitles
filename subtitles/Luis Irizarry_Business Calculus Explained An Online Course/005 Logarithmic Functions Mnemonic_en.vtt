00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.510
All right.

2
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.810
So here we have a really cool and quick mnemonic.

3
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.110
Just remember how logarithms are structured.

4
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.900
So remember that I said that a logarithm is the word log.

5
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.040
EHLO G.

6
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.600
Then you have the base next to it.

7
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.800
Really small here on the bottom.

8
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.040
And then you have the results.

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.930
All right.

10
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.080
So log base results Albi our.

11
00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:04.150
And then to remember this Elby are I came up with this phrase let's be real Al for a let's B for A B

12
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.550
R for real.

13
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.060
All right.

14
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.790
This is it.

15
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.510
Let's be real Let's be real help here remember this structured log base result.

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.520
So going back to the example that we had let's say that we have log of 8

17
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.400
base 2.

18
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.190
All right.

19
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.740
So we're looking for a number so that when you elevate this to to that number then you're going to get

20
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.620
8 and let's identify each part.

21
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:48.950
So let's be real.

22
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.320
All right.

23
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.740
So the L is the lock.

24
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.420
This doesn't change.

25
00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:01.680
So this is just log the B for be real is the base and the base here is to

26
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.680
and then the real.

27
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.620
So the R corresponds to those results 8.

28
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.970
That is what you want to get when you exponentiate your base to the number that you're looking for your

29
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.020
logarithm.

30
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.140
So resolved is 8.

31
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.700
All right.

32
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.020
And that is Elby are so log Beys results from left to right is.

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.190
Let's be real.

34
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.140
Let's do another quick example.

35
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.950
So if we have same example as we did before laga of 27 and by the way the parentheses for the result

36
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.900
are optional.

37
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.030
I like to use them.

38
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.220
Let's do one without.

39
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.520
In case you see that in your class as well.

40
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.220
All right.

41
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.270
So a log of 27 with base 3.

42
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.700
So we're looking for a number so that when you exponentiate 3 to that number it gives you 27.

43
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.300
And by the way the results for the first ones we said was three right.

44
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.970
Because two to the three equals eight.

45
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.760
All right so let's first identify the Elby are by the way when you're doing a problem you don't really

46
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.840
need to identify which ones which.

47
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.150
This is just for you to remember how to write it down.

48
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.430
So the L is the log.

49
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.720
What is the base the base is this three down here.

50
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.050
And the result is this 27.

51
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.980
All right.

52
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.860
So what is a logarithm of 27 with base 3.

53
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.630
It is three because again like we said before three to three equals 27.

54
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.980
All right.

55
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.640
Perfect.

56
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.680
So again just a quick mnemonic in case you get confused.

57
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.310
Oh which ones the base which was the results.

58
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.690
Just think about let's be real.

59
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.470
Log pays results.

60
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.100
We are let's be real.
