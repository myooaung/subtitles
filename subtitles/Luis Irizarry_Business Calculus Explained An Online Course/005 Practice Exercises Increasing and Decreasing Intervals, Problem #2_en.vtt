00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.090
All right so here we have our second problem for intervals of increase and decrease.

2
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.380
So find the intervals of increase and decrease for f of x equals x squared over X minus 1.

3
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.330
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

4
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.840
All right so let's go ahead and do it together.

5
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.370
So the first thing you'll notice is that we are actually dividing two functions.

6
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.770
We have x squared over X minus one.

7
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.220
So when you have this you need to use the quotient rule.

8
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.690
So first step to find the intervals of increase and decrease is to find the derivative of f of x.

9
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.480
SO derivative of f of x and let's apply the quotient rule.

10
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.020
Remember that's pro minus the B.S. That's than a Monnick that we use.

11
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.120
So we place our repeats.

12
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.930
We have x squared times X minus one and we place it again.

13
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.690
X squared times X minus 1.

14
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.650
So that's a PR place repeats.

15
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.840
Now we're going to do the 0 for pro and that is the derivatives of the outer functions.

16
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.410
So the derivative here and the derivative here finally we have the other part which is minus and then

17
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.090
B-S is bottom squared.

18
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.080
So that's going to be X minus 1 to the second power.

19
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.270
Let's go ahead and find the derivatives.

20
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.830
So we have derivative of x squared.

21
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.230
We just bring down a dictator to and X and then we substitute a less powerful leader.

22
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.200
That gives us a 1 in the exponent.

23
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.040
So we don't market.

24
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.290
So that's 2 x times X minus 1.

25
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.100
Mine is x squared.

26
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.580
Times a derivative of X minus 1.

27
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.880
So again remember the derivative of X is just one.

28
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:39.960
Because when we bring down our dictator it's a one times substitute less powerful leader.

29
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:52.980
X 2 0 is just one and then minus the derivative of one is simply zero sum minus zero like this.

30
00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.960
And we divide again over X Minus One squared.

31
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170
Let's go ahead and distribute.

32
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.210
So remember this 2 x goes here and goes here.

33
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.410
So two x times x.

34
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.520
Remember that when we multiply axes we add the exponents so X to 1 times x 2 the 1 is X to the two and

35
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:33.890
don't forget the two so two x times X is 2 x to the second power and then 2 x times negative 1 is minus

36
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:42.860
2 x and then on this side we have 1 times one is 1 minus zero is 1.

37
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.320
So it's this whole thing is 1 times x squared is just x squared.

38
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.640
So we had a minus here.

39
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.110
Mine is x squared.

40
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.260
Everything over X minus 1 squared.

41
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.510
And then finally simplify.

42
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.090
We have two terms that have x squared.

43
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.960
We have this one and we have this one.

44
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.440
So what we do is we keep the x squared and we work with the coefficients.

45
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.269
So it's two minus one.

46
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.920
Remember if nothing's there.

47
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.010
It's a 1.

48
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.960
So two minus one is choose 1.

49
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.090
So that means that we get X quid.

50
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.080
Let me repeat that again 2 x squared minus X squared is x squared right.

51
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.650
And then we had minus 2 x

52
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.950
everything over X minus 1 squared.

53
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.590
All right.

54
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.510
That was step 1.

55
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.860
Now for step 2

56
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.780
remember that what we need to do is find values that make this derivative equal to zero or undefined.

57
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.160
In this case because we have a fraction the numbers that make it equal to zero are the ones that make

58
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.750
the top equal to zero.

59
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.590
And the numbers that make it undefined are the ones that make the bottom equal to zero.

60
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.020
So topical to zero whole thing equals zero bottom equal to zero.

61
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.210
Whole thing is undefined.

62
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.120
So let's set both the top and the bottom equal to zero to find the numbers that make this derivative

63
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.480
equal to zero and undefined.

64
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:41.700
So starting with the top so that's x squared minus 2 x equal to zero

65
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.970
and just we don't forget let's grab this bottom and set it equal to zero as well.

66
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.870
So we'll do that here.

67
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.140
X minus 1 squared equals zero.

68
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.570
All right.

69
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.010
So starting with this one is this equal to zero.

70
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.380
Well it's not exactly clear just by looking at it.

71
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.530
So let's try and factor what is common to these two terms.

72
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.730
Is it that two.

73
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.730
Not really because this one doesn't have to multiplying and has it in the exponent but not multiplying.

74
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.200
So what these two have in common is one X right.

75
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.330
Because this one has x twice and this one has X once but we can take the X from both ends.

76
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:43.550
So we've factored out and if we took out one X from here what do we have left the other X and we took

77
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.930
out one X from here.

78
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.560
We only have the two.

79
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:53.600
So that's minus two.

80
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.020
All right.

81
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.660
So remember this needs to be equal to zero.

82
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.880
Remember that when things are multiplying.

83
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.860
If one of them is equal to zero then the whole thing is equal to zero.

84
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.160
So if this is zero or if this is zero the whole thing is going to be equal to zero.

85
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.140
So just by looking at it if we set X equal to zero then the whole thing is going to be equal to zero.

86
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.000
That means that one of our critical numbers is going to be zero itself.

87
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I'll put these here zero.

88
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.590
So when is this one equal to zero x minus 2.

89
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.030
Well we can solve for that.

90
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.740
And let me separate these two because remember this is the top being equal to zero.

91
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.340
And this is the bottom being equal to zero.

92
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.490
So let's find that out X minus 2 is equal to zero.

93
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.920
You maybe know the answer already because it's obvious but I like to do it step by step and we add to

94
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.360
them both sides.

95
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.420
Cancels out here and we have bring down the x x equals zero plus two equals two.

96
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.690
So this is zero when X equals 2.

97
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.360
And it makes sense because two minus two is zero.

98
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:25.270
So our second critical number is two Finally let's find out when the functions defined.

99
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.050
In other words when the bottom is equal to zero which is what we have here.

100
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.360
So I mean think about it.

101
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.380
One is this equals zero.

102
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.690
So remember what we have is X minus 1 squared.

103
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.370
So that's X minus 1 times X minus 1.

104
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.460
Y is x minus 1 equal to zero.

105
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.520
Well obviously we could do the same process that we did here you know X minus 1 equal to zero.

106
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.470
Move the one to the other side etc..

107
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:59.250
But just by looking at it we can tell that this is zero when X equals 1.

108
00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.840
Why.

109
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:07.020
Because if you plug in one here you're going to get one minus one that's going to give you zero and

110
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.330
zero squared is zero.

111
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.400
All right.

112
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.810
So this is 0 when X equals 1.

113
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.400
That means that our third critical number is 1.

114
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.050
So we have 3 0 2 and 1.

115
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:33.730
Now we have this we go to our third step which you remember is just pretty much classifying the intervals

116
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.410
for either increase or decrease.

117
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.620
And we do that using test values.

118
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:47.630
So again we just go back to our number line that we love so much this one here and we plug in the numbers

119
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.730
in ascending order.

120
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.200
Remember like I said before if you go to the left they get smaller.

121
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.580
And if you go to the right they get bigger.

122
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:12.090
So we have zero to 1 but if we order them from smallest to biggest they would be zero 1 and 2.

123
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:23.450
So we need to find test values to the left of 0 between 0 and 1 between 1 and 2 and greater than 2 to

124
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.560
the right of two.

125
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.640
All right.

126
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:33.290
So to the left of 0 Let's pick negative 1 between 0 and 1.

127
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.450
Let's pick 0.5

128
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.960
between 1 and 2.

129
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.990
Let's pick 1.5

130
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.150
and greater than two.

131
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.080
Let's pick three.

132
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.670
All right.

133
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:57.750
So we have four test values that we need to plug into the first derivative and find out what the sign

134
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.290
is.

135
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.740
So let's go ahead and do this.

136
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:07.570
Let's plug in negative 1 so prime of negative 1.

137
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.960
So the first derivative is here.

138
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.400
So let's go ahead and plug in negative 1.

139
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:31.470
So we have negative 1 squared minus two times negative on over negative 1 minus ones squared and negative

140
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.030
1 squared is one.

141
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.260
Then we have negative two times and negative 1.

142
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:48.470
So negative times a negative is a positive and one times two is just to over negative one minus one.

143
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.420
So if you owe one daughter and then you spend one more you owe $2.

144
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.240
So this is negative too but it's squared because it's squared.

145
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.690
Negative 2 squared is negative times a negative it becomes a positive.

146
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.490
And two attempts two is four.

147
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.410
So this becomes for and or answer is three over four.

148
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.520
All right.

149
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.390
This is a positive number.

150
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:22.330
That means that to the left of 0 we have a positive derivative.

151
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.330
All right let's keep going.

152
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.260
Let's plug in

153
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.870
0.5.

154
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.750
And of course I'm going to run out of space.

155
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.090
So 0.5

156
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:47.930
plugged into this derivative that's going to give us 0.5 squared.

157
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:54.710
Mine is two times zero point five.

158
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.120
That's over

159
00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.940
0.5 minus 1 squared.

160
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.600
Right.

161
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:15.160
So what is this 3.5 squared is point twenty five minus 2 times 0.5.

162
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:27.640
That's going to give you one and it's a negative sum minus one over 0.5 minus one is negative 0.5 negative

163
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.590
0.5 squared is points 25.

164
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:40.980
So that's a positive point twenty five and that is going to give us point twenty five minus one negative

165
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:54.460
points seventy five over points 25 the answer of point seventy five over 0.25 is actually three.

166
00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:00.910
You can try it in a calculator if you want and remember that because we have a negative over a positive

167
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.230
difference signs the answer is negative.

168
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:18.260
So we're this 0.5 is between the zero and the one we have a negative derivative.

169
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:18.710
All right.

170
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.790
And let's go to our third test value.

171
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.800
You know what since I'm running out of space I'll go ahead and take this out which if you're taking

172
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.920
notes you should have this already.

173
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.380
And if you didn't do the problem you should be taking notes.

174
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:40.120
Or if you did the problem and you see something different that I got versus what you got like maybe

175
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:47.000
you got negative to the left of 0 then you should be doing this problem again until you get it right.

176
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.960
All right so let me go ahead and take this out.

177
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.450
All right so let's try our third value which is 1.5

178
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.670
prime of 1.5

179
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.720
0 and of course let me write the derivative here.

180
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.660
So derivative

181
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:20.970
is x squared minus 2 x over X minus 1 squared.

182
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:26.900
All right so plug it in 1.5 into this derivative.

183
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:34.060
So that is 1.5 squared minus two times 1.5

184
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:45.340
over 1.5 minus one squared.

185
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:54.560
So if you try it on your calculator you'll see that 1.5 squared is two point twenty five minus two times

186
00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:05.730
a 1.5 is three to minus three over 1.5 minus one point five and point five squared.

187
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.570
We already know is points 25.

188
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:15.040
So two point twenty five minus three is negative points.

189
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.090
Seventy five

190
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:24.690
and this over points 25 is actually the same as this one.

191
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.630
See that.

192
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.880
So negative over a positive is a negative.

193
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.240
And point seventy five point twenty five is negative three.

194
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.960
So same value that we got for this one.

195
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.480
Therefore between 1 and 2 it's also negative see that.

196
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:52.530
And finally let's go to our last test points at Pryme of three that should be a lot easier.

197
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.750
So this blog entry into the derivative.

198
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.820
So we have three squared minus two times three

199
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.420
over three minus one squared.

200
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:16.430
So that gives us 3 squared which is nine minus two times three which is 6 three minus one is two and

201
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.180
two squared is four.

202
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.920
So that is nine minus six three over four which funny.

203
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.680
We got the same answer over here.

204
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.320
So three or four is positive.

205
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:38.520
So to the right of two we have positive derivative with this information we can get our intervals.

206
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.180
So to the left of 0 is positive derivative.

207
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.000
So it's increasing.

208
00:17:46.120 --> 00:18:01.800
So from negative infinity up to 0 it is increasing Well abbreviated like this then from 0 to 1 it is

209
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.470
decreasing but also from 1 to 2.

210
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:12.040
So we can just combine them together in one interval and say from zero to two.

211
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.740
Right.

212
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.800
Instead of saying zero to one and wanted to because the function is increasing in both of those we combined

213
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.760
them together into one and we say that the function is decreasing on that interval.

214
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:31.910
And then we have our last one which is to the right of two to the right of two is positive.

215
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.350
So from 2 to positive infinity

216
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.020
the original function is increasing

217
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.250
and that's it for this problem.

218
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:52.960
So the only difference between this problem and the other one is that in this problem we had a bottom.

219
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.150
So we also needed to set it equal to zero to find the intervals of increase and decrease every time

220
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.000
we have a fraction have a bottom.

221
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.210
And if you have a bottom you need to check when that bottom is equal to zero and use those test values

222
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.250
in your number line as well as the numbers that make the top equal to zero.

223
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:23.170
And we are done.

224
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:28.090
All right I'll see you in the next tutorial is.
