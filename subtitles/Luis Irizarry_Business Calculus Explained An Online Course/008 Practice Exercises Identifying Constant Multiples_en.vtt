00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.450
All right so let's jump right in to identifying constant multiples.

2
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.540
Remember again a constant multiple is simply a number that's in front of a function and it's multiplying

3
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.920
that function.

4
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.960
So identify the constant multiple for f of x equals 3 x squared.

5
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.650
Go ahead and pause the video and tell me what the constant multiple is.

6
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
I think in this case it's very easy.

7
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.960
The constant multiple is three because this three is multiplying the x squared.

8
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.440
All right.

9
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.280
So the constant multiple here is just a three right.

10
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.970
That is it.

11
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.540
All right.

12
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.540
So another exercise identify the constant multiple for f of x equals negative 5 x to the 11th.

13
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:24.540
All right so go ahead and pause the video and let me know the constant multiple is.

14
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.920
All right so this one should be pretty straightforward as well.

15
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.050
What number is multiplying the function x to the eleventh.

16
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.450
Well it's negative 5.

17
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.870
So the constant multiple is negative 5.

18
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.310
That's it.

19
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.340
By the way if you look at the term constant multiple constant just means that it doesn't change.

20
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.150
So it's a number and a multiple means that it's just multiplying.

21
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.330
Think of it like that.

22
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.090
So it's a constant That's multiplying the function.

23
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.580
All right.

24
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.940
So the last exercise says identify the constant multiple for half of X equals x to the fourth.

25
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.180
I'll give you a little hint.

26
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.210
It's kind of a trick question but go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

27
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.760
All right.

28
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.920
So f of x equals x to the fourth and we're identifying the constant multiple.

29
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.410
Maybe you said the constant multiple was zero because there's nothing here and that is a good guess.

30
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.490
However that is not the right answer.

31
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.250
Why.

32
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.600
Because if you said 0.

33
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.580
Think of it like this.

34
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.810
If 0 is a constant multiple and zeros multiplying X to the fourth then what is 0 times x to the fourth.

35
00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.140
It is zero and we don't want 0 we want x to the fourth So 0 cannot be the answer.

36
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.400
On the other hand there is a number that sometimes we do not mark.

37
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.330
We just assume that it's there.

38
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.060
And of course that number is 1.

39
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.990
So the constant multiple here is 1.

40
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.330
We don't market.

41
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.440
But it's there.

42
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.600
Why is it there.

43
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.710
Because 1 times x to the fourth is X and the fourth right

44
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.150
1 times.

45
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.100
Something else is always equal to that something else.

46
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.810
So constant multiple Here is one we don't really market.

47
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.090
And we actually pretend that it's not there.

48
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.200
All right we'll just have X to the fourth.

49
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.580
All right.

50
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.020
That's pretty much it for identifying constant multiples.

51
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.650
Again this is super easy.

52
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.170
Just look at the number that's multiplying the function and that's it.

53
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.810
Next we'll actually apply the constant multiple rule.
