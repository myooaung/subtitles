1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,340
All right so let's go ahead and do some problems for continuity.

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,189
So the first one says use the pencil test to determine if the following graphs are continuous everywhere.

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,300
And here we have six graphs of functions that you're going to use the pencil tests on.

4
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,210
So I'll let you do your thing.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,150
Go ahead and pause a video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,670
All right so were you able to use the pencil test or the chairman of the graphs are continuous.

7
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,400
Let's go ahead and do it together.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,500
So remember the pencil test tells you that if you can draw the graph without lifting your pencil then

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,110
yes the graph is continuous.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,790
If you have to lift your pencil then the graph is not continuous everywhere.

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,370
So let's start with the first one here.

12
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,200
So for this one it looks like there are no jumps no discontinuity just flows nicely.

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,850
Right.

14
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,820
So this one is continuous.

15
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,390
All right.

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,920
Getting to the second one it looks like that as we go up at some point we have to jump from this point

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,020
to this point.

18
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,500
So we have to let her pencil in order to keep drawing.

19
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:49,620
Therefore this second graph because of this jump is not continuous.

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,860
All right let's go to the third.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,150
So for this one let's start with this part.

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,060
So we go down and we go down and we go down but hey what happens here.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,420
Well it looks like to keep going with this part.

24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,470
We need to lift our pencil from here and then bring it all the way over here and then keep drawing.

25
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:21,790
So there's definitely some sort of jump in there and we can say that the graph is not continuous.

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,310
All right.

27
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,830
Next.

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:32,490
All right so this one is a tricky one because if you go ahead and do this and you started going up you

29
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:40,100
might think oh I can actually draw this circle and then keep going right without lifting my pencil.

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,660
But if we zoom into it what will notice is this behavior.

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,610
So I'm going to zoom in on this part.

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,810
Basically it's going to look like this.

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,750
And then remember that the open circle means that the graph is not defined for that points.

34
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,180
So at some point the graph stops here.

35
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,510
Then we have an empty value there.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,380
And then it jumps to this value.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,110
All right.

38
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,410
And then it keeps going.

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,960
So this is a zoom of this.

40
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,730
Remember that we use the open circle notation to say that there's no value there.

41
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,390
So when you start drawing it you might think oh yeah for sure I can just go around the circle and then

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,100
keep drawing.

43
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,790
But no this notation means that there's no value in there.

44
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,700
OK.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,120
That means that there is a small jump from this to this.

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,230
So you do have to lift your pencil.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:52,040
And this means that the graph is not continuous.

48
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,450
So again remember this open circle means that there is no value at that point.

49
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:05,270
So this x value whatever the x value here is is not part of the domain of the function.

50
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,090
All right.

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,140
And then let's do the last two.

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,920
So for this one seems pretty simple I just go like this and then I go up and sure enough I can draw

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,490
it with my left and my pencil.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,140
So this one is continuous

55
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,590
and then go into the last one.

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,410
So for this one it looks like there's no graph to the left over here.

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,830
But it doesn't matter if this is the graph then this is the graph.

58
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,540
And sure enough I can draw it without lifting my pencil.

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,910
Not a problem at all.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,520
So this one is also continuous.

61
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,800
And there we go.
