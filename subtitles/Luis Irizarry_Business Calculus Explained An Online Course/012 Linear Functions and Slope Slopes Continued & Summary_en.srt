1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,780
So let's do another example and let's find the slope of a different function.

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,110
Let's say we have the linear function

3
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,900
of x equals 3 X minus 2 and we want to find the slope of this function.

4
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,380
OK so let's use that formula.

5
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,000
Slow

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,970
equals.

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,170
But wait we don't have the points yet.

8
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,090
So let's get are two points so we can actually plug them into the slope.

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,620
I'll do this on the right.

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,290
So again I expect easy numbers.

11
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,470
Let's plug in one into this function.

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:16,090
So three times 1 is 3 minus 2 is 1 and lets plug in to

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,020
it three times two is six minus 2 is for.

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,790
So we have 2 points 1 1 and 2 4.

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,720
OK.

16
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:40,080
So let's call this point 1 over here and let's call this point to remember formula is why to mine is

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,830
why one over X to minus x 1 so the y value of the second point is four

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,950
minus the y value of the first point which is 1

19
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,860
everything over the x value of the second point which is to

20
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,090
mine is the x value of the first point which is 1

21
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:22,020
for minus one is 3 to minus 1 is one right over run your slope is 3

22
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,460
right.

23
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,020
Perfect.

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:41,450
By now you might have noticed something for the function f of x equals 5 x this globe was five for the

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,310
function 3 X minus 2 the slope is three.

26
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,990
It kind of looks like the number multiplying the X is actually the slope.

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,820
It turns out it is.

28
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:07,680
Do you remember how we have this equals AirMax plus B It turns out that M is the slope of the function.

29
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,840
This m this number multiplying the X is the slope.

30
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,550
So if I give you this function f of x equals 5 x you know that without plugging in any numbers that

31
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,710
the slope is 5.

32
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,030
If I give you this function f of x equals 3 x minus 2 and it's in this form then you know that the slope

33
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,860
is 3.

34
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,900
You don't really need to plug in anything here.

35
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,700
Sometimes you'll be asked to do this depending on what type of problem or what type of function you

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,960
get because you don't always get it in this form.

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:45,480
We call them exploit speak but if you do get it in this form the slope is always going to be M which

38
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,380
is a number multiplying the X.

39
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:56,910
So again for 5 x the slope is five and for the function 3 x minus 2 the slope is three because three

40
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,140
is a number multiplied the X and here five is the number of multiplying the X..

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,990
All right.

42
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,740
So just to finish up equals slope

43
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,579
OK so let's cover it one more thing about slopes.

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:31,000
So for example what if you have the function y equals negative 3 x plus 4.

45
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,400
So we just said that the number of multiplying the x is a slope.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,250
Right.

47
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:42,440
So the slope of this function I remember we can use for slope because in the in the equation that we

48
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,860
have.

49
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,120
Y equals and max plus B.

50
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,090
This is a slope to what we use and slope then we know right away just by looking at this that the slope

51
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,590
of this function is negative 3.

52
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,190
But wait.

53
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,860
Can the slope be negative or slopes only we're positive.

54
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,540
Well no they actually can be negative.

55
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,490
Let's try to grab this function.

56
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,290
So let's pick quickly.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,840
Couple values here.

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,090
In fact we only need two.

59
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:26,300
So what happens when we plug in on so negative 3 times 1 is negative 3 negative three plus four.

60
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,480
I'll write it down.

61
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:40,560
Times 1 plus four which is negative three plus four which is equal to 1 and again an easy number let's

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,970
pick zero.

63
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:53,690
It's negative three times zero pull us for negative three times zero cancels out and we have just four

64
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,340
so we have two points 1 1

65
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
and 0 for

66
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,760
let's try and grab this.

67
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,560
See what we get.

68
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,940
So first we have a point one one.

69
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,230
So that means it's one to the right and one up.

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,730
So about here and we have another point which is 0 4.

71
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,040
So the Xs 0 would move left or right we just go up by 4.

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,500
So this is one for would be around here.

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:48,720
All right let's draw a graph.

74
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:55,330
This is interesting because this graph is actually going down as you move from left to right instead

75
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,960
of going up like the other ones we've seen which kind of look like this.

76
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,170
Right.

77
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,020
Or maybe something like this.

78
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,860
This one is just going down.

79
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,930
So this is an example of a negative slope.

80
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,460
So it's a negative Rice overrun basically means.

81
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,960
And by the way we know that the slope is negative 3.

82
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,070
So let's see how that plays out.

83
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,530
If you start here for every unit you move to the right instead of going up you're going down.

84
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,350
So one to the right one two three down one to the right.

85
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,120
One two three down one to the right.

86
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,910
One two three down etc. etc..

87
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:46,500
So the difference between a positive slope and a negative slope is that as you move to the right in

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,130
a positive slope like these two you go up.

89
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,840
So move to the right move up move to the right move up.

90
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,060
Same thing for this one.

91
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:02,420
Move to the right move up move to the right move up etc. in the negative slope you actually go down

92
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,060
as you move to the right.

93
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,940
So you move to the right go down move to the right go down etc. etc..

94
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,450
So yes it is totally possible to have a negative slope.

95
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,290
And this is an example of it and we'll do a couple more examples in the problem section.

96
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:26,280
For now let's go to our summary for the linear functions and slopes section.

97
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,150
All right so going to a quick summary of what we just covered linear functions are in the form y equals

98
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,429
m exploits B.

99
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,539
This is called the slope intercept form.

100
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,390
Not sure if I mentioned that before.

101
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:46,540
So there you have it this y equals m Expos B is called the slope intercept form and is a slope as we

102
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:57,180
said this over here represents the slope of the graph of this function the mnemonic for y equals m expletive

103
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,560
p.

104
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,980
So you can actually remember this is why Mexico abro the graphs of linear functions are always straight

105
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,710
lines.

106
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,340
You only need two points to graph a line.

107
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,000
And again the way to remember that the graphs of linear functions are always straight lines.

108
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,990
Just go to the name

109
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Lynnie or this is the line right here.

110
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,420
OK.

111
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,710
Slope is a measure of the inclination of a line.

112
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:36,900
So how steep the line is which actually measures the rate of change of the function represented by the

113
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,970
line.

114
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,430
So again you have a function the graph of that function as a line the slope of that line measures how

115
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,590
the function is changing and the slope could be positive.

116
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,030
Or it could be negative linear functions have a constant rate of change.

117
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,870
So again going back to the lemonade example if I sell five lemonades per hour I'm not selling more than

118
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,230
five or less than five.

119
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,210
It's always going to be five therefore my rate of change is always constant it's always five.

120
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,780
So it never changes given two points in a line you can use a slow formula to the trim and the slope.

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:27,790
So if you're only given two points and no equation which again stands for slope y to minors is one over

122
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,090
X to mine is x 1.

123
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,200
So you just pick one of the points to be point number one.

124
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,770
The other one is point number two and just plug in a way.

125
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,290
Remember the answer can be positive or it can actually be negative as well.

126
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,700
A function in the form of X equals C where season number is a constant function.

127
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:56,110
Notice that there is no m x which is have the number here and constant functions have a slope of zero

128
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,410
because there is no rise again.

129
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,970
There is no number of multiplying the X.

130
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,510
So that's all 0 and the function is always at the same height because it doesn't matter what you plug

131
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,470
in for the function it's always going to give you the same Y.

132
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,730
Therefore it's going up or it's going down.

133
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,290
All right.

134
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,460
I know we covered a lot in this section but I'll give you some problems for you to work for and I'll

135
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,670
see you in the next tutorial.
