1
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,210
So basically what you have is this X minus five within the square root.

2
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,600
And remember this X minus 5 cannot be negative.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,910
So if we do X minus 5 and it has to be greater than or equal to zero.

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,080
What we can do here is we can solve for x.

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,950
All right so let's add five on both sides.

6
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:03,020
It's negative five plus five cancels out and we have x is greater than or equal to zero plus five is

7
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,070
five.

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,320
So what we did here was we said OK we want X minus 5 to always be greater than or equal to zero.

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,870
So we solve for x.

10
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,560
So we leave the x by itself on one side and we move the number to the other side and we get that x is

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,850
greater than or equal to 5.

12
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,600
Believe it or not this is our domain.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,650
Well how do we know that this is our domain.

14
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:42,600
Remember the domain is anything that will make this under the square root to be 0 or greater.

15
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:51,640
So any number that's 5 or greater It's OK to plug in because it makes whatever's under the square root

16
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,490
is 0 or greater.

17
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,080
So notice that doesn't matter which number you pick from here x is greater than or equal to 5.

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,840
It's never going to give you a negative number under the square root.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,500
So if you pick a number that's in this domain x is greater than or equal to 5 you are in the clear because

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,940
any number will work.

21
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,950
Nothing will give you a negative number.

22
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,510
All right.

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,370
Let's do another quick example.

24
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:36,600
What is the domain of f of x equals the cube root of x.

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,710
So let's try plugging then you know maybe something like 27

26
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,250
3 and 27.

27
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:03,630
Remember cube root which is 3 cube root basically tells you which number you need to multiply by itself

28
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,290
three times in order to get 27.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,820
And that is number three because three times three is nine times three is twenty seven.

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,660
So the answer is three.

31
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,990
All right.

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,800
Now let's pick another interesting number to plug in.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:33,560
Negative 27.

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,890
So which number do you need to multiply by itself three times in order to get negative 27.

35
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,770
You might say oh I already know this.

36
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,430
You cannot get a number that's going to give you negative 27 will you multiplied by itself three times.

37
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,770
Well you actually can.

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,730
And what is the difference between this problem and the last problem.

39
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:08,650
The difference is the root the root here is three three is an odd roots.

40
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,170
OK so you have a problem with the roots even two four six eight ten etc..

41
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:30,540
When you have an odd rule which it could be 3 5 7 9 accepter all of a sudden it doesn't matter if you

42
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,800
have negative numbers down here.

43
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,870
Why.

44
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:44,340
Because what happens when you have three I'm sorry negative three times negative three times negative

45
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:51,890
three so negative three times negative three is positive nine right.

46
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,300
So positive nine times negative three.

47
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,500
I remember this is positive nine because negative times a negative equals a positive.

48
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,240
Then we have nine times negative three.

49
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,250
Remember that a positive times a negative is a negative.

50
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,990
And nine times 3:27

51
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,690
ha.

52
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,080
So that gives you negative 27.

53
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:27,420
That means that the answer to this problem is negative 3 because negative 3 to the third power are multiplied

54
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,720
by itself three times gives you negative 27.

55
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,550
Notice that this is completely different from when you haven't even root because even roots look like

56
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,230
this.

57
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:49,780
And again let's pick an example let's pick for let's say that it's negative 16.

58
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,660
You're looking for a number that multiplied by itself four times gives you a negative number.

59
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,810
But remember that does not exist because when you have numbers multiplying themselves in even groups

60
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,970
it's always going to be a positive.

61
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:20,500
So if you have two times two times two times two that gives you 16 not negative 16 but also if you have

62
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:29,340
negative two times and negative two times negative two times negative two.

63
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,170
So that's four times.

64
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,980
Here you have a positive because it's negative times a negative.

65
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,060
And here you have a positive because it's negative times and negative.

66
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,480
All right.

67
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,240
So when you multiply this positive by this positive it's going to give you positive 16.

68
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,280
This is why for this the answer is two imaginary.

69
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,850
However when you have the odd root you're good to go because when you multiply something by itself an

70
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,600
odd number of times.

71
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,970
In this case three.

72
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,740
Right you're multiplying these negative three three times.

73
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,140
In those cases you are good to go.

74
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,270
All right so going back to the other example when you haven't even roots you need to make sure that

75
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,040
whatever is under the root is zero or greater.

76
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,590
It cannot be negative.

77
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
Let me repeat that again.

78
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:36,950
If you're finding the domain of a function of the Hasn't even roots then you need to find numbers that

79
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,560
when you plug in X it's going to give you zero or greater under the root.

80
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,660
OK.

81
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,210
For odd roots it doesn't matter.

82
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,800
You can get actual answers that are not imaginary for even rudes it's different.

83
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,850
I know the concept is a little bit odd of you know imaginary numbers even rudes odd rudes if you need

84
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,990
to go back and listen to this part again I recommend you do it.

85
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,410
It's going to help you out a lot probably.

86
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,230
And you can just put me on you know faster speeds so you don't have to hear me talk all the time.

87
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
You know it's going to be quicker.

88
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,730
But if this did him if this didn't make a lot of sense I suggest you just play it again.

89
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,360
It's going to take five minutes of your life and it's going to help you out a lot with this concept.

90
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:42,510
So our third case for domains is practical applications.

91
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,310
So what does this mean.

92
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,960
So in the same way you would not put your glasses in your washing machine to clean them.

93
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,380
Sometimes it doesn't make sense to put certain numbers into functions because of what the function represents.

94
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,560
For example let's say that I own a lemonade stand next to my backyard I sell lemonade on the weekends

95
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,070
and each class cause $2.

96
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,640
Also let's say that my fixed costs are five daughters regardless of how many glasses I sell.

97
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,950
Then my profit function would be

98
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:29,680
of X equals to X because remember I make $2 for every lemonade I sell minus five because five is my

99
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,880
fixed cost and then X here is the number of lemony glasses that I sell.

100
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:44,140
This is my profit.

101
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,820
So if I sell

102
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,490
three glasses during the day it's going to give us two times three.

103
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,870
Mine is five times three six minus five is one.

104
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,340
So we sell three glasses a day that's going to give us a profit of one sad dollar.

105
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:17,420
But what if we sell 30 glasses in a day well it's going to be two times.

106
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,250
Thirty minus five so two times 30 is 60 minus five is 55.

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,840
All right.

108
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,070
Fifty four dollars a profit.

109
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,750
Not bad.

110
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,330
Now what if I sell.

111
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,890
Negative three

112
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,400
glasses of lemonade.

113
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,410
Does that make sense to you.

114
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,280
Can you really sell negative three glasses of lemonade.

115
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,230
It does not.

116
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,740
Of course neither does any negative number.

117
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,440
They try to plug in in the same way that I cannot sell negative three glasses of lemonade.

118
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,980
I cannot sell negative 10 glasses of lemonade or negative 200 glass of lemonade.

119
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:07,880
So I think it's pretty obvious here that whatever you input into this function needs to be zero or a

120
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,030
positive number.

121
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,140
It cannot be a negative number.

122
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:19,630
So this does work and I think by now you are noticing how problematic negative numbers can be if they're

123
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,020
under an even Rood's than they not part of your domain.

124
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,440
And sometimes you cannot plug them in into certain functions.

125
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,240
And one more thing for the purposes of this example assume that you're not selling you know half a glass

126
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,570
of lemonade or three quarters of a glass of lemonade.

127
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,420
Let's assume that is.

128
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,420
We cannot do.

129
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,300
We can only sell whole numbers.

130
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,470
So one glass eliminate two glasses of lemonade three glass of lemonade etc..

131
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,900
All right.

132
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,060
So because it doesn't make sense in real life to put negative numbers into my function the domain of

133
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,340
this profit function is all integers greater than or equal to zero.

134
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,200
All integers

135
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,750
greater than or equal to zero.

136
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,250
I remember integers were just put this year quickly

137
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:39,470
integers are just numbers like negative 3 negative to negative 1 0 1 2 3 etc etc..

138
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:47,550
So integers are all whole numbers and they include 0 that the domain is going to be all integers greater

139
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,140
than or equal to zero.

140
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:55,510
So that's 0 1 glass of lemonade two glasses of lemonade three glass of lemonade.

141
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,490
Etc. etc..

142
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:06,170
So one quick caveat about this is that in theory I could plug in you know five and a half.

143
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,860
So 5.5 into this function and it would work well.

144
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,650
However that's why I said let's assume that you cannot sell you know half a glass of lemonade.

145
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,210
One fourth of a glass of lemonade three quarters to just simplify the example.

146
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,670
OK.

147
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:29,070
That's why our domain is only integers or whole numbers because we're not selling lemonade by a less

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,150
than a glass.

149
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,510
We're selling it by the glass itself.

150
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:44,670
So in this case the domain is not all real numbers because we cannot sell for example 3.5 or four point

151
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:54,430
a glass of lemonade or you know twelve point three glass of lemonade etc. only selling fool glasses.

152
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,450
And that's why we have 1 2 3 etc etc..

153
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,630
OK.

154
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,410
So we covered our three cases of when the domain is not all real numbers.

155
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,170
Number one is when you have division by zero.

156
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,940
Number two is when you have a negative number under an even root.

157
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:24,050
And number three is when you have some sort of practical limitation because you're doing an actual application

158
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,690
in real life and it doesn't make sense to put certain numbers.

159
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,300
OK so it follows that a domain is the eggs values

160
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,930
then range is y values.

161
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,930
So the range of a function is the group of all y values that are possible for that function.

162
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,940
So for example if I have of X equals x plus three

163
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:07,840
and we have our table of values x and y.

164
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:17,660
So for example we plug in two we get two plus three that gives us 5.

165
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:29,060
So for the plug in of two we get a y of five to another one for the plug in of three we get three plus

166
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,780
three which is six.

167
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,950
So when we play in three we get six.

168
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:42,100
And as we saw this function f of x he goes x 3 does not have division by zero or does not have any even

169
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,570
roots or does not have any practical applications.

170
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,600
So is all real numbers for the domain.

171
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,510
If you can plug in all real numbers in the domain that means that your range is also or we are numbers.

172
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,440
Why is that.

173
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:07,380
Well think about it if you can plug in any number here for X then you can get any y value that you want.

174
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:15,010
For example if you want to get a y value of 10 just plug in seven if you want to get a y value of 23

175
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,830
just plug in 20 etc. etc..

176
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:25,650
So this right here all these y values the range is also equal to all real numbers.

177
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,240
Now finding range you're probably not going to be asked to find the range of a function.

178
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,170
You might but we'll cover some examples.

179
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,150
And the problem section.

180
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,510
It's not as straightforward as domain because you kind of have to think OK what kind of y values I can

181
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:40,960
get.

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,480
We don't have any hard rules to tell right away.

183
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,730
But for now just know that the range refers to all the y values that are possible for a given function.

184
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,730
And now let's go into our summary.

185
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,610
All right so let's go into a summary of what we just covered.

186
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:04,220
Again the domain of a function refers to all allowable x values or input for the function.

187
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,079
It is typically all real numbers the domain that is.

188
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,380
But for three cases it's not when there's division by zero when there's an even root or by limitations

189
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,300
of practical applications.

190
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:22,740
Negative numbers under even roots which can be 2 4 6.

191
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,470
Again remember even means divisible by 2 under even rudes give rise to imaginary numbers which we don't

192
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,060
like.

193
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,620
And finally the range of a function is a group of numbers that the function can output.

194
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:43,390
One more thing I wanted to mention is if you forget you know which ones domain which one Drange x y

195
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,460
input output you can actually summarize it here by alphabetical order.

196
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,540
So the X which is the input

197
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:06,900
which refers to the domain and then on the other hand we have Y which is the output

198
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,250
and refers to the range.

199
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,000
So if you ever forget which ones which are you need to do is put each pair into alphabetical order and

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,830
you'll have it ready.

201
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:31,490
So X comes before y input comes before output and domain comes before range.

202
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm talking of course about the first letter of each.

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
How it plays out in the alphabet.

204
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,000
So X comes before Y.

205
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,920
Input comes before output.

206
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,560
And domain comes before range.

207
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,560
So this way you know that everything on this side is related and everything on this side is related.

208
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,810
So that's a quick way to know that you know X is the input and the allowable x values are the domain.

209
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:09,120
On the other hand why is the output and whatever the function can output is the range.

210
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,920
All right so I'll see everyone in the next tutorial.

211
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,240
Remember we're going to have some problems for you to practice and I'll see you around.
