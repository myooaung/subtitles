Hello there how's it going.

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,980
My name is Louis and I would like to welcome you to the limit less calculus course for Business Calculus.

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,280
Thank you so much for being here.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,540
And thank you so much for putting your trust in me to help you pass your class.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,130
To give you a little background.

6
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,570
My name is Lewis and I've been a tutor for Business Calculus for the past eight years.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,670
I've tutored hundreds of students and I understand what it takes to be able to pass this class over

8
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,900
those years of tutoring.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,000
I've accumulated a lot of knowledge when it comes to the best way of teaching this class.

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,290
And trust me I know this class is one of the most hated classes out there.

11
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,640
You're a business student.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,700
Maybe you like marketing Maybe you like finance maybe you like management but calculus.

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,770
Hmm probably not always taking this class because you have to.

14
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,400
And I totally get that and also believe me I've heard every single thing about this class.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,400
Why do I have to take this class.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,050
Am I ever going to use this.

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,660
Why is this class so hard etc..

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,050
I've heard it all.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,310
So if you're asking yourself those questions you came to the right place.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,830
My goal is to help you understand the concepts help you practice them and eventually help you pass the

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,910
class.

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,930
So don't worry if you're struggling with pases calculus right now I am here to help you and take it

23
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,610
from me.

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,260
There is light at the end of the tunnel.

25
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,190
You can absolutely crush this class if number one.

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,930
The information is presented to you in a way that makes sense.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,060
And number two you put in the work by practicing and I'm going to help you out with those two things

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,360
in this class.

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,230
So before we get into the tutorials Let's go ahead and review a couple of things about the course and

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,480
after that we'll dive right in.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,510
So again thank you for being here.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,130
And let's crush byssus calculus together.
