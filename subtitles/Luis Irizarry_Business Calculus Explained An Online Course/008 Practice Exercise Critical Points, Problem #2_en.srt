1
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,060
All right.

2
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,920
So here's a second problem for critical points.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,190
It says find the critical points for f of x equals x squared plus for everything over x.

4
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,580
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

5
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,820
All right.

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,590
So how did it go.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,070
Let's go ahead and do it together.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,020
So to find the critical points again we need to find the numbers that make the derivative of this either

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,530
zero or undefined.

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,690
So first of all let's find the derivative

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,600
and because it's a division that means we need to use the quotient rule the mnemonic for that is pro

12
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,519
minus the B-S.

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,450
So pro stands for place repeats.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,380
And then the derivative of the outer.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,150
So let's place our repeats x squared plus four

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,800
times x x.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:32,790
Let's repeat it again x squared plus four times x derivative of the outer here and here and then mine

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,610
is then over the B-S.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,650
All right so bottom squared would be x squared.

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,770
So let's go ahead and get the derivatives.

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,940
So the derivative of this is bring down a dictator to and less powerful leader becomes X to the one

22
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,230
plus the derivative of four for derivative of a constant is zero.

23
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,509
Then that times X than mine is.

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:19,680
So we have x squared plus four times the derivative of x which as I always say you bring down a dictator

25
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,450
which is 1 times x.

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,140
To substitute a less powerful leader.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,140
So to 0.

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:38,350
So that becomes a 1 everything over again x squared.

29
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,600
Let's go ahead and multiply through so the zero cancels out doesn't do anything.

30
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:53,560
So we just multiply 2 x times X so X to 1 times x to the 1 is 2 x squared.

31
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,580
Then we have minus.

32
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,790
So it's going to be X squared plus four times whatever's here.

33
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:12,240
But all of this is just equal to one one times x to the zero which is 1 to 1 times 1 is just 1 and x

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,680
squared plus four times 1 is x squared plus 4.

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,490
Now remember we have this negative sign which definitely distributes to each term so it distributes

36
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,770
here and here it's a minus x squared.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,160
And it's a minus because it's negative times a positive.

38
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:44,030
And then we have another negative because we have negative times a positive minus negative times that

39
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,060
positive for is negative 4.

40
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,140
All right everything over x squared.

41
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,530
Alice go ahead and simplify.

42
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,240
So we have two terms with x squared.

43
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,100
This one here and this one here.

44
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,390
So we keep the x squared and we work with the coefficients.

45
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:17,089
So two minus one remember there's like a one here even though you don't market to minus one is one.

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,070
So that's one x squared which is just x squared right.

47
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,360
And then the minus four over x squared.

48
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,050
All right.

49
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,290
So this is our derivative.

50
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,420
Then let's find out the critical numbers for the derivative

51
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,310
and those We're going to be the numbers that number 1 make it equal to zero.

52
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,230
And number two make it undefined.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,260
So first let's find the ones that make it equal to zero.

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,580
And to do this we're going to set the top equal to zero.

55
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,270
All right.

56
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,300
So this is x squared minus four equals zero.

57
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,080
If you remember this is what's called a difference of squares.

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,700
So we can factor.

59
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,400
Just to refresh your memory this looks like this.

60
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:27,550
If you have A-squared mine is B squared and that equals a plus b times a mine is B.

61
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,330
So what do you need to square to get x squared.

62
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,270
Obviously the answer is X that is a.

63
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,870
Why do you need to square to get four.

64
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,930
Obviously the answer is 2.

65
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,480
So that is your B.

66
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:52,130
In other words this will become X plus two times x minus two.

67
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:52,960
All right.

68
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:59,560
This is a difference of squares.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,900
So we've covered this in the past.

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,650
And again this is basically just factoring out this a.

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,450
Mine is B squared.

72
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,460
Funny thing is once you've seen a lot of these problems they all look the same and you identify them

73
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,750
right away.

74
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,280
That's how you know right away that X squared minus four can be factored into this.

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,760
So we're setting this equal to zero so because we have two things that are multiplying X plus two an

76
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,910
X minus two.

77
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,600
If either of them are zero then the whole thing is zero.

78
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,200
So why is X plus two equal to zero.

79
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,450
Let's find out x plus two equal to zero.

80
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,450
So we're going to solve for x.

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,200
So we move this to to the other side.

82
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,160
We subtract two from both sides cancels out on this side and we have X equals negative 2.

83
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,290
We'll do the same thing for this over here.

84
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:09,250
So we have X minus two set it equal to zero and solve for x.

85
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,380
We add two on both sides because this is negative

86
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,700
cancels out.

87
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,180
We bring down the x x equals zero plus 2 which is 2.

88
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:30,110
So both x equals negative 2 and exit calls to make this derivative equal to zero.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,320
The top right.

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,590
And then let's go check for the second case which is when the bottom is zero.

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,130
So the undefined case

92
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,470
and then when those x squared equals zero.

93
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,960
The only way for x squared to equal 0 is when X is 0 right.

94
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,710
0 is the only number.

95
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,040
So that when you multiplied by itself gives you zero.

96
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,340
So the last one here is ex-secret zero.

97
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,840
These are critical numbers.

98
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,860
All right these two make the top equal to zero.

99
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,580
In other words they make the derivative as a whole equals zero.

100
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,850
And then this one here makes the derivative undefined because it makes the bottom equal to zero.

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,470
So we have a critical numbers but we're actually looking for the points so remember what we need to

102
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,610
do is plug in the critical numbers into the original.

103
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:39,419
So what we do is we plug in negative 2 and 2 into the original and that's going to give you the corresponding

104
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,840
y value for these critical numbers.

105
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:50,960
Now something funny happens with this function so 0 makes the derivative undefined.

106
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,110
But we still should have plugged it in into the original to get y value for when X equals zero.

107
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,810
However it turns out that 0 also makes the original a function on the find.

108
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,480
Because if you plugging 0 you're going to get a zero on the bottom.

109
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,750
Therefore this exit equals zero.

110
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,160
There is no critical point there.

111
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:27,130
Let me repeat that again the number that makes the derivative undefined also makes the original undefined.

112
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,070
Therefore there's no critical points.

113
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,300
Most of the time this is not the case.

114
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,480
Most of the time you get a number that makes the derivative undefined but not the original.

115
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,490
In this case this point makes both of them undefined.

116
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,580
Obviously if the original is not defined for 0 there can't be a point there.

117
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,950
Right.

118
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,770
There cannot be any sort of points because we cannot even plug in the Zero to get a y.

119
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,700
So that's how we know that there's no critical points when X equals zero.

120
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:05,030
If this had been any other number that you could plug in into the original then yes there's a critical

121
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,850
point there.

122
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,010
In this case there's nothing.

123
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,270
So there's no critical points.

124
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,720
In other words what we need to do is plug in this negative to and this to into the original function

125
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:29,180
and get the y values for the critical points and I'll put that here.

126
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:37,270
So let's go ahead and plug in negative to so plugging in negative 2 into the original.

127
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,440
That gives us negative 2 squared which is four plus four

128
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,680
over negative two.

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,850
That gives us eight on the top.

130
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,110
And negative two on the bottom positive over negative is a negative.

131
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,980
And that over two is negative for.

132
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:14,340
All right let's put in the second number which is just two so two squared plus four is four plus for.

133
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,640
And then we plug into the bottom as well.

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:28,020
So that's two and we get four plus four is eight over to eight over two.

135
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,230
Everything positive is four.

136
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,950
So one gives as negative four.

137
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,770
And the other one gives us four.

138
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,630
So these are the y values corresponding to these two x values.

139
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,520
Therefore are critical points and I'll put it down here.

140
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:51,720
The critical points are at negative 2 negative 4.

141
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,650
Right.

142
00:11:52,730 --> 00:12:00,630
It's negative 2 is the x value and negative 4 is a Y value corresponding to the negative two ends.

143
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:12,020
The other point is two which is the input and four which is the output of that two.

144
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:21,180
So you have critical points that negative to negative 4 and add 2 for we are done.

145
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,040
And these are our critical points.

146
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:31,950
Like I said zero there's no critical point at 0 because we cannot even plug it in into the original.

147
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,890
If we did we would get zero on the bottom or in other words undefined.

148
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,360
All right.

149
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,890
So that's it.

150
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:48,130
Go out there do some homework do some practice just get it going and they'll see you in the next tutorial.
