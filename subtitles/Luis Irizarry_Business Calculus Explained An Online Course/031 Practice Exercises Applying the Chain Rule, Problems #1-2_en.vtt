1
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.920
Are right.

2
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.850
So let's do some actual chain rule problems.

3
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.690
So my idea with these exercises is to get you started on the chain rule and give you some practice.

4
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.570
So we're going to be giving you easy on to the beginning and then they get progressively harder.

5
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.840
But again at the beginning what I want you to do is to be able to apply our mnemonic UTX and be able

6
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540
to solve easy problems.

7
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.500
All right.

8
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.380
So we have find f prime of x f f of x equals x squared minus 3 to the 20th power.

9
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.720
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

10
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.340
All right.

11
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.319
So we have this function x squared minus three and we need to find its derivative.

12
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.970
So how do we go about that.

13
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.920
Well it turns out that here we have a composition of functions right.

14
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.090
We're plugging in this x squared minus three into this other function that takes it to the 20th power.

15
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.400
So for that reason we're going to need to use the chain rule.

16
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.150
So the mnemonic for the chain rule is ugly.

17
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.120
Daily X-Box that's UTX.

18
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.670
So for the first step we're going to have the you and for this tab remember all we do is we say you

19
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.700
equals whatever the enter function is.

20
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.790
In this case it's X squared minus three.

21
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.010
That's it for that step.

22
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.320
Second step is derivatives.

23
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.890
And I'll put it here we're doing you the x ugly daily x box.

24
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.730
All right.

25
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.370
Second step is derivatives.

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:10.479
So remember that we have DUI cross dx and then we have you over here and you over here as well.

27
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.760
So overall like we mentioned all we're doing is we're multiplying this derivative times this derivative

28
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.690
So it's derivative of y in terms of you.

29
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.060
So first we have why in terms of view and we get the derivative of that.

30
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
So like I said before and a lot of people get confused by this but it's actually very easy.

31
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.430
We want to set this Y to the original function in terms of you.

32
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.940
So we do not want to have any access.

33
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.090
Right.

34
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.660
So the way we do that is we already said in step one that you is equal to x squared minus 3 to the inner

35
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.290
function.

36
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.000
Right.

37
00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:00.470
So this inner function is already you so to rewrite this whole thing using you instead of X. We just

38
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.970
say you to the 20th.

39
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.820
Right you till the 20th is the same as saying X squared minus 3 to the 20th but X squared minus three

40
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.530
has been replaced by you which like I said we already did on our first step.

41
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.960
All right.

42
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.920
So it's not only you to the 20 we're getting the derivative of you to the 20.

43
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.130
This is very important.

44
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.030
If you just say you to the 20 and you do not get the derivative your answer will not be correct.

45
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.870
Remember this is a multiplication of two derivatives putting y in terms of you as Step 1 and then get

46
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.540
the derivative as the second step.

47
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.990
All right.

48
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.060
So we have that times.

49
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.290
The other derivative which is DDX.

50
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:56.490
So you in terms of x we can refer back to Step 1 for this one you equals x squared minus 3.

51
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.910
It's already in terms of x.

52
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.260
So we just say derivative of x squared minus 3

53
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.840
and again for this second part.

54
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.740
Do you over ADX we're just putting the inner function here.

55
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.350
If you haven't noticed that yet.

56
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.900
Because you is what we're finding the derivative for and you is the inner function and it is already

57
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.240
in terms of x y because that's how we defined it in step 1.

58
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.620
All right.

59
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.360
So we have two derivatives derivative of the 20th time's derivative of x squared minus three.

60
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.840
Let's do that over here.

61
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.490
So what is a derivative of you to the 20th.

62
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.750
Remember that what we do here is we treat you as if it were an X.

63
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.900
So if you had x to the 20th and you want to find the derivative of that what would you do.

64
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.260
It would just do the power roll.

65
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.240
Right.

66
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.930
So that's exactly what we'll do.

67
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.520
But instead of using the X we're going to use the you so this 20 is a dictator.

68
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.390
So it comes down multiplying we keep the you and we substitute by a less powerful leader.

69
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.350
So that's the 19th that is a first derivative then for a second derivative.

70
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.450
This is a difference.

71
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.190
So we do derivative of the first mynahs derivative of the second.

72
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.930
So here derivative of x squared.

73
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.720
This is just power rule.

74
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:37.650
So we bring our dictator down by a less powerful leader which is one so we don't market and minus the

75
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.380
derivative of three while three is a constant.

76
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.040
So its derivative is zero.

77
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.690
So we did not market.

78
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:52.160
So at the end of the day what we have is 20 years of the 19th times to X..

79
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.110
So let's go out and multiply 20 times to x.

80
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.110
That's 40 x times you to the 19th.

81
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.660
All right.

82
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.010
This is it.

83
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:14.090
Now for our last step which is the X part of the process we just put our answer back in terms of x.

84
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.830
So we have this answer.

85
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.620
We do not want any use.

86
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.050
So what we do is we change as you buy the equivalence which is in X..

87
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.160
So again refer back to Step 1.

88
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:32.990
We already said that you equals the inner function or in other words you equals x squared minus 3.

89
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.100
So the final derivative is going to be equal to

90
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.270
40 x times instead of you to the 19th.

91
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.460
We'll have x squared minus 3 which is the same as you just an X terms

92
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.070
to the 19th.

93
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.350
And this is our final answer.

94
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.560
So how did it go.

95
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.870
Did you get the same results maybe you didn't get to the last part.

96
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.440
Maybe you got confused in step 2.

97
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.690
Again the chain rule is difficult.

98
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.090
All right.

99
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.870
So if you didn't get it the first time don't worry we'll do a couple of problems to get you used to

100
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.330
it.

101
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.410
But remember the key is your mnemonic you the x.

102
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.800
Let's do another problem.

103
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.030
All right.

104
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:43.490
So let's try this other exercise find a prime of X if X equals x squared plus x squared plus two to

105
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.630
the one hundredth power.

106
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.840
Interesting.

107
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.630
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

108
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.740
All right.

109
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.200
So let's go ahead and find the derivative for this function

110
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:07.250
so maybe you noticed that what we're doing here is we have two functions that are adding right.

111
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:14.660
We have x squared and then we have this other function which itself is a composition of more functions.

112
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:21.420
So we're adding X squared and x squared plus two to the one hundredth power.

113
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:27.210
And of course we use our some rule because we're adding two different functions.

114
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.350
And then remember for some rule that a monarch is a DD.

115
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.710
So you add the different derivatives.

116
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:39.000
Same thing if we were subtracting we would find the derivative of the first minus the derivative of

117
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.900
the second.

118
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.120
But because we're adding we find the derivative of the first plus the derivative of the second.

119
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.240
So let's get the derivative of x squared.

120
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.790
And again we bring down a dictator as a 2 x substitute by a less powerful leader gives us a 1 so we

121
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.720
don't market plus and.

122
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.600
Aha.

123
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.690
So how do we get the derivative of this one over here.

124
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.950
Of course you know it we're going to need to use the chain rule because we have one function x squared

125
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.360
plus two within another function.

126
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.730
So notice we started with some rule and while doing this some rule we had to sidetrack and do the change

127
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.080
rule come back with an answer and keep doing the some rule.

128
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:38.210
So let's go ahead and do it on the side so chain rule for x squared plus two to the 100.

129
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.780
All right so let's get this.

130
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:47.540
Remember ugly daily X-Box you the x so step one is you.

131
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:57.030
So we said you equal to the inner function which in this case is x squared plus two that said for step

132
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.400
1.

133
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.710
Step 2 Remember we find our derivatives and we multiply them.

134
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:10.610
So this is D-y Fras dx and then do you over here.

135
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.810
And do you over here.

136
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.820
All right so what is this what is y in terms of you.

137
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.150
So don't get confused now because this is the original Why.

138
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.600
However this is completely separate.

139
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.000
This part over here we're finding the derivative of x squared plus two to the one hundredth power.

140
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.900
All right so the Y refers to of course this function that we're using the chain rule on.

141
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.950
So in the other examples you was always equal to the original function because we only did the changeroom

142
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.370
in this case.

143
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:55.240
We have this function which doesn't need the chain rule and we have this other one that does.

144
00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:01.340
So again this y refers only to the one that you're differentiating with the chain rule.

145
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.770
So how do we set why in terms of you.

146
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.890
So we know already that X squared plus two is equal to you.

147
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.580
That's what we did on step 1.

148
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.190
So we can just say you to the one hundredth power.

149
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.640
Right.

150
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.780
It's like saying X squared plus two to the 100.

151
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:26.370
But instead of x squared plus two we put you there because you is equal to the inner function.

152
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.640
And remember we need to get our derivative.

153
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.860
If you forget that then you're going to get the wrong answer.

154
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:41.590
And again just look at this derivative of Y Times derivative of you you're always multiplying two derivatives.

155
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.300
All right.

156
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:49.790
So this is derivative of y in terms of you we're going to multiply that times derivative of you in terms

157
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.490
of x.

158
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.020
So you is x squared plus two.

159
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:59.690
It's already in terms of x so it's X plus 2 and the derivative of that.

160
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.160
All right.

161
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:08.240
So remember that for first derivative derivative of you to the 100 we just treat the you as if it were

162
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.530
an X..

163
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.040
So we can apply our power rule.

164
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:20.210
So we're bring down a dictator has 100 you to the ninety nine.

165
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.670
Right.

166
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.490
Less powerful leader.

167
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.220
And we're going to multiply that by the derivative of this.

168
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.790
So here we have a sum we just get the derivative of the first one and we added to the derivative of

169
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.180
the second one derivative for the first one power rule.

170
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:44.290
So we bring our dictator down which is a 2 x and less powerful leader it becomes a 1.

171
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.420
So we don't market and plus the derivative of a constant which is zero.

172
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.890
So we don't mark that either.

173
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.890
All right.

174
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.730
So finally we have 100 times 2 x that is 200 x

175
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.000
times you to the ninety nine great.

176
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.590
Now we simplified things.

177
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:15.200
We go to our final and third step which is setting it back in terms of x.

178
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.910
All right.

179
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.890
So wherever you see in you you're going to substitute it not by the letter X. But by whatever you is

180
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.750
equal right here.

181
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.210
And step one.

182
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.420
So basically you're taking you and putting the inner function there instead of the letter you.

183
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:38.000
So we have 200 x so instead of you we're going to put it in terms of x.

184
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:47.130
So we do X squared plus two to the 99th power.

185
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.120
All right.

186
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:56.360
And this right here is the derivative of x squared plus two to the 100.

187
00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.120
So now that we got this derivative we actually have to go back to the original problem and we need to

188
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.240
plug in or answer the derivative that we got here.

189
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.830
So derivative of x squared.

190
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:22.360
We already have it is 2 x plus derivative of this guy is the one we just got 200 x x squared plus two

191
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:29.570
to the ninety nine and at this point there's nothing really to simplify.

192
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.620
And this is our answer.

193
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:43.810
So I think you're seeing now how the change can complicate things because this was a simple addition.

194
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:48.750
So we just needed to get the derivative of the first plus the derivative of the second.

195
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:55.680
However this second required the chain rule because it's a function within another function.

196
00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.260
So we just went ahead and apply the change rule here UTX and once we got the answer we put it here.

197
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:09.360
And so we got the derivative of this plus the derivative of this and that is our answer.

198
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.400
At this point we are done.
