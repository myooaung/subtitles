1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,820
All right so let's put the constant rule into action.

2
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:32,549
So our first exercise says find prime of x so find the derivative of f of x if f of x equals three.

3
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,000
Right.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,320
So go ahead and pause the video and do your thing.

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,210
All right so looking for a prime of X

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,800
and if we look at f of x it's equal to 3.

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,720
That means that it's a constant function and the constant rule says that the derivative of a constant

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,560
function is always 0.

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:08,340
Therefore the derivative of this is zero that is it.

10
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,560
Believe it or not we are done.

11
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:21,160
All right so our next exercise says find f prime of X if f of x equals negative twenty five thousand

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,330
three hundred and thirty one.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,330
Go ahead and pause the video and try to do it

14
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,400
all right.

15
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,730
So we're looking for an Prime of X

16
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,830
and if you look at this function f of x it looks like a big negative number right.

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,110
Negative twenty five thousand 331 at the end of the day.

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,270
This is just a number.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,180
There are no axes no letters in this.

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,310
So this is just a number.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,340
Doesn't matter how big it is or how small.

22
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,370
If f of x equals a number then that means that the derivative is zero

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,150
so same thing.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,520
Derivative of a constant is always zero.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,660
Doesn't matter how big or how small the number is

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,340
all right.

27
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:30,200
So for our alast exercise we're being asked to find a prime of x 1 f of x equals zero.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,980
Hmm interesting.

29
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,790
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

30
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:49,920
All right so prime of X of the function f of x equals zero.

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,020
Well again 0 is just a number and the derivative of a number is zero.

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,430
So the answer here as well is 0.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,310
So the function is equal to zero.

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,600
The derivative is equal to zero.

35
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:06,960
All right.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,430
So just like we saw whenever a function equals a number with no letters its derivative will always be

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,630
zero.

38
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,280
All right.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,980
And that never changes.

40
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,530
That is it for the constant rule.
