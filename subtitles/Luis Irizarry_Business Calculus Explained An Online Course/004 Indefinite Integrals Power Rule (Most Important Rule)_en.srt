1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,050
OK so we already know when we're being asked to find the indefinite integral of a function.

2
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:33,730
So it looks something like this you have to reassemble and then you have the function itself of X and

3
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,940
then you have dx.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:53,960
So what happens if I ask you for example to find integral of x squared plus 5 x minus 3 DX how do we

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,940
do this.

6
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:02,420
Well to be able to find the indefinite integral for this function there are a couple of rules that we

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,360
need to know about integrals.

8
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,660
However out of all the rules there is one that's super important.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,210
It is critical.

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,920
It is the most important rule for finding into rules and you're going to see it everywhere.

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,290
So remember how he had the power rule for derivatives where we bring down a dictator.

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:32,330
So for example if we have the derivative of x squared then remember that the mnemonic said to bring

13
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,770
down our dictator.

14
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,560
So we bring down the two and then we keep the X and we substitute by one of less power.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,810
So this too becomes two minus one.

16
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,890
So that becomes 2 x and it's 2 to 1.

17
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,220
But when it's X to the one it's just x.

18
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,050
All right.

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,160
So this is the power rule for derivatives for power functions.

20
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,430
It turns out we have a power rule for integrals as well.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,750
And this rule is actually opposite to this power rule and derivatives.

22
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,410
So as you know already integrating and differentiating our Abo's processes processes right.

23
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,590
When you differentiate something and then that derivative that you got when you integrate it you go

24
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,860
back to the original function.

25
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:33,660
Not exactly because you might have constants but in a way you do so because integrating and differentiating

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,960
are opposite processes than the power rule for integrals.

27
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,670
It's kind of opposite to the power rule and derivatives.

28
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,280
Let's check out the power rule for integrals and see why it is so important.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,010
All right so power rule for entry rules.

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,020
So remember a power function has the form X to the end.

31
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,250
So it follows the power rule is used to integrate functions in the form X to the end.

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,750
So the power rule says the following.

33
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,630
So if you have the integral

34
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:19,590
of x to the end and remember this and it's just a number dx.

35
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,220
So we want to find the indefinite integral of this function x to the n that is going to be equal to

36
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,360
the following.

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,520
So we keep the X but then check out what we do with the exponents.

38
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:42,900
So the exponent that we have here is and what we do is we actually add 1 to the exponent.

39
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,670
So we say and plus one

40
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,620
and then we divide the whole thing by and plus one

41
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,800
and then plus see all right remember that plus he always goes there.

42
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,650
But check out what happened here.

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,780
The original exponent is n.

44
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,800
So what we do is we add one to the exponents and then we divide by the new exponent by new exponent.

45
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,120
I mean the original plus one.

46
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,020
All right.

47
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,150
So I went to the exponents divide by the new one.

48
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,010
Let's check out an example.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,260
So the integral of x squared

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,880
X what is the indefinite integral for this function x squared.

51
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,810
So the rule says we keep the X

52
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,890
then we add a 1 to the exponent.

53
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,100
So the point here is 2.

54
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,620
So that's two plus 1.

55
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:12,590
And then we divide it by the new exponent which is also 2 plus 1.

56
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,820
And then we do Plus see what does this equal to.

57
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:24,090
Well we have x 2 the 2 plus 1 so that's X to the 3.

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:33,970
And then on the bottom we also have 3 2 plus 1 so x to the third power over three plus C that is your

59
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,740
indefinite integral.

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,650
That wasn't too bad was it.

61
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,730
It's really simple because once you add that to the exponents do you just take this new exponent and

62
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,330
you bring it down here dividing.

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,210
That's it.

64
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,530
And in fact to check or answer it what we'll do is we'll actually take the derivative of this and see

65
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,370
if it gives us this x squared again.

66
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,490
Let's put it here.

67
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,150
Checking

68
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,110
an all circle this.

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,970
So you know it's the actual answer.

70
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:16,880
So let's double check and let's get the derivative of execute over three plus a constant derivative

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,270
of that so see.

72
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,010
Now we're going to find the derivative.

73
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,430
So we're going to use the power rule but for derivatives.

74
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,350
This one's for integrals.

75
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,990
This one's for derivatives.

76
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,810
So power rule for derivatives.

77
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,680
Remember that we actually go ahead and bring down a dictator so we bring down the three and then we

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,870
have this three dividing already so three over three acts and we substitute by one of less power.

79
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,370
So the three becomes a two and then the derivative of a constant is zero.

80
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,300
All right.

81
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,740
So then we have three over three x squared.

82
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,000
However the three over 3 cancels out and we get x squared.

83
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,660
There we go.

84
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,790
There's x squared.

85
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,750
Is this x squared right.

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,170
So we've found the indefinite integral of x squared.

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,950
It gave us this when we differentiate this answer.

88
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,200
We get back this x squared.

89
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,720
That's how you know that the answer is correct.

90
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:29,570
And of course that tells you that again integration and differentiation arges inverses of each other.

91
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,830
Now of course you know I'm not mean all right.

92
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,880
I'm not going to make you remember these you know add 1 and then divide by the same one.

93
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,640
You know I'm going to give you a beautiful awesome mnemonic.

94
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,870
So let's go into that next.
