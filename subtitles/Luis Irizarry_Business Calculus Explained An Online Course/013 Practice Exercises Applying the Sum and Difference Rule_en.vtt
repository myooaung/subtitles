1
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.550
All right.

2
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.060
So let's do a couple of exercises here using the and different trial.

3
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.730
Remember that many many times in fact most times you will have to use these two rules together and just

4
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.080
remind you we have a mnemonic for the rule and it is D.

5
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.120
And the way to remember that is if you're summing two things what you're doing is adding them all right.

6
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.900
So D D stands for.

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.730
Add different derivatives in other words if you're adding two things and you want to get the derivative

8
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.200
of the whole thing.

9
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.320
You get the derivative of the first plus the derivative of the second.

10
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.710
And remember that we use the same mnemonic for a difference or in other words for subtraction.

11
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.830
Now for subtraction instead of add all derivatives you subtract all derivatives.

12
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.660
So in other words what you do is you keep the sign in the middle.

13
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.400
OK.

14
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.120
So we have this example here f of x equals x to the fourth minus x cubed plus x squared minus X plus

15
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.840
1.

16
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.020
And I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

17
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.370
All right so let's find the derivative of this and see if you got it right.

18
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.450
All right.

19
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.610
So for all of these we're just going to use the power rule.

20
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.550
So we're going to bring down our dictator and we're going to substitute by a less powerful leader.

21
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.440
All right so derivative of vector The fourth is for x cubed.

22
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.530
All right.

23
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.140
And then remember these two are subtracting.

24
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:14.120
So we keep the negative derivative of the second is breaking down or 3 x and subtract one from the exponent.

25
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.650
All right.

26
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:27.530
And then we keep the sign plus derivative of the next bringing down a dictator to X and subtract 1 from

27
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.160
the exponent which becomes just 1.

28
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:39.350
So Escher's X minus derivative of x we bring down a dictator which is 1 and we subtract one from the

29
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.180
exponents.

30
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.030
So that becomes X to the 1 minus 1 x 2 0.

31
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.740
And actually I'll write this one down because this derivative can be confusing to some people.

32
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:59.510
So we bring down a dictator which was one X and one minus one.

33
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.670
All right.

34
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.680
And the one is multiplying the X..

35
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.770
All right.

36
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.050
And then we keep the sign Plus a derivative of a constant is zero.

37
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.070
All right.

38
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.190
And let's go ahead and simplify.

39
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.150
So that's 4 x cubed.

40
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.390
Mine is 3 x squared.

41
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.650
Plus to x.

42
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.140
So this one here actually became what.

43
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.800
Well we have access to the one to my next one that's next to the 0 x to the 0 is just one.

44
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:47.330
So we have in essence 1 times 1 which is 1 minus 1 and then the plus 0 we did not do anything with that

45
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.780
because it doesn't change a thing.

46
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.210
All right.

47
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.470
So we just take it out and this is our final answer.

48
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.690
See how easy it is.

49
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.700
All you need to do is to get the derivative of each individual function and keep the sign in between

50
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.250
them.

51
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.790
That's what the mnemonic says.

52
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.370
You add different derivatives and you subtract different derivatives.

53
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.350
Right.

54
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.650
When I say different derivatives I mean each individual one derivative of x to the fourth derivative

55
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.900
of execute derivative of x squared etc. etc..

56
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.080
And again you just keep the sign in between them the same.

57
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.780
That's it.

58
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.280
All right.

59
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:43.290
So here we have another example find f prime of X if X equals negative 3 x squared minus X to the negative

60
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.040
on plus 5.

61
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.320
I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

62
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.410
All right so what is this.

63
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.350
Let's find the derivative.

64
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.290
Like I said you're just going to get the derivative of each individual function and you're going to

65
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.270
keep the sign right.

66
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.700
So let's get the derivative of this one.

67
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.390
So we have a constant multiple negative three.

68
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:21.340
We put it outside a derivative of x squared is we bring down a dictator which is our two x and the exponent

69
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.710
becomes a 1.

70
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.920
We don't market but market in this case.

71
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.060
So we can keep track of it and then we'll take it out.

72
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.910
All right.

73
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.170
So we have this now.

74
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.690
So we do minus.

75
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.180
Right.

76
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.080
We're just keeping this sign the same and we get the derivative of this guy.

77
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:48.160
So again what we do here is we use the power rule so this negative one comes down multiplying.

78
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.020
And remember we have this negative from outside and then the negative from the negative one.

79
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.790
These are two different negatives.

80
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.180
That's important.

81
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.360
You can say like oh we have a negative here so I'll just put a one.

82
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.820
No.

83
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.840
If you bring down a negative one your market is negative one.

84
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.230
In addition to the negative that you already had.

85
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.050
OK.

86
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.390
So keeping up with the power all we have are x.

87
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.590
We subtract one from the exponent so negative one minus one.

88
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.160
If you own daughter and you spent one more now you owe too.

89
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.710
So that's negative too.

90
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.220
And then the derivative of a constant is zero.

91
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.750
So we do.

92
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.900
Plus zero.

93
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.870
And let's go ahead and simplify negative three times two is negative six because it's a negative times

94
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.790
a positive.

95
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.220
The answer is negative six x.

96
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.100
And then for the X to the one we're just going to leave it as X..

97
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.610
It's the same thing.

98
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.650
All right.

99
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.990
Now what happens here.

100
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.500
Here you have a negative times a negative.

101
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.110
Right.

102
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.130
So when you have a minus and then whatever your mind is saying is a minus as well.

103
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:18.560
Remember the whole thing becomes positive negative times a negative becomes positive this negative too

104
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.450
and the exponent is something completely different.

105
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.870
Right.

106
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.540
That is for the max.

107
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:31.250
This xponent what I'm talking about is the value of this as a whole is negative because this guy makes

108
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.090
it negative.

109
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.200
But then when you have minus times minus it becomes positive.

110
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.170
All right.

111
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.120
So here we do plus and then we have the one.

112
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:54.660
So we're not going to market because again it's just the one and we have X to the negative to plus zero

113
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.960
we don't need to push it because it doesn't change a thing.

114
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.680
All right.

115
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:06.690
Let's go ahead and finally simplify this so we have negative six sex.

116
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.230
And remember that we don't like negative exponents.

117
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:17.300
So what we're going to do is we're going to take this guy and bring it to the bottom with a fliped exponent.

118
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:26.810
So we do plus one over x to the second power.

119
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.010
So now the exponent is positive.

120
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.679
Remember that you always flip it when you bring it down or you bring it up.

121
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.250
And this would be our final answer.

122
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:47.530
So maybe this problem this negative temps negative confused you maybe didn't simplify it all the way

123
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.570
until the end.

124
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.570
Just make sure that you study this and you get what is it that we did.

125
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:59.620
And again remember very important if you have a negative times a negative the whole thing becomes a

126
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.670
positive.

127
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.230
So yes we say that we keep the sign when we do this some are differential.

128
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.360
That's what we did.

129
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.530
We actually took this sign and brought it down here.

130
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.960
However this expression we had a negative.

131
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.400
So that's where we ended up multiplying the negative times a negative.

132
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.030
And that's why it became a positive.

133
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.400
All right.

134
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:32.390
So for a last exercise finds prime of X if X equals this 3 x squared plus 5 x squared minus 5 x cubed

135
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:37.360
plus 20 x plus three alleged pause and give it a shot.

136
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.360
All right.

137
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.730
So let's go ahead and find this derivative.

138
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.230
However there is something interesting about this function.

139
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.500
Have you caught it yet.

140
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.560
Let's see.

141
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.500
So we have three x squared and we have five x squared.

142
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:03.710
So these two have the same base and exponents x squared right x to the two.

143
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.270
That means that we can actually simplify these two and put them together.

144
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.820
We can do that with any other term here because this is executable.

145
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.800
This is X and this is three.

146
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.520
So the only ones that have x squared are these two.

147
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.540
So that means that you can actually put them together like this.

148
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.130
You add the three and the five.

149
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.410
So that gives you eight x squared

150
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.660
and that's it.

151
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.100
We have simplified them.

152
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.220
So we keep the x squared right.

153
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.700
That doesn't change because we're adding and then we do three plus five.

154
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.430
That gives us 8 x squared.

155
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.790
All right and now we'll just rewrite the rest of our function.

156
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.870
So 5 x cubed

157
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.190
plus 20 x

158
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.820
plus three.

159
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:11.020
Now one thing you'll probably never get a function where you actually have to simplify before you do

160
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.560
the derivative.

161
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.590
Now when you're finding derivatives there are going to be a lot of times where you need to simplify

162
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.590
like this.

163
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.850
When you getting an answer here I gave you the simplification at the beginning but typically you're

164
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.360
not going to see that again.

165
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:31.090
Only when you're finishing up a derivative is where you're going to have to simplify terms like this.

166
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:38.410
So if they have the same base and the same exponents only then you can add the constant multiples at

167
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.410
the beginning.

168
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.660
In this case three and five that gives is eight.

169
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.270
And then you keep this x squared right.

170
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.500
Now if you were wondering what if I didn't simplify and I got the derivative it would have given you

171
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.740
the same answer but it's always better to simplify.

172
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.160
If you see something like this.

173
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.580
All right.

174
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:06.800
So let's go ahead and find the derivative of this function.

175
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.630
All right so the derivative of this we have constant multiple We have an eight times bring down a dictator

176
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:21.020
to x to the to minus one substituting by a less powerful leader.

177
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.200
And we do minus.

178
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:28.610
So we keep the sign right and then we have again constant multiple.

179
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.230
We bring down a dictator that's three x.

180
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:41.660
Subtract one from the exponents plus So we keep the sign again.

181
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:47.710
Remember we always keep the sign in between the terms and just get the different derivatives.

182
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.460
All right.

183
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:56.620
So constant multiple We have a 20 multiplying at the beginning and then we bring down our dictator which

184
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:03.690
in this case is just one x to the one minus one.

185
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.520
So we substitute a less powerful leader here.

186
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.980
Remember that if it's X then the exponent is implied to be 1.

187
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.860
So that's where we subtract that 1 minus 1.

188
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.790
And then the derivative of this 3 is 0.

189
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.770
So we do plus 0.

190
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.640
And let's go ahead and simplify.

191
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.620
8 times 2 is 16

192
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:40.010
x to the two minus one just becomes X to the 1 or just X minus 5 times 3 is 15

193
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.020
and then x to the three minus one is X to the two

194
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.820
plus 20 times one is 20

195
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.420
and then times x to the 1 minus 1.

196
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:08.300
So remember X to the one of minus one is just x to the zero and anything to the zero power is 1.

197
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.380
So that's going to give us 20 times 1 which is just 20.

198
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.410
So we'll just leave it like that and then play zero.

199
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.810
We take that out because it doesn't change anything.

200
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.440
And we have our final answer.

201
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.740
There it is.

202
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.200
All right.

203
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:35.240
So we just did all these problems with our mnemonic a DD says add the different derivatives.

204
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:41.320
That's what we do here we add and subtract the different derivatives by keeping the sign in between

205
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.380
them.

206
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.460
That's pretty much it for the sum and differential.

207
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.700
I'll see you in the next tutorial.

208
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.410
I remember practice.

209
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.660
Do your homework.

210
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.090
Just do it.
