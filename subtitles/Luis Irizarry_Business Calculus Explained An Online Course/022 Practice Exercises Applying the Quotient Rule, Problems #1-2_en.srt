1
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,520
All right so let's get started with our quotient rule exercises.

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,640
Now remember a question is just a diversion.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,890
So whenever you see a division of functions then you know you need to use the quotient rule.

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,020
And the best way to know if two functions are dividing is if they have this line in between them that

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,780
tells you right away if they are dividing and remind you once more.

6
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,400
We have a mnemonic for the quotient rule.

7
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,300
It is pro

8
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,470
minus the b.s..

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,190
Right.

10
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,510
So if you've never seen this please go back to the quotient rule videos and there you'll find where

11
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,850
this money come from and how to apply it.

12
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,200
So I'll leave that for you right there.

13
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:23,710
Our first function is f of x equals x squared minus 1 everything over X minus 2.

14
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,530
So we need to find the derivative of this function.

15
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,200
So we need to use our quotient rule.

16
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,940
All right.

17
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,870
So go ahead and pause it and give it a shot.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,150
All right so let's see how it went.

19
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,100
Let's find the derivative of this function.

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,500
All right.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,910
So just like our mnemonic says it's Parow just like the product rule minus the B-S.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,780
So pro means place repeats.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,030
And then get the derivative of the outer.

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,610
So let's go ahead and place repeats x squared minus 1.

25
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,790
And remember when we place repeats in the quotient rule what we do is we just put them multiplying the

26
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,520
top function times the bottom function.

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,610
So again it's just like the broader group.

28
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,770
So this is sort first function which is the top one.

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:33,130
And then we have the bottom function X minus two and then we place our second repeats.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,430
So we just write it again.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,600
X squared minus 1 and X minus 2.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,430
All right.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,430
So in the product rule what we do is we put a plus in between.

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,150
But remember this is the quotient rule.

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,540
It's a distant cousin.

36
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:57,250
So what we do here according to the mnemonic is instead of putting a plus we put a minus.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,190
That's where the mine is here in the mnemonic comes from.

38
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,900
And then finally to finish up.

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,590
Remember that we do this the top over B-S.

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:17,790
So bottom squared the bottom squared is the bottom function X minus 2 to the second power.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,750
So again product rule minus the B-S minus means there's a minus in between.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,340
The place repeats and B-S just means the bottom squared.

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,750
All right.

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,140
So we just missed actually to put our outer derivatives.

45
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,020
So we're going to have a derivative of the outer on top.

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,020
So the derivative of this one here and derivative of this one here.

47
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,420
All right.

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,050
So remember place repeats.

49
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,950
That's what we did derivatives of the outer.

50
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,650
So the derivative of the first and the derivative of this one here.

51
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,930
Then we do a minus and between.

52
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,350
And the bottom squared is X minus two to the second power.

53
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,710
Let's go ahead and start doing this.

54
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,150
So let's get the derivative of this function.

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,380
We bring our dictator down so that's 2 x to the first power.

56
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,180
So that's just 2 x.

57
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,020
And then we have mynahs derivative of one derivative of a constant is zero.

58
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,510
All right.

59
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,960
So we don't market at all

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,490
that times X minus 2

61
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,890
then we do the minus and we have x squared minus 1

62
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,900
times the derivative of this.

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:53,820
So it's derivative of X number derivative of X is just one because you bring the dictator which is one

64
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,910
and then the exponent becomes 0 1 time to 1 is just 1 and then derivative of this two is zero.

65
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,530
So we have one minus zero which is just one

66
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,050
everything over the bottom squared.

67
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,120
All right let's go ahead and simplify the top.

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:30,090
Now that we got derivatives so we'll multiply again this 2 x times X and then times the two.

69
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,910
So this is distributed here and also distributed here.

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,230
So we have 2 x times x.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:45,550
So that's two and then X and remember xponent Here's one point and here is one.

72
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,680
So we add them up and we get to all right.

73
00:05:50,010 --> 00:06:00,830
Now we have 2 x times negative to positive times a negative is a negative and 2 x times 2 is for X and

74
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,320
then we have minus X squared minus one times 1.

75
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,680
So that gives you x squared minus 1.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,550
Right now something very important here.

77
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,050
This mynahs distributes to both the x squared and to the negative 1.

78
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,020
This is a common source of confusion.

79
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,980
So this negative sign applies here and also applies here.

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,010
OK.

81
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,410
So what we're going to do is we're going to say negative times a positive is a negative.

82
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,040
So that's mine is x squared right.

83
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:46,620
Then we distribute it to the next one which is negative 1 and a negative times a negative is a positive.

84
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,840
So that's going to be negative times negative one is plus one.

85
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,100
All right everything over X minus 2 squared.

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,790
And finally we can go ahead and simplify let's look for the ones that have the same exponents.

87
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,510
That's going to be this one here too x squared and negative x squared.

88
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:19,970
So 2 x squared minus X squared we subtract the coefficients two minus one is just 1.

89
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,280
So we don't market.

90
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,180
And we keep the x squared.

91
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,900
So it's basically one X where.

92
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,520
But we don't mark the.

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,520
All right and then we have minus 4 x

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:43,330
and then we have plus 1 everything over X minus 2 squared.

95
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,950
And that is our answer.

96
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,110
All right so we just simply applied our mnemonic to get the derivative of this quotient.

97
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,780
And again we'll see this and more examples but I need you to know that you distribute this negative

98
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,490
sign to everything on the right.

99
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,680
So it's attributed to this x squared and is distributed to this negative 1.

100
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:21,110
So this negative sign changes the sign basically of all this the positive becomes a negative and the

101
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,080
negative becomes a positive.

102
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,150
All right.

103
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,740
So here we have our second example we have of X equals 3 x cubed minus 3 over X and we want to find

104
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,270
the derivative of that.

105
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,470
All right.

106
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,179
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

107
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,560
All right.

108
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,440
So let's see how it works.

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,130
Let's go ahead and get the derivative of this function.

110
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:00,280
And again we know it's the quotient rule function because there is a line dividing the top on the bottom.

111
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,930
So you have two functions that are dividing and we need to use the quotient rule.

112
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,140
So let's in our Monnick for the quotient rule.

113
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,210
So product rule minus the B-S.

114
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,170
So the product rule says we're going to place our repeats.

115
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:32,350
So that's going to be 3x cubed minus 3 times X and same thing 3 x cubed minus three times x.

116
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,290
All right.

117
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,890
And then the minus B-S part.

118
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:43,280
So we have instead of a plus like we would do in the product rule we put a minus and the B-S just means

119
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,410
bottom squared.

120
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:52,830
So everything over the bottom squared and again don't forget we need to get the derivative of the outer.

121
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,620
That is the 0 in the pro and a Monnick for product rule.

122
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,720
So here we do derivative here and derivative here.

123
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,800
All right let's see what this gives us.

124
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,770
So we have derivative of this function over here.

125
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,100
So we have a constant multiple of three.

126
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,860
We bring down a dictator which is also a 3 X substitute by a less powerful leader.

127
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:29,000
That gives us a two and then mine is a constant derivative of a constant Al-Jazeera.

128
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:37,250
So we don't put it that times X minus then and we have this one here.

129
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:45,550
So three x cubed minus three times a derivative of x and y is a derivative of X..

130
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,910
Well again remember that x is x to 1.

131
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,650
So we bring our dictator down.

132
00:10:51,730 --> 00:11:01,540
So we're bring down our 1 X. And it's going to be one minus one.

133
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,350
Right.

134
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,290
So actually zero.

135
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,600
I know I repeat this one a lot but again the derivative of X or 2 x or 5 x is typically a source of

136
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,780
confusion because the one is not written.

137
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:25,330
Just remember that when you have X you have an exponent of 1 and this is going to be over x squared.

138
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,150
So let's go ahead and simplify.

139
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,700
We have three times three.

140
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,930
Those are the coefficients.

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,730
That's 9.

142
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,630
And we have x squared times x.

143
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,140
So we add the exponents to 1 to 1.

144
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,100
That's going to give us X to the third power that we have minus.

145
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:54,830
So this part over here will become a one right because X to the one when is 1 is X to 0 anything zero

146
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,150
equals 1.

147
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,980
So we have 1 times 1.

148
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:05,270
It's just 1 so therefore when you multiply this which is 1 times this you're just going to get this

149
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,160
right.

150
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,510
And you think times 1 equals the anything again.

151
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,930
So this is what we have on this side.

152
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:22,800
Mine is 3 x cubed minus three over x squared.

153
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:33,050
Now remember what I said this negative sign distributes over here and over here as well.

154
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,810
All right.

155
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,270
So let's go ahead and do that.

156
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,180
So we have 9 x cubed

157
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,510
minus and then remember negative times a positive is a negative.

158
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:57,090
So that's going to give you negative 3 x cubed and then a negative times a negative is a positive.

159
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:07,700
So it's going to give you that positive three plus three and we have x squared on the bottom and finally

160
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:16,380
we can simplify because we have two terms that have the same exponents 9 x cubed and 3 execute.

161
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,590
So I remember when they have the same exponents you know you're going to keep the exponents because

162
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,650
you're just adding or subtracting.

163
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,610
And what you do is you take the coefficients and you work with them.

164
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,690
So nine minus three is six.

165
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,250
That's it.

166
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,160
All you have left is a plus three and everything over x squared.

167
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,080
That is our answer.

168
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,640
You see how easy life is with mnemonics.

169
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,720
You just go OK product minus the B.S. and you just get it right away.

170
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,390
All right great.

171
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,840
Let's do our last example.
