00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
Hello they're welcome to another session of limit less calculus.

2
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.790
Today we're going to cover a very cool concept called Limits.

3
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.170
We're going to talk about what they are how they work and their properties.

4
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.540
So to get started on limits I want you to think of something so I imagine that to get to school every

5
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
morning you have to drive from your house

6
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.260
up to school

7
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.490
and let's say that for some divine reason you live on the same street as your school.

8
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.720
So you don't have to make any turns you just go directly from your house to school.

9
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.680
It's a straight line.

10
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.700
And every morning you take the same route and every time you take that route it takes you 20 minutes

11
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.620
to get there.

12
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.420
On average.

13
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.950
All right.

14
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.420
Wouldn't that be beautiful.

15
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.490
That would be awesome.

16
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.730
Unless you live on campus which is even better.

17
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.390
But again just for the sake of the example you drive to school from your house every morning and it

18
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.440
takes you 20 minutes.

19
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:49.020
So one morning as you're driving toward school and you get to the last stop which is here you notice

20
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.070
that there's a detour

21
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.680
Oh no it's going to take you more than 20 minutes.

22
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.750
You're going to be late to class.

23
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.320
So what the Detour does is it actually takes you through this route.

24
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.900
OK so you have to come down.

25
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.370
You have to make a left.

26
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.010
I'm saying left looking at it from the point of view of the car and you have to make another left and

27
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.620
then you have to make one more left.

28
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.640
So you were driving towards Call your usual route but then you had to take a detour.

29
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.450
You still got there at the end but you didn't get there through the usual route.

30
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.100
Enter the concept of limits OK.

31
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.950
Perfect.

32
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.870
So now we have the definition of a limit.

33
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.160
A limit is the y value that a function is approaching assets x value approaches a number.

34
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.640
I'll repeat that again.

35
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.300
The y value that a function is approaching assets x value approaches a number.

36
00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.490
The first thing I want you to note is a limit is a number that a y value is approaching.

37
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.560
All right.

38
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.140
Once you get this the fact that we're talking about y values the height of the function it's going to

39
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.250
be a lot easier.

40
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.120
So again a limit is the y value that a function is approaching.

41
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.450
So just remember what we were talking about just now you drive to school every morning as you drive

42
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.790
towards school.

43
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.300
What is it that you're approaching or approaching school.

44
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.010
Right.

45
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.110
But then you had to take a detour at the end of the day.

46
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.080
Let's say you got there late to class.

47
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.940
Well it doesn't matter for limits because for a limit what matters is why is it that you are approaching

48
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900
what are you getting close to.

49
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.010
Let's say that is a farfetched scenario that as you're driving to school you'll find out that the school

50
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.350
moved yesterday to a different place.

51
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.470
Well you were approaching school.

52
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.390
It doesn't matter if eventually you got there or not but you were approaching it.

53
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.880
That's what limits are all about y values approaching certain numbers as x values approach other numbers

54
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.360
and here's how we didn't know limits

55
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.280
we say lym of fallbacks

56
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:38.660
as x approaches see equals L and actually if you're observant enough you'll notice that the logo for

57
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.260
limitless calculus is based on this.

58
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.920
The logo looks something like this.

59
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.660
It's LYM.

60
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.800
And then you have the rest.

61
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.600
So this part the limb actually came from the concept of limits.

62
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.910
So again to denote a limit we say Lim of f of x f of x is the function for which are finding a limit

63
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.280
as x approaches c.

64
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.670
So remember as the input approaches a certain value then the y value or the output approaches a certain

65
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.190
y value doesn't matter if it gets there at the end of the day or it doesn't one important thing about

66
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.020
limits is that they can be approached from the left or from the right.

67
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.400
Now what does that mean.

68
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.730
Well let me show you here with a quick graph.

69
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.720
So let's say we have this function

70
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.970
OK OK so I know you're thinking What the heck is that.

71
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.860
It's called a piecewise function.

72
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.530
And now explain right now how it works.

73
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.800
Piecewise

74
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.960
function.

75
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.990
So a piecewise function is a function that is composed of different functions for different intervals.

76
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.310
So for example from here to the left it's a curve.

77
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.270
However from here to the right it's a line.

78
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.120
All right.

79
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.470
So let's say that this is one to the left of one we have a certain function that's a curve and then

80
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.870
to the right of one we have another function which is a line.

81
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.570
Doesn't this not pass the vertical line to us.

82
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.290
Because if you draw a vertical line here then it's touching the graph at two points.

83
00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.690
If you draw a vertical line here it actually does pass the vertical line test because the function is

84
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.770
defined here.

85
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.210
For one not here.

86
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.850
So if I plug in one into this piecewise function it's going to give me this value here not the one down

87
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.340
here.

88
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.470
And we know that because this circle is filled then this one is actually not filled in.

89
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.430
OK.

90
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:30.610
So we don't have to get into too much detail about piecewise functions but let's do the limit.

91
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:37.820
OK so let's say that this y value is 3 right.

92
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.300
So we go up 1 to 3.

93
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.160
This is three.

94
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.980
And this is let's say 7 OK.

95
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:56.940
So let's get the limit of this function as it approaches one from the left and one from the right we'll

96
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.910
do it over here.

97
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.560
So the limits of fallbacks

98
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.770
as it approaches

99
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.750
one from the left.

100
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.390
So we don't know whether a limit is approaching from the left or from the right.

101
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:26.860
We say as x approaches the number and then we put either the negative sign for the left or positive

102
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.320
sign for right I'll put that here for you.

103
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.840
So negative means left

104
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.340
and positive means right.

105
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:56.340
So as we approach this value of 1 from the left it looks like when it gets there it's going to be three

106
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.400
right.

107
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.650
So again if I take this function and one is over here.

108
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:09.590
So we need to approach the point at one from the left you come from the left come from the left come

109
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.690
from the left.

110
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.920
And again it looks like the y value that it is approaching is at 3.

111
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.490
So for that reason the answer to this is three.

112
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.150
Now what happens if we approach it from the right

113
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.020
as x approaches one from the right.

114
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.180
It's positive.

115
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.420
Well let's look at the function again.

116
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.210
So we're approaching 1.

117
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.600
However we're not doing it from the left anymore.

118
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.760
We're doing it from the right.

119
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:51.420
So as you approach it from the right from the right from the right you approaching one approaching 1

120
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:57.920
Bam when you get here it looks like it's approaching 7 right.

121
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.230
It looks like when it gets there how it's going to be seven.

122
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.840
Therefore our limit here is 7.

123
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.300
So what do we have here.

124
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.170
We have a limit approaching from the left and a limit approaching from the right.

125
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.970
They're both approaching one just from different sites.

126
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.010
So what I want you to understand is for this function f of one is not defined here but it's defined

127
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.850
up here so f of 1 for this function

128
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.230
equals 7.

129
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.290
That means that if I plug in one into this function whatever the function is it's going to give me the

130
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:46.070
point 1 7 and again we know this because the circle is filled in up here now down here.

131
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:53.600
However for limits it does not matter where the function is defined as you can see the limit of f of

132
00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:04.790
x x approaches 1 from the left is already here 3 because the y value is approaching 3.

133
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.480
It doesn't matter that it's not three at that point.

134
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.060
What matters is is that it's actually approaching it.

135
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.860
That's why the limit here is equal to 3.

136
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:22.530
Same thing for the limit as it approaches from the right limit of every x x x approaches one from the

137
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.390
right.

138
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.260
Again as you come from the right it looks like it's going to be seven.

139
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.800
That's why the limit is seven.

140
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:37.740
Now it turns out that this limit is actually accurate because not only is it approaching 7 it's actually

141
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.210
7 when you get there.

142
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.460
But in the other limit from the left it's not three when you get there.

143
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.110
But again that doesn't matter.

144
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.940
What matters is that it's actually approaching.

145
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.000
So again he points for limits.

146
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.820
Number one no they are talking about what the y value is approaching.

147
00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.780
And number two key word here is approaching again.

148
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.160
Doesn't matter what it is when you get there.

149
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.560
Just the fact that you're getting there is enough for a limit.

150
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.800
All right so let's throw a familiar limit.

151
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.310
OK.

152
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.360
So let's try for example.

153
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.940
Half of X equals

154
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.120
2 x plus 1.

155
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.660
All right.

156
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.640
So let's go ahead and grab this function sort of it.

157
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.390
Again we just grab two points.

158
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.210
X and y let's plug in

159
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:48.380
0 2 times 0 plus 1 to them 0 0.

160
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.880
So we just keep the 1.

161
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.690
So our first point is 0 1

162
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:03.650
and it's plug in 1 so two of times won

163
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.160
plus one that's two times one is two plus one is three.

164
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.790
So that's one.

165
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.610
All right.

166
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.540
So we're ready to grab this function since we have our two points.

167
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.130
So our first point is going to be a 0 1 so x 0.

168
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:38.980
We did not move left or right and we moved one up because Y is positive and our second point is 1 3.

169
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:47.670
So we move one to the right because it's positive 1 and 3 up because it's positive 3 1 2 3

170
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.910
right.

171
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.990
Again remember that's supposed to be a straight line but I cannot draw for the life of me.

172
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.460
So OK we have our function and we have a graph for that function

173
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.440
let's say that we want to find the limit as x approaches

174
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.620
1 OK.

175
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:30.870
We know that when it actually gets there when it actually gets to 1 the y values 3 let's see what f

176
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.930
of x is approaching as x approaches 1.

177
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:50.510
So first let's do it from the left limit of IVAX as x approaches one from the left.

178
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.180
And in fact we'll do it a little bit differently this time.

179
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.300
So we'll have a table

180
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:09.430
and if we're approaching one from the left that means that the values the x values are getting closer

181
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.180
and closer and closer to 1.

182
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.450
So I'm going to just pick three values that are really close to 1.

183
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.040
So 0.9

184
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.710
0 Whoops.

185
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.690
Let's try that again.

186
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:38.360
Zero point nine nine and even closer zero point nine nine nine.

187
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.810
All right.

188
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.030
And we're going to plug in all of these into our function here.

189
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.260
And you don't have to go into the trouble of plugging those in.

190
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.580
I already got the numbers and I'm going to plug them in.

191
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:56.570
So remember all we're doing is taking these x values and plug in them in each one into this function.

192
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.810
So I have the results right here with me.

193
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:12.310
So when X equals 0.9 y equals two points eight when X equals zero point nine nine y equals two point

194
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:27.360
ninety eight and when X equals zero point nine nine nine y equals two point nine nine eight interesting.

195
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:36.740
So as X is getting closer to 1 first 0.9 then zero point nine nine and then zero point nine nine nine.

196
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.080
Why is getting closer to what.

197
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:47.630
Well first it is 2.8 then two point ninety eight and that two point nine nine eight right.

198
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.220
So it seems like it's getting closer and closer to three.

199
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:59.570
So we have really strong evidence that as x approaches one from the left then the y value approaches

200
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.200
three.

201
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:07.069
So I'll say that the limit of x x x approaches one from the left is three based on her evidence down

202
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.500
here.

203
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.920
Now let's do it from the right.

204
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.500
And of course the limit from the right I have to do it on the right.

205
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.560
No I'm just kidding.

206
00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.550
You really have to.

207
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:24.130
But for this example I did the limit from the left is on the left and the limit from the right is actually

208
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:37.420
on the right which we're doing right now a limit of half of X as x approaches 1 from the right.

209
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.660
So let's continue in the next video.
