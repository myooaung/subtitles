00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.630
So let's go over a really useful mnemonic lesson.

2
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.360
I know we've talked about a lot about concavity and inflection points and increasing and decreasing.

3
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.270
And with all of that stuff going on you might be thinking oh is concavity with the first or second derivative

4
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.560
does inflection point have to do with the increase or with the concavity.

5
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.510
And what was the relative extrema again does it go with the second derivative or the first.

6
00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.530
So point is there is a lot of stuff going on and I don't want you to confuse interims of what we do

7
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.530
with each derivative.

8
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.240
For that reason I came up with this mnemonic.

9
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.420
So it says to remember what the first and second derivatives each do what you're going to do is you're

10
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.630
going to think about this abbreviation F I R and S E C and you might be thinking OK so how do I remember

11
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.460
those.

12
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.410
Well f I are is just the first three letters of first an S E C is the first three letters of second.

13
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.950
Right.

14
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.780
So if I R and C C so as you might have guessed we're going to use fir to remember what the first derivative

15
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.370
does.

16
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.390
And we're going to use SEC to remember what the second derivative does.

17
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.060
It's that easy.

18
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.020
All right.

19
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.320
So we have

20
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.949
and we have SEC.

21
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.430
All right.

22
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.460
So obviously the F is for first right.

23
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:29.460
That's how we know we're talking about the first derivative then this is for increasing and decreasing.

24
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.320
And then this R is for relative

25
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.310
extrema see that.

26
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.660
So if you remember fir which again is the first three letters of first for first derivative then you

27
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.140
know the first derivative is the one you used to find increasing and decreasing intervals and also the

28
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.470
one you use to find relative extrema.

29
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.370
We're going to do the same thing for sec.

30
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.630
So the first sac is for second.

31
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.120
Obviously the second derivative then the E.

32
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.660
So right the easy a little bit tricky because what's supposed to go here is inflection points but obviously

33
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.920
it's not an eye it's an E.

34
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.370
So the way I want you to think of this is think of the word inflection.

35
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.320
So what I want you to think about is think of the word inflection as inflection.

36
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.930
The inflection all right

37
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.960
what I don't want to happen is for you to go ahead and say OK inflexions starts with an I.

38
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.500
So inflection would be here no.

39
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.740
And that's a problem.

40
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.410
We have increasing which starts with an eye an inflection which also starts with an eye.

41
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.280
So think of this word as inflection and it's pronounced as reflexion

42
00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.570
All right.

43
00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.300
And refl. has an E which matches with this E.

44
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.630
All right.

45
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.650
So in Fluxion rhymes with re flexion and refl. has this E.

46
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.650
So that's how you know that this e belongs to inflection points and then thankfully the C is pretty

47
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.700
easy it's just concavity.

48
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.930
Isn't that nice.

49
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.170
We can just go ahead and use the actual names first and second to find out what the first derivative

50
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.510
and the second derivative do.

51
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:59.160
So again for a first derivative for increasing and decreasing and for finding relative extrema.

52
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.800
Remember that relative extrema are the points where the function goes from increasing to decreasing

53
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.390
or vice a versa.

54
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.100
On the other hand we have the SEC.

55
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.800
So sad for the second derivative the second derivative is used to find concavity remember whether the

56
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.300
graph opens up or down and then these inflection points is where the concavity changes.

57
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.240
So you might have noticed a parallel.

58
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.390
Remember that we find relative extrema where the first derivative equals zero or is undefined.

59
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:40.460
We also find the inflection points where the second derivative is either 0 or undefined.

60
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.410
And then the function goes from increasing to decreasing or vice a versa where the relative extremes

61
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.510
are in the same way.

62
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.020
The function changes concavity from up to down or down to up at the inflection points.

63
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.370
So there's definitely a parallel between intervals of concavity and inflection points and intervals

64
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.360
of increase and decrease and relative extrema just that these two use the first derivative and these

65
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
two use the second.

66
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.770
All right so just to give you a quick visual and this is not part of the mnemonic than a Monika's is

67
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.240
the for and the SEC.

68
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.610
All right but just to give you a quick visual for example.

69
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.790
Here the function is increasing increasing.

70
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.550
Then you get to a relative extrema.

71
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.610
So this is our and then it starts decreasing.

72
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.720
All right.

73
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.770
And you could do the same with a minute.

74
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.930
This would just be a max.

75
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.030
But the main would be the same thing.

76
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.120
And here we have something similar.

77
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.380
So we have for example this and this is concave down.

78
00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.320
This is concave up and inflection points because that's how I like to call it.

79
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.840
So it makes sense for this mnemonic is right here.

80
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:13.430
So that for the E is right if you're observant you might have noticed that actually the graph is concave

81
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.680
down here.

82
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.310
And the graph is increasing and decreasing here and then it increases again.

83
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.020
So there is some relation to these concepts.

84
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:29.600
However notice that for example when the graph is concave down it's it can be both increasing and decreasing

85
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.940
because this whole thing is concave down.

86
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.730
But it has both increasing and decreasing intervals in the same way.

87
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.520
For example this is concave up right here.

88
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.390
And it also has decreasing and then increasing intervals.

89
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:53.090
So again just an observation nothing to worry about what I want you to take away from this is again

90
00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.530
use the mnemonic for and SEC the three letters of first and second and then figure out what each one

91
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:00.950
does.

92
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.110
In case you ever forget in the middle of your homework in the middle of a test in the middle of your

93
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.290
final practice is going to help you out a lot.

94
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.480
And that's it for this mnemonic.
