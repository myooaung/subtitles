00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,530
Hello they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,260
Today we're going to cover domain and range of a function.

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,930
So we already said that X represents or input so X is our input

4
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,550
and Y is our output

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,540
and here come into play the concept of domain and range.

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,090
So first let's start with domain

7
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,710
so domain of a function is the group of allowable

8
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:24,290
put in quotes allowable x values.

9
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,870
In other words the domain is a group of allowable input for a function.

10
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,830
You might be thinking.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,650
Wait what.

12
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,090
What do you mean allowed.

13
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,560
Am I not allowed to plug in any number I want into a function.

14
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,840
Well not really.

15
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,020
There are certain numbers that you cannot plug in into certain functions.

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,200
And the reason for that is basically divided into three different cases.

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,140
And these cases are number one is division by zero.

18
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,160
The second case is

19
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,460
even root's

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,960
of negative numbers.

21
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:54,740
And number three would be practical applications practical.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,350
OK so we're actually going to go into each one of these cases and see what they mean.

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,400
But just so you know if the function does not have division by zero if it does not have even rude of

24
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:16,570
negative numbers and if it's not limited by practical applications then the domain is all real numbers.

25
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,870
So let me put that down here.

26
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,770
So typically

27
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll put D for a domain the equals all real numbers

28
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:50,630
except for the situations 1 2 and 3 which are again division by zero even root of negative numbers or

29
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,240
practical applications.

30
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,140
So except on two

31
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,550
so again the domain of a function is all real numbers except in the cases when you have one of these

32
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,330
three present and they could actually be together so you could see one in two or you could see one and

33
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,350
three etc. etc..

34
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,620
Now let's go over into division by zero.

35
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:21,970
So

36
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,220
division by zero.

37
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,370
Ha.

38
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,780
The infamous division by zero.

39
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,700
In case you've been living under a rock for the past thousand years let's get this out of the way in

40
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,240
math.

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,440
Division by zero is a big no no.

42
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,200
OK.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,670
Division by zero is no bueno.

44
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,630
You cannot divide by zero.

45
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,720
It's not allowed.

46
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,180
And math.

47
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,510
So why is this.

48
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,040
Well let's say you have six apples sorry bananas.

49
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,590
I still love you and you want to split those six apples between three friends.

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,430
So six apples over three friends is two apples per friend.

51
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,440
But what if you have six apples they need to give away and you have no friends.

52
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,010
And I swear this is not based on my real life.

53
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,980
Please help.

54
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:34,470
So six apples over zero people think about that for a second.

55
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,730
Six apples over zero people.

56
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,420
That does not make any sense.

57
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,070
OK.

58
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,010
So you cannot divide by zero.

59
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,610
Now mathematicians their fancy and they came up with this.

60
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:53,770
Anything divided by zero is undefined not zero not infinity just undefined.

61
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,060
So division

62
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,060
by zero is undefined.

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,420
That is a name they came up with.

64
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,940
So since division by zero is not allowed.

65
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:32,590
What happens when you have something like this for example half of X equals 1 over X minus 3.

66
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,520
What do we do here.

67
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,760
Well we can plug in different numbers.

68
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:49,850
But let's pick a special number let's pick three to plug in.

69
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:59,830
So we have won over three because we're Xs we need to put it three now because that is our input.

70
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,280
Three minus three.

71
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,000
Ha.

72
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,830
Interesting.

73
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:10,260
So now we have what won over three minus three which is zero.

74
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,050
Ha.

75
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,920
So here we have division by zero.

76
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:24,010
This is then on the find.

77
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,710
That means that we cannot plug in three into this function.

78
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:37,980
It's not part of the allowable values for this function f of x therefore the domain of this function

79
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,880
right here domain is

80
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,780
all real numbers.

81
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,890
Except for

82
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,690
what do you think the answer is except for three.

83
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,250
Why.

84
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,350
Well because when you plug in into this function you get division by zero.

85
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,000
Therefore you can not plug in three into this function.

86
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:17,630
That is why the domain which is equal to all allowable input is equal to all real numbers except for

87
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,260
three because three makes it divide by zero.

88
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,770
And again we do not like division by zero.

89
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,100
If you're wondering what a real number is we'll go into that in the next section actually which is where

90
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,380
we talk about the even root of negative numbers.

91
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:44,290
OK so let's go over that even roots of negative numbers and see what the heck that means.

92
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,380
Even roots of negative numbers

93
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,940
OK.

94
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:04,960
So before we get into this let's go over all specific examples of square roots.

95
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,390
So when we talk about squaring a number it means multiply that number by itself.

96
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:20,310
So two squared is equal to two times two is equal to four.

97
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:32,030
Three squared equals three times three which is equal to nine etc. etc..

98
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:42,890
And remember you can actually square negative numbers as well and negative two squared is negative two

99
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:52,830
times negative to remember that a negative times a negative is a positive.

100
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,990
That is also equal to four.

101
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,420
So two squared is equal to four and negative two squared is equal to four.

102
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,660
And by the way if you do not remember this one and put it right here on the right.

103
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:12,010
Remember that a negative times a negative

104
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,870
equals a positive

105
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:28,070
and the negative over a negative also equals a positive.

106
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,060
And of course positive times positive positive and positive over positive is also positive.

107
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,160
So the only time you're going to switch sides is when you have different signs OK.

108
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,720
So this is all positive.

109
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,490
But if you have for example a positive times a negative

110
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,550
that gives you a negative and if you have a positive

111
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:12,360
over negative that also gives you a negative.

112
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,510
All right.

113
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,330
So again we have three cases either everything's positive in which case everything is going to be positive.

114
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,930
There's no negatives anywhere.

115
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,130
The second case is where everything's negative multiplying or dividing.

116
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,950
In that case you're going to get a positive.

117
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,650
All right.

118
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:37,180
So as a general rule if you're multiplying or dividing two things of the same sign that's going to give

119
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,040
you a positive that can be both negative or they can be both positive.

120
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,860
Now where things get interesting is when you have stuff with different signs.

121
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,070
So when you have a positive terms a negative or a negative times a positive or a positive over a negative

122
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,190
or a negative over a positive that's always going to be negative results.

123
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,940
So when you have different signs the result is negative.

124
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,510
When you have the same sign the result is positive.

125
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,060
OK.

126
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:16,880
So going back to our roots was one more example of a negative being squared so negative three times

127
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:26,130
negative three negative three times negative three is just nine.

128
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,660
All right.

129
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,640
The point is if you square something it's always going to be a positive number.

130
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,000
Here we have four here we have nine here we have four.

131
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,070
And here we have nine as well.

132
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,020
So when you square something it can never be negative.

133
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:52,420
So remember if you find the square root of a number for example the square root of nine it's going to

134
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:05,560
be what number gives you nine will you multiply it by itself the answer is actually three but not only

135
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,010
three.

136
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,910
It's plus or minus three because that three could be positive three times three equals nine and that

137
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,870
three can also be negative because negative 3 squared is also 9.

138
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,960
Now what happens if I ask you for the square root of negative 9.

139
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:38,260
Remember we're looking for a number so that when you multiply that number by itself it gives you negative

140
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:47,740
9 but is that even possible because we already said that when you multiply something by itself is always

141
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,760
going to give you a positive number.

142
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,460
It matter if it's positive or negative 3.

143
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,250
OK.

144
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,040
So there's really no answer for this.

145
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,650
You cannot get the square root of a negative number.

146
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,980
So just when you thought math cannot get any more weird mathematicians came up with a solution for this

147
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,750
problem.

148
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,480
Imaginary numbers Oh yes good old imaginary numbers.

149
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:23,990
So imaginary numbers.

150
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,480
That isn't weird stuff right there man.

151
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,460
All right.

152
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,410
Yes there is such a thing.

153
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,010
We don't need to go into details because you won't be using them in class but just know that you cannot

154
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,290
put numbers into a function that will give you an even root of a negative number.

155
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,820
Now when I say even roots what I mean is this.

156
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,410
So

157
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:58,060
remember that even numbers are 2 4 6 8 etc..

158
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,500
So you could have even roots like a square root.

159
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:12,420
Remember that if you do not put here a number it is assumed to be a to have the fourth root.

160
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,660
You could have six root etc..

161
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,140
This is an even root because the root over here is an even number.

162
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,110
OK.

163
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:31,160
So quickly going back to our imaginary numbers we say that the square root of negative 9 is 3.

164
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,690
I.

165
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,260
An imaginary number.

166
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,510
Again we're not going to go into detail.

167
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,750
It's pretty much the same as a square root but with a 9 next to it.

168
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,520
But you won't be using them in class.

169
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,060
So no need to worry about imaginary numbers.

170
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,770
OK.

171
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:55,910
So again if you haven't even root of a negative number which is this is an example of that because we

172
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:03,860
have the square root of negative 9 then that means that you're going to get imaginary numbers.

173
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,820
So this is not good.

174
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,090
So how does that all play into what we're trying to find which is domain.

175
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,460
Well let's do a quick example over here.

176
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,490
What happens if you have f x equals

177
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,760
X minus five.

178
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,080
All right.

179
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,950
So let's play in a couple numbers of five.

180
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:46,520
For example is the square root of five minus five that gives as the square root of 0 is zero.

181
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,150
All right so far so good.

182
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,270
What if we plug in 10

183
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,920
that gives us 10 minus 5 equals the square root of 5.

184
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,260
OK.

185
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,580
Also good.

186
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,650
Let's plug in to.

187
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:21,030
So we have to minus five to minus 5 is negative 3.

188
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,230
What do we have here.

189
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,060
We have the square root of a negative number.

190
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,160
Can we get that can it can we get a real number if we try to find the solution to this.

191
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,830
No.

192
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:41,240
Remember that when you have a negative number under an even rudes that's always going to be imaginary.

193
00:17:41,240 --> 00:18:00,280
So if you have a negative number and the route is even that is going to give you an imaginary number.

194
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:10,180
So this means that for this function f of x 2 is not in the domain because when you plug into you get

195
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,190
a square root of a negative number.

196
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,660
And again that gives imaginary numbers which we don't deal with.

197
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,540
OK.

198
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,850
So let's try plugging in another number.

199
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,390
Let's plug in one.

200
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:32,900
So we have 1 minus five equals square root of negative 4.

201
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,890
And there again we run into the same problem.

202
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,570
We're trying to get the square root of a negative number.

203
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,120
Again this is not good.

204
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,670
We cannot use one as a domain.

205
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:51,980
So you can see that some numbers we can plug in five and 10 are OK but some other numbers like to 1.

206
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,010
We cannot plug in.
