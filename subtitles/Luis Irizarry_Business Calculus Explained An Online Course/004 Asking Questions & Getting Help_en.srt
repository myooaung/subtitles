00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,150
Hey what's going on.

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,760
So you've got the Course you're now my student and I am your online tutor.

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,530
My goal is for you to pass this class.

4
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,420
I want you to understand the concepts.

5
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:38,040
I want you to be able to do the problems so that you can eventually be done with basic calculus.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,280
That's what I want.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,140
Now I did invest a lot of hours into making this course as easy to understand as possible as clear as

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,060
possible.

9
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,670
I did a lot of editing a lot of recording a lot of voice overs etc..

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,570
That doesn't mean that everything will always make sense at all times.

11
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,290
There might be times where you get lost so sometimes you might have some questions for me.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,020
So maybe watching a tutorial and something doesn't make sense.

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,250
Or maybe you think it should be another thing.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,030
Maybe I made a mistake even though I double check all the problems.

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,930
Maybe gives you a different result and it turns out that it was my bad.

16
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,900
So if anything comes up there are two main ways to ask me questions.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,090
The first way is in the general dashboard.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,950
So if you go to the general dashboard for the course you can go to the Q&A section right here and here

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,630
you'll see that you can either search for a question or you can ask a new question.

20
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,490
So don't be shy.

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,440
If you have a question about the course about a specific problem about a specific topic.

22
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,800
I am here to help.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,570
Now this is more for generic questions.

24
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,020
You can actually ask a question within a specific video

25
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,890
so let's say that you're doing marginal analysis and you have a question for a certain video.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,460
So let's say you have a question about the mnemonic for marginal analysis.

27
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,430
So you're in the video.

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,710
Go ahead and pause it.

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,050
And here you see a button that's called Brough's Q&A.

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,170
You can actually click here and if other people have asked questions you'll see them listed here.

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,170
And you yourself can ask can you question about this specific video.

32
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,850
So if your question is about a specific thing in a specific video I would totally suggest for you to

33
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,790
pose your questions within the video that way.

34
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,370
Number one it's easier for me to know what you're talking about.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,960
And number two other people can benefit if they have the same question as you.

36
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,870
All right.

37
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,580
So there you go.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,100
You have two ways of asking me questions in the general dashboard.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,410
And in this specific video.

40
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:01,190
So don't be shy if you have a question about anything please contact me if you need help.

41
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,010
I want to make sure that you pass this class so if something doesn't make sense even after you watch

42
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:14,040
the video once or twice or three times hey write me a question I'll be more than happy to help.
