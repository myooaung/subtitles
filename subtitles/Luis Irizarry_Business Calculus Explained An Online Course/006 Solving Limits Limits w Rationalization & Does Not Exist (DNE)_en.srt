1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:37,130
OK and so the second technique that we can use is called rationalization.

2
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,900
And basically what this is is working with roots in order to be able to evaluate the limits.

3
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,580
So for example let's do a quick problem here.

4
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,670
I say that we have limits of

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:07,700
square root IVAX minus six over X minus 36

6
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,680
as x approaches 36 OK.

7
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,300
So again to find the limits plug it in.

8
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,380
First thing you do.

9
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:40,540
So this becomes you plug in square roots of 36 minus 6 over 36 because it's X minus 36 again.

10
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,370
Oh look so we have a problem.

11
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:55,730
We get discarded of 36 is 6 minus 6 0 on top which again is ok but then we have 36 minus 36 on the bottom.

12
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,240
So we get zero zero.

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,990
Again no bueno.

14
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,490
Let's give that a shot.

15
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,300
So let's say limit of just rewriting it again.

16
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:20,110
Square root of x minus 6 over X minus 36.

17
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:20,970
OK.

18
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,650
So we definitely need to manipulate this in some way so that we can actually evaluate the limit.

19
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,630
And as you can see there's nothing really to factor.

20
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,140
So what do we do.

21
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,030
Well we rationalize.

22
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:42,800
So how do we rationalize we basically multiply this whole fraction on top and bottom by a conjugate.

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,880
I'll explain what that is for rationalization.

24
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,970
We multiply

25
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,690
the top and the bottom

26
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:08,780
by a conjugate.

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,810
OK so what is a conjugate.

28
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,180
Let's find out.

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,870
So to rationalize all we do is we look at the term with a square root and we multiply by the conjugate

30
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,370
the conjugate being the same expression.

31
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,190
But with the changed sign.

32
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,890
Right.

33
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,360
So the conjugate is

34
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,000
the same expression

35
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,850
with different sign.

36
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,470
Here are some examples of conjugates for example.

37
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:15,770
If you have a square root of x minus 6 conjugate it will be square root of x plus six.

38
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,110
So we just went from a minus to a plus.

39
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,820
That's it.

40
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,300
That's a conjugate.

41
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:32,960
Again another example is the square root of x minus nine the conjugate of that will be square root of

42
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,580
x plus 9.

43
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,990
Again we're just changing the sign in the middle.

44
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,310
All right.

45
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,880
So actually this first one here is the one that we need to use.

46
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,550
So again we multiply the top and the bottom by a conjugate.

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,780
So the conjugate of this square root of x minus 6 and again let me repeat once more you get the conjugate

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,880
of the expression with the square root.

49
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,090
All right so what we're doing is we're manipulating this function in order to be able to evaluate the

50
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,970
limit so we multiply by the conjugate of the expression that has a square root.

51
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,420
So the conjugate of a square root of x minus 6 is

52
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:31,190
X plus 6 and the same thing on the bottom square root of x plus 6.

53
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,940
All right all of that as x approaches 36.

54
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,760
All right so what does that equal to.

55
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,310
All right.

56
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,990
So remember what we're doing here is we're multiplying fractions so we multiply the top Times the top

57
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,610
and the bottom times the bottom.

58
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,230
OK.

59
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,800
So it's this multiplied by this and this multiplied by this.

60
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,920
When I say this I mean this whole thing by this whole thing.

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,900
And the same thing on top right.

62
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,100
So let's multiply the ones on top and see what we get.

63
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,600
So we have screwed of X times square root of x.

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,930
Remember if you multiply the square root of something again by itself it's going to give you that something

65
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,470
for example the square root of 9 is 3.

66
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,570
So square root of nine times square root of 9 is 3 times 3 which gives you back 9.

67
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,710
So it's pretty much removing this square root.

68
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,390
All right.

69
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,150
The square root of x times square root of x is just x.

70
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,400
And if that didn't make a lot of sense.

71
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,480
Don't worry I will go into more problems later on.

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,000
And remember here we're doing foil.

73
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,010
Remember foil so foil it's funny foil is actually on a Monnick but I didn't come up with it.

74
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,310
Of course I'm sure you've seen it before.

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,670
It stands for first

76
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,650
outer

77
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:15,190
inner and last and again foil is used when you're multiplying something like this when you have for

78
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,970
example

79
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,010
a plus b times c plus D.

80
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,970
All right.

81
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,030
So the first you multiply the first which is the f.

82
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,600
So you have a the first one here times.

83
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,990
See the first one here.

84
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:44,990
Then you multiply the outer the outers are a over here and over here then you multiply the inner the

85
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,360
inner R B and C and then you multiply the last which are B and D.

86
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,600
And that is foil.

87
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,040
So that's exactly what we're doing here.

88
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:04,060
So first we do the math which is for first so squared of X times square root of x then we multiply the

89
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,780
outer.

90
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:16,170
So we have a square root of x will do plus square root of x times 6.

91
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,840
And actually all we would write is instead of saying is quoted of X time 6 I'll say six square root

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,430
of X..

93
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
That's usually how it's written.

94
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,560
OK.

95
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,440
So that's first then we did our.

96
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,530
Now we do enter.

97
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,070
So negative six times square root of x.

98
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,630
So we do minus six quarterbacks.

99
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:49,420
And then finally we have the last which is negative 66 which is negative 36 right positive times a negative

100
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,330
is a negative.

101
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,620
All right so we multiply this whole thing on top and to finish up this limit we're actually not going

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,390
to touch the ones on the bottom.

103
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,580
We're just going to leave it as multiplying.

104
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,350
OK.

105
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,480
So I hope you're seeing how this works.

106
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,330
You rationalize by getting the conjugate of the term with the roots and then you actually go ahead with

107
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,890
the multiplication of this conjugate on top.

108
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,250
You do it explicitly.

109
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,100
You actually do foil on the bottom you just leave it as an expression on the bottom are going to leave

110
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:33,180
it as X minus 36 times square root of x plus 6 right.

111
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,660
And let's see what happens down here.

112
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,740
So check it out.

113
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,150
We have six quarterbacks minus 6 square root of x.

114
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,970
So you're actually subtracting something from itself right.

115
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,280
This six square root of x is positive.

116
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,500
And this six quartet of x is negative.

117
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,300
So these cancel out.

118
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,130
Interesting.

119
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,630
That is why we do rationalization.

120
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,230
See we just got rid of this square root and now we're going to do something else.

121
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,010
So we have actually continue this in the next page.

122
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,870
So let me rewrite what we just had.

123
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,140
So we had limits of

124
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,600
X plus six x

125
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,870
minus six quarterbacks

126
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:44,370
minus 36 and everything over

127
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,590
remember.

128
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,170
On the bottom we leave it the way it was.

129
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,020
And we do not multiply.

130
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:10,070
So we are multiplying but we're not actually doing the multiplication of X plus 6 as x approaches 36.

131
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:18,130
So like we said this part on top cancels out the six scores of X and the minus 6 quarter of X..

132
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,020
Just to give you a visual.

133
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:28,640
That's like saying three minus three that's going to be equal to zero because you're subtracting something

134
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,720
from itself.

135
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,290
That's exactly what we're doing here.

136
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,050
Six square root of x minus 6 Karoon of X is going to be zero.

137
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,570
All right.

138
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,200
So what do we have left on top.

139
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,580
Well we have X minus 36 that's all we have left.

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,140
And still on the bottom we have X minus 36

141
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,100
and square root of x 6

142
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,870
as x approaches 36.

143
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,190
So what happens now.

144
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,380
Well interesting because we have X minus 36 on top.

145
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,270
And we also have X minus 36 and bottom.

146
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,380
Multiplying this.

147
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,830
But remember you're dividing this over this whole thing.

148
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:34,170
So you can basically do is you can take this X minus 36 and cancel it out with this X minus 36.

149
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,840
Let me give you a visual of what's going on here.

150
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,340
So if you have two over two times three

151
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,100
well you have two over six right because two times three is six.

152
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:59,950
However it is factored down here so we can do is we can say to over 2 these cancel out and all you have

153
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,170
left is one on top.

154
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,510
And three on the bottom.

155
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,840
That's your answer.

156
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,530
So that's exactly what we're doing here because we have X minus 36 and both top on the bottom we can

157
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,340
cancel widow

158
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,660
and then we have just one on top because you know there's nothing else

159
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:38,070
and on the bottom all we have left is square root of x plus 6 a right to the limit of that as x approaches

160
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,220
36.

161
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,870
All right.

162
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,920
So interesting.

163
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,760
It looks like if we plug in 36 now it's going to be OK.

164
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,880
Let's give it a shot.

165
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,380
So to find the limits plug it in.

166
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:58,540
It's going to be won over and by the way when we get to this point we don't see a limit as x approaches

167
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,610
36 because we're actually evaluating the limit.

168
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,280
So when you plug it in at that point you're done.

169
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,610
All right so one over.

170
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,390
And then we plug in 36 down here.

171
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:16,730
So we have square root of thirty six plus six

172
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:29,120
one over square root of 36 remember is six because six times six is 36 plus this other six that we had

173
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
here.

174
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,900
And that's going to be one over six plus six which is 12.

175
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,120
Guess what that is your limit.

176
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,540
That is the answer.

177
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,980
So see what we did.

178
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:49,840
We rationalized so we multiplied by the conjugate of the expression with the square root then we do

179
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,670
foil on that expression with the square root being multiplied by the conjugate.

180
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:01,010
The other expression we leave it as multiplying so we multiply this through.

181
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,820
We only do it on top because the top is where you have your square root initially or your roots.

182
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,990
In general and after that we can cancel out the common terms and the top on the bottom and that's going

183
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,870
to give you an expression that you can actually work with.

184
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,330
So at this point you just go ahead and plug in there 36 and you don't get 0 0 0 anymore.

185
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,890
You get 1 over 12.

186
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,160
That is it.

187
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,570
I know this example was probably a little bit complicated but we'll do a couple more in the example

188
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,260
section so guess what.

189
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,320
Not all limits exist.

190
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,260
Some times you're going to bump into limits that do not exist.

191
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:47,620
And when it doesn't exist we just say D and E does not exist.

192
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,940
So how do we know when a limit exists and when it doesn't.

193
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:59,930
Remember that sometimes when you plug in a number into a function to get a limit then you get a denominator

194
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,990
of 0.

195
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,150
Well there are two cases.

196
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:10,820
Either you get zero over zero or you get a number.

197
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,630
Over zero.

198
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:24,080
So if you get zero zero I'll go back to the example that we did which was limit of square root of x

199
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:39,160
minus 6 over X minus 36 as x approaches 36 so we would try plugging in 36 over here.

200
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
We're going to get squirt of 36.

201
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,810
That's six and six.

202
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,250
Minus 6 is zero.

203
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,130
So that's going to give you zero on top.

204
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,530
And you plug in 36 on the bottom you get 36 minors 36 0 on the bottom.

205
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,570
So here you get zero on both the top and the bottom.

206
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,710
When that's the case the limit might exist.

207
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,680
So at that point you're going to try to either factor

208
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,800
or rationalize whichever actually applies to whatever you're doing.

209
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,569
And the more limits you do the better you get at determining whether you can factor or rationalize.

210
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,450
So it's a matter of practice pretty much.

211
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,819
All right.

212
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,290
So 00 you can still keep looking.

213
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:40,660
Our second case where we have a number over 0 at that point we say that the limit does not exist.

214
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,710
All right.

215
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,720
So this is like the topic in general.

216
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,430
First case the limit could exist.

217
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:58,080
Number over zero the limit does not exist and was doing example limit of 1 over X as x approaches zero.

218
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
So what happens when you try to plug in zero into this function.

219
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,730
You get 1 over 0.

220
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:17,370
So again for 1 over 0 we say that the limits of one over x x x approaches zero does not exist.

221
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,400
So limit might not exist for a couple of reasons.

222
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,370
Maybe the limit from the left is not the same as the limit from the right.

223
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,170
So at that point it doesn't exist.

224
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:38,110
And the other case is where a limit tends toward infinity like positive infinity or minus infinity.

225
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,980
Which is a topic that will cover later on.

226
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,340
Right now we're just focusing on regular limits.

227
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,050
All right.

228
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,240
So what I want you to get out of this is if it's 0 0 0 you can still try to do something else to try

229
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,170
to get the limit.

230
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,900
If it's a number over 0 then the limit does not exist.

231
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,950
And by the way there is such a thing as for example limit being positive infinity or negative infinity

232
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,710
or as x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.

233
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,590
The point is that there can be infinite limits.

234
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,240
However we're not going to cover that just now.

235
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,940
We're going to cover that in a separate tutorial later on.

236
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,550
So if your professor starts showing you infinite's in this sector for limits just feel free to skip

237
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,590
to that other section so you can learn the material together.

238
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,430
All right.

239
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:38,090
If not you're good to go for now and just go over what we learned which is limits without infinity.

240
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,320
And then we'll later learn it later.

241
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:46,870
So whichever way your professor gives the class then that's the way you should study

242
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,480
for

243
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,710
five.
