00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.280
All right so I want to make a quick note about something that you'll see when you're dealing with exponential

2
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.940
functions.

3
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.120
And the next topic coming up as well which is a logarithmic functions.

4
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.280
So in math there is a special number called E.

5
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.850
All right.

6
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.950
So when we say e we know we are talking about that number and that number is also called Euler's number

7
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.980
and Euler was a mathematician you know hundreds of years ago super smart guy and he was involved in

8
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.750
the discovery of this number

9
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.240
and I would be very surprised if your professor asked you know where this number comes from.

10
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.180
And basically all classes that I've taught for Bessus calculus all you need to know is that E is a number

11
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.350
that is approximately equal to two point seventy one

12
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.210
right.

13
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.220
So you might see this number as a base often.

14
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.450
So for example you could have something like E to the three.

15
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.320
So to get this you can actually go to calculators and it's funny scientific calculators actually have

16
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.450
this number enough for you to plug in.

17
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.020
So you can actually go to a calculator and say each of the three and get the actual results.

18
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.830
And actually if we go to Google we can actually get the result right there on Google.

19
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.530
So let's see what this one is specifically.

20
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.009
So I just went to Google and typed in E to the three.

21
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.180
Google already knows that.

22
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.520
Is that number that we're talking about.

23
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.940
And it says that the result is this.

24
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.410
All right.

25
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.180
So again big number we'll just approximate it and say it's approximately equal to 20 point 0 9 so will

26
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:35.750
say that E is approximately equal to 20 points 09.

27
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.400
By the way if you've never seen this before this are approximately equal to.

28
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.610
So instead of having the equal sign you have like two squiggly lines like this and that means approximately

29
00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:01.680
equal to.

30
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.340
All right.

31
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.060
So I just want you to be aware of Euler's number.

32
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.070
Again it is a mathematical constant.

33
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:17.510
It never changes and it is approximately equal to two point seventy one.

34
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.820
So you might see it as a base for exponential functions.

35
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.050
In this case this is not really a function.

36
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.220
It's just each of the three.

37
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.300
But you could see it and stuff like this.

38
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.360
For example each of the X so that could be your f of x for a given problem.

39
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.300
Or you could have stuff like f of x equals e to the two x etc. etc..

40
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.890
So this is again an exponential because you have a base which is a number.

41
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.170
And then you have a letter and the exponent also you'll see a lot of e in the section for logarithms

42
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.300
which we're going to cover next.

43
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.220
So again when you see don't get scared.

44
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.910
It's just another number.
