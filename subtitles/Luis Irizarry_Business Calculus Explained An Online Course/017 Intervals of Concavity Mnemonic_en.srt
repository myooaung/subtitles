1
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,470
All right so here's a quick mnemonic for you to remember which one is concave up or concave down.

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,510
So look at the word concave.

3
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,070
So the last four letters are cave.

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,610
Right.

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
So all you have to think about is where does this cave open.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,580
Does it open up or does it open down.

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:01:26,570
And again let's go to our graph so we can see this in action.

8
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:26,940
All right.

9
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,360
So what do we have here.

10
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,100
We have a graph.

11
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,460
And again remember this is only one graph just two different colors so that it's easier to see.

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,270
So the pink parts are actually concave down right.

13
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,950
I want you to look at each of these little mountains and the holes as caves.

14
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,160
Right.

15
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,170
So this is a cave but this for example this first cave where does it open.

16
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,990
It's close on the top so it's opening down right.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,810
It's open.

18
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:09,009
And the bottom part therefore this is concave down.

19
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,490
Then we go to the next.

20
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,780
So it's concave down and then it changes.

21
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,990
And now where is it open towork.

22
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,170
Where does the cave open.

23
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,400
It opens up so it's concave up

24
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,690
right.

25
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,670
And then we have this little mini cave over here.

26
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,390
Again where does this one open.

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,790
There's nothing on the bottom so it's open down.

28
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,740
And this one is down as well.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,920
And finally we have our last cave which goes down like that.

30
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,120
And where does it open.

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,830
Well it's open on top not on the bottom.

32
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,720
So it opens up as well.

33
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,130
All right.

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,640
That's pretty much it for the mnemonic.

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,080
It's super easy.

36
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,760
So again when you see the word concave.

37
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,340
Think about where does a cave open.

38
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,800
Does it open up or does it open down.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,240
And to remember that just look at the actual shape of the cave.

40
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:14,990
If it's close on top and it's open on the bottom then it opens down on the other hand if it's close

41
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:26,290
on the bottom but then it opens up then it opens up so it opens down concave down open up concave up.

42
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,230
That's it.

43
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,450
So he said that to find a concavity we need to use the second derivative.

44
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,940
Let's find out what the second derivative of a function is.
