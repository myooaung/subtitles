00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:29.020
Finally our third step is to put our answer in terms of X that means we do not want any use in our answer.

2
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:37.580
So the answer is through you to the second power times to X we want to substitute this you by it's X

3
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.480
equivalent right x squared minus five.

4
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.990
In this case.

5
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.930
So that's exactly what we did here 3.

6
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.810
And then this is you that was substituted by x squared minus five.

7
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.740
I remember we say that you equals x squared minus 5 in step 1.

8
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.040
So we did this already.

9
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.460
We're just putting it back in terms of x 2 x y and minus 5 to the second power times 2 x.

10
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.240
And here we simply simplified and we said three times 2 x 6 x times x squared minus 5 to the second

11
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.820
power.

12
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.470
This is our derivative.

13
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.820
And I just moved it over here so we could have her answer right here.

14
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.870
All right.

15
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.310
So again general it's not bad at all but it can be tricky at the beginning.

16
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.110
Maybe you looked at this problem and you have no idea what's going on.

17
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.930
Maybe it kind of makes sense but you feel that you need more practice.

18
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.310
If that's the case don't worry we'll do problems and we'll get it into your head for now just remember

19
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.460
ugly daily X-Box.
