00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.370
All right so let's do some exercises on linear functions and slope.

2
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:33.290
So let's start with draw the graph of the line passing through the points 3 5 and 6 8.

3
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.170
All right so we're talking about a linear function.

4
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.540
We know that because the graph is a line and it's just drawing the graph of this line.

5
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.890
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.760
All right.

7
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.620
So there shouldn't be too bad.

8
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.270
All we need to do here is draw our accreditation plain.

9
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.700
Right now we have our x axis and y axis.

10
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.460
And basically what we do is we just plot the two points three five and six eight and then we draw a

11
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.070
line through them and that's it.

12
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.760
So for the first point it's three five.

13
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.680
So that means we move three to the right one to three that's in the x axis and then 5 up for the y axis

14
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.330
because it's positive five.

15
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.890
So one two three four five.

16
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.390
All right.

17
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:41.110
That is the points 3 5.

18
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.910
All right.

19
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.150
And then let's plug the other point which is 6 8.

20
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.920
So we'll move six to the right on the x axis because it's positive and ate up on the y axis because

21
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.140
it's positive.

22
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.970
So this is three.

23
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.420
We're going to move four five six and then we're going to move 8 up.

24
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.139
So this is five six seven eight.

25
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.870
This is our next point six eight.

26
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.690
So after this all we need to do is connect the dots.

27
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.520
And that is going to give us the graph of our line so it should look something like this.

28
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.360
I don't draw exactly straight lines as you know by now but this is a good representation of what the

29
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.630
line looks like.

30
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:56.010
So this line right here is the line that goes through these two points three five and six eight.

31
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.440
All right so let's do another one of these.

32
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.750
Draw the graph of the line passing through the points and then we get another two points points to negative

33
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.990
three and negative 5 and 2.

34
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.010
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

35
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.150
All right so same drill.

36
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.940
Let's see if you got this one.

37
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.020
So we have X Xs and the y axis and let's go ahead and plot these points.

38
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.390
So the first point is two negative three.

39
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.440
So that's two to the right on the x axis 1 2 and then three down because that 3 is negative.

40
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.890
All right.

41
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.960
So that's two to the right and then three down.

42
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.240
So one two three.

43
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.850
All right.

44
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.520
And then we have our next point which is negative 5 and 2.

45
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.690
So that's five to the left on the x axis because this x is negative and 2 up on the y axis.

46
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.990
So we start here we move five to the left.

47
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.020
So that's one two three four five.

48
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.200
And then we move two up.

49
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.399
And the y axis 1 and 2.

50
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.390
All right.

51
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.330
Let me just mark these points.

52
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.660
This one down here is 2 negative 3.

53
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.270
And this one up here is negative 5 to and it will just draw a line connecting the two points.

54
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.320
So there should be something like this and that is the line that connects these two points.

55
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.930
That is the graph of the linear function.

56
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.840
We are done.

57
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.610
All right so now that we graphed are functions let's try a different sort of problem.

58
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.960
Now we have find the slope of the line that passes through the two points.

59
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.670
Negative three 10 and 5 negative 7.

60
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.880
So we are finding here the slope of the line.

61
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.100
You don't need to graph anything.

62
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.590
Boy you need to find the inclination of the line that touches these two points.

63
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.880
In other words the slope.

64
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.960
So go ahead and pause the video and give this one a shot.

65
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.000
All right.

66
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.160
So we're finding this slope.

67
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.470
How do we find slope.

68
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.180
Remember slope equals Well first of all a slope is referred to as m.

69
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.990
Right.

70
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:52.240
And slope equals rise overrun and there's a formula for this race overrun which we covered in the tutorial

71
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.530
difference in a Y over difference in X..

72
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.490
Right.

73
00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:11.480
So it's wide to mine is why a one over to minus x 1 so Rice is the wise and run is the Xs.

74
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.980
OK.

75
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.860
So we just plug in the coordinates of these two points into this formula right.

76
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.290
Let's call this point 1 and let's call this point 2.

77
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.100
This is X-1.

78
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.850
This is why I won this is x 2.

79
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.750
And this is why two so slope is equal to.

80
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.660
So we have y2 which is negative 7

81
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.340
minus y one which is 10

82
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.460
over x 2 which is 5

83
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.930
minus x 1 so minus negative 3.

84
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.350
So mine is negative 3

85
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.770
negative 7 minus 10.

86
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.590
So remember this gets even more negative.

87
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.860
Oh $7.

88
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.580
And you spend 10 more.

89
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.430
Now you owe 17.

90
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.490
So that's negative 17 and on the bottom.

91
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.350
Check it out.

92
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.720
So we have five minus negative three.

93
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.900
Remember that when you have a negative in front of another negative negative times a negative becomes

94
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.400
a positive.

95
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.850
So down here it actually becomes five plus three.

96
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.300
All right.

97
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.910
That's what you get down here.

98
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.220
Negative times a negative becomes a positive.

99
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.480
So plus three and then just to get a final answer.

100
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.360
This is negative 17 over 8.

101
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.900
That is the slope of the line that touches those two points.

102
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.380
All right.

103
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.260
So here we have another example for slope.

104
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:13.480
Find the slope of the line that passes through the points 6 8 and 2 4.

105
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.280
And again we're going to call this point point 1.

106
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:21.750
So here we have X and Y 1 and we're going to call this point 2.

107
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.790
So here we have x 2 and a y 2.

108
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.650
So go ahead and find this slope.

109
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.230
Pause the video and give it a shot.

110
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.190
All right so now let's give it a shot together.

111
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.610
So we have again that slope equals difference and why.

112
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:52.030
Why two minds why one over x two minus x 1.

113
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.790
So again we're just plugging in numbers into this function here.

114
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:05.130
So again what's white two whites who is four minus why one which is eight

115
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.750
over x 2 which is two

116
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.810
and x 1 which is 6.

117
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:28.310
So we have four minus eight is negative four and two minus six is negative four.

118
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.220
Check it out.

119
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.530
Remember that a negative over a negative gives you a positive.

120
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.040
So we're going to get a positive result.

121
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:46.020
And for over 4 it is just one the slope of this line is just a simple one.

122
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.520
That's it for this problem.
