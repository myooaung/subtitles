00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.340
All right.

2
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.500
Welcome again let's go ahead and get into some limit exercises so that you get some practice.

3
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.780
So where are going to simply find the limits.

4
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.370
All right.

5
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:38.100
So find the following limit it says limit of x squared plus 10 x minus five as x approaches 1.

6
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.690
So go ahead and pause the video and try to find the limit.

7
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.210
All right.

8
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.210
So let's see how you did.

9
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.790
Remember that to find the limb we're going to plug it in.

10
00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.050
Mnemonic says that all we need to do here literally is plug in this one into this function and that's

11
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.590
going to give us our limit.

12
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.110
So it's going to be one squared

13
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.410
plus 10 times one

14
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.910
minus five.

15
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:31.450
All right so one squared is just one plus ten times one is just 10 minus five.

16
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
So one plus 10 is 11 minus five is six.

17
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.590
So put it down here.

18
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.240
The limit of this function as x approaches 1 is simply 6.

19
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.640
All we needed to do was plug it into the function itself and we are done.

20
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.120
All right.

21
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.770
So here we have her next limit limit of x squared minus 2 over X plus 5 as x approaches negative to

22
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.980
go ahead and pause and give it a shot.

23
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.910
All right.

24
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:14.630
So again should be pretty similar to the other one to find the lym just plug it in.

25
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.160
So we're going to go ahead and plug in this negative two into this function.

26
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.770
So we have negative 2 squared

27
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.990
minus two

28
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.460
over negative two plus five.

29
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.590
And what is negative 2 squared is a negative two times negative 2.

30
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.860
So remember that a negative times a negative equals a positive.

31
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.510
So that's positive for minus 2.

32
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.130
Over negative 2 plus 5.

33
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.530
So if you go to dollars but you pay 5 back now you're three in the clear.

34
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.930
Right.

35
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.530
So it's going to be positive three.

36
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.480
And we have four minus two is two.

37
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.960
And on the bottom we have three.

38
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.510
So the limit of this function as x approaches negative 2 is two thirds.

39
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.090
And we are good to go.

40
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.130
So as you can see all you have to do is to find the lym just plug it in plug in this number into the

41
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.710
actual function that you're finding the limit for.

42
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.890
And if you get a number then you're good.

43
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.340
However there are going to be cases where you get a 0 0 or a number over zero.

44
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.660
The point is when you have division by zero then you have a problem.

45
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.010
Sometimes you have to do something else.

46
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.200
Sometimes the limit doesn't exist.

47
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.330
And let's check out some more examples on that.
