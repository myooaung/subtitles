1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,050
Are right and there are just a couple of other things that I wanted to cover.

2
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,690
Number one is each concept has a summary at the end.

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,130
So sometimes you know I explain concepts in one video maybe two videos or three videos but at the end

4
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,620
of each concept there's a summary for the concept where I go over what we just covered and I give you

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,250
bullet points for you to review.

6
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,810
So the summaries are really good for for example when you're taking a test in three days.

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,750
So you've learned the concept in the past but you want to refresh it.

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,740
You can go straight to the summary so that it's even fresher in your mind so be sure to check those

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,880
out.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,810
The second thing I want to cover is I'll repeat myself often I'll repeat myself often I repeat myself

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,470
often.

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,490
What am I trying to tell you with this.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,700
So you'll notice that in the tutorials I repeat things a lot.

14
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,770
So if I'm talking about a concept maybe I explain it and then we'll do the problem.

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,190
I explain it again.

16
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:25,080
And after the problems done I explain one more time what we did and here's why what if I told you that

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,930
the derivative of a function measures the slope of the line tangent to a graph for a given point.

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,390
What if I told you that once.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,100
Do you think you will remember in five minutes what I just told you now 10 minutes in an hour tomorrow

20
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,730
for the test.

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,010
Of course not.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,500
There are things here that you won't remember.

23
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,550
If we only mention it once.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,930
So as I mentioned concepts over and over they started getting into your head.

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,600
Yes.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,430
It can be annoying but that's a way to learn.

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,450
And that's something that I've learned with my students over the years.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,300
The more that I repeat concepts the more familiar they become with them and the better it is for everybody

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,060
because at the moment of the test you'll be ready.

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,980
So when I start repeating myself Please don't hate me it'll help you learn faster and better.

31
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,810
All right.

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,530
So third thing is learn only what's relevant to you.

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,240
So for example let's say that your class is a summer class so it's shorter than the regular fall or

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,060
spring class and maybe your professor says all right in this basic calculus class we're not going to

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,080
cover marginal analysis.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,180
So what do you do.

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,720
You do not do the videos for marginal analysis.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,570
Hey Time is precious.

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,650
There are twenty two plus hours of content in this course.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,460
Learn only what's relevant to you.

41
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,330
I do not recommend you learning topics that are not going to be on your test that are not going to be

42
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,580
on your exams.

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,260
So it's funny because if you ask the professor if something is going to be in the exam they will tell

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,670
you.

45
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,720
Well if we covered it it's fair game.

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,500
So look at the syllabus.

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,520
Pay attention to what's done in class and based on that come to this course and then study what's relevant

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,910
is to not try to go over every single topic just on what's going to be covered in your specific class.

49
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,430
All right the next one is an interesting one.

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,210
So for some people I speak too slowly and for some others I speak too quickly.

51
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,360
So thankfully you can actually slow down and speed up videos.

52
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,930
So if my voice is getting too slow and too annoying or if I'm speaking too fast for you you can actually

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,360
just go ahead and do more work faster.

54
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,750
Whichever is better for you.

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,850
Also always feel free to pause the videos or rewind to take notes.

56
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,810
All right.

57
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,870
If I said something that didn't make any sense at all or if you need to take notes.

58
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,280
Go ahead and pause it.

59
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,270
Don't just place through the video into at speed.

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,860
All right.

61
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,710
That's not going to help you at all.

62
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,270
You can speed it up a little bit but you need to be taking notes at all times.

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,290
That is the only way to learn.

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,810
And quickly let me show you how to slow down or speed up the video.

65
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,050
So let's say you're watching one of my videos and let's say I'm speaking too slowly and you want to

66
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,220
speed it up.

67
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,750
You can actually go down here and you can say all right let me put the speed at one point twenty five

68
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:36,060
x and the video is going to be quicker and the same way if I'm speaking too quickly or you would rather

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,790
slow it down to take notes.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,500
You can always go back here and press 0.75 X and again everybody's different.

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,120
Some people like to go quicker.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,990
Some people like to go slower.

73
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,410
That's the beauty of an online course.

74
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,300
You can shoot it too which ever way you prefer but my point is just put it at whatever speed you feel

75
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,040
comfortable doing something else.

76
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's say you covered a topic a month ago and then you have a test coming up where you could do is you

77
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,180
can go over the videos again and you can do it in 1.5 or maybe 2 x beat if it's comfortable for you

78
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,800
and you could do that just to review quickly what you learned one or two months ago.

79
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,660
All right.

80
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,370
So that is how you change the speed of a video right and for the last thing here when your topic is

81
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,150
not covered write to me.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,950
So my goal is to have the most complete business calculus course on the internet.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,030
I've made sure to include many many topics that are covered in your class.

84
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,750
However not every business calculus class is the same.

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,370
Maybe at your institution it's taught a little bit differently and there are topics that I did not have.

86
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,060
So please write to me and let me know if there are any topics that you do not see covered either.

87
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:59,110
I'm working on a video to include the topic or I'll point you in the right direction so I'll point you

88
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,580
to another video where you can actually learn the topic.

89
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,390
And it's not going to be a random videos.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,360
They're going to be videos that I picked personally because I know that they teach it well like I'm

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,480
going to say a couple of times in the future.

92
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,580
I want this to be a five star of course.

93
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,160
So again if your topic is not covered I will definitely look for a way to help you out because I want

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,590
you to pass the class.

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,020
All right.

96
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,910
And one more thing I wanted to mention.

97
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,330
Didn't feel that it deserved its own bullet point but the Course is designed to be used with headphones

98
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,260
so it's 20:17.

99
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,580
You should have some sort of headphones or ear buds or whatever.

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,870
If you don't that's OK you can still watch the course without headphones but I can definitely tell you

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,190
that it sounds better and you learn better if you use headphones with of course.

102
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,480
So again thank you for being here and I'll see you in the next video.
