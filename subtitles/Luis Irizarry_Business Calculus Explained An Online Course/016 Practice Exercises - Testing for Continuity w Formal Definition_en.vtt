00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.510
All right so here we have our next exercise for continuity.

2
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.490
It says use the formal definition of continuity to the tournament if the function is continues for the

3
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.470
following X values.

4
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.120
So you need to find if the function is continues when X equals negative 3 when X equals 2 1 x equals

5
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.890
6 and when X equals 4 and yes you do have to draw this.

6
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.540
You might be thinking Loys Why are you making me draw this over again.

7
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.330
I need to get used to it.

8
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.410
All right.

9
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.120
Don't just say oh let me look at it and kind of go over the answer in my head.

10
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.920
No please go ahead and draw your cartesian plane.

11
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.170
X and Y and then try to draw this graph the best that you can.

12
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.450
Doesn't have to be perfect.

13
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.280
It doesn't have to be exactly equal but you have to do the job.

14
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.630
Trust me I know these things because I've taught this class for a long time and the people that don't

15
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.960
draw the people that don't take notes.

16
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.850
Those are the people that do not do well in the class.

17
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.630
So go ahead and draw this one quickly and I'll let you pause the video so you can not only draw it but

18
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:39.040
use a formal definition of continuity to find if access continues at these x values.

19
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.100
All right so how do you do.

20
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.350
Let's see.

21
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.530
So we need to use the formal definition of continuity.

22
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.160
Remember that the formal definition of continuity.

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.020
We actually have a mnemonic for that which is the equals L.

24
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.900
Right we said driver's license and the way to remember this.

25
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.230
A driver's license is continuous because you don't have to renew it every day.

26
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810
It's there for many many years.

27
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.950
So when you think of continuity of driver's license equals L and this mnemonic says that for a function

28
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.220
to be continuous at a certain point then the function number one needs to be defined.

29
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210
Number two the limit must exist.

30
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.760
That means that the limit from the left and the right are equal and number three.

31
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.310
The definition of the function must be equal to the limit at that point.

32
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.450
So let's go ahead and figure this out for each of these.

33
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.490
So let's start with x equals negative 3.

34
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.910
Let's see number 1 if the function is defined so negative 3 is over here.

35
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.990
What is the y value corresponding to negative 3.

36
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.850
So it's not up here because this is an open circle so there is no y value here.

37
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.460
But if you look down there's no y value here either.

38
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.340
So it turns out that this function does function f of x is not defined for negative Threet because there

39
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.150
is no y value here and no y value here.

40
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.710
Therefore f of negative 3 is undefined.

41
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.760
This means that the first condition of continuity is not even met.

42
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.940
This means that this function already is not continuous for X equals negative 3

43
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.300
right.

44
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.700
So not defined not continuous.

45
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.730
We move on.

46
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.810
We don't have to check for anything else.

47
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.870
Let's go to this one here.

48
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.510
So let's see if f of two is defined.

49
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.200
So what is half 2.

50
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.680
So it turns out that f of 2 does have a Y value associated with it.

51
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.990
As you can see we have a shaded trickle so the y value is 3 right.

52
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.220
So a lot better.

53
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.990
This first condition is met.

54
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:27.690
Let's find the limit from the left and the right of X as x approaches to from the left.

55
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.720
So as we approach two from the left to overhear.

56
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.330
So we approach it from the left from the left.

57
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.150
It looks like the y value is going to be negative for the

58
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.410
now let's do the same thing but let's approach it from the right instead.

59
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.140
So limit of x.

60
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.550
Sorry I'm running out of space here.

61
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.660
As x approaches 2 from the right so to is over here.

62
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.990
And as we approach it from the right we approach from the right from the right from the right.

63
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.490
It looks like the y value is going to be 3 so y values 3.

64
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.360
So what do we have here.

65
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.150
We have the limit from the left as x approaches 2 is negative 4 and the limit from the right as x approaches

66
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.220
2 is 3.

67
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.310
So the limit from the left is different than the limit from the right.

68
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.210
That means remember that the limit does not exist.

69
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.300
So that means it's not continuous either.

70
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.990
All right.

71
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.200
Because this limit is different than this limit.

72
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.000
Right.

73
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.540
So the limit does not exist.

74
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.610
Our second condition is not true.

75
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.690
All right let's do another one over here.

76
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.880
When X equals six.

77
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:16.330
So first of all let's see if it is defined when X equals 6 so x equals 6 is over here as it defines.

78
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.300
Yes we do have a Y value over here.

79
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.120
And I forgot to put up a number here so let's do six.

80
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.910
All right so one X equals 6.

81
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.540
The y value is actually 6.

82
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.870
All right.

83
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.990
So the first condition is true.

84
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.900
Now let's check the limit from the left and from the right.

85
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.830
So we have a limit of half of X

86
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.870
as x approaches

87
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.500
6.

88
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:58.960
And let's start with the left sexers over here as we approach it from the left.

89
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.050
It looks like the y value is going to be 6.

90
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.090
All right that's good.

91
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:18.280
Now let's approach it from the right limit of X as x approaches 6 from the right

92
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.150
and let's see a six is over here as we approach it from the right.

93
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:33.340
It looks like the y value is going to be negative to.

94
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:40.940
OK so it looks like again the limit from the left which is six is different than the limit from the

95
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.290
right which is negative 2.

96
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:49.760
So because the limit from the left is different than the limit from the right we say that this is not

97
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.110
continuous either.

98
00:07:53.610 --> 00:08:00.560
And market over here these two are different different than salaamed limit from the left.

99
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.160
Oops.

100
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.470
Is different than the limit from the right.

101
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.490
Remember this means different all right.

102
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.440
Different than.

103
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.430
All right well.

104
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.390
So that kind of sucks.

105
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.770
I mean the first three x values.

106
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.380
Neither of them are continuous.

107
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.450
Let's see the fourth one is which is X equals 4.

108
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.380
So let's check for our conditions.

109
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.890
By the way I'm putting this in case you don't know what it is.

110
00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.370
It's just a semicolon to separate stuff.

111
00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.179
That's pretty much it.

112
00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:37.500
All right.

113
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.909
So let's do full four and see.

114
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:48.230
The function is defined for the input for so for was over here it definitely looks like we have a Y

115
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:57.090
value because the point is here and the y value is for nice.

116
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.340
Now let's go with the limit from the left.

117
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.790
So a limit of of X

118
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.800
as x approaches for from the left.

119
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.960
What would that be.

120
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:19.480
So again fours over here as we approach it from the left Uloom market by the way.

121
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:27.710
So as we approach it from the left it looks like the y value is going to be for nice.

122
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.760
Now it's approach it from the right

123
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.100
limit of IVAX

124
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:43.310
as x approaches 4 from the right.

125
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.470
So again the point is here so let's approach it from the right and see what the x value is going to

126
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:54.220
be it looks like it's going to be for Nice.

127
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.770
All right.

128
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.360
So our first condition is true.

129
00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:02.920
We have a Y value for X-C calls for our second condition is true the limit exists because the limit

130
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.080
from the left is equal to the limit from the right both or for.

131
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:15.200
And finally we need to check if the definition is equal to the limit and it turns out it is.

132
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.280
So F or 4 equals for the y value when I plug in 4 is also 4.

133
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:27.900
But then the limit as x approaches 4 in general is also for.

134
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.830
Why.

135
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.440
Because the limit from the left equals the limit from the right and they both equal four.

136
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:43.190
So we can finally say that half of four is equal to the limit of f of x

137
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160
as x approaches 4 in general.

138
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.450
All right.

139
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.970
Not from the left or the right.

140
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.080
We already found those since they're equal to each other.

141
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.240
The limit in general equals four.

142
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:04.600
So four four equals four and the limit of f of x x x approaches 4 also equals 4.

143
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:14.620
So these two are equal and we have that our function is continues at X equals 4.

144
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:20.320
So this one is content is all right.

145
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.470
That's pretty much it.

146
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:28.010
So don't forget your mnemonic driver's license equals all very important with it you can check your

147
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:35.720
three conditions definition limit from the left on the right and definition equals the limit in general

148
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.570
of the other.
