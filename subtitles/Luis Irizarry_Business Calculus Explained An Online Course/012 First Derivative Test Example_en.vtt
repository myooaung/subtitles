00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.280
OK so here we have our example for the first derivative test.

2
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:31.170
It says Use the first derivative test to classify the relative extrema of f of x he calls x cubed minus

3
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.750
nine x squared plus 24 x again when we're doing these types of problems.

4
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:56.360
Step number one is to actually find all the critical points.

5
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.150
So what do we do to find the critical points we need to find the numbers that make that derivative either

6
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.440
equal to zero or undefined.

7
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.110
So first of all let's find the derivative of the function.

8
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.740
So we're going to use the power rule.

9
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.730
So we bring down the 3 x squared minus.

10
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.160
We have a 9 to that stays outside times we bring down the two and we have X to the first power.

11
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.390
So that's just x plus we have a constant 24 and x to the 1.

12
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.960
But when you differentiate that you get access to the zero which is just one.

13
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.580
So let's simplify a little bit more.

14
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.450
We have 3 x squared

15
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.550
minus nine times 2 is 18 x

16
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.650
plus 24.

17
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.300
All right.

18
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.270
So we have a derivative.

19
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.570
Let's find the critical numbers that make this derivative either equal to zero or undefined.

20
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.570
But actually it cannot be undefined because there's no bottom.

21
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.940
So we'll just find the numbers that make this derivative equal to zero.

22
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.920
And I totally forgot this negative sign right here because it's minus nine times too.

23
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.660
So you have 3 x squared minus 18 next.

24
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.860
Plus 24.

25
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.320
Let's make that equal to zero.

26
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.850
All right so what can we do here.

27
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.080
So what we need to do is to factor now at the time of this recording.

28
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.870
I do not have a factoring video as part of the tutorial so please check out the resources for this video

29
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.610
in which you will find some resources to learn how to factor.

30
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.290
Please take a couple of minutes and check those out.

31
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.670
So as of right now what we need to do is we need to factor in order to find out what are the numbers

32
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.830
that make this equal to zero.

33
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.700
So what is a common thing that all these terms have three x squared X and 24.

34
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.720
Well first of all they're all divisible by three.

35
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.110
So you can actually factor out the three and put it outside.

36
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.210
So what you need to do now is take out the three from each of these wands and take watch remaining.

37
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.670
So if this was 3 x squared.

38
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.900
Now we only have the x squared.

39
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.030
This was 18 x.

40
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.610
Now it becomes 6 x and again that's because 6 x times 3 is 18.

41
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.300
So remember that when we factor what we're doing is we're saying OK if you multiply this and this then

42
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.370
it gives you the result.

43
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.200
And finally if we had 24 but then we'd divide by three.

44
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.810
We have eight.

45
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.420
So we have plus eight equals zero.

46
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.760
Now we actually have to factor further and factor this expression right here in the middle.

47
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.710
In parentheses because remember we're trying to find a number that would make this whole thing equal

48
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.750
to zero.

49
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.160
X this three by itself can never be zero.

50
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.390
So the zero has to be inside.

51
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.530
So we keep that three outside.

52
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.180
And then we factor here

53
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.930
as of right now just know that to factor X squared minus 6 x plus 8 then what you need to do is you

54
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.770
put an X at the beginning and next at the beginning here as well.

55
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.470
Then we bring down this line.

56
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.720
And the sign for the second is actually the multiplication of this sign in this site negative times

57
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.630
a positive is a negative.

58
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.430
And then finally we need to find two numbers so that when you multiply them you get this number.

59
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.430
And when you add them you get this number.

60
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.870
So it's actually going to be 4 and 2

61
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:22.790
because negative four times negative to positive 8 and negative four plus negative two is negative six.

62
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.180
All right.

63
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.700
All of this is equal to zero.

64
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.960
So we're multiplying three things.

65
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The three the X minus 4 and the X minus 2.

66
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.220
So the three again can never be zero.

67
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.880
So we need to make sure that we find when this one can be zero.

68
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:46.380
And when this one can be zero and just by looking at it you can pretty much tell right one is X minus

69
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.810
four equal to zero.

70
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.120
Well when x is equal to four.

71
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.580
Right because four minus four is zero.

72
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.020
When you have a zero here and you multiply it with three and the X minus two.

73
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.010
That is going to give you zero.

74
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.450
Same thing for this one.

75
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.140
One is X minus two equal to zero.

76
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.130
Well when X equals two because two minus two is zero.

77
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.420
And then when you multiply with everything else you also get zero.

78
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.910
So we have two critical numbers

79
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:28.920
and they are for and to because again when you plug in for here you get a zero.

80
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.620
And when you plug in to here you get a zero.

81
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.480
Now that we have two critical numbers and by the way here I said that you need to find the critical

82
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.500
points.

83
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.280
Not exactly.

84
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.900
It's really just the critical numbers that you need to find.

85
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.600
And with that you can actually determine if you're dealing with maximums or minimums.

86
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.320
So step number two is to classify

87
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.330
your critical points.

88
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.390
And again we need to use now the first derivative test to classify these numbers that we have here and

89
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.920
let's go to our mnemonic like we said all you need to do is you need to draw a mountain and you need

90
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.560
to draw a whole.

91
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.040
All right.

92
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.100
So this is your max and this is your men and then you're going to test to the left and to the right.

93
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.390
So this is on the left.

94
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.490
This is on the right.

95
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.930
This is on the left and this is on the right.

96
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.210
So for a max on the left you have a positive slope because it's going up.

97
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.150
So this is positive on the right of the max.

98
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.500
You have a slope that's going down so it's negative for the men on the left.

99
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.320
You have a slope that's going down.

100
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.260
So it's a negative slope.

101
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.630
And for the right of the men we have a line that's going up.

102
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.090
So it's positive.

103
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.280
All right.

104
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.110
Knowing this let's go ahead and let's pick points to the left and to the right of the four and the two

105
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.110
and see what we get.

106
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.600
And if you have several critical numbers you can do them all on the same number line.

107
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.020
All right.

108
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.800
So we can say we're going to have this number line over here.

109
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.620
We're going to put a 2 here and we're going to put the four right here.

110
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:39.120
All right so let's pick values to the left on the right of the two and to the right of the four.

111
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.330
We don't need to test to the left of the four because that's covered by the number to the right of the

112
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.860
two.

113
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.810
Do you see what I mean like this interval to the right of the to the left of the four is the same interval.

114
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.960
So we're going to pick a test value here to the left of the two.

115
00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:03.590
So that's going to be 0 that we're going to pick a number in between which is going to be three and

116
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:09.560
we're going to pick a number to the right of the four which is going to be you know what let's do 10

117
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.210
because 10 is a round number.

118
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.030
It's very easy to plug in.

119
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.710
All right.

120
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:24.360
So first of all let's go ahead and plug zero into our derivative and see what sign we get.

121
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.390
So our derivative is this one here.

122
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:37.370
So if we plug in zero we get three times zero squared minus 18 times zero.

123
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.110
Plus 24.

124
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.250
This is 0 0 and 24.

125
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.010
So it's positive.

126
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:56.410
That means that to the left of the two we have a positive slope.

127
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.990
Let's test our second number and I'll do this one a little bit more to the left just to gain some space.

128
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.280
Prime of what are we plug in in replug and in three

129
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.610
right.

130
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.650
So we have three.

131
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.990
And remember we're plugging the scent into the derivative just like increasing and decreasing intervals.

132
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.250
We need to test this out into the derivative.

133
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.060
Actually the name itself says it it's the first derivative test.

134
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.410
Do not plug this sin into the original function.

135
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.880
Instead do it on the first derivative.

136
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.540
So we're plugging in three into this first derivative.

137
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:48.510
So three times three squared minus 18 times three plus 24.

138
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.310
So this is three squared is nine times three is twenty seven.

139
00:10:52.320 --> 00:11:01.830
So we have 27 minors 18 times three is 54 and then plus 24.

140
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:13.950
So negative 54 plus 24 is negative 30 negative 30 plus 27 is negative 3.

141
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.690
So this is negative.

142
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:25.790
So between the two and the four are critical numbers we have a negative slope.

143
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.810
All right and we only have one more thing to test and that is the 10 to the right of the four.

144
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.530
So let's plug in turn into our derivative.

145
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:44.370
So we have three times 10 squared.

146
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.410
Mine is 18 times 10

147
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.000
plus 24 that's going to be a big number.

148
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.520
It's 10 squared is a hundred times three's 300.

149
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:15.350
So 300 minus 18 times 10 is 180 plus 24 so that's 300 minus 180 that's 120 120 plus 24 is 144.

150
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.120
Definitely a positive number.

151
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:25.740
So to the right of the four we have a positive slope.

152
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.370
All right.

153
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.790
So we finally have our signs to the left and to the right of two and four.

154
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.710
At this point we can go ahead and classify.

155
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.350
Let's grab the first critical number two.

156
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.090
So to the left it's positive and to the right it's negative.

157
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.880
That means it is a max.

158
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.390
Why.

159
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:54.030
Because in a max mnemonic it says to the left you have a positive slope to the right you have a negative.

160
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.330
Same as here on the left you have a positive right.

161
00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.440
You have a negative.

162
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.000
So I'll go ahead and write it over here.

163
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.160
We have a relative Max

164
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:22.640
at X equals two.

165
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.240
All right so perfect that is our first critical point which is to.

166
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:36.270
Now let's go for the four for the four we have negative to the left and positive to the right.

167
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:44.980
That means that it's actually a min because see here in a men you have negative slope on the left and

168
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.840
positive on the right which is what we have here.

169
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.570
Negative on the left and positive on the right.

170
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.660
Therefore we have a relative.

171
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.040
Men

172
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.490
at X equals four.

173
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.380
There we go.

174
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.200
We just found our critical points.

175
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.790
We actually then classify them and we determined that we have a relative Max Texaco's two and a half

176
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.310
men at X equals four.

177
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.510
However in theory we're not done.

178
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.370
We have one more step.

179
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.700
Remember we're trying to find the critical points themselves.

180
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:27.450
That means that we're going to have to get this to and this four and plug them in into the original

181
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.680
function.

182
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.170
So I don't want you to get confused the test values that we picked those go into the derivative because

183
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.470
we need to measure the slope of the line tangent.

184
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.200
However when we're actually finding the critical points.

185
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.950
Remember that we're finding those critical points for f of x.

186
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.690
So now that we have the x values of those critical points we need to find the corresponding y values.

187
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.760
That's why you plug those into the original.

188
00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.340
So anytime you're doing one of these apply derivative problems I want you to think what am I getting

189
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.900
if I'm getting the critical point then where do I need to plug it in.

190
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.860
Well it's in the original because those critical points belong to the original function.

191
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:16.690
Or if you're testing values for derivatives they need to think I need to plug this into a derivative

192
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.700
instead.

193
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:25.630
So let's just go ahead and quickly find out the y values for these two x values so we can get the four

194
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.290
coordinates over relative Max and relative min.

195
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.780
So let's go ahead and plug it into into the original function.

196
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.400
So f of 2.

197
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.670
Again no prime.

198
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:47.920
Because we're plugging into the original that's going to give us two cubed minus nine times two squared

199
00:15:48.640 --> 00:16:01.310
plus 24 times to two cubed is two times two times two that's eight minus two squared is four times nine

200
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:18.150
is minus 36 plus 24 times to 48 so 8 minus 36 is actually negative 28 negative 28 plus 48 is positive

201
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.070
20.

202
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:30.650
And let's do the same thing for our next x value which is four of four.

203
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.060
All right.

204
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:43.730
So we have four cubes minus nine rhymes for squared plus 24 times for

205
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.000
four cubed is four times four times four.

206
00:16:49.070 --> 00:17:01.930
So that's four times four is 16 times four is 64 minus four square it is 16 and 16 times 9 is 144.

207
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.270
Finally we have 24 times 4 which is 96

208
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:20.359
so 64 minus 144 plus 96 is 16.

209
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.520
We just got our y values for these critical numbers.

210
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:33.610
So now we can actually write down the full x and y of our relative Max and realize if the points are

211
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.650
for the max it's two

212
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.310
20.

213
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:52.670
That's the corresponding y value and we have 4 16 that has a corresponding y value for 4.

214
00:17:52.670 --> 00:18:06.690
These are our points and again to 20 is the max and the 416 is the min.

215
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.620
All right.

216
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.090
How do you feel about this problem.

217
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.580
It was kind of long right.

218
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.120
Yeah.

219
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.320
These first derivative problems tend to be a little bit long.

220
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.580
So it's a matter of getting used to it doing a lot of them.

221
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.910
So they don't seem scary anymore.

222
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.430
So yeah it definitely takes a little bit to get used to.

223
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.140
Let me just summarize what we did.

224
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:31.090
So we were asked to use the first derivative test to classify the relative extrema of this function.

225
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:36.780
So the first thing we need to do is find the critical points because remember relative extrema can only

226
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.910
occur at critical points.

227
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:44.540
So we find the derivative over function and we set it equal to zero.

228
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:50.280
We don't really need to check for undefined because there's no denominator There's no bottom.

229
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.170
So we said the derivative equals zero.

230
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.340
And we factor out the three.

231
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.980
After that we factor out this thing in parentheses which again will do.

232
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.030
More examples of that.

233
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.060
So you can understand how it actually works.

234
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:10.210
We determined that the derivative is 0 when X equals 4 and when X equals 2.

235
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.470
All right so these are critical numbers.
