1
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,960
All right.

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,470
So this is one of my favorite mnemonics.

3
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,940
It's on a Monnick to remember how natural logarithms work.

4
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,510
So it says that the natural logarithm is equal to the Canadian logarithm.

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,380
All right so we're calling this natural logarithm with base e.

6
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,550
We're calling it the Canadian logarithm and that's because of two reasons.

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,820
Number one is when you think of Canada what do you think about Ellis when I think of Canada I think

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:05,319
of landscape's I think of a huge country with lots of beautiful mountain ranges lots of greens lots

9
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,970
of mooses lots of nature.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,610
All right.

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:16,750
So to me Canada equals nature and that goes hand-in-hand with the name of this logarithm because it's

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,540
natural so natural nature pretty close.

13
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,030
So Reason number one.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,370
Well we call this natural logarithm the Canadian logarithm is because of nature.

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,780
All right.

16
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,690
So when you think of natural log Oh Canadian log that's nature.

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,320
OK.

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,690
Got it.

19
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,070
And then the second reason is something that Canadians say a lot.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,260
I actually went to Toronto and that was last year and I was surprised by the number of people that said

21
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,690
this and I know that's a Canadian thing you know.

22
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,600
They do say this but a lot of people that I talked to said this.

23
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,810
So Canadians are famous for saying A At the end of some questions.

24
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:10,370
So for example they would tell you it's a pretty nice weather a or this is the coldest day of the year

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,140
a.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,920
And that they should remind you that Canadian logarithms use IE as the base.

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,910
All right.

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,210
So the first word of that A is that don't care.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,930
So second reason why natural logs are called Canadian logs is because of the A.

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
Right.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,470
And I hope you knew this.

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,570
I think this is common knowledge right that Canadians say a lot.

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,720
So this is why I thought it was a good idea to put it as part of the mnemonic.

34
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,320
Right.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,870
So this is what will remind you that natural logs use IE as a base.

36
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,100
If you're actually Canadian this mnemonic should be really easy for you.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,600
So an example of a Canadian logarithm led to Ellen of thirty three.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,630
All right.

39
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,080
So we look at this.

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,800
OK.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,890
So it's a natural log.

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,120
So we know it's a Canadian log.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,970
Right.

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,660
Because natural logs equal Canadian logs.

45
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,110
Why.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,470
Well number one because natural reminds us of the Canadian nature all the beautiful landscapes they

47
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,820
have over there.

48
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:33,050
And number two we know the base is e because they say hey I know this is so silly but I'm sure it's

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,600
going to help here remember this in case you do forget it.

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,560
So let's go ahead and find the answer to this natural log of 13:3.

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,010
And again we'll do this in Google.

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,080
And here we have it.

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,360
Thad Allen of 33 is approximately 3.5.

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,370
Let's round it up to 3.5.

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,210
OK.

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:08,700
So again it's not an exact results so we're going to say approximately equal to 3.5.

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,130
All right.

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,070
This is it natural log Canadian log nature an A.

59
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,480
I hope you liked this one.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,630
That is it for natural logs.

61
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,700
That was a pretty good mnemonic.

62
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,240
A.
