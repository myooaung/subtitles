00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,890
Hey they're welcome to another session of limit class calculus.

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,150
Today we're going to cover a very basic concept of basic calculus.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,940
So you're very likely to see this topic in your class.

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,950
Does it matter if your class is six weeks.

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,520
Does it matter if your class is four weeks is four months.

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,610
Marginal analysis in general is taught in our basic calculus classes based on my experience as a tutor.

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,370
Now there's nothing to worry about.

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,840
Marginal analysis is actually very simple and you just need to remember one thing and we'll see that

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,020
in the mnemonic.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,410
So let's start with the question what is marginal analysis right.

11
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,880
So here we have the definition.

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,500
So marginal analysis is using derivatives to estimate how profit revenue and costs change on production

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,400
level changes by 1.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,370
Let me repeat that once again using derivatives to estimate how profit revenue and cost change on production

15
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,630
level changes by one.

16
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,000
So what the heck is this talking about.

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:37,580
So the first thing I want you to notice is the word estimate that means we're not getting exact answers

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,570
we're getting estimate approximations right.

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,230
Marginal analysis is all about approximation.

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,830
We'll see how that plays out just in a minute.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,810
But let's keep going.

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,380
So something else interesting about this definition is that we talk about profit revenue and cost.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,430
Whenever we do marginal analysis we're pretty much going to talk about these three quantities profit

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,960
revenue and cost.

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,600
And finally it's an estimation of how these three change when production level changes by one no production

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,120
level changes by one.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,890
We've seen that before or you remember that in slopes we have a rise over run right.

28
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,960
So for every unit you move to the right than the slope is however many units you either move up if it's

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,190
a positive slope or down if it's a negative slope.

30
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:40,020
So in other words marginal analysis is estimating what the derivative will be at a given point.

31
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,660
Right.

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,410
Because when production level changes by one that's like moving one to the right.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,190
So we want to know how it changes once we move on to the right.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,810
And again all of this is just slope.

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,270
So when we're there I want to mention before we go is that profit revenue and cost.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,250
Like I said are the quantities are you going to be dealing with in marginal analysis.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,610
And you might have functions for these three so you might have a profit function

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,550
of x you might have a revenue function of x

39
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,850
and you might have a cost function SIEV-X.

40
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,450
All right.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,210
So X is whatever value you plug in.

42
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,460
Which is the production level.

43
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:39,470
So for example if you're selling lemonades you might say okay X is a number of lemonades that I sell.

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,030
And once I plug this in into the profit function I'll know what my profit is.

45
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,400
And the same way we have revenue.

46
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,880
So when I make X amount of money then my revenue is whatever and finally costs.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,830
Same thing.

48
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,100
So if I make X amount of lemonades then this function tells me what my cost is going to be.

49
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,840
Now I know your business to business.

50
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,920
But in case you forgot the difference between profit and revenue.

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,950
So profit is where you get to keep and revenue is everything that you make.

52
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,310
So in other words and this is important to know profit equals

53
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:32,690
revenue minus costs.

54
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,240
All right.

55
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,340
So for selling lemonade.

56
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:50,350
I knew one day you made a revenue of hundred and twenty.

57
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,690
But then the costs stuff like buying the lemons buying a pitcher buying the ice etc. the cost of all

58
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,390
that was $20.

59
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,820
So you don't get to keep the whole 120 while you get to key for your own pocket is 120 everything that

60
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,070
you made minus the cost that you went through to make the 120.

61
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,950
So that's going to give you a profit of a hundred dollars.

62
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,470
All right.

63
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,450
I know this is very basic but it's very important to know.

64
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,140
And just like we say profit equals revenue minus costs you can also say that in terms of functions.

65
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,020
So in other words the profit function

66
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,580
equals the revenue function

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,580
minus the cost function.

68
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:52,670
All right.

69
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,920
So this way you know that if you're asked to find profit and you're given the revenue function and the

70
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,310
cost function you can just subtract cost from revenue and that's going to give you the profit function

71
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,870
and we'll do an example of that so you can see how it works.

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,260
All right.

73
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,330
So again profit equals revenue minus cost.

74
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,240
And there's one more thing I want to mention.

75
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,290
So you have these three functions right now profit function the revenue function and the cost function.

76
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,790
So what happens when you get the derivative of each.

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:35,940
So if you get the derivative of profit that's going to give you the price of X right.

78
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:43,440
If you get the derivative of revenue it's going to give you our prime IVAX how the revenue is changing

79
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:52,900
and finally a derivative of cost see Prime effects.

80
00:06:52,990 --> 00:07:00,170
So it turns out these three derivatives they have names and the names are just basically the word marginal.

81
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,850
And then whatever quantity you're dealing with.

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,480
So for example the prime of x is a derivative of profit.

83
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:20,520
So that's called marginal profit.

84
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,160
And the same way we have revenue.

85
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:40,710
So the derivative of revenue is marginal revenue.

86
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:56,370
And finally for cost the same thing that the derivative of cause is called marginal cost.

87
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,890
All right.

88
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,030
That's pretty much it.

89
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,700
That is a good introduction to marginal analysis and now we're going to see how is it that we actually

90
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,990
saw problems.

91
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,410
Just to summarize once more marginal analysis is used to estimate how profit revenue and cost change

92
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,970
from production level changes by 1.

93
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,240
So you have your three quantities profit revenue and change.

94
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:23,740
If you get the derivative of these three functions then you get the marginal profit margin revenue and

95
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,850
the marginal cost correspondingly to each one.

96
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,919
The last thing to cover is that again profit equals revenue minus cost.

97
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,220
So if you have one of these two quantities then that means you can get the third.

98
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,190
So obviously again if you don't have profit you have revenue on cost.

99
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,870
You can just subtract these two.

100
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,500
And that's going to give you profit but also for example if you want to find revenue and you have profit

101
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:56,140
and costs then you can just move cost to this site and that's going to give you revenue.

102
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,810
Right it's going to be profit plus cost equals revenue etcetera etcetera.

103
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,070
And by the way there's one more thing I want to cover and that is revenue itself.

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,570
So we have revenue our of X right

105
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,730
remember that revenue is basically all the money that you get for selling your product.

106
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,620
Now what happens if we don't have the revenue function and we don't have the profit function and we

107
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,870
do have the cost function but we still want to find revenue.

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,790
So remember that X is a level of production.

109
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,330
So the number that you plug into the revenue function is a number of units that you sold that's going

110
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:48,040
to give you your total revenue so what happens if you have the prize function which tells you what the

111
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,840
price is depending on the number of units.

112
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,400
And I'll put this up here.

113
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,760
PLX is a prize function.

114
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,290
Now you might be thinking wait a minute isn't P of X profit.

115
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,030
Well yes but Abra case.

116
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,790
All right.

117
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,250
So when we're talking about profit we're talking about an upper case P

118
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,070
What we're talking about price.

119
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,480
It's a lower case p.

120
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,080
All right.

121
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,850
So just remember that profit revenue and costs go together and all of these are apprecate.

122
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,870
All right.

123
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,730
So price is the black sheep is by itself and it's a lower case.

124
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,920
That's why it's different.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,920
So make sure you don't get confused between profit uppercase and price lower case.

126
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,290
All right.

127
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,210
So let's say that we have a piece of X. let's say that we have lower case p of X..

128
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,460
So we have price and we want to find the revenue.

129
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,080
Well let me put it to you this way.

130
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:04,260
If the price of each lemonade you sell is $2 and you sell 10 of them what is your revenue.

131
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,730
Well it is $2 per eliminate times 10 lemonades.

132
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,730
Right.

133
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,550
Going to give you 20.

134
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,320
In other words we're multiplying the number of units that we sell times the price of each unit.

135
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,020
And that's just simple math right.

136
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,000
There's nothing weird about that.

137
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:32,310
You know Wal-Mart sells a thousand shirts in one day and each shirt costs $5.

138
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,010
Then the revenue for shirts is going to be five thousand.

139
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,400
A thousand shirts times $5 each.

140
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,510
So it turns out we can still get the revenue that way.

141
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:57,370
So we have P of x which gives you the price of each unit times X which is actually the number of units

142
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,030
and to make it look better we can just say x x

143
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,810
All right.

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,710
So this is X times P of X and again that's going to give you more revenue because X is the number of

145
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:23,390
units that you're selling and P of X gives you the prize for X number of units.

146
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:35,490
So again this is another way of getting the revenue in case you do not have profit or cost.

147
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,750
And again each problem is different and some problems are going to be given the profit on the cost.

148
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,380
But sometimes you want.

149
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,330
In that case if you need to find the revenue you will very likely be given this price function and all

150
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,970
you need to do is multiply X by that function and that's going to give your revenue.
