00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.010
Finish up we'll do a couple of examples.

2
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.290
And here we're going to include functions that are both adding and subtracting.

3
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:39.820
So for example if we have X and we want to find the derivative of X right.

4
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:59.810
So let's say that X equals 3 x 2 the fourth minus 2 x to the eighth plus 5 x minus 3.

5
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.390
OK.

6
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.640
So here we have a group of functions right.

7
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.660
Some of them are subtracting like these two and these two and some of them are adding like these two.

8
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.890
So we basically are going to use a combination of the sum rule and the differential.

9
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.020
And remember our mnemonic says add because we're adding.

10
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.580
But again it also works for us.

11
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580
It also works for the differential.

12
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.690
And it says to add the different derivatives.

13
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.720
Yes I know Majdi looks like a p.

14
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.730
Thank you very much.

15
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.400
OK.

16
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.870
So what we do here is we basically get the derivative of each function normally as we would.

17
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.090
And we just keep the signs between them.

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.550
So whenever you have a minors you're going to keep a minus.

19
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.640
And wherever you have a plus you're going to keep a plus.

20
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.250
So right let's start getting the derivatives.

21
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.140
So first one is constant multiple.

22
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.100
We keep the three we bring down a dictator that's for X substituted by a less powerful leader.

23
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.540
Gives us a three on top minus constant multiple rule.

24
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.250
So we keep the two we bring down our dictator eights X and we substitute a less powerful leader.

25
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.400
That gives us a 7 and my 7 sucks.

26
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.980
So let's try that again.

27
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.460
It cuts a little bit better I guess.

28
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.570
All right.

29
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.960
Moving on plus so constant multiple we keep the five times again remember that if it doesn't have anything

30
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.200
this X it just means it's a 1.

31
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.710
So we bring down the one we keep the X and we substitute by a new leader.

32
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.080
But if we have one and we substitute by any leader that gives us the one minus one.

33
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.640
So that's X to the 0 minus.

34
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:04.330
Again 3 is a constant constant rule constant temperature means that it's not changing so its derivative

35
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400
is zero.

36
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.040
There we go.

37
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.110
All right and now let's simplify.

38
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:23.110
Three times four is 12 x cubed times 8 is 16 x 7.

39
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
If I can write seven.

40
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.750
All right.

41
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.650
That's a lot better.

42
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.410
OK.

43
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.020
Plus five times one is five x to zero.

44
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.530
Remember that anything to the zero is one.

45
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.330
OK.

46
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.660
In case you still do not remember this.

47
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.210
I'll put it over here.

48
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.970
X 2 0 is always one that never changes.

49
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.010
OK so it's five times one is five times x to the zero.

50
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.130
So times 1 again is still 5 ok and minus zero there's nothing to do there.

51
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.470
So we have our answer.

52
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.150
This is it

53
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.180
OK.

54
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.810
So again whenever you have a combination of functions some of them subtracting some of them adding what

55
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.890
you do is you get the derivative of each.

56
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.829
Remember your rule.

57
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.490
Add the different derivatives but also subtract the different derivatives that means that basically

58
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.900
you're going to get the derivative of each term right.

59
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.590
Each of these and you're just going to keep the sign that was there.

60
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.330
So for example for these two we find the derivative of the first function.

61
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.290
We put the minus.

62
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.690
We find the derivative of the second function.

63
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.920
We put a plus.

64
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.510
We find the derivative of the third function.

65
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.240
We put a minus and we find the derivative of the third right there.

66
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.010
OK.

67
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.690
We'll have a couple of more examples in the examples section.

68
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.090
So for now just know that you can combine the sum rule and the differential.

69
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.630
OK guys so now to go over a quick summary of what we just did.

70
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.890
First of all functions can be composed of other functions that are adding or subtracting.

71
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.730
So you could have a x equals to the sum of different functions subtraction of different functions or

72
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.850
both the sum and subtraction of different functions for functions that are adding.

73
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.190
We apply some rule which says the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.

74
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.750
Right.

75
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.500
And here we have our mnemonic which is at.

76
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.970
And you remember this because to some something means to add something and he means add different derivatives.

77
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.400
So you're going to take each individual derivative of the function and then you're going to add them

78
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.390
together.

79
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.840
On the other hand for functions that are subtracting the difference rule is what we use the derivative

80
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.620
of a difference is the difference of the derivatives.

81
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.020
And again we also use the same the same mnemonic

82
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.880
AD.

83
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.120
However instead of adding we're going to be subtracting and again we use the same mnemonic for both

84
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.500
the sum and different SRL because they're very similar.

85
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.570
However instead of adding we'll be subtracting here.

86
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:29.560
So if you have a function that equals the subtraction of other functions you're going to do is you're

87
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.570
going to take each individual derivative and you're going to subtract them.

88
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.060
OK.

89
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.020
Sometimes you will need to use both the sum rule and the differential for a function.

90
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.130
Again we did a couple of examples.

91
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:50.910
You could have f of x equals G of X minus H of X plus I have X etc. etc..

92
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.600
So sometimes you'll have functions that are a combination of both adding and subtracting.

93
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.300
And here you're just going to take.

94
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.360
Again we're going to use our mnemonic and we're just going to take each individual derivative and keep

95
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.930
the sign in the middle.

96
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.960
OK.

97
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.440
So if you think about it it's the same thing we do with the ADD rule right.

98
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.120
We use the mnemonic we take each individual derivative and we take the plus sign.

99
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.550
Same for subtraction.

100
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.820
We take each individual derivative and we keep the negative sign.

101
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:32.380
Well again when you have both adding and subtracting functions you take each individual derivative and

102
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.760
you just keep the sign.

103
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.560
If it's a plus staes a plus if it's negative it stays negative.

104
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.620
OK.

105
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.270
Finally we have our mnemonic which is add we know how to use it because when you're adding something

106
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.160
is when you use the same rule.

107
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.930
Remember when you sum something.

108
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.800
Adding it to same thing and the mnemonic stands for add different derivatives.

109
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.430
It is used to remember both the sum rule and the differential.

110
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.680
The only difference.

111
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:07.810
No pun intended is that in the differential instead of adding We are subtracting.

112
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:15.910
And finally just remember addition equals a sum and a difference equals subtraction.

113
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:24.730
So this stuff over here is Plus and this stuff over here is minus.

114
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.030
OK.

115
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.220
Again hopefully that wasn't too bad.

116
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.690
It's a very easy rule.

117
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.909
Once you learn to apply it I know I say that about every single rule but it is true.

118
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:40.740
Once you do it in a couple of problems you're going to think to yourself wow it's actually pretty easy.

119
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.050
So we have a couple of problems for you to explore in the problem section.

120
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:50.490
That is it for now and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
