1
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,370
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:28,350
So I want to talk to you about something that's very very very important to me and that is reviews for

3
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,440
the course.

4
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,860
So as it says here I designed the corps to be a five star course.

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,770
And when I say that let me back it up let me show you the amount of time I've spent making sure that

6
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,230
the Corps is amazing.

7
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,850
So right now we're sitting at about 22 hours of constant So that's 22 hours.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,370
Now this is edited content.

9
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:01,080
So that means that for every hour of edited content there was another hour of recording behind that.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,590
So we have 22 hours of content.

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:12,250
And then we have approximately 22 hours even though it's a little bit more because there are things

12
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,680
that I didn't put in the tutorials of recording

13
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,610
then after that I had to write the script of what I was going to say in each video.

14
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,970
That definitely took a while because that is for every topic that you cover in a business calculus course

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,570
which last fall semester so that took me approximately 12 hours

16
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,200
I was just writing scripts

17
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,300
and then of course there is the whole organizing it online uploading the videos put in descriptions

18
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,680
putting titles updating my profile etc etc..

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,990
So theres a lot that goes there as well and that one took me approximately five hours to get everything

20
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,640
ready.

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,110
So five hours of set up.

22
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,680
All right.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,640
So this is like the minimum time I've spent on these tutorials.

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,490
That is approximately 61 hours.

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,110
So my point here is not that you should care how much work I put into it or you should care about is

26
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,930
whether it's helping you achieve your goals of passing this class.

27
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,970
But I do want to make a point that I've spent a lot of times a lot of weekends a lot of mornings and

28
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,530
a lot of nights making sure that this course is a five star of course making sure that the Course explains

29
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,560
the concepts in a way that's easy for you to understand making sure that you have problems for you to

30
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,190
practice making sure that the mnemonics make sense and then they're easy to remember.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,890
I mean there's a lot a lot a lot of work that went into the course.

32
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,400
So this is not a five star course for you I would like to know.

33
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:12,410
I would love to know why you think this course is not five stars and you know there could be valid reasons.

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,730
Maybe you don't find it really helpful.

35
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,650
Maybe you expected something else.

36
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,570
I mean whatever it is I'm always looking for ways to improve the course.

37
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,670
So this is not five stars.

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,540
Please let me know.

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,230
So I wanted to say if this course helps you understand concepts easier and faster than you doing class

40
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:40,250
practice problems to help you gain confidence in your business calculus skills improve your score and

41
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,890
quizzes and test and of course this is the most important one.

42
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:52,760
If it helps you pass the class I will ask you to please leave me a review letting me know how much you

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,950
like the course.

44
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,300
If you feel it's a five star course then great.

45
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,650
Those five star reviews mean the world to me.

46
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,570
If you feel that it's less than five stars Remember you can always leave me a review.

47
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,120
But please let me know why you didn't think it was a five star course.

48
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,240
Again I put a lot of work into this making sure that this course is the best business calculus course

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,709
on the Internet.

50
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,680
So if it's not worth five stars I need to know why.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,240
But if it helps you do any of these four then I would love to get a five star review from you.

52
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,120
All right.

53
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,920
So why are these so important to me.

54
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,000
Well number one is if you'll give me a five star review I know that what I'm teaching and the way I'm

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,950
teaching it is working.

56
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,180
I love helping students.

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,100
I've tutored hundreds of business calculus students throughout the last couple of years.

58
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,140
I can explain to you how happy makes me feel to see them pass the class at the beginning you know they're

59
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,520
struggling they don't know what to do.

60
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,650
They're stressed by this class and all those things.

61
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,090
But it's a great great feeling when they finally start improving their scores.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
They start understanding the class and eventually pass it.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,320
So that is number one.

64
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,730
So if I get a five star reviews it gives me confidence in my ability to keep teaching other students.

65
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:34,290
Number two is it actually helps the course rank higher in the search results that allows me to reach

66
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,880
more people and to help many others.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,280
All right.

68
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,970
So that is also very important because it doesn't matter if I invest that 60 80 or 100 hours into the

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,230
course if it's not in the search results on the top then it's not going to help a lot of people right.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,430
So please if you think the Course is helping you out and you feel it's a five star course.

71
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,980
Please go ahead and leave me a review.

72
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,350
All right.

73
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,500
I would really greatly appreciate it.

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,010
And by the way the Web site will ask you often if you want to leave a review or not.

75
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,010
So if you're not ready to leave review then please don't keep taking the course.

76
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,800
Keep learning more do more problems etc. but once you feel that the Course has helped you enough to

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,830
warrant a five star review.

78
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,950
If you think that's what it deserves then I'll ask you to please go ahead and leave a rating.

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,360
You could also out of the description in the review which is something that I greatly appreciate any

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,480
sort of feedback is completely appreciated.

81
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,330
But if you don't want to leave a description of why you gave me that rating then that's fine.

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,960
Even if it's just marking the number of stars then that is great but any sort of feedback is appreciated.

83
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,370
All right so I hope you like the course.

84
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,560
I hope that my teaching is beneficial to you as it's been to other students and I'll see you in the

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,250
next video.
