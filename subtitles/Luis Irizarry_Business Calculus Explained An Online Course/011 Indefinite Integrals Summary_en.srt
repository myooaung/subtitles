00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,240
Are right so let's go into a quick summary of what indefinite integrals are and how they work.

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:33,870
So calculus is divided into two branches differential calculus which deals with derivatives and integral

3
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,550
calculus which deals with integrals.

4
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,960
So the antiderivative of f of x is a function whose derivative is f of x.

5
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:51,400
So if I give you a function f of x and I tell you what is the function so that when you find the derivative

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,170
of that function it gives you this f of x that's the antiderivative.

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:10,260
And it is given by uppercase of x so uppercase X that's the antiderivative and the derivative of the

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,630
antiderivative gives you the function that you're working with vivax.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,810
All right.

10
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,650
Next we have that functions have an infinite number of antiderivatives because of constants and we know

11
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:22,980
this.

12
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:30,870
And we did a couple of examples for example the derivative of x squared is X but the derivative of x

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:39,600
squared plus 3 is also 2 x and the derivative of x squared minus 5 is also 2 x the derivative of x squared

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,530
plus 10 is also 2 x etc. etc..

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,890
So when you add a constant to the antiderivative you're still going to get f of x.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,350
When you differentiate it because the derivative of a constant is always 0.

17
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,840
That's why there is an infinite number of antiderivatives.

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,470
Next the family of antiderivatives of a function is called the indefinite integral of the function.

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,800
It is given by uppercase f of x.

20
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,310
Plus C.

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,630
So remember this C actually stands for any constant.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,730
It could be two.

23
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,600
It could be 10.

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,580
It could be five.

25
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,930
It could be negative 10.

26
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,510
It could be negative 20 etc..

27
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,740
It really doesn't matter.

28
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,180
It's only a concept.

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,520
It represents a constant.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,880
And then this f x is then the antiderivative of lowercase f of x.

31
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,340
Right.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,200
So this upper case f of x plus see represents the infinite number of antiderivatives that a function

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,760
can have.

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,050
Next we have a notation for an indefinite integral is the following.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,030
So we have elongated s half of x which is the function for which you're finding the indefinite integral

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,360
remember that next to that we also put DX right.

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,400
And the answer to that will be uppercase f of x plus C.

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,720
All right.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,520
This is a notation for an indefinite integral and then to find antiderivatives for a power function.

40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,650
You increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,230
Again this is the most important integration rule there is because you're going to see it a lot just

42
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,370
like the power rule for derivatives.

43
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:39,550
This is the power rule for integrals and it's opposite to the power rule for derivatives.

44
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,860
Instead of bringing down a dictator and substituting by one of less power we actually increase the exponent

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,720
by 1 and divide by the new exponent.

46
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:59,340
So quick reminder if you have for example x to the 3 DX then we're going to increase the exponent by

47
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,960
1.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,770
So that's X to the fourth and we divide by this new exponent which is also 4.

49
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,950
And then we do plus C..

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,870
All right.

51
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,790
So increase by 1 and divide by the same thing.

52
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:22,470
We actually have a mnemonic for this which is indefinite integral with the I and D in uppercase this

53
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,970
I Andie's tense for increase and divide.

54
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,140
So again if you have x cubed you increase the exponent by 1.

55
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,200
So that's a 4.

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,180
And then divide by the same for all right.

57
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,210
And we actually went over a couple of rules for integration.

58
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,580
The first one is the power rule which is the one we just covered with this mnemonic.

59
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,170
Then we have the constant rule that says that the end rule of a constant is equal to that same constant

60
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,720
multiplied by x.

61
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,540
And of course plus C logarithmic rule.

62
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:03,570
This one tells you that the integral of one over X or in other words of x to the negative 1 which is

63
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,420
the same thing is equal to the natural log of x.

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,640
Now remember this X has an absolute value in the answer.

65
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,120
If you need to review that please go back to that part of the video.

66
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,240
Finally we have the exponential rule which says if you have the integral of E to the K x that's going

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,090
to be equal to 1 over a k.

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,410
So you're going to divide by that constant in the exponents and you're going to keep the of the K x.

69
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,540
All right.

70
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,000
Finally we have integration properties.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,340
We have two main ones the constant multiple rule.

72
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,990
This one says that if you have a constant multiplying a function inside of an interval you can take

73
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,670
out the constant get the integral and then multiplied Bacchante.

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,990
This is very similar to the constant multiple rule for derivatives.

75
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,530
Take out the constant Do your thing and then multiplied back in.

76
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,400
And then finally the sum and difference rule again very similar to the sum and difference for all four

77
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,110
derivatives tells you that if you have an integral that's composed of a sum or a difference of functions

78
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:22,150
you can take each individual integral added up or subtract it depending on what's the sign and then

79
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,640
that way you put it together.

80
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,630
All right.

81
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,510
That is it for indefinite integrals.

82
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,120
I know it's a little bit different from derivatives but hey at the same time it's a breath of fresh

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,580
air.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,040
So hopefully you enjoy doing integrals instead of derivatives for a change.

85
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,660
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
