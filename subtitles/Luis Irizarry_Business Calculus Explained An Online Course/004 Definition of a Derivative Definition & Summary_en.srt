1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,300
Are right so let's formalize the concept and the definition of a derivative is so a derivative is a

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,670
measure of how a function is changing.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,040
So that's what a derivative does it tells you how the function is changing at a specific point.

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,430
And again the word derivative can refer to either the derivative function or to the actual rate of change

5
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,250
at a specific point and to know which one you're talking about.

6
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,430
Well you have to look at the problem that you're given.

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,590
Again let me repeat this once more.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,570
If you're told.

9
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:07,110
Find the derivative of for example f of x equals execute then its derivative will be 3 x squared and

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,150
you don't have to worry about how I got that answer.

11
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
We're going to we're going to learn that later.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
This would be the derivative.

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,690
But this is also the derivative function right because you have one function.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,670
And from there you get another function.

15
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:27,610
Now if I ask you to find the rate of change of x cubed at a specific point.

16
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,780
So for example I want to find the rate of change when X equals four.

17
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,560
What I'll do is I'll go ahead and grab the number four.

18
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,400
And we're going to plug it in to this derivative function.

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,200
So

20
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,590
rate of change

21
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,700
when X equals four.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,450
We're going to plug in four into this function three times.

23
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,730
For squared

24
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:16,250
so that's three times sixteen and three times 16 is just 64.

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,370
All right.

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,750
So this is called the derivative.

27
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,780
But then this instantaneous rate of change at a specific point is also called the derivative

28
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,310
right.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,470
And I'm repeating this a lot but I want to make sure that you get it where derivative can either refer

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,710
to the derivative function or to a specific rate of change at a specific point.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:54,980
And the way to denote a derivative mathematically like we just saw is limits of X plus H.

32
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,390
Mine is for VAX over age as age approaches zero.

33
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,090
So remember to find them just plug it in.

34
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,760
However in this case we cannot just plug in zero for H because it is in the denominator plugging in

35
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,320
zero.

36
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,070
H is going to give us a denominator of zero which is not good.

37
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,230
So to find derivatives using this formula where you need to do is you need to just go ahead and plug

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,800
in these values into the formula and then at some point you'll be able to cancel out the H's one on

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,020
top and one on the bottom and at that point you can actually go ahead and plug in zero for each.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,430
The really good thing is we have derivative rules so you don't really have to use this all the time.

41
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,130
That would be really annoying.

42
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,930
We're going to learn about derivative rules in the next section.

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,150
And basically a derivative rule allows you to find the derivative for any function that you want very

44
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,820
easily.

45
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,240
However your professor might want you to learn this formula so I don't really have a mnemonic for this

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,850
one.

47
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,970
This is just pretty much something that you need to write a couple times until you actually remember

48
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,390
how it looks.

49
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:26,010
And again it's really not that hard on the top you have f of x plus H minus f x everything over H.

50
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,610
And then you have a limit as h approaches zero.

51
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,800
We'll do a couple of examples on how to get derivatives using this formula.

52
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,350
But again we're going to get into derivative rules later on.

53
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,160
So one last thing before we go to the summary.

54
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,600
I just want you to be aware of a certain word and the word is differentiation.

55
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,530
What is differentiation differentiation is the process

56
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,010
of finding

57
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:19,880
a derivative.

58
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,540
All right.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,910
That's pretty much it.

60
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,860
So when you're asked to differentiate something you're just finding it's derivative.

61
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,390
So for example if I tell you let's differentiate x squared

62
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,360
then we differentiate it and we get two x.

63
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,690
We just found it's derivative and again like we said derivative can either mean the derivative function

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,760
or an actual rate of change.

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:54,980
So if we say let's differentiate x squared to find the rate of change at X equals 5 then we have to

66
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,140
plug in 5 into this function.

67
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,660
That's going to give us 10 and 10 again.

68
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
Is a derivative

69
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,880
when X equals five

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,630
So differentiation it can either mean find this derivative function or find the actual derivative for

71
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,060
aspecific x.

72
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,480
All right.

73
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,830
That's pretty much it.

74
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,800
All right so let's go over a summary of this very important section.

75
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,470
So as the points in a second line get closer together the second approximates a tangent line.

76
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,000
This is a really cool thing because you have a second line.

77
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,260
It measures the average rate of change.

78
00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:00,070
But as a point get closer or like we said as the H gets smaller then this line gets closer and closer

79
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,260
to a tangent line.

80
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,540
And remember the tangent line is what we want for instantaneous rate of change.

81
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,090
Then when you get your tangent line we have that the slope of a line tangent to a point in the curve

82
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,380
gives you the instantaneous rate of change.

83
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:23,950
So if you have a curve and you have a specific point of that curve and you draw a line that touches

84
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:31,850
the graph at that specific point the slope of that line will give you the instantaneous rate of change.

85
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,310
And then we have that a derivative is given by this formula.

86
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,140
Remember we have limits of half of X plus H

87
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,750
minus F X over h h approaches zero.

88
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,500
This my friends is a definition of a derivative.

89
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,300
So if you're given a function you need to plug it in here and you need to find the limit that's going

90
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,970
to give you back the derivative function with the derivative function.

91
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,050
You can find the instantaneous rate of change at any point for that function.

92
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:23,520
So as an example we did f of x equals x squared.

93
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,290
So once we plug in x squared over here we ended up getting

94
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,100
2 x 2 x is our derivative function.

95
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:42,030
So with this derivative function we can find the rate of change at any point of x squared.

96
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,590
All right.

97
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:50,530
So don't get them confused f of x is the original function to x is the derivative function of x squared

98
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,820
and derivatives measure what they measure.

99
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,810
Rate of Change

100
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,780
measure rate of change of a function

101
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,710
right.

102
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,220
This is what I derivative does and again derivatives are fundamental to calculus.

103
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,860
So you should totally know that when ever you're asked to find the rate of change of a function or whenever

104
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,160
you're asked to find oh let's find out how this function is changing.

105
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,750
You need to use derivatives.

106
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,930
Right now the word derivative can either mean the derivative function or the rate of change at a specific

107
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,810
point.

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,130
And this happens a lot or both definitions are used.

109
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,390
That's the case in most books.

110
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,570
So for example if you're asked to find the derivative of x squared first then you're always going to

111
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,930
do is find the derivative function right which is also called the derivative.

112
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,440
But if you're asked to find the derivative at a specific point first you need to find the function anyways.

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,200
The derivative function you always have to find it anyways.

114
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,450
And then you plug in your number here.

115
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,200
All right and finally to differentiate means to find a derivative.

116
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,810
Yes it's actually a verb.

117
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,070
Isn't that crazy.

118
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
But yeah that's the way it works.

119
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:29,760
All right.

120
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,550
So I have the last three points.

121
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,450
So number one is the tangent line to a point is the instantaneous rate of change at that point which

122
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,680
is the derivative.

123
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,340
All right.

124
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,890
So we were talking about instantaneous rate of change.

125
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,100
You find the derivative because that's exactly what it is.

126
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,480
All right.

127
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:57,900
And to be more specific the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change which is the slope of this

128
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,380
tangent line not the line itself but the slope.

129
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Remember the derivative in general is just a value right.

130
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,600
It's a rate of change.

131
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,630
So it's equal to the slope of this tangent line.

132
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,830
Then to find the derivative function of f of x so if we're given a function f of x y you need to do

133
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,540
is you need to plug that function f of x into the definition of the derivative.

134
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,540
And then you actually go ahead and find the limit remember.

135
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,650
And we just did this.

136
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,080
But I'll repeat it again.

137
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,740
The definition of a derivative is a limit of half of X plus H.

138
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:44,180
Mine is fallbacks over h as h approaches zero.

139
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,610
This is the definition of a derivative.

140
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,770
So if you want to find the derivative function of f of x you take f of x.

141
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,880
You plug it in here you do some manipulation which will do a couple of examples off and then you find

142
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,610
the limit that's going to give you the derivative function then to find the instantaneous rate of change

143
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,570
of a function for a specific point.

144
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,210
You simply plug in the x value of the points into the derivative function which is the one that you've

145
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,550
found by doing this.

146
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,350
So once you have your derivative function you can use it to find the instantaneous rate of change at

147
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,930
any points in that function.

148
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,330
OK so going back.

149
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,110
All right so we just cover derivatives.

150
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:34,140
If this video didn't make a lot of sense please just go back put me in a 1.5 speed or whatever you want

151
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,560
to do but watch it again.

152
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,610
You passing this class depends on you understanding this video.

153
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,860
All right you need to understand what's going on here.

154
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,610
You need to understand what a derivative does is to understand how we get derivatives need to understand

155
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,860
where they come from.

156
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,560
And you need to understand in general what you do with derivatives.

157
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,110
All right.

158
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,850
We have a lot more videos for derivatives.

159
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,370
We're going to see the applications of derivatives.

160
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,520
So how they are applied to business and we're also going to see the different rules that we can use

161
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,560
to find derivatives of functions.

162
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,140
So like I mentioned before you don't have to use this formula all the time.

163
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,910
That would be a pain.

164
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,110
There are several rules that we can use to find derivatives of functions that make it easier for us

165
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,820
to find those derivatives.

166
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,740
All right.

167
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,940
So again super important topic.

168
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,860
I recommend you watch it again even if it is in 1.5 2x whatever you want to do.

169
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,570
Just go ahead and watch it again if it didn't make a lot of sense.

170
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,070
So I'll definitely see you at the next tutorial.
