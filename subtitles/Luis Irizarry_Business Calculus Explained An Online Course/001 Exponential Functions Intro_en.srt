00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,780
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,050
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,440
Today we're going to talk about exponential functions and we'll get to the definition of an exponential

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,180
function in a second.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,320
Before that though let's talk a little about exponents.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,790
So remember that and xponent just tells you how to multiply a base by itself.

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,180
It tells you how many times to do it.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:55,140
So for example if you have two to the third power then the two is called the base

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:07,870
and the three is called the exponent.

10
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,250
So remember the exponent is always to the right of the base and it's a little bit higher and a little

11
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,210
bit smarter.

12
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,600
So this is how you know that this is not.

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:24,120
But two to the three began the exponent is up here and it's very small.

14
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,250
So what this expression means is that you're going to multiply the base by itself and the exponent tells

15
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,450
you how many times.

16
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:45,590
So two to the three is to times two times two right.

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,880
So we're multiplying the base by itself three times

18
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,460
and two times two is four times two is eight.

19
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,950
All right.

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,130
So two to the three is equal to eight.

21
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,330
Let's do another example.

22
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,380
Let's say we have four to the second power.

23
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,060
And remember that anything to the second power is also called squared.

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:27,630
So four squared is basically four times four so you are multiplying four by itself two times.

25
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,190
And that equals 16.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,630
All right.

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,390
So that's all that exponents do.

28
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,780
All right so let's cover a couple of different cases of other exponents.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:55,480
What happens when you have fractions as exponents.

30
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:07,220
So for example let's say you have four and the exponent is two over four.

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,230
All right so the exponent itself is a fraction.

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,420
How does this work.

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:25,070
Well there's a rule that says that if you have a base a to the exponents be oversee this becomes.

34
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,250
So we have base to the top of the fraction.

35
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,910
So a to be.

36
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,120
And then we take the route and the route is seat.

37
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,780
All right.

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,420
I know this might be a little confusing but let's take a look at the example but again where we have

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:55,970
if we have a base elevated to a fraction B oversee then what we do is we keep the aid to the B right.

40
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,170
Here we get a root the number outside of the root is c..

41
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,120
So let's apply this rule right here.

42
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,770
So again this is for the two or four.

43
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,390
So we keep the four to the second power

44
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:23,250
and we take the fourth root.

45
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:33,130
So that is going to be equal to the fourth root of four squared which is 16.

46
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,360
So this is like the inverse of exponent.

47
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,250
So we're looking for a number so that when you multiplied by itself four times you get 16.

48
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,260
And that number is two because two times two times two attempts to is 16.

49
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,820
So this is your answer.

50
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,360
Now what's really important here and what I want you to look at is the fact that we can solve problems

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,420
that have fractions in the exponents using this rule over here.

52
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,380
And again we'll do a couple of examples on that later on.

53
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,500
So for now don't worry about it.

54
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,540
Just make sure that you know that a stays with the B.

55
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:23,700
So that's a to the beat and then you put the roots and the number outside the root is C.

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,310
All right so another case is when you have negative numbers in the exponents

57
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
how do we handle these.

58
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:46,970
So for example what if you have two to the negative three we solve this.

59
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,670
It's kind of weird because this tells you this xponent how many times to multiply 2 by itself.

60
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,060
So you might think oh ashes negative two times negative two times negative two.

61
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,540
That's the way it works the way it works is this.

62
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,450
So if you have for example and this is the rule a to the negative b.

63
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,260
So you have a base of a.

64
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:21,840
And then the exponent is negative b then that means that you're going to keep your age to the B but

65
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,110
you're going to have a fraction and there's going to be a 1 on top.

66
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,110
OK.

67
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:34,200
So basically this a to the negative b comes to the bottom over fraction and you flip the sign on the

68
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,940
exponent.

69
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,600
So here we had a to the negative b.

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,240
That became a to b.

71
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,610
And again this is now the bottom of a fraction.

72
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:53,150
So we have one over to the OK so let's apply this rule over here before that.

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,200
Let me circle it so that you know it's a rule so let's apply it here.

74
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,070
There's going to be equal to one over.

75
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,600
So we always do the one over and then we bring this whole thing to the bottom but it comes in with a

76
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,690
flip sign for the exponent.

77
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:19,540
So instead of being to the negative three it is two to three.

78
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,350
All right.

79
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,230
And finally we have won over what is two to three.

80
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,620
It's two times two is four times two again is eight.

81
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,640
So this is one over eight.

82
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,910
All right.

83
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,160
So again if you have a negative exponent you can always bring down this whole expression to the bottom

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,300
by flipping the sign of the exponent and let's do one more rule.

85
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,030
So if you have something to the zero power

86
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,230
it's going to put a line through the zero just so that you know it is zero.

87
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,550
So as a rule you probably know this by now.

88
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:10,600
Anything let's call anything a 2 0 equals 1.

89
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,980
All right.

90
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
You might think it's 0 but it's not.

91
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,640
It actually equals one.

92
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,090
We don't have to get into the why does remember when you have anything to zero.

93
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:29,940
That is one I remember in our derivative rules sometimes we have for example the derivative of X right.

94
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:42,870
So that gives us like x 2 to 1 minus 1 x 2 0 0 and X of the 0 is 1.

95
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,540
That's why the derivative of x by itself is 1 and it doesn't matter if it's X or if it's a number.

96
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,830
So for example 3 to 0 is 1

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,130
22 2 0 is 1 etc. etc..

98
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,940
So in general anything to the zero power is one.

99
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,300
All right.

100
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,200
So we covered four things we covered exponents and how they work.

101
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,110
Remember that this number here is the base and the exponent is on top to the right.

102
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,050
A little bit smaller the exponent tells you how many times to multiply the base by itself.

103
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,130
Then sometimes you have exponents that are fractions.

104
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,970
In that case you keep the base to the top.

105
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,790
So in this case it's forward to the two.

106
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,480
Right.

107
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,110
And then we do roots and we do the fourth root.

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:47,720
So this bottom actually comes as a root over here then we have the case where we have negative exponents.

109
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,470
If you have a base to a negative exponent you can actually bring down this whole term bring it down

110
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,350
here and then you flip the sign of the exponent.

111
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,150
So instead of being negative 3 it becomes positive 3.

112
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,320
All right.

113
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,510
That gave us 1 over 8.

114
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,450
And here's the rule and again very important.

115
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,530
You have to switch the sign of this exponent.

116
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,340
Here it was negative.

117
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,770
But when we brought it down it became positive.

118
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:25,210
And finally the property of zero power anything to the zero power is always 1.

119
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,560
So with this in mind let's go ahead and visit exponential functions.
