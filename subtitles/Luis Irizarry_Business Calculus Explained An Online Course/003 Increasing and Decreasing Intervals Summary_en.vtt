00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.560
All right.

2
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.580
So this summer is a little bit bigger than what we're used to but just bear with me.

3
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.410
It's a first topic on the application of derivatives that we cover.

4
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.300
So I want to make sure that we have everything here summarized for you.

5
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.240
So let's start functions can be increasing for some intervals and decreasing for other intervals.

6
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.620
And remember that an interval is a group of x values.

7
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.440
There are some functions however that are only increasing and there are some others that are only decreasing.

8
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.330
But for the most part you'll be dealing with functions that are both increasing for some interval and

9
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.030
decreasing for others.

10
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.930
A function is increasing the y values get bigger as you move from left to right.

11
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.450
So as the x values get bigger the y values also get bigger for an increasing function.

12
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.510
On the other hand a function is decreasing if the Y values get smaller as you move from left to right.

13
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.730
So if you look at the graph from left to right the y values are going down and that is your next point.

14
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:31.680
If you have a graph then increasing means that the graph is going up and decreasing means that it's

15
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.150
actually going down.

16
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220
I remember that we always do this as we look at it from left to right.

17
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600
So it's in the same direction that you're right from left to right.

18
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.580
This is the same way that we look at graphs.

19
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.070
Now you do not always have a graph available so sometimes you have to use derivatives to find the intervals

20
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.230
where a function is increasing and the intervals where it is decreasing.

21
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.320
So using derivatives if a derivative is positive.

22
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.370
In other words if it's greater than zero then the original function is increasing.

23
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.280
On the other hand if a derivative is negative then the original function is decreasing.

24
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.740
Right.

25
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.040
So they go hand-in-hand derivative positive original function increasing derivative negative all original

26
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.520
function decreasing.

27
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.890
Finally if a derivative is zero then the original function is neither increasing or decreasing.

28
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.720
And finally this is the main thing and this is how you're going to solve problems.

29
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.940
This is a three step process that you use to find the intervals of increase and decrease for a function.

30
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.180
So step one is to find the derivative.

31
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.230
You always have to find the derivative.

32
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.770
Step two is to find the values that make the derivative equal to zero and to find the values that make

33
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.860
the derivative undefined.

34
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.770
Remember that this on the step is only done when you have a bottom part of the derivative.

35
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.350
If there is no bottom part there's no fraction.

36
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.000
You only have to find the values that make it equal to zero.

37
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.570
But if there is a fraction then you need to do is find the values that make it equal to zero.

38
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.460
So that means you set the top equal to zero.

39
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.480
And you also have to find the values that make the bottom equal to zero.

40
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.630
That's the undefined part.

41
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.770
And then finally once you have those values and make it equal to zero and undefined you're going to

42
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.920
grab those values.

43
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.830
You can put them in a number line which actually looks something like this

44
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.110
that's called a number line.

45
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.510
And remember like we did in the example for example.

46
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.500
So let's say that there is a zero an X equals 2.

47
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.550
That means we have to test to the left of two and to the right of two.

48
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.650
And so to the left of two we can pick for example 1 and to the right of 2 we can pick for example 3.

49
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.240
So what we do is we take these test values 1 and 3.

50
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.310
And you plug them into the derivative.

51
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.280
So let's say that we plugged into one and he gave us a positive number.

52
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.330
That means that to the left of two the derivative is positive.

53
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.380
Let's say that we plugged that three into the derivative and he gave us a negative number.

54
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.510
So that means that to the right of to a derivative is negative.

55
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.520
This means that for numbers less than two the graph of the original function is increasing because the

56
00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:00.650
derivative is positive and to the rights of to the graph of the original function is decreasing because

57
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.260
a derivative is negative.

58
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.660
Right.

59
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.140
This is pretty much it.

60
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.510
I know it's a lot that we covered but bear with me the more problems you do easier it's going to be

61
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.330
at some point it becomes second nature.

62
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.910
We're going to be like oh ok.

63
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.600
Intervals of increase and decrease.

64
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.030
Let's find a derivative we find the values that make the derivative equals zero and undefined.

65
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.880
And then you plug it into the derivative etc.

66
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.410
All right.

67
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:35.360
So we'll keep going over some more applications of derivatives and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
