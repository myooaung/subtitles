1
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,840
All right.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,960
So before we get started with the course I want to go over a couple of things.

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,070
The first one is the course structure so the Course is divided into seven main calculus sections.

4
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,740
These are pretty much the same sections that you should see in your textbook.

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,690
And I made it like that so that it resembles your class the most.

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:47,880
So the sections are functions and graphing limits and continuity derivatives differentiation rules applications

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,100
of derivatives exponential and logarithmic functions and integrals.

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,770
By the time you're watching this video I might have other new sections so I'm going to have a section

9
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,370
for the introduction to the course where for example this video is going to be.

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,560
And any other section that I plan to add.

11
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:14,350
However the 7 will always be there because these are the main sections for Bessus calculus.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,590
And then within each section you're going to have videos on different topics.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:26,130
So in these videos I will go ahead and explain concepts go over mnemonics and do examples so that you

14
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,980
know how stuff works because applying what we just learned is critical.

15
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,020
That's why I do examples for each of the things that we learn.

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,070
Besides I also give you practice exercises which we're going to cover right now.

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,870
All right so for the practice exercises each section has practice exercises for you to do so as you

18
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,210
go through each section.

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,040
I'll have videos for you to practice what you just learned.

20
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,220
So the way the videos work is I give you a problem I give you some time to pause the video and do it.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,820
And then after that you pause the video and we'll do it together.

22
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,880
That way you can see if you got the right answer and you can see if your process is correct.

23
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,340
Now let me say something very clearly you need to do these exercises.

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,830
All right.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,910
You need to.

26
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,270
It's not that you should.

27
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:32,100
You need to do these exercises if you think that all you're going to do is watch these videos and then

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,490
you're going to magically pass the class.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,430
I have news for you that is not going to happen.

30
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,230
The only way to learn math is by practice.

31
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,780
All right.

32
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,570
Let me repeat that again because it's critical.

33
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,640
The only way that you're going to learn this stuff is by doing so you absolutely need to get out a piece

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,010
of paper and a pencil and sit down and try to do the exercises in the tutorials.

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,070
I give you all of the tools that you need to solve exercises.

36
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,540
But even if you do not know how to do them you have to pause the video and give it a shot.

37
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,430
That is so so important.

38
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,770
I've tutored many students over the years that what they did was they took two hours of tutoring with

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,170
me and after that we went over some concepts.

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,880
We went over a couple of problems and they thought they were good to go.

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,410
Guess what those students didn't do well in tests.

42
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,260
The ones that did well and eventually pass the class were the ones that practiced more and more and

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,860
more.

44
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,290
All right.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,970
So for every section do the practice exercises they're going to help you drill what you just learned

46
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,020
in your head.

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,830
All right.

48
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,730
And another point is you need to do your homework so whatever homework your professor gives you it's

49
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,850
for a reason.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,590
Guess what those problems that you're doing the homework a lot of them will show up in quizzes and midterms

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,600
and in final exams.

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,410
So you need to do your homework.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,700
So just like I had students that came to tutoring for two hours a week and then took a test and didn't

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,300
do well in the same way you cannot just come to the videos do the practice exercises that I give you

55
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,310
and then call it a day.

56
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,110
You also need to do your homework.

57
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,000
What better way to practice what you just learned than by doing your homework.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,750
All right.

59
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,170
Let me tell you the mnemonics as good as they are they might not get into your head the first time you

60
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,730
have to do them over and over again.

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,760
So every single homework exercise that you get you need to do.

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,580
Sometimes it's going to be difficult sometimes it's going to be boring.

63
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,960
You might not feel like it but do you want to pass this class or not.

64
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,790
If you do you need to do.

65
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,680
Number one the exercises that I give you.

66
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,270
And number two you need to do your homework.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,380
And again no excuses like Sheil above says just just do it do it.
