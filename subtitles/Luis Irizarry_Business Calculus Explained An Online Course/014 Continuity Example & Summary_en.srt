1
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,250
All right.

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,630
So let's do a quick example to check if a function is continuous at different points.

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,470
So let's throw a piecewise function

4
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,890
so we'll have it looking something like is up to here.

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,970
Then we'll have our next function.

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,410
Looking something like this and a third function looking like this

7
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,570
right.

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,590
So let's say that this is negative too right.

9
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,560
Because this is the X-axis.

10
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:37,850
So to the left is negative to your x value and let's say that this one is three positive three because

11
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,930
it's one to three to the right.

12
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,950
And let's do one more let's say that this is five.

13
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,450
All right.

14
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,790
So we're going to check for continuity at these three x values.

15
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,850
Negative 2 3 and 5.

16
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,790
All right.

17
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:04,400
So remember our mnemonic says that the equals L.

18
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,070
That's how we're going to check if the function is continuous.

19
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,930
So let's start with x equals negative 2.

20
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,800
So remember it's three conditions.

21
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,490
The first one is f of x defined for negative 2.

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,230
So when you plug in negative 2 into half of X. What do you get.

23
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,450
Well it actually is defined.

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,600
And if you remember when the circles shaded in.

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,290
That means that that's where you get the actual y value.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,350
So when you plug in negative to the point is not up here.

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,800
It's actually down here.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,040
So let's say that this is negative 3 because you're going three down.

29
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,920
OK.

30
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,900
So when you plug in negative to your y value is negative 3.

31
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,340
All right.

32
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,830
That's a good start.

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,590
The function is defined for negative 2.

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,250
Then we do our second check the L.

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,680
So we have to make sure that the limit from the left equals the limit from the right.

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:25,880
So limits of X as x approaches negative 2 from the left is what right.

37
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,230
So let's run through here.

38
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,110
This is negative 2.

39
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,800
By the way.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:39,740
So as we approach it from the left it looks like the limit is going to be let's say that this is three.

41
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,010
So the limit from the left is three.

42
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,320
Let's find out about the limit from the right limit of f of x

43
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,060
as x approaches negative 2.

44
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,660
But this time from the right

45
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:07,260
so negative 2 is over here let's approach it from the right as we approach it from the right it looks

46
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,920
like the y values are going to be negative 3.

47
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,430
OK.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:25,070
So the limit from the left is three but the limit from the right is negative 3.

49
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,000
That means that the limit from the left is different than the limit from there right.

50
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:44,530
And this is how you say that limit of X as x approaches negative 2 from the left is different.

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,050
So this is a sign for different.

52
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,420
It's basically an equal sign with a line crossed over it.

53
00:04:51,420 --> 00:05:01,160
So the limit from the left is different than the limit from the right approaches is negative two from

54
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,910
the right.

55
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,580
Therefore because these two limits are different.

56
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,920
That means that our second condition which is that the limit exists is not true.

57
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,250
Remember that if a limit from the left is different then a limit from the right.

58
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,370
Then we know that the limit does not exist as x approaches that number.

59
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:30,810
Therefore because a limit does not exist we know the function is not continues for X equals negative

60
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,230
to.

61
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,510
So this is no knock continues.

62
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,810
We don't even have to check if the definition equals the limit because at this point the lever doesn't

63
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,260
even exist right.

64
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,430
So we can say no and it's not continuous over there.

65
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:46,900
Right.

66
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,170
So let's try our second point and that is when X equals three.

67
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,820
All right.

68
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,890
So first thing we're going to do is on I forgot to number these.

69
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,420
So this would be condition number one and its starts condition number two and we never checked for number

70
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,940
3 because if the limit doesn't exist there's nothing to check for.

71
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:19,090
All right so number 1 is again D is the function defined for X equals 3.

72
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,980
So when you plug in F of 3 What do you get.

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,370
So when you plug n f of 3 here.

74
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,390
Well it looks like we have a problem right here.

75
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,720
3.

76
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,860
So in the blue graph the three is not included because it's not shaded it.

77
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,150
However in the green graph it looks like also it's not included.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,920
Right because it's an open circle.

79
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,970
Actually in both of these is an open circle.

80
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,030
What does that mean.

81
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:58,750
That means that when you plug in three there's nothing that you get back because three is not defined

82
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,480
for this function.

83
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,120
So of three is actually undefined.

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,460
And again let me repeat.

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:22,650
It's undefined because both circles are not shaded in this other case this one down here was shaded.

86
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,330
That's why when you plug in negative 2 you get negative 3.

87
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,610
However here both of them are open circles.

88
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,320
Therefore when you plug in three there's no y value associated with it.

89
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,980
That's why we have this jump and it's why we have to open circles.

90
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,810
So actually in this case the first condition isn't even true F 3 is not defined.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,670
Therefore this is not continuous either.

92
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,850
So you see how the process works you start checking for the three conditions.

93
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,930
D l if one of them is not true then you can stop checking at that point and you can say that it's not

94
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,920
continuous So in your first example the limit does not exist because the one from the left to the right

95
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,710
are not equal.

96
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,930
The second example of three is not even defined.

97
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,800
Some part of the domain.

98
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:25,020
And we know that based on the graph here and because it's not defined it's not content is because it

99
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,110
doesn't pass the first condition.

100
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Let's do our last number here when X equals 5.

101
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,240
So first condition is f 5.

102
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,250
When we plug in 5 what do we get.

103
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,580
So when we plug in 5 it falls over here the point.

104
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,980
Let's say that this is one okra.

105
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,210
So we do have a point.

106
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,460
So for five equals 1 it is defined.

107
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,150
Everything looks OK.

108
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,550
Now let's do limit of X

109
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:19,720
as x approaches 5 from the left so five is already here.

110
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,110
As we approach it from the left it looks like the y value is going to be one good

111
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
now let's approach it from the right

112
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,360
as x approaches 5 from the right.

113
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,490
That's going to be sorgen 5 is here as we approach it from the right.

114
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,720
It looks like the y value is going to be one as well.

115
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,980
Very good.

116
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,100
That means that the limit exists because as you approach it from the left is the same as when you approach

117
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,010
it from the right.

118
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,540
They both equal one.

119
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,110
Great.

120
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,410
So we have already defined.

121
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,290
We have l.

122
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,720
The limit exists now that d equals L is a third condition.

123
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,900
So does d equal L.

124
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,260
So the question is does f of 5 equal this limit in general.

125
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,760
So we have that f of 5

126
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,530
is it equal to limits.

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,260
F of x as x approaches 5.

128
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,590
Is that true.

129
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,200
OK so what is f a 5.

130
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,750
Well we said F of 5 is 1.

131
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,080
So is one equal to what is the limit of f of x.

132
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,650
X approaches 5.

133
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,590
Remember this is not from the left or from the right.

134
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,900
This is in general and like we said if the limit from the left is equal to the limit from the right

135
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,670
then the limit in general is equal to whatever those two are equal to.

136
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,330
All right so the limit from the left equals 1 and the limit from the right equals 1 than the limit of

137
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,640
general equals 1 as well.

138
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,710
So in this case that is true.

139
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,150
They're both equal.

140
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:25,630
So the limit of 5 x x approaches 5 in general is also one hey what do we have here.

141
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:31,090
F four 5 equals 1 limit is X or bridges 5 also equals 1.

142
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,110
This means that in fact after 5 the definition equals the limit.

143
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,190
So the third conditions also true.

144
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,880
OK.

145
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,240
One equals one.

146
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:51,350
This means that the function is continuous for X equals 5.

147
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,220
OK.

148
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,700
Great.

149
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,740
So just to recap we tested three points and the first point the limit from the left is different than

150
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,990
the limit from the right.

151
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,930
Therefore it continues on the second point.

152
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,770
X equals 3.

153
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,460
The function is not even defined for 3.

154
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,880
So it's not continuous either.

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,010
However for X equals 5.

156
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,540
All three conditions are true.

157
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,590
It is defined for 5.

158
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,360
The limit from the left equals the limit from the right and the definition equals the limit in general.

159
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,760
Right.

160
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,720
So that's how you know it continues.

161
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,880
And remember you can do the pencil test to test it quickly.

162
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:40,620
So if you try to draw that is when you get to here you definitely need to lift your pencil to keep on

163
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,880
doing the function.

164
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,140
So you get to hear you lift your pencil and you go down here.

165
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,390
That's why it's not continuous at this point because you have to lift your pencil and same thing here.

166
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,680
Here you also have to lift your pencil.

167
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,600
All right.

168
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,900
So that's how we know that the function is not continuous everywhere but to be more precise and to check

169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,230
at a specific point.

170
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,280
We use the D equals l mnemonic which is a test for continuity.

171
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,820
All right.

172
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,700
That's pretty much it.

173
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,590
I know that three conditions can be difficult to remember but hopefully with a D equals L Do you know

174
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,470
how to do them.

175
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,920
So you can check that out in the examples section.

176
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,810
And let's go into our summary.

177
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,160
All right.

178
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,720
So a quick summary of what we just covered.

179
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,640
You use the pencil test to test for continuity everywhere and the pencil test says if you can draw a

180
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,870
graph without lifting your pencil then the function is continuous everywhere.

181
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,870
And when we say continuous everywhere that means for all x values.

182
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,440
So if you can draw the graph you don't have to be lifting your pencil to like make a jump or do something

183
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,910
else then it is continuous.

184
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,060
On the other hand if you do have to lift your pencil and the graph is not continues.

185
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:07,050
Remember when you think of the word continues or continuity then think about interruptions.

186
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,590
Right.

187
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,380
If it continues it's not meant to be interrupted.

188
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,470
But again if you're drawing your graph and you need to interrupt it by lifting your pencil then it's

189
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:25,360
not continuous that's for checking continuity everywhere to check for continuity at a specific point

190
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,240
where X equals a.

191
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,560
There are three checks.

192
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:37,120
So again those checks are number one that f of a is defined.

193
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,360
So it's part of the domain

194
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,170
and again remember we talked about domain a long time ago.

195
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,340
Basically you cannot plug in anything that gives you division over zero.

196
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,560
Also you cannot plug in anything that's going to give you a negative number under an even root.

197
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,410
Also if you're given the graph on the graph there is no definition for that.

198
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:08,380
A like we saw in the last example for one of the points then it's not defined.

199
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:17,630
Number two is that the limits must exist as x approaches that number a.

200
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:33,950
So that means that the limits of fallbacks as x approaches a from the left must be equal to the limit

201
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:41,930
of X as x approaches a from the right OK.

202
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,510
So the limit from the left must be equal to the limit from the right.

203
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:54,410
That means that the limit in general exists and when we put this here this means that the limit of f

204
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,850
of x as x approaches A exists.

205
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,080
Right so if these two limits are different the one from the left and the one from the right.

206
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,910
Stop looking for continuity.

207
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,160
It is not continuous.

208
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,920
And finally and very important.

209
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,580
Number three says that number one must be equal to number two.

210
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,100
So f of a

211
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:33,530
has to be equal to the limit of f of x as x approaches a.

212
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,950
And again this limit is not from the left or the right.

213
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,540
This is just this generic limit and you know it exists.

214
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,030
If the one from the left equals the one from the right.

215
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,090
OK.

216
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:54,690
So those are your three conditions for ways to find the limit exists and the definition equals the limit.

217
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,800
And finally we have a favorite.

218
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:04,720
We have a demonic for remembering these three d equals L and again a way to remember this is.

219
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,000
Driver's license is continuous.

220
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,050
Once you get it you don't need to get it every day.

221
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,290
It's valid for a good amount of time.

222
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:21,310
So therefore the initials of driver's license or DL and you just say d equals L So we d equals L.

223
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,410
What you have is the three conditions.

224
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,950
First one is D.

225
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,859
So D is defined right.

226
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,540
So the function needs to be defined for the point that you're checking.

227
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,810
Number two is the limit of every x x x approaches that number A exists.

228
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,770
So the limit from the left must be equal to the limit from the right.

229
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,440
And finally you have a third condition which is the whole thing.

230
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:57,850
D equals L So the y value that you get when you plug in a definition equals the limit as x approaches

231
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,820
a.

232
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,560
Basically in other words Number one equals number two.

233
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,440
All right.

234
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,870
That's pretty much it.

235
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,930
I know continuity is not a favorite topic for business calculus students but hopefully that makes a

236
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,270
little bit of sense.

237
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:20,180
We'll do a couple of problems so you get more used to it and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
