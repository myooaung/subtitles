1
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,400
All right.

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,220
So let's do a couple of exercises for identifying whether a function is a constant function or not.

3
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,830
So the first one that we have is identify whether f of x equals 10 is a constant function.

4
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,220
So these are basically yes or no questions.

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,220
It's either a constant function or it isn't.

6
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,820
So just go ahead and pause a video and write your answer down.

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,250
All right.

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,880
So identify whether f of x equals 10 is a constant function.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,990
The answer is actually yes.

10
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,930
Yes it is a constant function.

11
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,670
Why.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:08,140
Because f of x is equal to a number anytime that f of x is equal to the number then we have a constant

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,800
function right.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,800
There are no axes no letters just f of x equals 10.

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,250
All right.

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,710
I'm moving on to the next one.

17
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,340
Identify y f of x equals Pi is a constant function.

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,610
So is it is pi a constant function.

19
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,210
This might be a little tricky because pi it kind of looks like a symbol and not really a number but

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,620
I'll let you figure it out.

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,940
So go ahead and pause the video and check it out.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,390
All right so what do you think is f of x equals pi a constant function.

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,100
The answer again is yes it is a constant function.

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,190
All right.

25
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,950
It is a constant function because pi at the end of the day is just a number.

26
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,130
Remember that pi is approximately equal to three point fourteen.

27
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,070
Right.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,080
So again f of x equals a number.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,850
So this is just a constant function.

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,300
All right.

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,870
So let's do one more identify whether f of x equals x is a constant function.

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,120
So f of x equals x.

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,650
Pause the video and give it a shot.

34
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,290
All right so is f of x equals x a constant function.

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,620
So let's see.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:46,040
So I remember it to be a constant function it needs to be equal to a number.

37
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
Here it's actually equal to a letter.

38
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,500
In fact in this function whatever you plug in is whatever you get out.

39
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:03,450
So the answer is no the y value is not always the same the y value actually depends on the input right.

40
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,670
If you plug in one you get 1.

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,590
But if you plug into you get two if you plug plugging three you get three etc. etc. for that reason

42
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:20,610
f of x is not a constant function because it's not equal to a simple number.
