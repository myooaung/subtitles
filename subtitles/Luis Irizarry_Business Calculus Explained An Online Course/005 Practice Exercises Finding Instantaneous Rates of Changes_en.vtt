1
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.300
All right.

2
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.950
So because we love our instantaneous rate of change so much.

3
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.840
Here are a couple of problems for you to practice.

4
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.240
So first one is find the instantaneous rate of change of half of X equals 3 x plus 1.

5
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.650
So this is your function.

6
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.540
Add the following x values when X equals 4 and when X equals 10.

7
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.350
I'll remind you we're looking for instantaneous rate of change.

8
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.270
All right.

9
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.220
So go ahead and pause a video and give it a shot.

10
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.530
All right.

11
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.050
So how do we do this.

12
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.239
Well the only tool we have right now for finding instantaneous rate of change is the definition of a

13
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.280
derivative.

14
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.470
And the definition of a derivative looks like this.

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.280
So we have limb of X plus H.

16
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.510
Mine is a VAX

17
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.590
over age as age approaches zero.

18
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.460
So remember this is the definition of a derivative.

19
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.610
And of course to find the way and plug it in.

20
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.960
But if we plug in zero for H We're going to get division by zero.

21
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.470
So that doesn't work.

22
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.330
What we need to do is we need to go ahead and plug in our function 3x plus one into this formula and

23
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.280
then we'll be able to get the limit.

24
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.980
So let's go ahead and do that.

25
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.090
So it's limits of.

26
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.850
So we have f of x plus H.

27
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.520
So we're going to plug in this X plus age into our function here.

28
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.660
So we would be three times x plus H.

29
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.870
Right.

30
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.920
And again x plus H is our input into this function.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.470
So then we do plus one

32
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.220
and then we have minus F X so minus what is f of x is the whole function completely.

33
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:41.390
All right so that's 3 x plus 1 everything over age as age approaches zero.

34
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.340
So we're going to do is we're going to simplify.

35
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.790
So limit of and remember this 3 gets distributed and X and in the age as well.

36
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.890
So it goes here and it also goes here.

37
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:09.810
So we multiply three times X is 3x and three times age is 3H plus three age.

38
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:19.570
Then we have the plus one and then this mine is also distributes in that 3x and in the one negative

39
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:28.500
times a positive is negative 3 x and again negative as a positive is also a negative.

40
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.280
So that's negative 1 minus 1

41
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.340
over h as age approaches zero.

42
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.320
So we have 3x and we have minus 3x.

43
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.310
So these two cancel out and we have one and then we have minus one.

44
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.380
So those cancel out as well.

45
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.810
What do we have left in the top.

46
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.630
We have 3H And why do we have in the bottom we have h h over H also cancels out.

47
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.880
And in fact let me do it down here just to make it more clean.

48
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.160
Limit of 3H over age as age approaches zero.

49
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.279
So we have h over age goes away.

50
00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.370
And remember that the limit of a constant is just the same constant.

51
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.370
So that's three in theory three is our derivative function.

52
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.410
But it turns out that this is a constant function meaning the y value never changes.

53
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.300
What does that tell you that tells you that the instantaneous rate of change everywhere on this function

54
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.980
is always three Arite.

55
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.340
It never changes from three.

56
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.530
And why is this.

57
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.030
Well think about it this is a linear function.

58
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.830
Remember linear functions look like lines and then this is the slope of that line.

59
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.630
This is not even a curve.

60
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.180
So if we had gone two points that lie in this graph and then get the slope of that line it would have

61
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.320
been three as well.

62
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.400
Therefore when X equals 4 and also an X equals 10.

63
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.690
The instantaneous rate of change.

64
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.750
So I R C equals 3 because it never changes.

65
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.000
So everywhere in this function the instantaneous rate of change equals three.

66
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.460
That's not that interesting because again we could have gotten this using slope.

67
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.100
This is not even a curve.

68
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.680
Now let's go into a problem where we do have a curve and we want to find the instantaneous rate of change.

69
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.260
All right so now we need to find the instantaneous rate of change of f of x which equals 3 x squared.

70
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.250
Now we're talking.

71
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.720
This is a curve.

72
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.080
Now we're not dealing with lines anymore.

73
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.780
We're actually finding something useful and we need to find it at the following x values x equals to

74
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.800
X equals 5 x equals 100.

75
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.440
All right so I'll let you go ahead and do your thing.

76
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.790
Pause the video and give it a shot.

77
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.370
All right.

78
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.090
So let's see how you did.

79
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.010
Let's again find the limit using the definition of a derivative.

80
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.760
So we'll just go ahead and plug it in directly.

81
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.720
Which we have limits of of X plus H.

82
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.920
Mine is of X over h as age approaches zero.

83
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.680
This is the definition of the derivative.

84
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.740
So we're going to go ahead and use this function and plug it in right here.

85
00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.840
So we have limits of f of x plus H.

86
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.460
So remember again we plug in this X plus H into this function.

87
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.540
So we have three x plus H squared

88
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.020
minus f of x.

89
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:29.010
So we just take this af of X and put it in 3 x squared over h h approaches zero.

90
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.590
All right.

91
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.320
So we need to expand this X plus H squared.

92
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.520
And how do we do that with foil.

93
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.950
So X plus H times x plus age

94
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.460
we use foil

95
00:07:48.470 --> 00:08:02.900
and foil says you multiply the first X times x is x squared than the outer X times H which is H x then

96
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:10.810
the enter H times x again which is again H x and then the last.

97
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.610
So h times H is H squared.

98
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.990
All right so now we have a result.

99
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.130
We'll keep doing our limit.

100
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:28.570
So limit of three times whatever we got here and this H.

101
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.799
X plus H x becomes 2 x.

102
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.159
Right.

103
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.450
Because you have two of them.

104
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:53.040
So we have three times Expo's age squared which is this x squared plus 2 h x plus H squared minus 3

105
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.070
x squared.

106
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.280
Over age as age approaches zero.

107
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.130
So remember what we're doing here is we're finding our derivative function.

108
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.600
This function gives us our instantaneous rate of change and then we can plug in numbers into that function

109
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:19.290
and get the instantaneous rate of change at all these different x values in the past problem or derivative

110
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.620
function was a constant.

111
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.500
That means that the rate of change was three everywhere.

112
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:32.010
In this case we're not going to get a constant We're going to get a function with an X in it.

113
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.340
That means we're going go ahead and plug in all these values.

114
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.320
All right.

115
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.990
And then to finish up.

116
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:45.590
Let's go ahead and distribute this three into each of these terms are here here and here.

117
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:56.850
That is going to give us limits of three times x squared is 3 x squared 3 times 2.

118
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:08.910
X is 6 x plus three times h squared is just 3H squared.

119
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.380
Then minus our 3 x squared

120
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.530
everything over h h approaches zero.

121
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.320
All right so we can always always always.

122
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.510
Every time we do the definition of a derivative eliminate some terms.

123
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:35.090
So let's get rid of that 3 x squared with this 3 x squared and check it out.

124
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.550
Let's move it over here.

125
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.150
So now we have limits of 6 H.

126
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.850
X plus 3 h squared.

127
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.900
It turns out that we can actually factor the H.

128
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.630
Right because the H is on the top part here and the first term.

129
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.790
And here in the second term.

130
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:04.240
So we factor out this age what do we have left.

131
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.070
So we took the age from this one.

132
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.000
So we only have six sex

133
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.990
and we factor out the age from this one.

134
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:28.860
But he was there twice because it was squared so we only have 3 h left plus 3H over age as age approaches

135
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.960
zero.

136
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.780
So check it out.

137
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.630
You always need to cancel out this age at some point doing some sort of factoring.

138
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.350
And that's what we just did.

139
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:48.030
We got the age out of the top so we can cancel it out with the one at the bottom and finally or limit

140
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:58.130
is limit of six x plus 3H as age approaches zero.

141
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.140
Check it out.

142
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:05.520
Now you can actually plug it in and that is going to give you plug in zero for age.

143
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:13.500
So we have six x plus three times zero.

144
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.550
And that gives you six x.

145
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.200
This right here.

146
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.590
Ladies and gentlemen is your derivative function.

147
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:30.260
This function is used to determine the rate of change at several different points in the graph.

148
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:36.260
So what we're going to do now is we're going to take these values and plug them into this function.

149
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.080
So instantaneous rate of change

150
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.970
when X equals to

151
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.770
we're just going to go ahead and plug into into this function.

152
00:12:50.910 --> 00:13:01.850
It's 12 right six times two and since Pena's rate of change at X equals five

153
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:17.330
we take five and we plug it into our derivative function six times five is 30.

154
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:27.570
And finally instantaneous rate of change at X equals 100.

155
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:36.070
We take a hundred and we plug it into our function six times 100 is 600.

156
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.860
And there we go.

157
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.370
We did it.

158
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.100
So we found the instantaneous rate of change for this function at three different x values.

159
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.300
To do that again we use the definition of a derivative.

160
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.040
After that we need to use our function that we're looking for in this formula.

161
00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.000
So we have to plug in the X plus H and then minus the original over age etc..

162
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.630
Then you plug in all of that in.

163
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.840
At some point you factor on the top which is what we did here.

164
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.560
We took out the age and that allows you to actually get rid of the denominator.

165
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.250
So you don't have a zero on the bottom anymore.

166
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.490
That gives you this limit which you can use to find the way and plug it in.

167
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:27.830
We plugged in 0 for H and that gave us our derivative function after we have our derivative function.

168
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:35.120
All we need to do is plug in these x values right here to two five and 100 into our derivative function

169
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:42.220
and that will give us the instantaneous rate of change at each of these points for this function f of

170
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.750
x equals 3 x squared OK.

171
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.550
Just reminding you this definition of a derivative is very important.

172
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.630
Now when we started using rules for derivatives you're not going to have to use this.

173
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.480
We're going to have some shortcuts to find derivatives.

174
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.810
But for now this is the tool that we have and that's the one that you need to learn.

175
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:13.810
And make sure that you know by memory limit of a X plus H minus f of x over h as h approaches zero.

176
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.110
This is said for instantaneous rate of change.

177
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.800
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
