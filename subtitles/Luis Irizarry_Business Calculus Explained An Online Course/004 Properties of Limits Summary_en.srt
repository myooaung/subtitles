1
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,370
OK so just for a quick summary of the properties of limits.

2
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,910
First there are certain properties you can apply to limits which are the ones we just covered next.

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,430
The limit of a constant is equal to the constant regardless of what egg's is approaching.

4
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,060
Remember that for a constant function the y values are always the same.

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,530
So it's always approaching that constant.

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:52,430
So if f of x again equals three then the limit of 3 is always going to be 3.

7
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:59,260
It does not matter what x is approaching conses multiplying functions can be brought outside of limits

8
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,670
multiplying.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:10,900
So remember that for this one if you have something like three well limit of 3 x squared all you do

10
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:18,850
is you bring the three outside multiply the limit and then you get to keep the limit of x squared.

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,420
Only right next limits of two functions doing an operation can be broken down by applying the limit

12
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,700
to each.

13
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:34,990
So remember if you have two functions that are adding or subtracting that are multiplying or that are

14
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,230
dividing then when we put this here.

15
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,910
So its different from subtraction.

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,700
So again if they're adding subtracting multiplying or dividing then you can simply do the limit of the

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,490
first and then you do the operation.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,690
The limit of the Second it's not only with two functions.

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,970
You could even do it with three four five etc..

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,490
So the limit of two functions that are adding is the limit of the first plus the limit of the second

21
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,120
the limit of the functions that are multiplying is the limit of the first times the limit of the second

22
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,970
etc. etc..

23
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,610
And finally the limits of functions with exponents or roots are simplified by putting the limit inside

24
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,460
the exponent or the root.

25
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,020
So this is what we discussed last.

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:34,050
So if you have the limit of x squared you can just do the limit of X and square the whole thing.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,310
And same thing for the roots.

28
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,150
We'll do a couple of examples.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,240
For you to practice so I'll see you in the next 45.
