00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.430
All right.

2
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.470
So let's do some identification of functions that are adding subtracting or both.

3
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.500
So let's get started with this function is 3 x squared plus for X adding subtracting or both.

4
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.730
I'll let you pause a video and get the answer.

5
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.750
All right.

6
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.510
So there should have been a really easy on everything here is positive and there's a plus sign between

7
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.830
them.

8
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:59.820
So these functions three x squared and 4 x are both adding.

9
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.510
All right let's check out another example.

10
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.180
So if f of x equals 5 x to the eleventh minus x.

11
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.650
Are these two functions adding subtracting or both lead should pause and get the answer

12
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.640
All right.

13
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.570
So pretty easy.

14
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.660
There's a negative in between.

15
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.530
So we know that these are actually subtracting

16
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.740
right.

17
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.360
Let's go to the next.

18
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.860
All right so here we have a longer function and it's X to the fourth minus 3 x to the third plus to

19
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.390
X minus 5.

20
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.700
So are these adding or subtracting or both.

21
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.690
I'll let you pause and get the answer.

22
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.090
All right.

23
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.350
I think this was a pretty obvious one as well.

24
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.490
So for example between these two you have a negative so you are subtracting between three x cubed and

25
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.370
2 x you have a positive.

26
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.790
So you're adding these two and then to X minus 5 you're subtracting five from 2 x.

27
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.190
So it's a combination of both adding and subtracting

28
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.400
and to beyond is this combination of both adding and subtracting is a more realistic example of what

29
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.530
you will find in your class.

30
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.440
So a lot of times you'll find that if you get a function f of x it will be composed of functions that

31
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.780
are both adding and subtracting.

32
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.210
All right.

33
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.690
Let's do some problems with the sum and difference rule.
