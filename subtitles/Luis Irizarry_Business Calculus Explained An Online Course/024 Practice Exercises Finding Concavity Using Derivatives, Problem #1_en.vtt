1
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.020
All right.

2
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.840
So let's do a couple of exercises for intervals of concavity and inflection points.

3
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.280
All right.

4
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.330
So it says find the intervals of concavity and inflection points if any for a vaccine cause X to the

5
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.390
fourth minus 8 x cubed.

6
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.280
So I'll let you do your thing.

7
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.500
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

8
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.490
All right so let's go ahead and do it together.

9
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.550
So remember we're finding intervals of concavity and inflection points.

10
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.130
So this is just like finding relative extrema and increasing and decreasing intervals.

11
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.129
We're just going to use the second derivative instead of the first.

12
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.030
So the first step is to go ahead and find the second derivative to find the second derivative.

13
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.800
When he defined the first derivative.

14
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:21.900
So let's go out and find the first one so derivative of x to the fourth or bring down or dictator that's

15
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:32.740
for X that's powerful leaders going to be at three minus then constant multiple is eight times bring

16
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.910
down a dictator which is a three X and less powerful leader is 2.

17
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:54.140
So let's go ahead and simplify that's for X to the third minus eight times threes 24 x squared.

18
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.580
All right.

19
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.850
So that is our first derivative.

20
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.390
Now we need to go to our second derivative.

21
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.870
And by the way if you got confused as to whether we use here the first or the second derivative remember

22
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.640
that we have our mnemonic fir and Seck.

23
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:23.920
So F I R N S E C in this case we have S E C which means Second

24
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.950
remember that e is inflection point so it's spelled wrong on purpose.

25
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.860
Rhymes with reflection.

26
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.720
Reflection has an e.

27
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.010
So inflection also has an E for those mnemonic.

28
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.780
And then we have concavity.

29
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.360
All right.

30
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.980
So we use a second derivative to find inflection points and concavity which is exactly what we're finding

31
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.080
over here.

32
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.110
All right.

33
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.390
So let's go ahead and get this second derivative.

34
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.610
A derivative of 4 x cubed.

35
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.760
We have a constant multiple which is four.

36
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:18.090
We bring down a dictator 3 x a less powerful leader is to minus constant multiple again and we have

37
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:29.200
a 24 so we put it on the side bring down a dictator which is a two and x to the one and let's go ahead

38
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.340
and simplify this so we can get our second derivative.

39
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.350
So 4 times 3 is 12 x squared

40
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.770
minus 24 times 2 is 48 x.

41
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.360
All right.

42
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.430
So here we have our second derivative 12 x squared minus 48 x.

43
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.180
The second thing we're going to do is we're going to find basically the critical points.

44
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.050
But for the second derivative instead of the first remember here we always work with the second derivative

45
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.580
and again to find critical points you need to find the numbers that make the second derivative either

46
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.050
equal to zero or undefined.

47
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.380
In this case the second derivative cannot be undefined because there cannot be any division by zero.

48
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.670
Therefore we just find the numbers that make it equal to zero.

49
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.930
So we set it equal to zero.

50
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.050
12 x squared minus 48 x.

51
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.730
So a second derivative equal to zero.

52
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.720
So a little tip for you whenever you have two axes you probably need to factor.

53
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.000
That's the typical way.

54
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020
If you only have 1 x you can just solve for X right.

55
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.660
You move everything else to the other side and you get X when you have to act just like this.

56
00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.320
Typically again you need to factor sometimes you need to factor when you have one X but it all depends

57
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.500
on the type of problem that you get.

58
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.180
So that's why you have to do a lot of these to make sure that you cover all the cases and you're not

59
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.540
surprised in the middle of a test.

60
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.650
All right so what can we do here.

61
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.090
Well we don't have any difference of squares.

62
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.020
We don't have any trinomial to factor whatever we try to factor as regularly.

63
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.820
Meaning let's take out common terms that 12 x squared and 48 x have.

64
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:37.610
So let's see they have 12 as a factor because this can be divided by 12 and 48 can be divided by 12

65
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.120
as well.

66
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.740
So we take out the 12 and one more thing they have in common is x.

67
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.270
This one has x squared.

68
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.490
And this one has just X..

69
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.040
So the lowest common factor is X..

70
00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:02.100
All right we cannot take for example x squared outside because this one doesn't have X squared but X

71
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.540
itself is contained in both here once and here twice.

72
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:15.770
So we take our 12 X and if we take our 12 x from this one all we have left is X right.

73
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.770
Mine is if we take out 12 x from this one.

74
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.510
So we take away the X and we divide by 12.

75
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.500
We only have four.

76
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.400
Here we go.

77
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.870
Now is so interesting.

78
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.960
Now we have this multiplication 12 x times X minus 4.

79
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.810
And remember that when any of these zero of either.

80
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.160
This one is zero.

81
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.670
Or this one is zero.

82
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.220
Then the whole thing is true.

83
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.230
So our critical numbers are going to be whenever this is zero.

84
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.570
And whenever there's a zero.

85
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.650
So for the first one here one is 12 x equals zero.

86
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.720
What does X need to be.

87
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.950
Obviously the only answer is zero.

88
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.130
Twelve times 0 gives you zero.

89
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.000
There's no other number so that when you multiplied by 12 gives you zero.

90
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.860
All right.

91
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.420
So our first critical number is going to be zero.

92
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.470
And what else.

93
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.140
Let's find out the other one.

94
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.160
One is X minus 4 equal to zero.

95
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.870
Well it's very easy to see but let's do it anyways x minus 4 0.

96
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.050
So we had four on both sides.

97
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.690
Right.

98
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:45.910
We're bring down the x negative four plus four cancels out and zero plus four equals four.

99
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.340
All right so when X equals 4 right here then this is zero.

100
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.980
And that makes sense because for at minus four equals zero.

101
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.840
Right.

102
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.510
So are two critical numbers are 0 and 4.

103
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.930
All right.

104
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.410
These are the critical numbers for the second derivative.

105
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:14.590
Then we go to our third step which is basically testing values and classifying left and right

106
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.570
so we draw our number line.

107
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.340
Remember it goes from lowest to highest.

108
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.060
As you go from left to right.

109
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:34.159
So we have zero which is the first one and then four which is the second one.

110
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.340
These are critical numbers.

111
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.980
So we have to test to the left of zero.

112
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:48.310
We have to test between 0 and 4 and we have to test to the right of 4 so to the left of 0 Let's pick

113
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.500
negative 1 easy number between 0 and 4.

114
00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:01.690
Let's pick one which again is an easy number and a greater than four so to the right of four we'll pick

115
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.250
10 which is also an easy number.

116
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.720
And remember we're plugging these in into the second derivative because we're testing to see the sign

117
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.630
of the second derivative which tells you about the concavity.

118
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:21.870
So plugging in negative 1 into the second derivative.

119
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:27.270
So we can either plug it in here or we can plug it into the factor form.

120
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.640
I think in this case we can just plug it in into this one here might be easier.

121
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.730
All right so let's plug it in right here.

122
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:41.920
We have 12 negative 1 squared.

123
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:52.780
Mine is 48 times negative 1 so negative 1 squared is 1 because negative times a negative equals a positive

124
00:09:53.050 --> 00:10:02.970
times 12 is just 12 and then minus 48 times negative 1 some negative times a negative becomes a positive

125
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.530
positive 48 and 12 plus 48 is 60.

126
00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.660
So we have that to the left of the zero.

127
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:19.320
We have a positive second derivative.

128
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.920
Let's go to our second test value of 1.

129
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.740
This one here between zero and four.

130
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.260
So we have 12 times 1 squared.

131
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:46.640
Minus 48 times 1 so we have one squared is one times 12 is 12 minus 48 times on it's a negative times

132
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.520
a positive is a negative.

133
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:59.100
So if you have $12 and you spend 48 you're 36 in the negative right in the red.

134
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.050
All right.

135
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.020
So this number is negative.

136
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.310
That means that whatever this one is the second derivative is negative.

137
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:17.370
In other words from 0 to 4 the second derivative for this function f of x is negative.

138
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:28.080
And let's go ahead and test our last value our last value is 10 and it's to the right or for.

139
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:37.990
So we plug in San So we have 12 times 10 squared.

140
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.380
Mine is 48 times 10.

141
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:50.480
So we have 10 squared is a hundred times 12 is 1200.

142
00:11:50.680 --> 00:12:01.820
And then we have minus 48 times 10 negative times a positive as a negative and 48 times 10 is for 80.

143
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.120
And this is equal to 720

144
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.130
right.

145
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.690
So we get a positive number for this 10.

146
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:20.380
That means that to the right of this for we have a positive second derivative.

147
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.640
So check it out.

148
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.180
Second derivative is positive up until 0 then from 0 to 4.

149
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.450
It becomes negative.

150
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.800
And then after 4 it becomes positive again.

151
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.360
So that means what.

152
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:41.490
So that means that to the laptop zero the function is concave up because remember positive second derivative

153
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:51.330
concave up then between 0 and four it's concave down because it's negative and from for on it's concave

154
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.250
up again because it's positive.

155
00:12:53.430 --> 00:13:00.570
Not only that but it looks like we have two inflection points one 0 and 1 and 4 and we know that because

156
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.860
remember an inflection point is where the concavity changes.

157
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.900
So it's zero.

158
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.420
It goes from concave up.

159
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.250
And when you get to zero concave down.

160
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.070
So concavity changed right here.

161
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.720
Not only that but at four it was concave down.

162
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.800
And when you get to 4 it becomes concave up.

163
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.370
All right so let's summarize all of this here.

164
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:32.160
We have that from negative infinity to zero.

165
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:45.680
So basically to the left of 0 and up to zero we have concave up.

166
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:53.460
And then what happens from 0 4 it becomes concave down because the sign of the second derivative is

167
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.690
negative.

168
00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:06.300
So from 0 to 4 this is concave down.

169
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.400
And then finally we have this for right here.

170
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:17.770
So from for on so for numbers greater than four it is concave up again because the sign is positive.

171
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:29.200
So from for up to positive infinity it is concave up.

172
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.070
All right.

173
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.360
So this is the first part of her answer.

174
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.810
These are the intervals of concavity.

175
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:45.100
The last thing that we need to do is remember who wants inflection points which is no where they happen

176
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.400
at X equals zero.

177
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:53.260
And it actually calls for but to get the actual points we need to find out what the y values for these

178
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.050
points are to do that.

179
00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:02.830
Remember that we plug it into the original because we want the actual y value of the actual inflection

180
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.960
points.

181
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.040
We're now using the first derivative because we're not even touching it here.

182
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.690
And the second derivative.

183
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:15.700
Again if you plug them in they're going to give you a zero which in and of itself it's not like you

184
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.680
couldn't have an inflection points with a y of 0.

185
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.700
But that's not what we're doing.

186
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.220
Remember second derivative measures concavity.

187
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.880
What we're trying to find is just a Y value of a point.

188
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.050
So let's go ahead and plug 0 and 4 into the original.

189
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.640
So I'll do it right here.

190
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:49.950
So let me separate this f of 0 in the original is 0 to the four.

191
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:56.700
Mine is 8 0 to 3 right.

192
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.660
We're just plugging it in right here.

193
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:11.000
Surprisingly that gives 0 to the 4 0 mine is 0 2 3 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 0.

194
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.100
All right.

195
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.680
That is the first one.

196
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:21.630
And for the second one we're plug in and for so we have four to the four.

197
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:28.350
Mine is 8 times 4 to the three.

198
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.410
If you plug that into a calculator that will give you 256.

199
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:39.300
That's four to the fourth minus 512 which is for the third time.

200
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.700
Eights

201
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.240
which gives you negative to 56.

202
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.810
I'm running out of space here but hopefully you can see it.

203
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.980
That means that our inflection points are located here.

204
00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:02.650
First one is that 0 0 right x value of zero y value of 0.

205
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:18.410
So inflection points at 0 0 and the second one is located at four which is the x value negative 256

206
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.050
which is the y value.

207
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:27.089
So hard for Khama negative to 56.

208
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.480
This is the second part of our answer.

209
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.810
Right.

210
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.420
Little bit tight there but we got it.

211
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.730
All right.

212
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.000
So this is it.

213
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.440
I know you must be looking at this and saying wow that was a big one.

214
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.690
It was so.

215
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.920
Just to quickly summarize for those of concavity and inflection points for this function.

216
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.850
First thing we do is we find the first derivative and then we get the second derivative.

217
00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.440
Remember that concavity and inflection points are done with the second.

218
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.340
Then we find the critical numbers for this second derivative.

219
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:12.510
So numbers that make it equal to zero or undefined in this case there is no bottom so no undefined.

220
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.370
We just set it equal to zero.

221
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.200
For that we had to factor out the common terms between 12 x squared and 48 x.

222
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.570
And this gave us this multiplication.

223
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:30.110
So we found the numbers that made this equal to zero or this equal to zero to make the whole thing equal

224
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.370
to zero.

225
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.560
These numbers were 0 and 4.

226
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.110
So we draw a number line put 0 on 4.

227
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.200
Remember it's from lowest to highest as you go from left to right.

228
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:50.180
And then we pick values to the left of 0 between 0 and 4 and to the right of 4 we went ahead and plugged

229
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.240
these values.

230
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:57.040
Negative 1 1 and 10 into the second derivative and we got the sides of the answers.

231
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:06.620
It was positive negative positive so positive negative positive and based on this we know that the function

232
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:15.020
is concave up from negative infinity to zero because the sign is positive and it is also concave up

233
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.900
from four up to positive infinity because to the right of four is positive.

234
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.490
This is our third interval right here.

235
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.740
And finally it is concave down between 0 and 4 because a sign is negative.

236
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:37.160
Finally we wanted to get the inflection points and we know there are inflection points because concavity

237
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:46.780
changes from up to down at zero base and the signs and from down to up at four based on these signs.

238
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:54.470
So we go ahead and grab the 0 and we grab the four and we plug them into the original to get the Y values

239
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.350
of those inflection points.
