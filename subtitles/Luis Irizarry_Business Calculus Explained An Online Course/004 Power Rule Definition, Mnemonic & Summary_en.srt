00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,320
Hey guys what's going on.

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,530
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:31,560
Today we're going to talk about the most important derivative rule.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,000
This is essential.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,420
It is critical.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,280
And the good news is that it's very easy to do and you'll be doing it a lot.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,270
And that's the power rule.

8
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,030
So the power rule is very important because when you're doing other types of derivatives you're going

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,520
to have to incorporate the power rule in order to do those derivatives.

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,470
So you're basically going to see the power rule from now until the moment you finish the course.

11
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,190
It is absolutely everywhere.

12
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:08,020
You will use the power rule in the vast majority of problems you will encounter in business calculus.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,920
So the power rule is used to find derivatives of power functions.

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,670
So let's quickly cover what a power function is.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,610
And I'll give you some examples as well.

16
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,520
Power functions.

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:41,280
All right so power functions have the form f of x equals x.

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,800
And.

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,850
OK.

20
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,040
And here is a number

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,690
I'm sure that looks pretty familiar right.

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:05,950
I mean we have a common power of functions which for example we have quadratic functions which look

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,710
like X to the two or x squared that is a part of function.

24
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:18,800
In this case the end is equal to to remember and it's just the exponent of the power function.

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,840
So X to the two and equals two.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,410
Then we have a quadratic function

27
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,150
x to the three and equals three.

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,910
And you can pretty much plug in whatever you want.

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,070
X to the 20th power you can do that too.

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,410
In fact you could even plug in negative numbers.

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,520
X to the negative 3.

32
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,260
Well what is x the negative 3.

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,700
How do you calculate that.

34
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:04,230
Well there's a really handy rule which tells you how to deal with negative exponents and the rule says

35
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:19,330
this If you have x negative and that is equal to 1 over X the.

36
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,300
So what this does is it takes this whole expression X to the negative and it brings it to the bottom

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,280
and it makes the end positive.

38
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,270
OK.

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:43,300
So again x to the negative n is equal to 1 over x to the N so using this rule we can convert this expression

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,840
into f of x.

41
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:58,710
And again what we do is we grab this we say one over this same thing but we change the negative three

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:08,870
to a positive three x to the negative three is equal to 1 over X or 3.

43
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,780
This is of course again a power function as well.

44
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,839
Finally you can even plug in decimals.

45
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,790
In fact let's plug in a decimal.

46
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,980
But let's do it in the form of a fraction.

47
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,660
So let's say X to the two thirds.

48
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,060
Well this is a rule number one.

49
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,170
And now we're going to go over a rule number to fruit and we're dealing with fractional exponents.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:56,450
So if we have for example x to the Am over and right so x to the fraction and over end well.

51
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,620
Or are we going to do is we're going to keep the x to the M stays the same

52
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,680
and we're going to take the roots

53
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:18,150
and the actual route that we're gonna take is the nth root.

54
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,660
This goes like that again to repeat quickly we're going to keep the x to the M which we keep inside

55
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,950
and then we're going to get the nth root of this.

56
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,200
So let's apply that here.

57
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,880
And again this is our second important rule

58
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,610
let's apply this rule down here.

59
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,110
So we have a x equals.

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:57,310
So if we have X to the two thirds Well our rule says to keep the x to the numerator or the number top.

61
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,070
So we keep the XT to the two and we do the nth root.

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,710
So we do the roots.

63
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,280
It's going to be the denominator or the number on the bottom.

64
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:19,880
So we apply roots and this is going to be the cube root.

65
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,340
All right.

66
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,020
So why is it important to know these two rules.

67
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:30,010
Well it turns out that sometimes you're given a problem with a power function.

68
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,710
You need to convert it into this form X to the end or X to the M over and.

69
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,420
OK.

70
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,850
So first you need to convert you apply the power rule and then you switch it back to its last form which

71
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,620
would be the final form here.

72
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:56,760
One over x to the end or X to the YEM taken at the nth root.

73
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,160
These are examples of power functions.

74
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,940
Again issues X to the end where n is a number it could be an integer like two or three or 20.

75
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:13,040
It could be a negative number like negative 3 or it could be a fraction like two thirds etc..

76
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,180
All right how do we find derivatives of power functions.

77
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,800
Well for that we use the power rule.

78
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,110
And how do we apply the power rule.

79
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,970
Well let's first go into the definition of the power rule the power rule says that to find the derivative

80
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:40,950
of a power function you bring down the exponent multiplying and then you subtract one from the exponent.

81
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,580
I'll repeat that again to find the derivative of a power function.

82
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,080
You bring down the exponent multiplying and subtract one from the exponent.

83
00:07:50,730 --> 00:08:00,120
So we know that power functions have this form of X equals x to the right.

84
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,950
So this says the derivative is bring down the exponent multiplying.

85
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,320
So we take this n right here.

86
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,060
That's the exponent.

87
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,740
Let's just write it down.

88
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:22,000
The derivative is equal to take this and and you bring it down multiplying the whole thing.

89
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:33,669
So a derivative is and times we keep the X and we subtract 1 from the exponent.

90
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,940
So for this and that was here we actually brought down.

91
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,250
We're going to put instead and minus one.

92
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,890
That is the power all again.

93
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,740
Well we just did was we have a function x to the n power function.

94
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,730
We want to find its derivative.

95
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,890
So the first thing we do is we bring down the n over here multiplying this is this.

96
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:06,370
And we keep the X and then we subtract one from the exponent.

97
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,380
For example

98
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,580
if X

99
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,890
equals x 3.

100
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,030
What is prime of x.

101
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:29,090
So let's find its derivative Well it's a power function because it's in the form X to the n the power

102
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,670
rule says grab this three.

103
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:46,630
So take the exponent and bring it down multiplying keep the X and subtract one from the exponent 3 minus

104
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,350
1.

105
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,190
So let's simplify.

106
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,780
We have 3 x three minus one is just to.

107
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,790
So we put it to a year and we are done.

108
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:14,810
We just applied the power rule to the function x to the three to another example.

109
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,420
What if we have the function x 10 was fine as derivative

110
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,020
again.

111
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,810
The power rule says we take this xponent we bring it down multiplying.

112
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,400
We keep the X and we subtract one from the exponent.

113
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:46,470
So that would be 10 minus one 10 x to the 9.

114
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,590
Believe it or not we are done.

115
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,840
See the power rule is very very easy once you start doing it over and over it's going to come like second

116
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,540
nature to you.

117
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,720
Now there's an easier way to remember the powerful.

118
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:13,930
And of course we're going to go into its mnemonic.

119
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,580
All right.

120
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,600
So now we have our mnemonic for the power room.

121
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,800
And it says dictator in power gets taken down and it's substituted by a less powerful leader.

122
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,550
You might be thinking well what the heck does this have to do with the powerful.

123
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,180
Well once you get it it's going to make a lot of sense.

124
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,840
OK.

125
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,080
So let's say that there's a country the world has a really powerful dictator.

126
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,230
All right.

127
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm not talking about Sacha Baron Cohen and the dictator the movie I'm talking about like a real dictator

128
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,150
real evil guy who wants to take over the world.

129
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,860
I mean it's a problem it's a huge problem.

130
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,440
OK.

131
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,870
Typically happens to dictators in power.

132
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,380
I mean usually at some point they get either taken down or they get killed.

133
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,490
All right.

134
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,120
The point is they go away.

135
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,080
So that is actually the first part of our non-monic a dictator in power usually gets taken down.

136
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:22,020
And again the key to remember here is that dictators are in power right just like the power rule.

137
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,890
OK.

138
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,260
So dictator in power usually gets taken down.

139
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,090
That would be the first step.

140
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,960
Of the power rule so let's say you have a power function x to the end.

141
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,300
Let's say that n represents your dictator.

142
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,880
Right.

143
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,300
So we want to find the derivative.

144
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,960
So dictator in power gets taken down.

145
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,950
This is the equivalent of this and coming down here

146
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,820
so dictator is taken down.

147
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,430
That's when the end comes down multiplying.

148
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,550
And the second part is when a dictator is taken down what happens.

149
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Well usually there's another person that comes in and gets into power.

150
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,990
Now this person is usually not as powerful as a dictator.

151
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,490
Right.

152
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,000
Because the dictator had you know all the connections that all the money the respect the person are

153
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,950
going to be a leader but they're not going to be as powerful.

154
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:36,170
So usually what happens again is that a dictator is substituted by a less powerful leader.

155
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,520
Well this is exactly what we're going to do in our power rule.

156
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,150
Remember we keep Vieques.

157
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,770
And then instead of having just an We're going to have an minus one.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,520
This represents the less powerful leader.

159
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
So it's not the same as the dictator.

160
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,600
That person is now a leader but it doesn't have maybe the same respect the same army the same power.

161
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,240
OK.

162
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,720
So that's why we subtract one from it.

163
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,270
And that's pretty much it for the mnemonic let's apply it in a couple of problems.

164
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,800
OK.

165
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:27,080
So f of x equals x to the fourth power well power rule dictator in power.

166
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,300
So a grubbier dictator which is for we bring it down.

167
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,170
We keep Vieques and we substituted by a less powerful leader.

168
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,000
So it's going to be four minus one

169
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,010
we simplify for X and for minus one is just three.

170
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,770
There we go.

171
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:54,260
We just use the mnemonic to actually do a power function problem let's try doing another one

172
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,520
X one 100

173
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,900
Well again power function dictator in power OK.

174
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,990
So we grabbed a dictator which is the one hundred.

175
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,320
We bring it down and we substituted by a less powerful dictator.

176
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,670
Again we already know it's a hundred minus one.

177
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,440
So we can just plug it in directly.

178
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,620
It's going to be 99

179
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,310
to another problem here.

180
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:39,510
Let's say we have access to the negative 3.

181
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,080
So remember how we talked about that rule for negative exponents.

182
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,040
Let's apply it here

183
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,330
again.

184
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,320
Power rule the dictator in power.

185
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:04,400
First thing we need to do is bring our dictator down which is negative 3 and we multiply it by same

186
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,330
x.

187
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,010
And now what do we need to do.

188
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,000
Remember we subtract 1 from our exponent right.

189
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,300
We're substituting by a less powerful leader.

190
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,710
What is negative three minus 1.

191
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:26,770
Well if you owe three dollars and then you borrow one more dollar that means you owe now four dollars

192
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,800
right.

193
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:37,110
So negative three minus one is equal to negative four.

194
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,710
So let's just simplify we crabber negative three from the beginning which is our dictator that we brought

195
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,020
down keep the.

196
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:51,390
And again negative 3 minus 1 is just negative for go.

197
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,230
That is our final answer.

198
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:01,060
And by the way for this same problem so let's say you were given the problem like this.

199
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,089
Find the derivative of one over x to the three.

200
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,990
Well if it's in this form we can't really get it.

201
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,369
We can't really get the derivative right there right.

202
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,800
It's not in the ax to the end form.

203
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:24,849
So what we need to do is we apply the rule to bring up an exponent that's down here.

204
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,210
And again I'll write it again just so you have it.

205
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:39,430
We had said that X to the negative and equals 1 over x to the end

206
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:45,920
OK.

207
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:53,450
So we're going to go from this form to this form.

208
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,100
Right.

209
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,670
So we have one over X to that three.

210
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,680
This would be the one over x to the end and to bring it up.

211
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,230
We just bring the same thing but we change the exponent to a negative.

212
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:15,300
So 1 over X to that 3 becomes X to the negative three again.

213
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,930
All we did was take this and bring it up with a negative exponent.

214
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,140
And then from here you can just apply the power rule.

215
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,860
OK.

216
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:34,790
Which is what we did exactly here that is it again every time you get a power function.

217
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,020
I want you to think dictator in power what happens to dictators in power.

218
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,550
Well number one they get taken down.

219
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,180
And number two they get substituted by a less powerful leader in the same way in the power rule.

220
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,510
We bring down the xponent and we keep the ax and we subtract one from the xponent.

221
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,110
All right.

222
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,810
OK so now just to finish up with a summary of what we just covered.

223
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,410
First of all we know that power functions have the form X to the end.

224
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,720
So that's X to the nth power and it could be an integer.

225
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,160
It could be a negative number.

226
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,120
It could be a fraction etc. etc..

227
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,100
Power functions with negative or fractional exponents need some extra work.

228
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,860
All right so the power rule is used to find the derivatives of power functions.

229
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,880
Again where we just covered what a power function is X to the end to apply the power rule used the mnemonic

230
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:39,410
of the dictator as is one of my favorite mnemonics that mnemonic says dictators in power get taken down

231
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,870
and they're replaced by less powerful leaders.

232
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,750
And that's pretty much it.

233
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,800
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
