1
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,370
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,720
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,320
Today we're going to cover the counterpart to the product.

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,230
And it is called the quotient.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,550
BILL

6
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,500
So it's called the quotient rule.

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,470
And I have a little bit of a weird sound to you.

8
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,190
The word quotient the word quotient just means the results of dividing two things.

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,930
So remember how product is a result of multiplication of two things quotient is the same but for division.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,420
So I'll put that here on the side the quotient

11
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,700
is the results

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,060
of division.

13
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,210
And so just looking at the product rule we're trying to find the derivative of a product of functions.

14
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,540
Here we're trying to find the derivative of a division of functions.

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:38,980
So you're going to have something that looks like this half of X equals Giovanni X first function over

16
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,610
h of x.

17
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:50,090
So we have x is equal to the division of g of X by h of x.

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,780
And how do we know they're dividing.

19
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,210
Well it's actually there's no question about it.

20
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,870
OK.

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,970
It's the dividing line right here.

22
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,050
This is how you know that they are dividing.

23
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,640
So if there is a dividing line like this there's a division.

24
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,770
This means

25
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,700
there's a division.

26
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,220
That is how you know they need to use the quotient rule just to give you an example of a dividing function.

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:49,350
It of looks something like this 3 x squared is 5 x over 3 x OK.

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:58,270
So f of x is equal to 3 x squared plus 5 x 3 x plus 5 x is called the numerator right.

29
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,460
Remember fractions in a fraction you have a top part and a bottom part right.

30
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,270
A B and the top part is called the numerator

31
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,170
or the top and the bottom part is called the denominator

32
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,670
which is the bottom

33
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,170
OK.

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,840
So for simplification purposes I'm going to refer to the numerator as the top and the two that denominator

35
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,280
as the bottom.

36
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,480
All right.

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:49,040
So in this case our top is going to be 3 x squared plus 5 x that is our top function and our bottom

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,190
function is going to be 3 x.

39
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,490
So the question is how do we get the derivative of f of x which is composed of two functions that are

40
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,840
dividing for the quotient rule comes in.

41
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,820
OK so here we have the definition of the quotient rule.

42
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,170
If you read this you're going to be like What the heck is going on here.

43
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,970
Why is it so long.

44
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,100
Etc. etc..

45
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,149
Let me just tell you right now that the definition of the quotient rule is probably the longest in all

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,700
of this is calculus.

47
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,480
So bear with me you know we'll go over it step by step.

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,770
We'll go over some examples.

49
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,350
We have some practice problems in another video for you to take a look at and hey you're going to get

50
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,580
it.

51
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,230
OK.

52
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,110
So remember it's all about practice.

53
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,570
You know the first time I go through a problem you might not know what's going on in that case.

54
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,760
Just go ahead and rewind it and try taking a look again.

55
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,350
If it still doesn't make sense we'll keep going and then come back to it tomorrow for example.

56
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,380
Also go through the practice problems.

57
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,960
OK.

58
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,650
So everything is practice until it's easy.

59
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,760
So let's go over the quotient rule.

60
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,010
But right before let's go over the product rule because they are similar.

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,210
It's just the cushion or was something different.

62
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,880
And then it has an extra step but it's very similar to the product.

63
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,880
So when the product rule

64
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,960
we have two functions that are multiplying right.

65
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:27,030
I'll do it here on the side.

66
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:34,830
So we have the product rule for example if we want to do derivative of f of x and f x is a multiplication

67
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,570
of two functions.

68
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,310
So if we want to get the derivative

69
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,470
remember that what we need to do and I'm not going to use the mnemonic here because we're not doing

70
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,700
the mnemonics for the quotient rule.

71
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,250
I'm just going to go over the regular definition which is get the derivative of the first times the

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:07,440
second plus the first time the derivative of the second.

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,280
Right.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,690
That is what we do.

75
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,000
For the product rule.

76
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,450
So now let's go over the definition of the quotient rule and see how similar they are.

77
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:25,380
So the derivative of a quotient and remember a quotient is just that division is equal to the derivative

78
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,430
of the top function.

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:38,690
That means the numerator times the bottom function minus the top function times the derivative of the

80
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,790
bottom function.

81
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,650
Everything over Bodum squared.

82
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,070
All right.

83
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,530
I know that was a mouthful.

84
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,730
Let's go over it step by step.

85
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:59,530
So we have fallbacks it is equal to the division of g of x and h of X..

86
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,500
When I get the derivative of f of x.

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,850
All right.

88
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,740
How do we do this.

89
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,290
Well again let's go over the rule derivative of a quotient is equal to the derivative of the top.

90
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,780
So this is the top function of x.

91
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,460
So we'll just say G prime of x.

92
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,090
All right.

93
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,940
So we have derivative of top times the bottom function bottom function is h of X

94
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
and then we have minus

95
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,790
the top which again the top is g of X

96
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,650
times the derivative of bottom the bottom is h of x

97
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,410
and so everything over bottom squared.

98
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,270
So we're going to get.

99
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,280
And we're going to divide this full result that we have here.

100
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,450
Over the bottom squared.

101
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
So the bottom is h of X right.

102
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,940
We're just going to square Age of X boom.

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,150
There you have it.

104
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,430
That is your quotient rule.

105
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,920
And I know it looks very messy looks really big.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,490
You're wondering what the heck is happening here.

107
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,750
Well that's why I wanted to go over the prog rule first because I want you to see the difference and

108
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,570
the similarities between the two.

109
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:41,210
So in the product rule we have derivative of first times the second well in the quotient rule.

110
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,340
We have the derivative of top times the bottom.

111
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,860
So see how it's similar.

112
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,780
Instead of being first and second we have top and bottom.

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,910
So this would be like the first g of x and h of x would be the second.

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,010
So again pro-tobacco derivative of first time second here and the quotient derivative of top times the

115
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:14,120
second and then then the actual difference between these two rules one of the two differences is that

116
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,140
the product rule we use a plus and in the quotient rule we use a minus.

117
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,970
So after you get the derivative of the top times the bottom you have the same minus instead of plus

118
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,580
then the second part if we go back to the product rule we have the first time the derivative of the

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,890
second.

120
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,730
Here we have pretty much the same thing.

121
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,530
The top time the derivative of the bottom.

122
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,580
So this top part of the quotient is pretty much like the product rule.

123
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:55,690
The only difference is that instead of plus we use a minus We have derivative of top Times bottom minus

124
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,190
top Times derivative of bottom.

125
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,840
OK.

126
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,540
And then the only other difference and this is actually a very easy to remember is that you're going

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,140
to divide this whole thing.

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,950
So this whole numerator this whole top over the bottom function squared the bottom function is h of

129
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,360
X right.

130
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,620
So we're just going to divide everything by h of x to the second power.

131
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,880
So the main two differences

132
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,480
between

133
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,030
the sorry the product rule

134
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,800
versus the quotient rule

135
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:57,960
number one is we use a minus instead of a plus.

136
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:19,890
And the second one is you need to divide everything by the bottom squared.

137
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,200
If you look for a textbook they're going to go into this hole probably like proof of why this works

138
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
where this came from.

139
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,130
That is interesting to nerds like me.

140
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,880
But you do not have to know this typically for a business calculus.

141
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,750
All you need to know is what the rule is and how to apply it.

142
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,100
You do not need to know like where I came from.

143
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,830
All right.

144
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:45,510
So because this is so messy what we're going to do is we're going to go into our favorite mnemonic and

145
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,460
figure out a way of actually remembering this whole big beautiful mess.

146
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,060
All right.

147
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,170
So let's go into our mnemonic

148
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,400
right.

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,120
So here we have our mnemonic for the quotient rule.

150
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,290
This is very interesting.

151
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,640
It's one of my favorite mnemonics as well.

152
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,590
I feel that it is very easy to remember also very funny.

153
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:18,100
It says the quotient rule is like the product rule minus the B S and that's literally minus the abs.

154
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,340
We'll see why in a second.

155
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,690
So to remember this is just think about how the product rule on the quotient rule.

156
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,800
They kind of go together because they're opposites.

157
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,150
So you know like you have multiplication and division are opposites right.

158
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,420
And then for multiplication functions you have the product rule

159
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,560
and then for dividing functions you have the quotient rule

160
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,360
OK.

161
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,570
So again multiplication and division are opposites.

162
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,910
So product and quotient they kind of go together because they're opposites as well.

163
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:20,060
And we know that for the product rule we use the mnemonic pro just like we learned in the last session.

164
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,350
So for the product we'll use Pro for the quotient rule.

165
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,870
Again it's kind of like the product minus the B.S. And let's see what we mean by that.

166
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:37,760
For example let's say we have a function that's composed of two functions that are multiplying.

167
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,130
Right.

168
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,880
So we need to use the product rule.

169
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,050
And again I know we just went over this how the product rule in the quotient rule are similar in the

170
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,650
last section but let's just go over that again so that we can see a live example of that a Monnick working.

171
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:04,010
So the derivative of f of x for two functions that are multiplying is remember mnemonic prope.

172
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,150
So we have placed repeats.

173
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:20,790
So we're going to do g of x x and again repeated g of x h of X and we separate them by a plus sign.

174
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,370
All right.

175
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,900
That is the mnemonic for the product rule.

176
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:31,820
So what happens if we have a division.

177
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:42,390
So we have half a VAX equals G of X over each of x.

178
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:48,900
Ok so let's find the derivative of f of x so let's go to our mnemonic.

179
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,780
It says it's like the Perata rule minus the b s.

180
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:59,880
So we're still going to use Parow the mnemonic for the product rule and that says to place repeats.

181
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,670
Now the only difference here is that instead of having the first function and the second function we

182
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,630
have the top function and the bottom function.

183
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:18,040
But like we said before the top function would be one and the bottom function would be to.

184
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,980
So again place repeats.

185
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,800
We're going to have

186
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:33,310
g of X age of x g of x h of X.

187
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,750
Right.

188
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,280
So for the same thing as the product rule.

189
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
OK.

190
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,540
Now we did the first part of the protocol.

191
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,910
The place repeats.

192
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,280
Now let's do the outer remember the outer is just to the derivative of the outer functions.

193
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,300
So the derivative of this one and the derivative of this one.

194
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,440
All right first function and last function perfect.

195
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,270
So we did the product rule we did or non-monic pro players repeats and then our derivatives.

196
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,270
What's next.

197
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,920
Well what's next is the minors the B-S.

198
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:16,320
So remember the probe rule where you would do is you you would put a plus sign in between these two

199
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,620
repeats.

200
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:25,020
However in the quotient rule because we're doing minors the B-S this part over here we're actually going

201
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,520
to say Maia's OK.

202
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,580
And that is the minus here.

203
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:39,620
Instead of doing a plus like we do in the product rule we actually do a minus and we have the biggest

204
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,650
part remaining.

205
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,370
What's that.

206
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:49,200
Well remember that in the quotient rule you need to divide by the bottom function squared.

207
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,910
Bottom function squared is the B-S.

208
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,160
All right so first we say minus because the minus device repeats.

209
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:05,040
And then we do everything over the B.S. which is the bottom squared.

210
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,609
All right.

211
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,890
Let me put that here.

212
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,670
Baez is not the typical meaning is going to be bottom squared

213
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,970
perfect.

214
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,329
So we just put our bottoms squared here.

215
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,750
Remember the bottom function is h of x.

216
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,830
So we're going to have h of x to the second power.

217
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,880
There you go.

218
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,320
There you have your quotient rule which was very easy to do because number one it was based on the product

219
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,670
rule.

220
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,340
The first part and then number two we have this really easy to remember mnemonic which says minus the

221
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,400
B-S.

222
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,420
And again what is the minus that B-S mean.

223
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,530
It means number one that instead of putting a plus in between the repeats you're going to put this minus

224
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,940
and then you're going to say B S which is bottom squared.

225
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,620
So you are going to divide this whole top part by B-S which is the bottom function squared.

226
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,500
Remember the bottom function originally is h of X.

227
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,000
We're just going to do h of x to the second power.

228
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,870
That's what squared means.

229
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,450
All right.

230
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,000
Up next we're going to do a quick example of the mnemonic for the quotient rule.

231
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,450
We're actually going to see it in action.

232
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,570
We're going to play it.

233
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:38,550
And after that we'll do a couple of problems get you settled then you'll know this in no time.

234
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,090
All right.

235
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,840
So let's go to our problem.
