00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.410
All right.

2
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's do a couple of problems for finding the entrails of increase and decrease of different functions.

3
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.480
Let's start with this one find the intervals of increase and decrease for f of x equals x cubed over

4
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.040
three plus five x squared over two plus 6 x plus three.

5
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.390
So Elettra pause a video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.400
All right.

7
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.410
So let's see how you did.

8
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.690
So remember that to find the intervals of increase and decrease we're going to use the first derivative.

9
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:08.890
Step Number 1 is finding the derivative of f of x so prime of X let's see what that is.

10
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.450
So as you can see we have a sum of different functions.

11
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.100
So what we're going to do is we're going to use some rule and we are going to take the derivative of

12
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.780
each individual term.

13
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.570
So each function and we're going to add them together.

14
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.280
So let's start over here.

15
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.180
So for this first function we have a constant multiple That's one third right because it's dividing

16
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.240
by three.

17
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:42.700
We bring down our dictators so that's three X and less powerful leader becomes a two then plus.

18
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.340
And here we have a nother constant multiple That's five over two five over two.

19
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.170
And then we bring down a dictator times to X and less powerful leader becomes a one on top.

20
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.210
So we don't market plus 6 x so constant multiple is six.

21
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.150
And remember the derivative of X is just one.

22
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.110
We've done this a couple of times and I repeat it because again it's a source of confusion for a lot

23
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.300
of people.

24
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.880
The dictator here for the axe is one we bring it down.

25
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.450
So that is a 1 and then X

26
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:38.440
and since the exponent was a 1 when we substitute by a less powerful leader it becomes a zero x to zero

27
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.150
which again is one number this is one.

28
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.520
All right.

29
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.080
So let's go ahead and simplify.

30
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.240
So check it out.

31
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.940
We have 8 3 on top and 3 on the bottom.

32
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.950
So these two cancel out.

33
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.680
We have a two on top and a two on the bottom.

34
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.980
So these two cancel out.

35
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.560
And remember this is six times one times one.

36
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.190
So this is just six.

37
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:11.180
So we end up having X squared plus 5 x plus 6.

38
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.040
This is our derivative.

39
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.570
All right.

40
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.370
So for the first step we just found our derivative.

41
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.790
Let's go to our second step.

42
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.880
We need to find the critical numbers for this derivative.

43
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.940
So the numbers that make it equal to zero or the numbers that make it undefined.

44
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.840
And again this derivatives does not have a bottom so it cannot be defined for that reason.

45
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.820
We're only going to find the numbers that make it equal to zero.

46
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.100
By the way in the next example we'll do one where he does have a bottom.

47
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.820
So we'll have that one as well.

48
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.440
All right.

49
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.730
But for now let's just set it equal to zero squared plus 5 x plus 6 equal to zero.

50
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.040
And how do we know which numbers make this equal to zero.

51
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.130
So remember when you have something like this you always try to factor it one way or another and in

52
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.790
this case we are factoring trinomial.

53
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.820
So we have to factor trinomial.

54
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.880
And how do we do that.

55
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.670
Well which is bring down x here and we bring down x here.

56
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.150
So the sign of this one is a sign of this one that's positive and the sign of this one is the multiplication

57
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.660
of these two positive terms positive is also positive.

58
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:41.540
And remember that we need to get two numbers that multiplied give us six and added Give us five.

59
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.080
Obviously that is three and two right.

60
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.980
Three times two equals six ense three plus two equals five.

61
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.270
If you've never seen this type of factoring before there will be a youtube link to factoring videos

62
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.670
so you can check those out.

63
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.580
Remember this is just algebra.

64
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.590
All right.

65
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.070
So we factored our function.

66
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.340
And remember this is equal to zero.

67
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.170
So what is this whole thing equal to zero.

68
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400
Well you're multiplying two things right.

69
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.220
You're multiplying X plus three and you're multiplying X plus two.

70
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.470
So remember that anything times zero equals zero.

71
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.720
So if either this one is zero or this one is zero then the whole thing will be zero.

72
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.120
So we need to figure out when this one is zero.

73
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.900
And when this one is zero.

74
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.440
And remember the way we do that is I'll put it over here.

75
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.240
We said the first term equals zero.

76
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.770
So X plus three equals zero and we solve for x.

77
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.420
So we have to move this three to the other side so we can have x by itself.

78
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.220
So we do minus three and minus three and both sides.

79
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.830
Cancels out and X equals negative 3.

80
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.740
All right.

81
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.000
So this guy is 0 when X equals negative 3.

82
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.490
Let's see what this guy is all about.

83
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.340
So now let's set this one to zero x plus two equals zero.

84
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.140
And again we subtract two from both sides to leave the x by itself.

85
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.730
Two minus two cancels out and we have X equals negative two.

86
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.070
All right so we have a zero at negative 3 and that makes sense because if you plug in negative three

87
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:44.080
here it's negative three plus three that give you 0 0 multiplied by whatever this gives you equal zero.

88
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.610
And the same way.

89
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.760
This is zero when X equals negative to negative two plus two equals zero.

90
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.310
So zero times whatever you get here equals zero.

91
00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:04.610
So our critical numbers are negative 3 and negative 2.

92
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.190
All right.

93
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:11.670
And as a last type we'll go ahead and we'll classify with our number line.

94
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.550
So remember that to do this we draw our number line over here.

95
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.470
And we put the negative 3.

96
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.260
So remember it is from smallest to largest.

97
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.780
So as you go from left to right you are increasing.

98
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:35.700
So the smaller number in this case negative 3 has to be on the left and the bigger number needs to be

99
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:43.650
on the right which is negative to remember that negative 2 is greater than negative 3 because the more

100
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.530
negative you get the smaller quote unquote the number is right.

101
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.790
So if we had had for example 5 and 10 we would put five here and then 10 here because again as you move

102
00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:04.700
from left to right you're increasing and now what we need to do is we need to test values to the left

103
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.190
of the negative three between the negative 3 and the negative 2.

104
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.740
So over here and to the right of this negative to.

105
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.300
So let's pick easy numbers.

106
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.500
So our test value for the left of negative 3 let's make it negative 10.

107
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.120
And again if you picked different numbers it doesn't matter as long as you get the same answer.

108
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.900
So for example if instead of negative 10 you picked negative five it'll give you the same answer.

109
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:39.909
If you do it correctly but I always like to pick easy numbers because that makes it a lot easier.

110
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:48.810
All right and between negative 3 and negative 2 we'll go ahead and pick negative 2.5.

111
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.180
Unfortunately it has to be a decimal because there are no whole numbers between negative 3 and negative

112
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.300
2.

113
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:04.580
And finally to the right of two I'm going to pick 0 0 is usually a good choice because it cancels out

114
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.260
a lot of things.

115
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:12.740
All right so we have three test values that we need to test.

116
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.180
Let's go ahead and take these test values and plug them into the derivative.

117
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.480
So first let's go ahead and plug in negative 10

118
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.970
into the first derivative.

119
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.590
Remember you do not plug this into the original because that would just give you a y value.

120
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:41.090
And the graph of this function what we're looking for is intervals of increase and decrease.

121
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.000
And that's given by the sign of the first derivative.

122
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.180
So plug it in negative 10.

123
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:54.320
You could either plug it in into this one or you could plug it in into the factored form.

124
00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.950
I think in this case the fact reform is probably easier but if you did it with this one here that's

125
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.900
ok too.

126
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.420
It doesn't matter.

127
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.140
So let's go ahead and try this.

128
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:18.270
So we have negative 10 plus 3 that's negative 7 times negative 10 plus 2 that's negative 8

129
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:29.130
so negative times a negative remember is a positive and seven times 8 is 56.

130
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.830
There you go.

131
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.180
So Prime of negative 10 is 56.

132
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.240
It's positive.

133
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:43.430
That means that to the left of this negative three you have a positive sign for the derivative.

134
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.370
All right let's go ahead and plug in our second test value negative 2.5

135
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.800
by the way.

136
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.630
It's always a good idea to circle the test values because if not you might plug in you know this negative

137
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.060
3 or negative 2.

138
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.340
Those are going to give you zero.

139
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.070
Right.

140
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.360
Because we got them by finding the numbers that make the first derivative equal to zero.

141
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.970
So just so you know exactly what to plug in.

142
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.390
Always a good idea to circle these test values.

143
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.380
So let's plug in negative 2.5.

144
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.370
So we have

145
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:30.840
negative 2.5 plus three point five and again you're welcome to do this in a calculator if you need to.

146
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.980
Negative 2.5 plus 2 is negative.

147
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.800
Point five

148
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.910
positive times a negative is a negative.

149
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.940
So that's a negative.

150
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.480
And point five times point five is point twenty five.

151
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.890
So that's negative.

152
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:55.000
Point twenty five it's barely negative but it's negative.

153
00:11:55.390 --> 00:12:05.050
So between negative three and negative to the sign of the derivative is negative right.

154
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.340
And let's plug in our last number should be the easiest one is zero.

155
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.580
That's her third test value.

156
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.950
So let's go ahead and plug it in here.

157
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:23.810
Zero plus three is just three and zero plus two is just two.

158
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.780
So three times two is six.

159
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:34.100
That is a positive number because three and two are both positive and so to the right of negative to

160
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.840
zero is the sign of the derivative is positive.

161
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.900
Now we know what the sign of the derivative is for each of the intervals.

162
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.880
Let's go ahead and get our answer.

163
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.160
So to the left of negative 3 The derivative is positive.

164
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.700
That means that is increasing to the left of negative 3.

165
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:06.840
So we have that from negative infinity up to negative 3.

166
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:16.380
It is increasing.

167
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.910
All right so this original function between negative infinity and negative 3 the function is increasing

168
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:31.460
how ever when we get to negative 3 from negative 3 to negative to the sign of the derivative is negative.

169
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.240
That means that it's decreasing.

170
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:51.590
So from negative 3 to negative to it is decreasing.

171
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.630
All right.

172
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.480
So positive means increasing and negative means decreasing.

173
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:03.390
And we have one more interval which is to the right of this negative to and to the right of the negative

174
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.130
to it's positive.

175
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:21.000
So starting at the negative 2 and going up to positive infinity this is increasing.

176
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.470
Right.

177
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.760
So these are the intervals of increase and decrease.

178
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.080
And there we have our answer at this point.

179
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.040
We are done

180
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.920
so to quickly summarize to find the intervals of increase and decrease we've got the derivative of the

181
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.430
function then we set it equal to zero and we've factored to be able to find the numbers that make it

182
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.410
equal to zero.

183
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.120
They turn out to be negative 3 and negative 2.

184
00:14:53.170 --> 00:15:00.100
So we had to test values to the left and right of each to the right of negative 3 between negative 3

185
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.820
and negative 2 and to the right of negative 2 we got these test values.

186
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.720
We plug them into the derivative and we got the science of the answer.

187
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:18.550
So positive negative positive so positive negative positive and based on this number line we were able

188
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.510
to get our intervals of increase and decrease when the derivative is positive.

189
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.370
Then the original function is increasing.

190
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.970
And when the derivative is negative then the original function is decreasing.
