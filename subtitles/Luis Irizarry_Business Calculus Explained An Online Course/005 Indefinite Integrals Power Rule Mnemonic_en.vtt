00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.270
All right so here we have our mnemonic for finding indefinite integrals.

2
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.260
And like many other mnemonics that we have this one uses the letters in the name of what you're doing.

3
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.080
To tell you what you need to do.

4
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.430
So for indefinite integrals where you need to do is increase and divide it.

5
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.720
And actually if you grab the three first letters of indefinite I and D does for you get the increase

6
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140
and divide.

7
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.590
All right.

8
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.840
So for example if you have indefinite integral of x cubed DX

9
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.750
then using our mnemonic I N D for increase and divide.

10
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.420
We know that we need to grab this x to the third and that will become X to increase the exponent.

11
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.980
So it's going to be three plus one and divide it by the new exponents which is also three plus one.

12
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.410
All right so for integrals in general once you increase the exponent then you have to divide by the

13
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.700
new exponent.

14
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.220
So let's finish up this problem.

15
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.130
Remember this is plus C always.

16
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.620
And then we have X to that three plus one.

17
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130
So that's X to the fourth

18
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.200
over three plus one as well which is four plus seat and that is our answer.

19
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.000
All right.

20
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.250
Let's do another one.

21
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.070
X to the one hundredth.

22
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.970
So let's find the indefinite integral for this.

23
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.070
So again indef. i n d.

24
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:30.270
So we increase and divide that's going to be X to the 100 increase plus 1 and then divide by the same

25
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.700
thing 100 plus 1.

26
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.680
So we divide by the new exponent that we're getting plus C.

27
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:49.040
So what is 100 plus 1 it's a hundred on one like the Dalmatians right x to the 100 and a 1 over the

28
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.550
same thing 100 and 1 plus C that is our answer.

29
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.270
So you see how easy this makes it increase and divide tells you right away that you add one to the exponent

30
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.310
and then you divide by the new exponent that you're getting.

31
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.100
So compare this to the power rule but for derivatives.

32
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.810
Right.

33
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.370
So a power rule

34
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:29.460
for derivatives.

35
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.230
Remember that for this one for example if you have half of X equals x 3 and you want to find the derivative

36
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.930
of f of x we have a mnemonic that says that you grab the dictator in power.

37
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.230
You bring it down and then you substitute bï¿½l last powerful leader.

38
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.580
Right.

39
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.640
That is our dictator mnemonic.

40
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:58.610
So we bring it down to three and then we have X and substitute last powerful leader.

41
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.070
So that's three minus one and that becomes three x squared.

42
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.340
So notice that this process of bringing down the three and then subtracting by 1 is the opposite of

43
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.100
what we do here.

44
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.970
So here we bring down the exponent multiplying and we subtract 1 from the exponents for end rolls on

45
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.790
the other hand.

46
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.130
We add 1 to the exponents and then we divide by the new exponent.

47
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.540
So you see how they're kind of opposite.

48
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.350
That is the contrast between integrals and derivatives.

49
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.080
All right.

50
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.210
So it's very important you do not get them confused.

51
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.260
But I mean by this point you should know the power rule for derivatives by in-memory.

52
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.870
Because we've done it so many times basically every problem that we did for derivatives we have to use

53
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.990
this rule of bringing down a dictator and subtracting one.

54
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.190
But again like I said for the girls it changes and I hope they use this mnemonic to remind you that

55
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.490
here instead of bringing down the exponents and subtract them by 1.

56
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.740
Well we actually do is we increase the exponent by 1 and then divide by the new exponent.

57
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.310
So you have to be careful and see what type of problem you're doing.

58
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.930
If you're integrating you have to add one and then divide by the new exponents.

59
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.240
If you're finding derivatives then you need to bring the exponent down and subtract one from the exponents

60
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.560
as we've done so many times in the past on one more thing I wanted to mention Remember we've talked

61
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.370
about antiderivatives.

62
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.630
Right.

63
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.800
So the difference between an antiderivative and an indefinite integral is that the indefinite entero

64
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.500
remember is a family of functions.

65
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.500
The antiderivative is just one function.

66
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.030
So for example when we separate this here just to show you quickly

67
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.910
antiderivatives which we talked about before.

68
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.860
So if you have the function f of x equals x to the third and you want to find the antiderivative for

69
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.370
this.

70
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.720
Remember this is capital F of x then you can use the same rule increase and divide because remember

71
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.210
we're pretty much finding the function so that when you find it's derivative.

72
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.720
It gives you back x to the third.

73
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.590
That's the same thing that we're doing here.

74
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.590
But here we're getting a family of functions and this is kind of blurry.

75
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.050
Please go back to the beginning of this session on antiderivatives an indefinite integrals because there

76
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.340
is a distinction between the two.

77
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.000
However they are found using the same rule of increase and divide.

78
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.110
So again if we have this function f of x equals x to the third we can increase and divide it to get

79
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.710
the antiderivative.

80
00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:07.580
So we have X to that three plus one over three plus one and that is x to the fourth over 4 right which

81
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.770
is basically what we got for this problem right here where we're finding the indefinite integral of

82
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.860
x to the third.

83
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:22.050
And the answer was X to the forth over four plus see here the antiderivative of x cubed.

84
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.970
So the same function is X to the fourth over fourth.

85
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.660
So the same thing we got here with the only difference that in the indefinite integral we add the plus

86
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.420
C because remember the indefinite integral is a family of functions.

87
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.690
So it's an infinite number of functions whose derivative is x cubed and the antiderivatives on the other

88
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.740
hand you're finding one function whose derivative is execute.

89
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:57.680
So same answer just except the plus C but again to find antiderivatives you can use the same rule increase

90
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.340
and divide and that's it.
