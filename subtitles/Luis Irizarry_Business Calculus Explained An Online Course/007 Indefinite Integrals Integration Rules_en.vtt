1
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.200
Are right.

2
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.200
So like I mentioned before we're not going to cover a lot of integrals because they are not needed for

3
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.980
neither Bass's calculus nor a calculus one.

4
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.270
So we're going to go over the basic rules for integration.

5
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.880
Of course if you go on to take calculus too.

6
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.060
Or maybe a different subject you might see more integration than what we do here.

7
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.730
But again for the class that you're taking this is very likely to be what you will see.

8
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
So here we have four main rules that are used for simple integrals.

9
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.130
The power rule which we already covered the logarithmic rule the constant rule and the exponential rule.

10
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.670
So let's do each one with a couple of examples.

11
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630
Let's go I get into the power rule so I'll summarize it here.

12
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.090
But we did that in another video and we did it in a separate video because it is the most important

13
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420
rule for integrals.

14
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.650
So the rule says if you have the integral of x to the N so of a power function then what you're going

15
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.200
to do is you're going to take this X and then you're going to add 1 to the exponents.

16
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.510
So that will be.

17
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.510
And plus 1 over and plus 1 So remember we have a mnemonic for this.

18
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.650
It is increase and divide.

19
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.470
So we increase the exponent by 1 and we divide by the new exponent.

20
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.070
And of course let's not forget the plus seat.

21
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.000
All right.

22
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.050
So integral of x to the N is X to the end plus 1 over and plus 1.

23
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.940
And then you do plus see.

24
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:10.210
So for example if we have the integral of x to the 100 and 3 dx

25
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:28.770
that is going to be X to the 1 0 3 plus 1 over the same thing 1 0 3 plus 1 then we do plus see.

26
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:39.630
And that will be equal to do it down here because I don't have a lot of space X to the one of four over

27
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.700
one of four.

28
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.880
So notice the exponent of the X is the same thing that you divide by that is always the case for the

29
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.960
power rule.

30
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.490
So actually the fourth over 104 plus C and that is our final answer.

31
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.790
All right.

32
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.620
So if you still have questions about the power rule I recommend that you go back to the power rule video

33
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.020
where I explain this in more detail.

34
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.300
Let's move on to the constant rule.

35
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.800
So the concer rule is actually an example of the power rule.

36
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.240
Remember that I've said before that for example if you have the number five that is the same as saying

37
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.690
5 x to the 0.

38
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.170
Right because it's five times x to the zeros just one.

39
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.530
So that's why this becomes five times one is just five.

40
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.110
So the constant rule takes advantage of this fact to find the indefinite integrals of constant functions.

41
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.960
So the rule says if you have the integral of a constant k.

42
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.990
All right so OK could be any number the next and that is equal to k.

43
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.250
The constant again x.

44
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.610
So we're adding an X to that number plus C right.

45
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.280
So we take the constant we put an X next to it and we do plus C and let's not get confused with this.

46
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.340
This is something else right.

47
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:27.040
So for example if we have the integral of actually let's do the same five five DX here we have a constant.

48
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.760
So all we need to do is we add an X and if you're wondering why this is.

49
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.260
Well think about it think of this as integral of 5 x to 0.

50
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.760
Right.

51
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.940
Like I explained over here same thing.

52
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.320
Now that we have an exponents we could treat it as a power rule.

53
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.300
Right.

54
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.830
So we keep the five.

55
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.810
And then what do we do with the X..

56
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.010
You increase and divide.

57
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.540
So it's 5 x to the 0 plus 1.

58
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:10.380
We're adding one to the exponent and then we're dividing by the same exponent 0 plus 1 right.

59
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.620
And then we do plus see.

60
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:25.040
So that becomes 5 x 2 0 plus 1 is just x to the 1 or X and 0 plus 1 on the bottom is just 1.

61
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.760
So 5 x over 1 is still 5 x so we don't have to mark the one on the bottom plus see.

62
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:42.610
All right so the integral of 5 ends up being 5 x plus C the same number of times x plus the constant.

63
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.510
Let's do another example.

64
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.540
Two hundred and thirty five.

65
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.100
All right.

66
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.150
It's a bigger number but at the end of the day it is still a number.

67
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.100
All right still a constant.

68
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.370
So remember all we need to do is put an X next to the number and then add the plus the interval of to

69
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:14.140
35 equals to 35 x plus see and that's it.

70
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.190
That is our answer for this one.

71
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.970
And this one is our answer for the first one.

72
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.110
All right.

73
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.770
Pretty easy.

74
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.070
Just add an X to the constant and add the policy and you're good to go.

75
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.850
All right.

76
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.540
Moving on to the logarithmic rule I don't have a lot of space over here so I'll do a down here.

77
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.520
As you know the derivative of LNA VAX and this I actually do here.

78
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:49.270
So if you have L-N of x and you want to get the derivative of this remember that this is equal to 1

79
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.990
over X we talked about this in logarithmic functions S..

80
00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:01.930
So given this it's obvious that if you have one over X and you integrate it you're going back to Atlanta

81
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.420
X right.

82
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.660
So the rule says integral of one over X

83
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.270
equals L.A.X.

84
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.310
plus C..

85
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:26.570
Now there's one caveat to this and it is the fact that you have to do the absolute value of x.

86
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.480
So maybe you do not know the absolute value just means take the number within the absolute value and

87
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.880
make it positive if it's positive.

88
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.520
There's nothing you need to do if it's negative.

89
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.460
You make it positive for this integral.

90
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.550
We always do L-N of the absolute value of x plus C.

91
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.190
And again I don't want to bore you with all the details.

92
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.550
So why this includes an absolute value here.

93
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.240
If you want to you can look it up.

94
00:07:53.330 --> 00:08:00.980
But for now just know that when you have the integral of one over X then that is a natural log of the

95
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.500
absolute value of x plus C..

96
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:11.060
So one thing I want to mention is remember that one over X could be rewritten as something else.

97
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:19.200
Remember that this is one over x to the 1 because if we have X that is the same as saying X to the 1.

98
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:27.040
And remember that we could actually bring this x to the one to the top by flipping the sign of the exponent.

99
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:36.080
So in other words one over X is the same as saying X to the negative one.

100
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.100
Right.

101
00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.390
Let me put a one here so you know what I'm talking about.

102
00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:46.990
One X to the one is the same as bringing this x to the one to the top and then flipping the sign of

103
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.350
the exponents.

104
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.570
So if you get this integral integral of x to the negative one.

105
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.860
Remember this is the same as saying the integral of one over x.

106
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.780
Because these two are equivalent and you may look at this and say oh it's a power function so I can

107
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.960
just go ahead and apply the power rule.

108
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.630
However what happens remember that for the power rule we do increase and divide.

109
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.870
If we increase this it's going to be negative one plus one.

110
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.940
It's going to be an exponent of 0 and that's OK.

111
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.170
The problem is when you divide by zero.

112
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.750
Right.

113
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.150
If you divide by zero.

114
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.780
That math breaks down and you can't do it.

115
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:36.650
So this adds to the negative one is the only example of a power function which does not use the power

116
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.190
rule.

117
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.720
Any other power function you use a power tool for.

118
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:48.290
So if it's X for the negative to x to the negative 3 x to the 20th X to the one hundredth etc. X to

119
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:53.820
the negative one is the only example in which you cannot just apply the power rule.

120
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.420
And if you forget this fact you'll know right away when you start doing it because you'll get division

121
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.310
by zero.

122
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.350
All right.

123
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.240
Just want you to be aware of the fact that one over X is the same as x to the negative one and its integral.

124
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.390
Like we said on top is L-N of the absolute value of x plus C..

125
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.830
All right

126
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.020
cool.

127
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.600
So let's go to our alast rule which is the exponential rule.

128
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.630
Remember that an exponential function looks something like this.

129
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.470
An amusing is a base but your base could be any other number.

130
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.030
Right.

131
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.650
E to the X.

132
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.100
So let's see how this works out with integrals.

133
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:52.950
The exponential rule says that if you have integral of E to the power k x a K is just a number

134
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:09.130
and that is equal to one over OK so one over this constant that's in the exponents to the K x plus C.

135
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.670
All right so I know that was a little bit messy but bear with me.

136
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.580
So although we're doing here is we have this base to this xponent K x.

137
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:26.120
And what we do is we take this K and we divide everything by K and then we just write again this E to

138
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.340
the K x that doesn't change.

139
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.020
All right.

140
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.440
So let's do one example.

141
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:39.790
And to grow of the to 3 X right.

142
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:49.240
So in this example k equals 3 right because K is whatever numbers multiplying the DX right k x.

143
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.670
In this case it's 3x.

144
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.710
So according to this we do 1 over k.

145
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.790
So it's basically taking this 3 and saying 1 over 3.

146
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.440
And then we just keep the two the three x.

147
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.540
All right.

148
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:11.420
So you see that we brought down those three dividing and then we rewrite this thing again each to the

149
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.420
three X does exactly what we did.

150
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.100
And then plus C so it kind of looks difficult here but I saw about it all.

151
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:28.160
So divide by K and keep the E to the K x and then add the plus see of course.

152
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:28.680
All right.

153
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.370
So let's do another example which is actually a very special case of this rule.

154
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:42.510
What if you have the X just plain old E to the x y is the integral of this.

155
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.760
Well what is k in this case.

156
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.500
It kind of looks like it's not marked right what's multiplying is x.

157
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.200
So remember that when there's really nothing multiplying something we can think of it as a 1.

158
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.130
Right.

159
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:05.810
So each of the X is the same as saying each to the one times X. Right.

160
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.000
We're multiplying 1 times x.

161
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.460
And given this.

162
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.320
Now we can apply our rule.

163
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:15.740
Right.

164
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.100
So K is 1 and then we bring down the K.

165
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.970
So that becomes 1 over 1.

166
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.990
This is K down here.

167
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:35.330
To the one time is X which is again e to the X plus C but what is 1 over 1 is just one.

168
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:42.310
So we don't need to market at the end of the day we have each of the X plus C.

169
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.720
So check it out.

170
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.130
The integral of each of the X is the same.

171
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.210
Each of the X.

172
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.650
Right.

173
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:56.730
Nothing changes just like we saw in the exponential function section that the derivative of the X is.

174
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.480
Each of the x Well the integral of each of the X is also each of the X.

175
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.430
So basically each of the X is this immutable function that never changes.

176
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:14.620
When you get the derivative you get to the X and when you get the integral you also get to the X right.

177
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.710
Remember Like I mentioned in our mnemonic that your X never changes.

178
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.330
That's why you don't go back with them.

179
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:26.610
Same thing each of the X never changes whether you're getting the derivative or you're getting the integral.

180
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.580
It's always equal to the X..

181
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.970
All right

182
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:38.390
of course you always need to add the plus C because that's the way indefinite integrals work.

183
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.440
All right.

184
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.100
And let me just circle the answer for the first one which was this one here.

185
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.110
And that is it for the exponential rule.

186
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.110
All right so here we have are four integration rules.

187
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.850
Again these are very simple.

188
00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.250
They're used to find that and the rows of very simple functions like we said we have the power rule.

189
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.630
So we increase and divide.

190
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.880
We have a constant row where we basically just put an X next to the concept and that's going to give

191
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:13.190
you the integral that we have the logarithmic rule that tells you that if you're finding the integral

192
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:21.530
of one over x or x the negative one which is the same thing then that is equal to the natural log of

193
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:30.710
absolute value of x plus C and finally exponential rule where if you have E to the K X or K is a number

194
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.370
you pretty much bring down the K and then you keep the E to the K x.

195
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.640
Right.

196
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.350
Like I said this each of the X is a very special case.

197
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.730
This case k is 1.

198
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:49.220
And at the end of the day you get that the indefinite integral of each of the X is just to the X plus

199
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.600
C.

200
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.240
So these are our integration rules.

201
00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:00.260
Now let's look at some properties that we can use to break integrals apart and then be able to do them

202
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.590
all right.

203
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.240
Later on we're going to mix these rules with the properties that we're going to cover now and then you'll

204
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.610
be doing integrals in no time.
