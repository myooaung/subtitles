1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,620
All right so here we have our first example.

2
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,370
It says find the intervals of increase and decrease of the function f of x equals 6 x squared minus

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,260
2 x.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,980
So let's break it down step by step.

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:41,540
We do not have a graph for this function so we need to use derivatives first that is find the derivative

6
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,090
find and prime of X OK.

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,530
So what is a derivative of this function over here.

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,290
Let's finally put to use all of the rules that we learned in the last section.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,489
So the derivative of 6 x squared minus 2 x.

10
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,200
So we have a difference of 2 terms 6 x squared minus 2 x for the first term we have a constant multiplying.

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,070
So the constant multiple rules says we keep the six times.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,580
This is the power rule.

13
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:29,790
So we bring down a dictator so we bring down or 2 x and remember we remove one from the exponent.

14
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:38,060
So that's X to the one and it's two minus 1 becomes X to the one and then we have a difference so we

15
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,920
say minus constant multiple.

16
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,780
We have a two on the outside.

17
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,220
And then we have X to the 1.

18
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,760
So remember that an x by itself is X to the 1.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,090
So it's going to be X to the 1 minus 1.

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,380
So let's simplify six times two is 12.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,610
X 2 the 2 minus 1 is just 1.

22
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,560
So we don't market minus 2 times X to 1 minus 1.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,300
But remember this.

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,300
So one of minus one is 0.

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,200
So x 2 0 is just one.

26
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,390
Remember that anything to the zero power is always 1.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:32,350
So it's going to be two times one is just two 12 X minus 2 is our derivative our second step is going

28
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:40,770
to be to find the values that make the derivative equal to zero and the values that make it undefined.

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,010
So find the values where the derivative is equal to zero.

30
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,590
And where the derivative is defined.

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,220
Now in this specific case we do not have a fraction for a derivative.

32
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,960
The derivative is simply too well of x squared minus 2.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,010
So there is no value really that's going to make it on the find.

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,020
We cannot have any division by zero.

35
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,700
That's why this case is only going to check for the first case which is the derivative is equal to zero.

36
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,890
So let's grab this and set it equal to zero.

37
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,530
12 X minus 2 is equal to zero.

38
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,460
So we want to solve for x.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,170
First of all we have to move this to to the other side.

40
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,530
So we do plus two on both sides

41
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:55,660
cancels out and we bring down the 12 x 12 x is equal to zero plus two is to and then finally we want

42
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,980
to solve for x which is being multiplied by the 12.

43
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:07,370
So we have to divide by 12 on both sides over 12 and over 12.

44
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,770
So the 12 and 12 cancel out and we have X equals 2 over 12.

45
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:20,250
We divide this whole thing by two the two becomes a one and the 12 becomes a 6.

46
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,190
So we're just simplifying.

47
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,460
So X equals 1 over 6.

48
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,360
This one over 6.

49
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,520
When you plug it into the derivative It gives you a value of zero.

50
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,900
OK so this is your zero and there's only one.

51
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,030
Sometimes you have to or you have three in this case you only have one.

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,150
And finally or step three is test values left and right.

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
And do not worry.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,920
We're almost done with this problem.

55
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,070
OK.

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,400
So we found a derivative we found their values and make the derivative equal to zero.

57
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,360
In this case it's only 1 over 6 so that's the only value.

58
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,600
So how do we know where the original function is increasing or decreasing.

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,980
Well we need to test.

60
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,380
All right.

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,750
That is the last step when finding intervals of increase and decrease.

62
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:37,570
So what you can do here is you can draw a number line something like this and you can put the 0 and

63
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,080
the 0 is the number so that when you plug it into the derivative it is equal to zero.

64
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:53,290
So you put this 0 1 over 6 and when you need to do is you need to pick a value to the left and you need

65
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,780
to pick a value to the right.

66
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,880
So remember one over six is a positive number.

67
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,920
And if you plug it into a calculator it's approximately point 16.

68
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:12,060
So we need to get a value to the left of point 16 and to the right of point 16 we can pick either values.

69
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:19,520
So to the left of point 16 is what is 0 because 0 is less than 0.16.

70
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,600
And to the right of point 16 Let's pick an easy value.

71
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,370
Let's pick one

72
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,820
swimmer repeat that again.

73
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,270
Once you find the values that make the derivative equal to zero you need to pick values to the left

74
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,370
of that value and to the right of that value.

75
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,790
And what you do is you grab those test values 0 and 1 you plug them into the derivative and you see

76
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,860
either a positive or negative or positive.

77
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,800
The graph is increasing and if it's negative the graph is decreasing.

78
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,350
All right.

79
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:05,390
So let's go ahead and plug these into the derivative and I'll mark this here because this is very important.

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,230
So this zero and this one you plug into the derivative

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,440
you always always always plug in these test values in the derivative.

82
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,540
You're not going to plug the men into the original function f of x.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,050
You're going to plug them in into the derivative 12 X minus 2.

84
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,620
This is a source of confusion all the time.

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,460
And if you plug it into the original You're going to get it wrong.

86
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,220
OK.

87
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,930
So remember your test values always go into the derivative.

88
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,900
So let's go ahead and plug those in.

89
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,590
So first let's plug in zero.

90
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,490
So prime zero so we're plugging in zero into the derivative.

91
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,320
So 12 x so X is zero.

92
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,770
Mine is to 12 times zero is zero.

93
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,940
And we're left with the minus to.

94
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,990
OK so what does that mean.

95
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,370
That means that to the left of one over six the derivative is negative.

96
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,630
So you can just mark all of this as negative.

97
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,040
All right

98
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:36,679
and let's plug in the next value prime of what that is or second test value.

99
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,570
We're plugging that into our derivative.

100
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,100
So we have 12 times one

101
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,940
minus two 12 times one is 12.

102
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,580
Minus two is 10.

103
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,160
So this is interesting because this one's positive while the other one was negative.

104
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,600
So because we get 10 when we plug in one that means that to the right of 1 over 6 the derivative is

105
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,530
positive.

106
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,940
Aha.

107
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,920
So this is our answer.

108
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,070
The function is decreasing.

109
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:24,560
To the left of one over six because a derivative is negative and the graph is increasing to the right

110
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,620
of 1 over 6 because the derivative is positive.

111
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:35,050
So for the final answer we have to specify the intervals of increase and the intervals of decrease.

112
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:50,100
So from 1 over 6 up to positive infinity it is increasing so from 1 over 6 up to positive infinity

113
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,890
and remember this is not a point.

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,440
This is a group of x values.

115
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,920
In other words this is an interval.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,130
So in the interval we have from 1 over 6 which is approximately point 16 up to all the values greater

117
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,010
than 1 over 6.

118
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,340
The function is increasing.

119
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,760
And why is it increasing.

120
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,520
Because a derivative was positive in that interval.

121
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:32,400
On the other hand in the other interval which is the numbers that are less than 1 over 6 it is decreasing.

122
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:40,340
So from negative infinity up to 1 over 6

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,380
The graph is decreasing

124
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,250
these two are intervals of increase and decrease.

125
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,750
And that is our final answer.

126
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,010
All right.

127
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,850
This probably might be your first example applying derivatives into a problem in that case.

128
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,880
Welcome to the world of the application of derivatives.

129
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,840
As you go on you'll notice a lot of patterns.

130
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,110
You know many times where you need to do is find the derivative and then set it equal to zero and then

131
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,750
find the values left and right of the zeros etc. etc..

132
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,670
So we're going to see a lot of different problems that require the same approach.

133
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,980
All right so let's go over what we just did.

134
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,890
We wanted to find the intervals of increase and decrease of this function.

135
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,340
So step one is to find the derivative of the function.

136
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,570
We found it right here.

137
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:54,720
Step two is to find the values that make the derivative equal to zero or then make it undefined.

138
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,830
In this case nothing really makes it on the fine because there is no division.

139
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,580
All right.

140
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,210
So we're only checking for the values that make the derivative equal to zero.

141
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:14,020
To do that we took the derivative 12 X minus 2 we set it equal to zero and we solved for X that gave

142
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,390
us that the derivative is zero when X equals 1 over 6.

143
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,390
Finally because we have a value that makes a derivative equal to zero.

144
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,490
Our third step is to test for values left and right of this zero.

145
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,580
So we picked easy values less than 1 or 6.

146
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,970
We pegged 0 and greater than 1 over 6 we picked one.

147
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,380
Again you could have picked any number.

148
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:46,120
Remember you only have to pick one number to the left and one number to the right.

149
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,980
You do not have to pick several.

150
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:55,240
All right so if your values one of six you could have picked negative 10 for example to test to the

151
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,780
left instead of that we picked zero up because it's an easy number.

152
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,190
By the same token to test values to the right or greater than 1 over 6 You could have picked any value

153
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,780
greater could have picked two we could have picked ten we could have picked 100.

154
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,720
It doesn't matter.

155
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,240
But again we want to pick easy values as much as we can.

156
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:25,190
So we picked one after that we took these two test values 0 and 1 and we plugged them into the derivative.

157
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:31,560
I remember this is critical that you plug them in into the right function which is a derivative.

158
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,750
If you plug them in into the original function it is not going to work.

159
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,910
It's going to give you an incorrect answer.

160
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,100
So your test values always go in your derivative.

161
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,610
That's what I wrote down here.

162
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,620
You have to plug them into prime of x.

163
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:55,630
So we went ahead and we plugged in 0 to test to the left to 1 over 6 that gave us a negative number

164
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,910
to the left of negative 1 over 6.

165
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,310
The derivative is negative.

166
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,270
That means that the interval is decreasing.

167
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,020
Remember that negative derivative decreasing positive derivative increasing.

168
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,170
There you go.

169
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,080
And then we test that by plugging in one into the derivative.

170
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,540
That gave us a positive number 10.

171
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,300
So to the right of 1 over 6 the derivative is positive.

172
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,900
All right.

173
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,810
And finally just to write down or intervals.

174
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,070
We had that from 1 over six up to positive infinity.

175
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,750
So from here to the right it is increasing.

176
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,620
And on the other hand from negative infinity to 1 over 6.

177
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,620
So you come from the left and up to 1 over 6.

178
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,220
The graph is decreasing.

179
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,790
Why.

180
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,250
Because we know that to the left of one of six the derivative is negative.

181
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,210
Right.

182
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,490
And the last thing I wanted to show you is that this actually works well we just did.

183
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:08,660
So for a function f of x equals 6 x squared minus 2 x.

184
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,840
If we draw the graph and again you don't really need to know how you draw it.

185
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm just going to show you as an example.

186
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:26,690
It's going to look something like this.

187
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,140
All right.

188
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,670
So it's a parabola.

189
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,460
And this is the x value 1 over 6.

190
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,520
So like we said from negative infinity.

191
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,770
So as you come from the left up to 1 over 6.

192
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,270
Notice that it's actually decreasing right as you come from the left.

193
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,390
The graph is going down it's going down it's going down and up until one of six after one over six.

194
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,290
Check it out.

195
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,060
The graph is actually going up going up going up going up.

196
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,080
So what we determined with our derivatives is actually true.

197
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,870
I'll repeat it once again from negative infinity up to 1 over 6.

198
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,440
The graph is actually doing what it's decreasing because it's going down.

199
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:32,250
And once we get to 1 over 6 then what happens is it starts going up and going up and going up up until

200
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,240
infinity.

201
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:46,170
So from 1 over 6 up until positive infinity it is increasing.

202
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,860
Hey calculus works.

203
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,000
All right.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,510
Perfect.

205
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,000
Now let's go into our summary for this section in which we're going to go over the process that we just

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,560
did and where we're going to cover everything that we reviewed in this lesson.
