1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,290
All right.

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,080
So I know it's been a long section but I wanted to give you the details on everything on how concavity

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,540
works and very important.

4
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,140
The second the money that we did which differentiates between first derivative and second derivatives.

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,680
So you know which one does what.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,270
So let's get started.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,250
So concavity describes the shape of a curve.

8
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,300
Concave up means it opens up a board.

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,100
So this is concave up.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,050
Right.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,840
It opens up like concave down opens downward.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,480
So it's like the opposite of up.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,000
It opens down.

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,690
All right.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,490
So a graph can be concave up for some intervals and concave down for others.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,030
We've seen examples of this.

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,220
So so now looks like this you know how House changing concavity.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,000
So it's opening down here than up here.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,120
Then down here etc etc..

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,570
Then we have a mnemonic to remember concavity.

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,510
So think of the word concave concave up or concave down.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:44,820
So with then the word concave you have the word cave so then a Mark says where does this cave open forward.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,030
Does it open towards the top or does it open towards the bottom.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,400
So for example here and concave up it's close in the bottom but it's open towards the top so it's concave

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,450
up.

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,970
Same thing for a concave down.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,790
All right then let's go to the second derivative.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,750
So the second derivative of f of x is a derivative of the first derivative.

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,320
So we have a function of of x you get the derivative of f of x and then you find the derivative of that

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,000
derivative.

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,470
That's called the second derivative of the original f of x.

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,410
Right.

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:32,040
And it's typically denoted as double prime of x.

34
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,500
Of course this also means that it could be called Y double prime

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,420
remember that y equals f of x.

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,010
So if you can call it a double prime of X you could also call it y double prime.

37
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,250
Now there's a third notation that I don't know if you remember where we talked about the D-y dx.

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,310
That's a way of specifying derivatives.

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,050
So D-y dx is the first derivative a way of specifying the second derivative is

40
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,030
d to y.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,180
The x squared and I know it looks very weird.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,040
Very different.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,840
This kind of looks like you're squaring something and it's red as to why over the x 2.

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,750
I just wanted to mention it in case you ever see this.

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,830
This is just telling you find the second derivative of y and notice that the two is in the middle for

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,110
the top part but then it's at the end and the bottom part.

47
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,340
For some reason that's the way it is.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,910
All right.

49
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:49,870
So what is the relationship between the second derivative and concavity it's very similar to the relationship

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,520
between the first derivative and increasing and decreasing intervals.

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:02,860
So we have that if the second derivative is positive for an interval then the grab is concave up on

52
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,960
that interval.

53
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:11,400
All right in the same way if the second derivative is negative then the graph is concave down.

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,650
Remember how similar this is to increasing or decreasing functions.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,260
And the first derivative.

56
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,290
Let me draw this out for you.

57
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,300
All right so here's a quick summary of pretty much first and second derivative increasing and decreasing

58
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,730
intervals and concavity.

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,600
So when the result is positive if you're dealing with the first derivative that means that the function

60
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,170
is increasing.

61
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,690
If the result is positive.

62
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,440
But we're dealing with the second derivative then that means it's concave up.

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,010
So notice how all the positive terms are lumped together.

64
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,730
So when it's positive it's increasing it's up.

65
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,550
Right.

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,370
So when I say positive terms I don't mean greater than zero.

67
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,270
I mean like good terms right.

68
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,150
All the good terms are here.

69
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,900
When something's positive then it means it's good.

70
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,890
It's upbeat.

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,020
It's nice.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,310
Right.

73
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,080
If your profits are increasing then that's good right.

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,350
So positive.

75
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,860
Increasing up all of these are good quote unquote terms.

76
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,510
On the other hand we have negative.

77
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,580
Right.

78
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:24,220
So the result is negative and you're dealing with the first derivative then the graph of f of x is decreasing

79
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,770
on that interval.

80
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,520
The result is negative.

81
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,120
What you're dealing with the second derivative than that means that the graph is concave down and in

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,290
the same way as with the positive here we have lumped the negative terms right so negative decreasing

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,790
down right although these are not good.

84
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,860
And that's kind of a way to remember it.

85
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:56,030
All the good terms go together and all the bad trim that goes together and also remember this test that

86
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,310
you do with the first derivative to check where the function is increasing and decreasing is the same

87
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,350
test that you do with a second derivative to check if it's concave up or concave down.

88
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,570
Remember how we have to find the numbers that make it either equal to zero or undefined.

89
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,750
We do that with both the first derivative and the second derivative.

90
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,100
And then remember how we find like the test values we try a test value to the left and to the right

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,460
of each number that we got.

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,950
If you're using the first derivative for that then you're finding intervals of increase and decrease.

93
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,330
But if you do it with a second derivative you're finding intervals of concavity where the function is

94
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,510
concave up and concave down.

95
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,180
But it's the same process for both.

96
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,470
I'll put it here.

97
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,220
So you remember

98
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,370
same process right.

99
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,550
Find the derivative whether it's a first or the second derivative.

100
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,110
Find the numbers that make it equal to zero or that make it undefined.

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:08,570
Test one value to the left and one to the right of each number and then classify based on this good

102
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:17,180
trims go to gather positive increase up and bad terms go to gather negative decrease and down.

103
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,310
And let's go to the next page where we'll actually see the mnemonic that we learned to remember what

104
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,700
the first derivative does and what the second derivative does.

105
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,160
All right.

106
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,630
Here we have the last part of our summary.

107
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,010
So remember a point of inflection or inflection point is the point where the concavity changes.

108
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:46,340
So a graph goes from concave up to concave down or from concave down to concave up.

109
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,220
And remember this occurs only where the second derivative is zero or where the second derivative is

110
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:01,830
undefined just like relative extrema only occurs where the first derivative is zero or undefined just

111
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,410
that in this case we're used in the second instead of the first and then to find intervals of concavity.

112
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,180
Remember this is exactly the same process that we use to find intervals of increase and decrease.

113
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,300
The only difference is that instead of using the first derivative like we do for increase and decrease

114
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,880
we used the second.

115
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,050
So to find intervals of concavity find the second derivative find the numbers that make the second derivative

116
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,600
equal to zero.

117
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,310
And by the way you might be wondering why I used to equal signs.

118
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,590
That is the programmer in me in programming to see if things are equal.

119
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,550
You need to use the two equals.

120
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:51,870
So maybe I'll use the equal sign sometimes but I might slip and just use these two but that's OK.

121
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,690
You know that it means that it's just equal to something else.

122
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,520
So equals equals means just equals.

123
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:07,030
All right however in your notes you might want to put it as just one equals two so you don't get confused.

124
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,470
Right.

125
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,810
But that's pretty much it.

126
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,570
So one more time to find the entrails of concavity.

127
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,260
So then we need to find out where the second derivative is zero or undefined.

128
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,280
And then we classify intervals.

129
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:34,030
So remember we put test values one to the left and one to the right.

130
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:40,270
And this test value process we do it one to the left and one to the right for each number that makes

131
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,690
a derivative equal to zero or undefined.

132
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,480
OK.

133
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,570
Each one.

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,700
And then if the second derivative is positive then that means that it's concave up and if it's negative

135
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,640
it means it's concave down.

136
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:01,170
And finally one of the main takeaways of this whole lesson of concavity is how to differentiate.

137
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:06,950
No pun intended between what the first derivative does and the second derivative does.

138
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:12,700
I don't want you to get confused and start thinking 0 is the first derivative use for a concavity or

139
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,430
is it the second.

140
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,110
Do I use the second derivative for relative extrema.

141
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,470
I don't want any of that.

142
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,560
I want you to know right there boom.

143
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,310
Exactly which one goes with which.

144
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,840
So for that again you just grab the first three letters of first and second.

145
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:40,120
So if I are of course this means the first derivative is used for i.

146
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,450
Stands for increase and decrease

147
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,380
and also for relative extrema.

148
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,890
And remember this increase and decrease intervals is tightly related to relative extrema because relative

149
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,750
extrema only occurs where their graph goes from increasing to decreasing and vice versa.

150
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:18,650
All right so that's the first derivative for the second derivative as E.S. again as is for second.

151
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,510
Is again like I said think of it as inflection point

152
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,510
and it rhymes with reflection

153
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,950
and refl. has an e.

154
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
It rhymes with inflection.

155
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,610
So the E is for inflection right.

156
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,820
And finally the C is for concavity.

157
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,590
So you use the second derivative to find concavity and inflection points or as I like to call them sometimes

158
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,550
inflection points.

159
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,900
That's not my accent.

160
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,220
That is the way we say it.

161
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,850
For this mnemonic.

162
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,820
All right.

163
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,360
So I know we covered a lot.

164
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,840
Best thing to do is to practice a lot of these problems with inflection points and concavity and see

165
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,120
when you use the first derivative and the second etc..

166
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,170
I promise you that it does get better as you do problems.

167
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,250
There's going to be a point hopefully where you just go ahead and know exactly what to do once you see

168
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,750
one of these problems.

169
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,180
The trick of course is to practice.

170
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,700
So I'll give you a couple of problems in the problem section so you can practice and I'll see you in

171
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,680
the next to Tauriel.
