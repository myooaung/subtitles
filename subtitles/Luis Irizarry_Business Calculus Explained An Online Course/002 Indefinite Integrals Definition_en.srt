1
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,100
All right so we have that functions have an infinite number of antiderivatives because of constants.

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,450
So an infinite number of them.

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,850
That's a lot.

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,120
Let me show you what this means for example.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:45,240
So what is a derivative of x squared plus five.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,720
It is 2 x Right.

7
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,640
Because a derivative of x squared.

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,040
We just use the power rule.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,990
It gives us 2 x plus the derivative of a constant is 0.

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:09,200
All right what is the derivative of plus thirty four squared plus 34.

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,890
Well same thing.

12
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,000
The derivative of this one is to X and the derivative of this one is zero.

13
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,140
What is the derivative of x squared.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,740
Mine is pi.

15
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,370
Remember pi is approximately three point fourteen.

16
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:41,000
It's just a number well same thing derivative of this one is to X and derivative of negative pi is zero.

17
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,690
So I hope you're seeing a pattern here.

18
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,310
The derivative of all of these functions is 2x.

19
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:58,940
So if I ask you to find the antiderivative of 2 x so the function whose derivative is 2 x which one

20
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,450
is it.

21
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,970
Is it x squared plus 5 or is it x plus 34 or is it x squared minus Pi.

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,730
It turns out all of them are antiderivatives of 2 x.

23
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,720
So in general the antiderivative

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,860
of 2 x it's not only one function because as you can see there are several functions whose derivative

25
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,050
is to X.

26
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,470
In fact there is an infinite number of them.

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,140
Because you could put here any number that you want it.

28
00:02:42,150 --> 00:03:04,420
So in general the antiderivative of 2 x is x squared plus C right and that C is a constant.

29
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,490
All right.

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,740
So again I want you to pay attention because this is really important.

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,880
The antiderivative of 2 x it's not just one of these functions it's a family of functions.

32
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,420
In fact it's an infinite number of functions because again you could have x squared plus whatever a

33
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:33,240
constant and the derivative of that is always going to be 2x because a derivatives of constants are

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,950
zero.

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,470
So again the antiderivative of 2 x is x squared plus C and C could be any constant.

36
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,200
OK.

37
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,570
In fact we have a special name for this

38
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,610
and that's called indefinite integral.

39
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,480
Let's check that out next.

40
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,640
OK so here we have the definition of an indefinite integral.

41
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:08,130
So we saw in the last section that a function has an infinite number of antiderivatives.

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:18,670
So an indefinite integral is the family of antiderivatives of a function uppercase f of x plus C.

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,150
So when we say the family which is mean the group right it's a group of antiderivatives for a given

44
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:33,550
function and it makes sense that this is the notation because this is the generic antiderivative plus

45
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,970
a constant.

46
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,570
Remember though we have to add a constant because we'll find the derivative of this constant could be

47
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,460
anything but its derivative will be zero.

48
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,420
So let's do another example just to make it more clear.

49
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,020
So again let's find the derivative of

50
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,870
2 x squared plus three

51
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,150
a derivative of this is for X

52
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,660
and the derivative of three is zero.

53
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,740
Let's find the derivative of two x squared.

54
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,960
Again mine is 10.

55
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,860
So all that changes is the constant.

56
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:30,310
So that's going to be again for X because a derivative of the first term is for X minus the derivative

57
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,780
of 10 is 0 and 1 more.

58
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,630
Let's do

59
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,090
2 x squared plus 1 derivative of this.

60
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,870
And again it's just for X and the derivative of this one is zero.

61
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,390
So as you can see there is a group of functions whose derivative is Forex.

62
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:02,860
So if we want to get the antiderivative for X it's not just this one or just this one or just this one.

63
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,850
It's all of them and then some.

64
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:12,760
That's why we have the generic form where we say uppercase f of x plus C.

65
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,180
So we can say that the indefinite integral

66
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,870
I'm really great at writing with this pad.

67
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,230
Right.

68
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,700
Look at that.

69
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,410
And beautiful.

70
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,290
So the indefinite integral of 4 x

71
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
is what.

72
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,970
Well it's this antiderivative 2 x squared

73
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,190
plus C.

74
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:58,730
All right

75
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,780
cool.

76
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:13,660
So again this right here are the two x squared is the antiderivative because the derivative of 2 x squared

77
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,900
is for X.

78
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,730
But then we also have to specify this plus C which represents a constant.

79
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,030
Because you could have two X squared plus three or two x squared minus 10 or 2 x squared plus 1 x cetera

80
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,530
et cetera et cetera.

81
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:35,320
There's an infinite number of constants that you could add or subtract this to x squared.

82
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,100
That's why the indefinite integral is given in this form and this agrees with the definition we have

83
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,060
here.

84
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,840
It is a family of antiderivatives of a function.

85
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,310
All right.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,260
That's why this concept is not specified.

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,430
It's not one or two or three.

88
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,290
It's just C in general because it could be any constant.

89
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:07,950
So again the antiderivative is just one function but the indefinite integral is the family of functions

90
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,680
whose derivative is for X and I'll say it one more time.

91
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,140
The reason we have a family is because we have constants.

92
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,410
All right.

93
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,750
So let's see how the process of finding indefinite integrals looks like.
