1
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,260
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless count use.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,510
Today I want to talk a little bit more about rates of change.

3
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,870
So we already determined how to find the rate of change of a linear function is just the slope of the

4
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,590
line you get when you graph the function.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,530
As we mentioned a linear function has a constant rate of change.

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,200
We put that here.

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,650
So a linear function has a constant rate of change.

8
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,970
So what exactly does that mean.

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,740
Well if it's constant It means that it's not changing.

10
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:22,840
So for example if you have a graph that looks like this.

11
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,650
So there you have the graph of a linear function it's just a straight line.

12
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,150
Let's say that the slope for this one is three.

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,980
So remember slope is given by m so am equals three.

14
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,670
That means that for every unit you move to the right.

15
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,640
So if you move one to the right you're going to go up three.

16
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:56,090
So one two three and you end up and the graph again you can do it for example here as well.

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:06,500
So if you start here you move one to the right and then you move three up one two three OK.

18
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,270
So it's rate of change it's three because for every unit that you move to the right you move up three

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,150
that is slow.

20
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,580
Right.

21
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,000
Right.

22
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,930
Overrun.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
And just to repeat one more time.

24
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,980
That means that the rate of change of this function is three.

25
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,080
All right so that is for a linear function.

26
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,450
It's a straight line.

27
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,640
It's very easy.

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,340
Just count how many units you're going up or down as you move to the right.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,650
But what happens when you have something like this.

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:56,310
What happens if your graph is a curve.

31
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,130
What if we want to find the rate of change of this curve.

32
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:07,150
Well it turns out that this is a much harder problem than finding it for this line.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,030
And the answer to finding the rate of change of a curve will lead to some very smart people to invent

34
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,050
what we call calculus today.

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,250
So Slobo whole line very easy slope of a curve.

36
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,530
Not that easy.

37
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,870
Because think about it what if you want to do rice of a run for example here.

38
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,890
So you start here and then you move to the right and then you move up.

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
So you have this.

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:42,350
OK so you kind of have a line there but what happens here if you want to get the slope here you go here

41
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,670
and then you go down.

42
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,720
Well you have a completely different line.

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,810
Right.

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,740
So in this case when we drew two points you ended up in the same line here.

45
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,400
When you draw two points and try to connect them you don't have the same line at all.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,110
Here you have this line.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,140
But then here you have this line.

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,400
And if I drew two other points it's going to be a different line as well.

49
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,710
So we have to figure out a way to find the rate of change of a curve.

50
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,690
Now before we do that let's talk a little bit more about rates of change.

51
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,130
Let's say that you work as a finance officer for a company that makes 3D glasses.

52
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,760
Right.

53
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,640
Kind of like Google Glass.

54
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,560
So you have a meeting with your boss next week to talk about the current financial status of the company.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,210
You have a graph that shows how profit is changing over time.

56
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,160
And it looks like this

57
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:52,840
LME market here this is a profit over time graph.

58
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,250
So let's say that this graph looks something like this.

59
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,590
Let's say that this is when the company started.

60
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:28,340
And from there on the profit kind of has you know gone up then it went a little bit down up again down.

61
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,640
Then it went up by a lot and then it went down by a lot.

62
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,350
OK.

63
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,180
So it kind of looks like this.

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,960
So the interesting question is how are profits changing over time.

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
Can we get a precise answer.

66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,310
Well yes we can.

67
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,780
Now we can't really calculate the slope of a curve since the curve varies so much.

68
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,620
But let's start with the concept of average rate of change.

69
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,920
OK so what is average rate of change.

70
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:20,020
So what we can do is we can calculate in average how the profit is changing over a certain time period.

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,640
And the way to do that is with something called a c can't line

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,060
and what a second line does is that it touches the graph at two different points.

73
00:06:42,640 --> 00:07:02,200
So it touches graph.

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,770
All right.

75
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,930
So that's what a second line does.

76
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,540
It touches a graph at two different points.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,550
So for example let's say that we want to measure the average rate of change from this point up to this

78
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,040
point

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,740
OK.

80
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,950
So we want to measure average rate of change.

81
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,770
What we do is we draw a line.

82
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,850
So it touches the graph at two different points and then the slope of the second line is going to be

83
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,290
your average rate of change.

84
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,610
So slope of second line

85
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:57,680
that is the average rate of change.

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,340
Right.

87
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,040
So we have this point we have this point we can't draw a second line over here.

88
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,550
Something like this right.

89
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,350
So that's touching the graph at two points.

90
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,220
Now let's say that the slope of this line is

91
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,120
0.5

92
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,320
is the slope of this sequent line is 0.5.

93
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:39,299
That means that in average profit's changed 0.5 between this points in time and this point in time.

94
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,409
Okay.

95
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,350
Second line touches the graph at two points and it gives you the average rate of change.

96
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,740
Let's try to get another second line and see how it looks.

97
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,970
Let's say I want to get the average rate of change between this points and this point

98
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,350
will draw our second line over here.

99
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,860
So this second line is again touching the graph at two different points.

100
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,980
Notice that this one actually goes up as you move from left to right.

101
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,040
But then this line moves down as you go from left to right.

102
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,770
That means that the slope is negative and it makes sense because the prophets were doing well they were

103
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,440
up here and all of a sudden they just went down by a lot.

104
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,400
So it's changing in a negative way.

105
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:54,360
So let's say the slope of this line equals negative 3.5.

106
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:03,370
That means that from this point in time to this point in time the profits changed by negative 3.5 an

107
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,610
average over.

108
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,720
Just to summarize a secret line touches the graph at two different points.

109
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,410
Here's one secret line and here's another secret line.

110
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,790
So the slope of the second line gives you the average rate of change.

111
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,460
OK.

112
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,880
So the slope of this line is 0.5 we said.

113
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,310
So the average rate of change between these two points is 0.5.

114
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:38,020
On the other hand the average rate of change between these two points is negative 3.5.

115
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:44,530
And that's because the slope of the line is negative 3.5.

116
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,850
All right.

117
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,210
So this is average rate of change.

118
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,710
So it's not really accurate for a specific point in time.

119
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,830
You have to get two points and then get a line between them and find out the slope.

120
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,520
So it's really not that useful when you think about it.

121
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,060
What's really interesting is to get that instantaneous rate of change meaning how profit is changing

122
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,930
at a specific point in time.

123
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,020
So instead of having to pick two points I can say OK how is a prophet changing over here.

124
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,080
And to do that I don't want to have to get a different point and get the average.

125
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,220
I want to get it at that specific point.

126
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,520
So how do we do that.

127
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,040
Let's zoom in a little and I'll show you what happens.

128
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,860
Let's say they have this graph.

129
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,620
I'll make it big.

130
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,310
So it's very clearly noticeable.

131
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,600
So you have a graph looks like this

132
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,120
right.

133
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,360
And this one just goes on like that.

134
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,130
So again we want to get instantaneous

135
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:12,800
rate of change not average instantaneous.

136
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,380
So like we said a second line touches the graph at two points.

137
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,420
So let's try to get a second line.

138
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,970
From here to here.

139
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,770
OK.

140
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,450
So we have a second line right here.

141
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,750
Let's go ahead and graph it.

142
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,240
Right.

143
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,020
That's not really helping us get to instantaneous right.

144
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,900
It's still average because it's seconds.

145
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,460
However what happens if these two points get closer together.

146
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,270
So let's grab the upper points and bring it a little bit closer.

147
00:12:52,390 --> 00:13:01,190
So instead of being up here it's going to be let's say here.

148
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,750
All right.

149
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,840
That gives us another sequent line.

150
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,590
Interesting.

151
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,730
So we have these two points.

152
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,530
Give us a second line.

153
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,350
But when the point is the closer we get a totally different secret line what happens if the points get

154
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,600
even closer.

155
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,910
So let's say that this other point actually comes down here.

156
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:43,200
Well what's going to happen is we're going to get yet another seek out line.

157
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,390
I know it's a little bit messy but just bear with me.

158
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,410
All right.

159
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,590
So we get the other point.

160
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,880
We get a closer and closer to the other point.

161
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,450
And as you can see we get different segment lines but they're changing in slope.

162
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,800
Right.

163
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,370
So here's the big secret about calculus.

164
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,670
Here's why calculus is amazing.

165
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,140
Check this out as these two points get infinitely closer.

166
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,710
And I'll explain what that is in a minute.

167
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:20,680
Then we get a better approximation of the instantaneous rate of change at this point.

168
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,450
The idea is to get as close as possible as to what is a tangent line.

169
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,380
So at tangent line

170
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:42,250
remember how a second line touches the graph at two points a tangent line touches the graph.

171
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,750
We only one point

172
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:01,910
OK

173
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,460
so the sequence gives you average rate of change then a tangent must give you instantaneous rate of

174
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,230
change.

175
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,630
So for example I'll just redraw this over here.

176
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:30,380
If you want to get the instantaneous rate of change at this point what you need is not a second line

177
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,580
uniting two points at this point and a different one.

178
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:44,020
What you need is a tangent line that touches the graph at exactly what point.

179
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,260
This is it

180
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,630
see how this line only touches the graph at this point.

181
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,630
This is a tangent line.

182
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,500
And the big secret is hope you're ready for this.

183
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:11,090
The slope of this tangent line gives you the instantaneous rate of change at that point.

184
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,470
Let me repeat that once more the slope of the tangent line gives you the instantaneous rate of change

185
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,020
at that point.

186
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,550
Just because it's so important I'll repeat it once again.

187
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:33,100
Remember the slope of this tangent line gives you the instantaneous rate of change at that point.

188
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,890
Now if you're not really aware of what's going on we just found a way to find the rate of change of

189
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,700
a curve right.

190
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,100
You just find a tangent line to that curve at that point and you're good to go.

191
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,990
And to you it might be like OK that's fine it's just math.

192
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,510
But this is an incredible discovery.

193
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,490
This is one of the most amazing things that a human being has covered.

194
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,030
This is incredible.

195
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,870
All right.

196
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,530
The fact that we know that you can get a second line and then get the point closer and closer and closer

197
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,560
until you'll get to a tangent line.

198
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,650
It's just amazing right.

199
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,230
And this is basically the foundation of all calculus and we're going to go into a concept called derivatives

200
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,890
in the next section all right.

201
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,170
For a quick summary.

202
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,260
A linear function has a constant rate of change.

203
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,290
We already saw this a couple of seconds ago.

204
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,630
It's just a straight line.

205
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,770
Now when you get to a curve that's where it gets interesting.

206
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,060
So to get the average rate of change between two points and a curve we use the second line.

207
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,850
Remember the second line touches the graph at two points and again it's not that useful.

208
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:54,070
It's only the average when it gets interesting is as the points of a second line get closer and closer.

209
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,440
It approximates a tangent line.

210
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,950
This is really cool.

211
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
A tangent line touches a graph at only one points.

212
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,070
OK and again this is the big deal.

213
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,570
This is the secret sauce in calculus.

214
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:16,380
The slope of a tangent line is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change at that point.

215
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:25,980
So if you have a curve and it looks something like this and you have this point and you want to find

216
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,790
the rate of change of this point all you need to do is find the slope of the line that's tangent to

217
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,030
that point.

218
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,580
So the slope of this line will give you the rate of change at that specific point.

219
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,920
Beautiful.

220
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,520
All right.

221
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,410
So don't get confused.

222
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,010
Sequent line is for average rate of change

223
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,300
and the tangent

224
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,420
is for instantaneous rate of change which is the really cool one

225
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,050
and obviously the second line touches the graph at two points.

226
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,320
That's why its average is the average change as you go from point one to point to.

227
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,320
So this is two points.

228
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,180
The tangent line however only touches the graph at one point.

229
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:41,840
That's why it gives you an instantaneous rate of change because it is at that specific point right.

230
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:47,810
So pretty cool stuff will formalize this concept in the next section with the derivative.

231
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,090
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
