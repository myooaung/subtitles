1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,130
Pay there what's going on.

2
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,580
Welcome to another session of limit less calculus.

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,460
So we already covered the properties of limits.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,930
Now we're going to go into how to actually solve limits.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,110
OK.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,750
And it's funny because once you know what I'm going to teach you now you don't really need to know the

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,830
properties the property to use.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,260
You know you have to learn how limits work how they can be done.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,430
Maybe your professor wants you to learn them so you can apply them.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,460
However when we do what we're going to do just now which is a quick shortcut to how to find limits then

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,990
you don't really have to use the rules.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:11,460
You only have to do one thing and we'll explore that right now by going straight to our mnemonic.

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,890
OK so here we have our mnemonic and very easy very short very fun.

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,020
It says to find the limb just plug it in.

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,570
Look at that.

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,600
It even rhymes.

17
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,330
What an amazing mnemonic right to find the limb.

18
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,970
Just plug it in.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,000
What does that mean.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:43,970
So for example if you have limits of x squared let's pick a simple one as x approaches three.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,370
So we want to find this limit.

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,600
You know we have the property that says OK you can actually get this too.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,310
And you can leave it on the side and then you're going to get the limit of X as x approaches 3.

24
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,500
Then we have another property that says that the limit of X is just going to be the number that X is

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,070
approaching etc. etc..

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,530
The point is you can forget about all that and to find the limb just plug it in.

27
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:15,200
That means that all you need to do is take this number that your ex is approaching and plug it into

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
your function.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:27,710
So in this case the limit of x squared as x approaches 3 is just that three squared and that is equal

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,620
to 9.

31
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,520
Nine is then the limit of x squared as x approaches 3.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,570
Boom you're done.

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:57,980
All right let's do another example limit of x cubed minus 2 x plus let's say 7 as x approaches 1.

34
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,800
All right.

35
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,290
So define the lim.

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,920
Just plug it in let's grab this one and let's plug it into this function.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,230
I'll just put it in parentheses.

38
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,270
All right.

39
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,450
So we have excuse so that becomes one cubed.

40
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:28,020
Minus two times one right because 2 x becomes two times one plus seven.

41
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,310
So one cube remembers his 1 times 1 times 1 which is just 1.

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,040
Mine is two times one is to plus seven.

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,620
So we have one minus 2 which is minus 1 plus 7 is just 6 and that is your final answer.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,490
See how easy it is to find the limit just plug it in whatever number you are approaching.

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,040
Just plug it into the function for which you are finding the limit.

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,070
Thats it.

47
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,660
Now of course limits are not always that easy.

48
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,630
What if I tell you to find the limit

49
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:32,170
of this function so we have X minus three over x cubed minus nine

50
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,280
as x approaches 3 right.

51
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,580
So again to find the LEM just plug it in we're going to get this three and plug it into this function.

52
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,940
So we have X minus three so that's three minus three on top.

53
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,850
All right so that's going to be zero again a zero on the top is OK on the top of a fraction.

54
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,450
That's not a problem.

55
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,420
The problem is when you have a zero on the bottom so do we have a zero on the bottom.

56
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,380
Let's find out.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,570
So we plug in the three on the bottom that's three squared minus nine equals three minus three on top

58
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,270
is zero.

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,350
And on the bottom we have three square two three times three is nine minus nine.

60
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,860
What do we have here.

61
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,430
Zero over.

62
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,980
What's 9 minus 9 0.

63
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:40,050
Ha again 0 0 is no bueno.

64
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,040
We don't like that.

65
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,310
That's not good what does that mean.

66
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,680
What if you're trying to find the limit of a function and then you get something over 0 or even 0 0.

67
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,640
What happens to the limit then.

68
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,160
Well that means you're going to have to find another way of finding the limit.

69
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,330
You cannot just plug it in.

70
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,390
So depending on the type of function sometimes you're going to have to apply some tricks in order to

71
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,340
find limits.

72
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,280
It's not always going to be to find the LEM just plug it in.

73
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,920
However the first thing you're always going to try whenever you're finding a limit is to find the limb

74
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,240
and plug it in.

75
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,380
If you get a zero in the denominator in the bottom part then you have a problem.

76
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,310
So for example in this one here limit of x squared there's no denominator it's just x squared right.

77
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,110
That's not even a fraction.

78
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,710
Therefore the limit is just plug it in.

79
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,680
Same thing for the second one.

80
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,920
There's no denominator in this function.

81
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,040
And therefore you can just plug it in and this one we do have a denominator.

82
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,340
So we have to plug it in and check if it gives as a 0 on the bottom.

83
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,740
And I'll repeat that again.

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,640
The zero on top is OK the zero on the bottom is not OK.

85
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,080
So the fact that we get zero on top here no problem zero on the bottom.

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Then you have a problem.

87
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,090
So whenever you plug in a limit and you apply the mnemonic to find the limb just plug it in and you

88
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,840
get a 0 on the bottom.

89
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,880
You need to find a different method.

90
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,980
So for this limit you need to find

91
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,350
a different method.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,010
For finding the limit.

93
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,160
So there are a couple of tricks that we can use one of them is factorization which is something that

94
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,580
we'll cover in a couple of problems.

95
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,200
You can also do something called rationalization and that's something else I will see in the problems

96
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,160
as well.

97
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,880
But the point I want you to go away with for this specific mnemonic is that whenever you get a limit

98
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,570
you always have to try to plug in the number into the function.

99
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,610
That's the first thing always that you're going to try.

100
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,450
All right.

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:15,120
So this is first thing to try.

102
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,420
By the way we really haven't covered that much.

103
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,360
The limit from the left and from the right.

104
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,390
We did a little bit in a different section but we have a section just for that coming up.

105
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:31,180
So we're finding this limit of x squared as x approaches 3 that is both from the left and from the right.

106
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,370
So this is a general limit.

107
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,580
This is not specifically from the left nor specifically from the right.

108
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,610
OK.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,039
When you're finding the limits from the right on the left hand you cannot just plug it in because the

110
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,410
limit from the left might be different from the limit from the right.

111
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,110
But again it really depends on the type of function.

112
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,970
All right but if you have just a generic limit then you can just go ahead and plug it in like we did

113
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,570
in these three examples and the first example in the second example we got numbers that's perfect.

114
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:10,490
And the third example we got a zero in the bottom again let me mark this so that you know it's in the

115
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,640
bottom and it's not necessarily the one on top is the one on the bottom that's the one giving problems.

116
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,450
So we need to find a different method for this one.

117
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,390
And again we'll cover that in a couple of different problems.

118
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,360
Just remember to find the limb.

119
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,300
Just plug it in.

120
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,020
OK so we really saw an example where plugging in the limit gives us a denominator of zero.

121
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:56,300
And one of the things that we can do whenever we get a denominator of 0 is to do some factorization.

122
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:04,640
So what does factorization so remember to factor something is to grab the terms though when you multiply

123
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,650
give you that results.

124
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,420
For example if I want to factor the number nine I'll do it on the right here.

125
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:20,840
One effect of the number nine number nine can be a combination of for example three times three three

126
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:36,740
and three are the factors of nine factors of 10 are two and five for example and the factors of 20 or

127
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:49,310
four and five because four times five is twenty and you can break down the factors of this for two to

128
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,030
and two because two times two is four.

129
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,970
So again you're just getting a result and you're seeing how the result was produced.

130
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,150
So let's go back to our other limit.

131
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,430
We just tried doing where we try to find the limit by plugging it in and it didn't work out.

132
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,590
So we had a limit of X minus three over

133
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,770
x squared.

134
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,950
Mine is 9 as x approaches 3.

135
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,490
So again we can quickly see what I need to do it again.

136
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,500
That if we take this three and we plug it in the bottom it's going to be three squared minus nine.

137
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,340
And that's going to be nine minus nine is going to be equal to zero.

138
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,900
So what can we do to this function to manipulate it so that it's actually not in this form but in a

139
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,570
different form.

140
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,850
So it's as we write it down here.

141
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,330
Limit of.

142
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,550
OK.

143
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,570
So how can we rewrite this function so that when we plug in three it doesn't give us 0.

144
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:22,980
Well we're going to factor using something called the difference of squares.

145
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:33,130
And this says basically that if you have something in this form A to the second power mine is beat to

146
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,660
the second power.

147
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,940
So you have something squared.

148
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,910
Mine is something else squared.

149
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,700
Then you can factor that into

150
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,430
a plus b times a minus B.

151
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,800
All right.

152
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,710
So that's one of the ways that we can factor

153
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,510
and you probably have seen this before maybe you don't remember but I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere.

154
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,130
If you don't remember or if you don't know it or if it seems weird Don't worry about it.

155
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,450
We'll do a couple of examples with this same rule.

156
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:13,920
All right.

157
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:19,000
But again it's a difference of squares and it makes sense that that would be the name because you have

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,900
a difference.

159
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,530
So remember you're subtracting of two things that are squared a squared minus the square.

160
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,790
So can you see this over here.

161
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,910
Where do you have a difference of squares.

162
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,700
You have a difference of squares in the denominator.

163
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,180
Right.

164
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:43,010
So let's just put the numerator again the top X minus three.

165
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,180
And let's factor out this x squared.

166
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,050
Minus nine.

167
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,740
Because again we have a difference of squares.

168
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,700
So it says that A-squared minus B squared is a plus b times a minus B.

169
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,370
So what would be your a.

170
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:06,390
In this case our A would be X right because X is a first term and it's the term that's being squared

171
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:21,530
so it says that X is going to be first here and then here so it's going to be something like this x

172
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,150
something times x something else right.

173
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,600
Because X is what a represent over here what's going to be our B.

174
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,510
Well you might say or B is going to be nine but that's not true.

175
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:40,970
Why.

176
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:49,780
Because remember B's being squared so B is a term so that when you square it you get nine.

177
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,150
It's not going to be 9 itself.

178
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,360
So what is the square root of nine.

179
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,910
You know this already square root of nine is three.

180
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:11,050
OK so 3 is our A B in this case and again and the first term here and the factoring we do plus B.

181
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,340
So we do plus three.

182
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:26,990
And finally in the second term we do a minus B which becomes X minus 3.

183
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:33,320
So again all we're doing is we're saying OK we had X squared minus nine we want to factor that.

184
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,820
First we have to identify our A which is X and R B which is 3.

185
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,890
And then just put it in this form a plus b times a minus B.

186
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,740
That's what we did explode three times X minus three as x approaches 3.

187
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,980
Now something interesting happens because you have X minus three on top.

188
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,560
And you have X plus three times X minus three and bottom because these two are multiplying.

189
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,250
You can simply cancel out the X minus 3 that's on top with the one that's on the bottom.

190
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:19,780
So you can just cross X minus three and you can cross X minus three both in the top and in the bottom.

191
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,970
So when you do that what happens.

192
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,180
We have limits of

193
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,740
well in the top.

194
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,670
We don't have anything.

195
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:40,060
So it just becomes one line over and on the bottom we only have now x plus three

196
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,960
as x approaches 3.

197
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,430
And now that we have it in a different form.

198
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,110
What do we do to find the limb.

199
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,810
Just plug it in.

200
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,280
So at this point we're just going to plug in this three into this function.

201
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:17,569
And that becomes one over we plug in at three into the X three plus three equals 1 over 6.

202
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:28,130
That is your limit so see how we went from a limit that gave us 0 over 0 to an actual number.

203
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:34,180
That just tells you that sometimes you can just find a way just plug it in.

204
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,350
You have to factor this or you have to do something else to it so that it becomes the same function.

205
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,820
But in a different form and then you can just plug in your three of course.

206
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,550
Difference of squares is just one example of how you can factor a function in order to get a different

207
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,540
form.

208
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:00,660
Once we get to the problems we'll see other types of factoring that you can do and that you will encounter.

209
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,980
So it's definitely great practice to just go ahead and try out some problems which we'll do after this

210
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,540
lesson.

211
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:12,850
And solving limits is over.
