WEBVTT
1
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.230
OK.

2
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.680
So here we have the demonic for the product rule.

3
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:31.030
And you might look at it and say OK product that take you to please repeat outer.

4
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.420
What does that mean.

5
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.190
Well what it means is that it's going to simplify your life a lot in remembering the practical.

6
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.780
Nobody wants to think about you know derivative of the first times a second.

7
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.070
Plus the first time is a derivative of the seconds.

8
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.220
That's just complicated.

9
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.010
Right.

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.910
So that's why we have this mnemonic.

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.120
So the way to remember the mnemonic is OK you're doing a product.

12
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.760
OK.

13
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.900
So you're going to grab the first three letters of the word product which is pro p r o and this Pyrrho

14
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
stands for plays repeats and then outre.

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.540
Let's see that in practice again we have our generic function f of x and it is a product of two other

16
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.910
functions g of x and h of X

17
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.670
so we want to find the derivative of f of x

18
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.230
Now when we say please repeat.

19
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.550
What does that mean.

20
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.330
Well what that means is that you're going to do the following.

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.710
You're going to take this product that you see here and you're going to place it twice.

22
00:01:47.820 --> 00:02:05.720
So you're going to say g of X Age of X and again g of x h of x.

23
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
And remember that when you're doing products then the derivatives are adding.

24
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.540
Right.

25
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.180
Very important.

26
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.500
So what do we do.

27
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.490
We place the repeats.

28
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180
We have two repeats.

29
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.920
First we have g of x h of X and then we repeat it again here g g of X an H of X and then we put a plus

30
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.020
sign in between.

31
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.320
Now we have one more step which is the outers.

32
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.020
Well think of it like this.

33
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.600
We have g of X age of x x x x.

34
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.670
You can think of this as four different functions right.

35
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.200
And.

36
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.910
So all you're going to do is you're simply going to get the derivative of the outer ones.

37
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.070
So you're going to get the derivative of g of X and you're going to get the derivative of age of x.

38
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.790
That's it.

39
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.730
There you have your formula for the product rule.

40
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:11.650
And again it's the same thing we have talked about derivative of the first times the second plus the

41
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.540
first times the derivative of the second.

42
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.430
So again how do you use the mnemonic you're just going to place your repeats.

43
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.770
You're going to grab you know this product and you're going to put it here and you're going to put it

44
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.320
here again you're going to put a plus sign in between them and then you're going to get the derivative

45
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.310
of the outer functions which are g of X over here and H of X over here.

46
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:50.180
Let's see that working out in an actual example.

47
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.130
So it was 2 3 x to 10 times 5 x 5.

48
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.360
OK.

49
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.360
So these two functions are multiplying and we want to get the derivative edge of x sorry of f of x.

50
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.100
OK.

51
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:18.180
So again product which is then a monic PR O pro stands for place repeats again plays repeats means we're

52
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.490
going to grab these two functions and we're going to just rewrite them again twice.

53
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:41.750
Three x 10 5 x 5 3 x 10 5 x 5 again remember we have to put a plus sign in between.

54
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.000
And finally we do the derivative of the outer.

55
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.710
This is the outer and this is the other outer.

56
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.190
So you might be asking yourself how do we know that these are the outers.

57
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.710
Well again think of it like this.

58
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.490
You have one function a second one third one and a fourth.

59
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.670
The outer ones are the first.

60
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.860
This one and the last one.

61
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.350
OK.

62
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.210
So those are your outer functions.

63
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.220
And after this we just pretty much continue the calculation.

64
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.190
So now we know that we need to get the derivative of the outer So this first one here and this last

65
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.910
one.

66
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.150
Let's go ahead and proceed and do that.

67
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.400
So the derivative of three x to the 10 will constant multiple because we have a number of multiplying

68
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.880
we bring down a dictator 3x.

69
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.780
I'm sorry we bring down our dictator which is 10 x and then we substitute a less powerful leader.

70
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:57.020
So that's 10 minus one is 9 and we multiply that by 5 x to the 5.

71
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.230
So now we have this have done.

72
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.820
Now we're going to keep going.

73
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.710
We're going to say plus which is this plus over here.

74
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.220
And we're going to do this part.

75
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:15.970
That's going to be 3 x 10 times OK derivative of this.

76
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.240
Well constant multiples so we have five times and then we bring down our dictator which is another 5

77
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.960
5 x substitute by a less powerful leader.

78
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.670
That's a four.

79
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.800
All right.

80
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.210
All we need to do now is simplify and we will be done.

81
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.760
Let's continue down here.

82
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.080
All right.

83
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.410
So we have three times 10 is 30 30 times 5 is 150

84
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.750
x 2 the.

85
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.540
Well remember that if we have X to the M times x to the end we just add the exponents.

86
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:08.360
So in this case it's going to be X to the nine times x 2 The 5 is X to the 14 because 9 plus 5 is 14

87
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.150
plus.

88
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:18.340
And now we do the other half which is three times five is 15 and 15 times five is 75.

89
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.480
Again my 7.

90
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.340
My goodness.

91
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.790
It was really bad.

92
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.900
All right.

93
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:37.100
OK so now we have 75 and again what we do here is we just pretty much multiply the axes so x to the

94
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:46.000
tenth times x to the fourth is X to the 14th.

95
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.310
And again we can do one more simplifying step because these two terms.

96
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:58.020
A hundred and fifty to the 14th and seventy five x the 14th have the same x to the 14th.

97
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.500
We can just add the coefficients.

98
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:07.460
In other words add these numbers the 150 plus the 75 and keep the x or the 14th.

99
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.260
So 150 plus 75 is to 25

100
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.660
x to the 14th

101
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.580
and that is our final answer.

102
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:31.560
OK so quickly all we did was we use the product rule because we have two functions that were multiplying

103
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.230
the product rule.

104
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.320
We have our mnemonic which is Parow the first three letters play repeat so we grab the 3 x 10 and the

105
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.180
5 x to the 5 and we write them out twice.

106
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.130
That's placing your repeats.

107
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.500
Remember we put a plus sign in between those repeats.

108
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.660
And finally we go ahead and get the derivative of the out-of function.

109
00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.210
So that's going to be this function here and this function here.

110
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.700
All right.

111
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.100
The order functions are just the first and the last.

112
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:11.060
And then we'll just calculate and simplify and that's how we get our answer.

113
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.010
And that's pretty much it for our product will.

114
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.720
We're going to get lots of practice with the product we'll do not worry about it if it doesn't make

115
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.290
sense.

116
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.940
You can just watch the video again try to make sense of what the mnemonic means and what placing repeat

117
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.320
and getting the derivative of the outer means.

118
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.020
But again we'll get a lot of practice to make sure that you know this and that it's in your head and

119
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.660
that you know how to do it well.

120
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.330
OK.

121
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.110
So one more thing I wanted to mention before we go on is.

122
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.230
OK so the product rule actually applies when you have two functions multiplying right.

123
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.000
But what happens when you have more than two.

124
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.270
So let's say that after VAX is equal to g of X..

125
00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:08.530
Sorry about that g of X times h of X times I have X now we have three functions that are multiplying

126
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.410
G H and I.

127
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.980
How do we get the derivative of this.

128
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:18.430
Well you could extend the Prora rule and you could use it for three functions.

129
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.490
Now that is tedious.

130
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.150
That's adding more work.

131
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.550
How about this.

132
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.410
What you can do is you can just say you can just rewrite

133
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.950
this function and you can group for example g and h as one function.

134
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.780
And then I add the other function.

135
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:55.820
So you could say something like g of x h of X as one and then that multiplied by X at the end of the

136
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.490
day it's really the same thing because there are still all of a multiplying.

137
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.960
But by doing this you can actually apply the same product rule that we know in which we have remember

138
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:13.670
our Monnick Pro we place our repeats and then we do the derivative of the outer function.

139
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.390
Quick example

140
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:31.670
of X equals x squared 3 x to 3 4 x to the 4.

141
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.530
So we have three functions that are multiplying two squared three x cubed and for X to the fourth power.

142
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.260
So how do we do this.

143
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.970
Well we can simply regroup this.

144
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.030
And in fact we'll do it on the side here.

145
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:59.260
And we'll say that these two first two to x squared 3 x 3

146
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.840
times 4 x to the fourth power.

147
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:13.660
And in fact now that these are grouped we can actually multiply them together so they become one function

148
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.230
and then they multiply this function

149
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:31.080
of x equals two times three is six and again we can just add our exponents because we have x squared

150
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.460
times execute.

151
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.190
That's X to the 5 because two plus three is five.

152
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.100
Right.

153
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.720
So this became 6 x to the 5 right.

154
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:49.270
And then we just multiply by our third function which we left all by itself.

155
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.020
For X to the fourth guess what.

156
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.640
Now we have two functions right.

157
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.840
We have six x to the fifth and four x to the fourth power.

158
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.080
So now we can just go ahead and apply our product rule.

159
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.580
As usual you know we just place the.

160
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.880
Let me do it quickly here.

161
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.490
Derivative of f x we place our repeats.

162
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.090
So 6 x to the.

163
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:25.150
For x for we it again 6 x to the.

164
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.300
For x to the four.

165
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.870
We put a plus sign.

166
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.670
And don't forget the outer.

167
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:38.880
So we get the derivative of the first and the last

168
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.840
derivative of the first.

169
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:49.400
It's six times the dictator that comes down six times five is 30 x.

170
00:13:49.440 --> 00:14:02.900
Subtract 1 from the exponent four times for X to the four which is this plus 6 x to the.

171
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.580
Again we get the derivative of this.

172
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.590
It's constant multiples of four.

173
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.860
We bring down a dictator that's a 4 x 6.

174
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.120
Substitute for one of less power that's had three.

175
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.580
And then we just simplify you know 30 times for is 120

176
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.450
x or the fourth times X or the fourth is X to the eight

177
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:44.120
plus six times 4 is 24 24 times for what we have 20 times for is 80 and four times for 16.

178
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.960
So that's 96 and then we just again multiply the X's.

179
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:59.400
So X of the five times X to that 3 is X to the 8.

180
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.980
And then we have X to the eighth on both terms.

181
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.450
So we can simplify and add these together.

182
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.250
So that's going to give us one.

183
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:20.360
It's 120 plus 96 that's going to give us 200 plus 16 that's 216 X to the 8.

184
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.780
And that is our final answer.

185
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:31.860
So again see how easy it is to just combine functions here and multiply them together until you have

186
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.790
two.

187
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.390
So you get into this form and that's when you apply the product will that we already know how to use.

188
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.640
So you can use this trick wherever you want.

189
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.550
You don't have to remember anything else more about the product rule.

190
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:51.180
Just simplify until it's two functions and then use our mnemonic pro place repeats and then do the outer

191
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.620
oh ok perfect.

192
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.850
So now let's go over a summary of what we just covered in the product rule.

193
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:06.450
So first of all the product rule is used to find the derivative products multiplications of functions.

194
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.110
Remember that our product is a result of a multiplication.

195
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.410
So whenever we have functions multiplying you're going to have to use the product rule.

196
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:23.030
Also very important remember that the derivative of a product is not the product of the derivatives.

197
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.590
OK.

198
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.460
This is critical when you see two functions multiplying I don't think you can get the derivative of

199
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.440
the first and the derivative of the second and then multiply them together.

200
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.810
That's not going to work.

201
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.010
Instead you have to use the product well the way it is meant to be used.

202
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:48.000
So the product rule says the derivative of the first times the second function plus the first function

203
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.700
times a derivative of the second.

204
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.320
Again it's like a tongue twister.

205
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.000
We don't want to remember that we want something easier.

206
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.730
And that's where the money comes in.

207
00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:03.090
The mnemonic is pro which are the first three letters of product.

208
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.760
OK.

209
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:13.710
So mnemonic says for pro is place repeats and derivatives of outer place repeats just means that if

210
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:21.420
you have two functions multiplying and let's call these g of x and h of X

211
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.270
then you're going to have to actually write them twice.

212
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.630
Just like we did in the examples

213
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.280
and put a plus sign in between them.

214
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.740
OK.

215
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:43.380
So we have giove of x h of X plus same thing g of x h of X that that is the place repeats.

216
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.930
And then we have the last step of the mnemonic which is the outer.

217
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.990
So we just apply the prime to the outer functions.

218
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.800
The outer is this first and this last.

219
00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.410
So we put a prime here to signify a derivative and we put a prime here to say derivative.

220
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.050
And this giftes is what we have here.

221
00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.410
But you know remembering it this way is a lot more complicated.

222
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.790
Now we have derivative of first times the second plus first time derivative of second.

223
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.970
That is our Parow mnemonic.

224
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.560
And finally if you need to find the derivative of a product of more than two functions.

225
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.870
So if you're multiplying three functions for functions five functions you can actually group them so

226
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.870
that they become only two functions.

227
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:40.580
And then you apply pro because again the mnemonic that we have Parow pretty much works with two functions.

228
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:46.070
And remember that the way to group several functions is for example if you have three functions that

229
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.150
are multiplying.

230
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.210
You grab the first and the second you multiply them together.

231
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:58.390
And all of a sudden now you have the first and second together which becomes function number one times.

232
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.590
The third function which becomes function number two.

233
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:08.660
And again if this is a little shaky if I'm saying too much that you're not getting to not worry we'll

234
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.370
cover a lot of these problems in the practice problem section.

235
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.200
But this is it for the product rule.

236
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.020
And I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
