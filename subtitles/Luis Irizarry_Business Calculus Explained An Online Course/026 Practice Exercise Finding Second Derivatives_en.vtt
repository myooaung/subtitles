00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.760
All right so let's go ahead and do a couple of exercises using second derivatives.

2
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.160
So this says find f double prime of x.

3
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.720
So the second derivative if f of x equals x cute.

4
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
That's a pretty simple one and you should be able to get it with no problem.

5
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.710
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.040
All right.

7
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.250
So let's go ahead and do it together.

8
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.140
So of course we're finding the second derivative.

9
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.890
The first thing that we need to do is to find the first derivative.

10
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.450
Right so let's apply our mnemonic.

11
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.390
We bring our dictator down.

12
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.700
That's.

13
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.100
Three then x.

14
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.170
By a less powerful leader.

15
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.180
That gives us a two on top.

16
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.810
So now that we have the first derivative we need to get the derivative of this first derivative to get

17
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.840
the second derivative.

18
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.680
So the second derivative will be

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.510
the derivative of 3 x squared.

20
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.420
So we have a constant multiple.

21
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.650
So we put it on the side we bring down a dictator which is a two X and less powerful leader is a 1.

22
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.280
But we don't market.

23
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.030
So it's three times two x equals 6 x.

24
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.170
And this is it 6 x is our second derivative for f of x equals execute.

25
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.160
We are done.

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.760
All right.

27
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.370
So here we have our second example for second derivatives.

28
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:11.450
It says Find have doubled prime of X if f of x equals x to the fourth minus for execute plus 10 x squared

29
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.140
minus 7 next plus a thousand and one.

30
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.440
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

31
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.590
All right.

32
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.970
So let's go ahead and do this one together.

33
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.000
This one is a little bit longer than the other one but same concept.

34
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
First we're going to find the first derivative.

35
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.730
So the big picture is that we have a bunch of terms and they're separated by plus and minuses.

36
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.190
So remember what we do is we grab the derivative of each term and we keep the sign.

37
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.260
That's pretty much it.

38
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.210
So let's start with x to the fourth derivative of x to the fourth.

39
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.820
We bring down a dictator and X substitute by a less powerful leader.

40
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.950
So that's a three mynahs derivative of four executes.

41
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:17.060
So we have a constant multiple of four brings on our dictator which is a 3 X and less powerful leader

42
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.490
is a 2.

43
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.760
Moving on we have plus constant multiple here so that's 10.

44
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.910
And we bring down a dictator which is a 2 x less powerful leader is a 1.

45
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.970
So we don't market minus constant multiple here seven times.

46
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.160
And then we bring down a dictator for the ax which is just one and less powerful leader which is a zero.

47
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.510
And then plus the derivative of a constant which is zero.

48
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.170
So let's simplify this one here.

49
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.030
So we have four execute that one doesn't change.

50
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.110
Mine is four times three is 12.

51
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.020
X squared.

52
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:21.010
Plus 10 times to is Taurani X minus.

53
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.810
Remember that one times X to 0 is 1 right.

54
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.450
This whole thing is one because X to the zero is one.

55
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.950
In other words anything to the zero power is one.

56
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.220
So we have 1 times 1 and then we have seven times as this.

57
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.370
But this is one.

58
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.450
So seven times one is just seven.

59
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.740
All right.

60
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.210
And we forget about the 0 because it doesn't do anything.

61
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.250
This is our first derivative to get the second derivative which is get the derivative of this first

62
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.590
row of it of.

63
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.230
All right.

64
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.010
So let's get the derivative for x cubed.

65
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.850
So a constant multiple of four.

66
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.320
We put it on the side.

67
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:16.740
We bring our dictator down which is 3 x less powerful leader is a two minus constant multiple of 12

68
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.020
times.

69
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:30.380
We bring down a dictator which is a two X and we don't mark the exponent because it's a 1 plus constant

70
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.950
multiple which is 20.

71
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.310
We bring down a dictator on the X..

72
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:47.350
So that's 1 times X less powerful leader to the 0 minus the derivative of a constant which is zero.

73
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.510
And let's go ahead and simplify once more

74
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.390
so four times three is 12 x squared.

75
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:12.200
Mine is 12 times 2 is 24 x plus.

76
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:20.860
And here remember that X to 0 is 1 1 times 1 is 1 and 20 times one is 20.

77
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.430
All right so this whole thing is one.

78
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.530
So plus 20.

79
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.560
And at this point we are done.

80
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:38.260
This right here is our second derivative of the prime of X equals 12 x squared minus 24 x plus 20.

81
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.370
That is our final answer.

82
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.920
So like I said this problem was a little bit longer than the other one but the concept is the same to

83
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.010
find the second derivative of f of x we find the first derivative and then we get the derivative of

84
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.450
that first derivative which gives us our second derivative.
