00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.130
OK Guys welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.060
Today we're going to uncover the constant multiple rule there should be a short lesson as this is a

3
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.250
very easy thing to learn.

4
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.010
Again it's called the constant multiple rule not to be confused with a constant rule.

5
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.830
You might be thinking oh my god.

6
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.900
Another constant derivative rule.

7
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.950
It's very easy and you'll see how it's different from the constant rule.

8
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.380
So nothing to fear.

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.890
All right so quickly what is a constant.

10
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.520
Again remember a constant is something that doesn't change.

11
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.880
So for example of constants.

12
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.240
I'll put a couple of numbers here.

13
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.960
For example 5 is a constant because it is a number and 5 is always equal to 5 right.

14
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.270
In the same way sevens are constant 13.

15
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.060
Negative pi.

16
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.930
All these numbers are constants because they never ever change.

17
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:33.680
So we discussed the power rule in the last section in which we can have something like f of x equals

18
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.840
x to the 3 right now.

19
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.850
What happens if we take this x to the 3 and we multiply it by a constant by number.

20
00:01:47.960 --> 00:02:02.450
So let's say we have a new function g of X and that's equal to let's say 5 times X to 3.

21
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.910
So 5 x to the 3.

22
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.990
Remember that 5 and the exit 3 are multiplying.

23
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.419
There's nothing in between.

24
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.350
That means they are actually multiplying.

25
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.040
So now we have x two or three times five.

26
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.700
Well the question is how do we get the derivative of something like this 5 x to 3.

27
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.140
Well we already know how to get the derivative of x to the 3 right.

28
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.920
So the derivative of x to the 3.

29
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.610
And again this is for this one.

30
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.120
Well again we say that we can apply the power rule so remember dictator rule where the theory comes

31
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.040
down or dictator is taken down.

32
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.120
We keep the X and we're substituted by a last powerful leader.

33
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:04.270
So that's three minus one is equal to 3 x squared or to the two.

34
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.850
Right so that is when we have X to the three by itself.

35
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:19.150
What happens when we have 5 x 2 or 3 or by that matter any constant multiplying another function.

36
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.500
How do we get the derivative of that.

37
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.050
Well that's where the constant multiple rule comes in.

38
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.340
Let's check it out.

39
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.490
OK so here we have a constant multiple rule and it reads the derivative of a constant times.

40
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.570
A function equals the constant times a derivative of the function.

41
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.540
What a tongue twister right.

42
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.880
Let me repeat that again.

43
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.050
The derivative of a constant times a function equals constant times the derivative of the function.

44
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.390
So let's quickly apply that rule and you'll see how easy it is.

45
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.340
So let's go back to our example where g of X equals five

46
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:16.019
x cubed So here we have a constant which is 5 and we have x cubed which is the function right.

47
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:27.140
So we have a derivative of five times x cubed a constant times a function and just to just to be clear

48
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.110
G of x is equal to the multiplication of this constant times another function.

49
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.360
So the function of x is a composition of 5 times execute right.

50
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.460
So we go back to a rule which says the derivative of a constant times a function equals a constant times

51
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.180
the derivative of the function.

52
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:56.370
So a derivative of g of X equals the constant.

53
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.120
So 5 again times the derivative of the function.

54
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.490
So the derivative of execute what is a derivative of x cubed.

55
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:16.390
Again we have our dictator mnemonic which says we're going to bring down the three our dictator and

56
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.550
keep our X and we're going to subtract one from 3.

57
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.310
Like we know it's substituting our leader for a new less powerful leader.

58
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.350
That is three minus one is two.

59
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.200
Let's simplify.

60
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.570
Can we simplify this.

61
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.600
Well it's very easy.

62
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.660
You can multiply the numbers right because they're all multiplying.

63
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.350
So 5 times 3 is 15

64
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.350
and then you just keep the x squared.

65
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.640
That's it.

66
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.180
That is a constant multiple rule applied to another problem.

67
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.860
Let's say that each of X

68
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:12.870
equals seven x to the tenth power well again the constant multiple rule applies because we have a constant

69
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.890
multiplying a function.

70
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.590
OK.

71
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.220
So let's get the derivative of this

72
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.950
again which is keep a constant on the outside.

73
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.740
Do we apply the power rule here.

74
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.460
Because as a power function.

75
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:39.570
So we bring down a dictator 10 x and we struck one from the exponent.

76
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.720
Finally we simplify seven times 10 is 70

77
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.340
X to the ninth.

78
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.690
How easy it is.

79
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.500
It is absolutely critical that you know this.

80
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.180
But again it's also very easy to apply.

81
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.300
So again just to summarize we have a constant multiplying a function.

82
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.410
We keep that concept outside.

83
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.530
We do the derivative of the function and then we multiply everything together.

84
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.330
OK.

85
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.670
And to finish up we have our summary.

86
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.380
So first of all sometimes functions have constants multiplying them in front.

87
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.710
Again something like 3 x cubed is the constant three multiplying x.

88
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.990
Cute For those cases we use a constant multiple rule the constant multiple rules of the derivative of

89
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.290
a constant equals constant times the derivative of the function.

90
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.660
So again you put the constant aside you get the derivative of the function and then you multiply everything

91
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.980
together again like I said there's really no mnemonic here.

92
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.460
I don't want to confuse this with the constant rule in this case.

93
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.740
Whenever you see a constant multiplying a function just put a constant aside and multiplied back with

94
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.600
the derivative of the function.

95
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.380
Finally do not confuse with a constant function which is just f a vac equals a number and as a quick

96
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.890
refresher.

97
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:24.780
So for example here you would do the concert rule when you have a vaccine called 3 or f of x equals

98
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.080
7 or f of x equals negative 1.

99
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.809
These are all numbers right.

100
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.919
So these are all constant functions.

101
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.880
Here the Y is always 3.

102
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.740
Here the Y is always 7.

103
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.980
And here the Y is always negative 1 on the other hand for the constant multiple rule.

104
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:58.970
It's call that C and R here you would use a constant multiple rule for example 2 x 5.

105
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.350
This is not a constant function.

106
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.070
Why.

107
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.300
Because it's not equal to a number.

108
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.750
It's equal to a number of times x to the five.

109
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:17.030
No other example would be negative 3 x to the tenth.

110
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.270
Again you're multiplying a number times a function.

111
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.260
And one more example.

112
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.150
Negative 2 x 2 the negative 1.

113
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.750
So again see the difference constant rule.

114
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.620
We only have a number constant multiple rule.

115
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.800
We have a number times a function that's pretty much it.

116
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.800
I'll see you guys in the next tutorial.
