1
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,990
OK so here's a little more formal definition of what I just talked about.

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm calling it the input output relationship.

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,600
That's not a thing.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,560
I just made that up.

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,409
But it helps you remember exactly what it is.

6
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,180
So is that a function only has one output for every input.

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,590
This is very important.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,200
For example if you have a TiVo like this

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:51,300
where you have X input and here you have your y output if you have for example that.

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,380
So when you plug it in three it gives you five.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,420
And then when you plug in three it gives you 10 well that doesn't make a lot of sense right.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,690
Because for one input you can only have one output when I plug in three.

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,090
It gives me 5.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,650
It cannot be that when I plug in 3 It also gives me 10 sometimes five sometimes 10.

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,720
No that doesn't work.

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,440
This is not a function.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,160
OK.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,500
Again a function can only have one output for every input.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:35,230
Going back to the washing machine if you wash your red shirt with the Turgeon on Monday you will get

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,620
a red shirt back right.

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,910
It's going to be clean but it's going to be still the same red shirt if you wash your red shirt again

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,270
on Thursday.

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,230
Are you going to get your green pants back.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,240
Of course you won't.

25
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,630
You will get your same red shirt.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,850
So for each dirty clothing item that you wash will get the same item.

27
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,180
Now clean that is not going to change.

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,830
That is why when you have an input you cannot have different outputs.

29
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,500
It's always going to be related to one output and one output only.

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,460
OK.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,690
So that's pretty much it for an intro to functions.

32
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,090
Now let's go over a summary of what we just covered.

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,640
OK so a quick summary of what we just covered.

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,420
A function is a machine that takes an input does something to it and returns an output functions are

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,110
pretty much washing machines.

36
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,300
And so whenever you see a function I want you to think of a washing machine.

37
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,820
So how are they similar.

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,230
Well in the washing machine the input is dirty clothes.

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:49,150
The processes that you apply to that dirty clothes washing and the output is clean clothes functions

40
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,400
typically have a form y equals f of x even though they could be other letters and when y equals f of

41
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,380
x x is the input and Y is the output.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,700
If you're having problems remembering which one is X which ones y.

43
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,860
Think of it like this.

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,140
X is input

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:25,970
Y is output so if you organize them in an alphabetical order then X comes before a Y and I comes before.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Oh right.

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,030
So X and input both are first in the alphabet then y and output.

48
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,390
Therefore you know that x belongs to input and Y.

49
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,100
Is output right.

50
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,070
Alphabetical order again X is before Y is before 0.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,590
All right.

52
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,890
And finally a function always has 1 output only for every input.

53
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,670
OK.

54
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,010
You can plug in a number into a function and sometimes get one result and some other times get a different

55
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,630
result for every input.

56
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,570
There's always only going to be one output.

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,340
All right.

58
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,020
So hopefully that wasn't too bad.

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,570
Those are functions again.

60
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,890
They are a foundation for calculus and we'll see them over and over again in every single problem that

61
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,750
we're going to do.

62
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,190
Once again thank you for being here.

63
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,650
Welcome to the tutorial and I'll see you in the next one.
