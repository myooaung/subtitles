00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.900
All right.

2
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
So let's go into a quick summary of our favorite new rule the chain rule.

3
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.570
All right.

4
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.780
So a composition of functions is one function plugged into another.

5
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.560
We did a couple of examples of this at the beginning of the session.

6
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.520
Then we have the chain rule is used to find the derivative of a composition of functions.

7
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.290
So whenever you have one function inside of another and you want to find the derivative of that composition

8
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.580
that's when you use the chain rule and remember the name kind of says it.

9
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.620
A chain has pieces of metal linked to one another in the same way.

10
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.280
When you have a composition of functions you have one function linked to another right.

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.370
Next we have that you need to use the chain rule when you have a function wrapped inside another function

12
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.570
which is another way of saying when you have a composition of functions and here I say except for x

13
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.510
by itself.

14
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.370
And again we show it a couple of different examples of when you do not need to use the chain rule.

15
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.780
So for example if I tell you find the derivative of x to the tenth do you need the chain rule.

16
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.260
Obviously you don't because the inner function in this case is just x.

17
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.660
So here we can apply the typical power rule.

18
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.500
You know we bring our dictator down and we substitute a less powerful leader.

19
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.860
All right so this one takes no Chandru.

20
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.860
But what if I told you I mean the derivative of x to the third minus 5 x squared

21
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.530
plus 33 all of this to the tenth power.

22
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.160
Well here the game changes because now you have this function right.

23
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.090
This long function that's not x by itself but execute minus 5 x squared plus 33 and you're taking that

24
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.040
to the tenth power.

25
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.970
So here you have your inner function and then the outer function tells you get the inner function and

26
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.800
take it to the tenth power.

27
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.170
Right.

28
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.280
So for this one we would need to use the chain rule and in general if you do not know if you need to

29
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.160
use the chain rule.

30
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.230
Well ask yourself Is there an inner function.

31
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.710
So in the first example we just did here X to the tenth the inner function quote unquote is just x.

32
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.560
But remember we have x by itself.

33
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.890
That's not fun that's just standard right.

34
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.790
However in this one is there an inner function.

35
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.740
You bet.

36
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.620
Here it is.

37
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.100
It's this thing inside and it's being wrapped around by this other function which takes it to the tenth

38
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.920
power.

39
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.460
All right.

40
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.680
And we have our crazy mnemonic for this UTX ugly daily X-Box.

41
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.480
I totally know you're enjoying this mnemonic.

42
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.470
Come on I know you like it.

43
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:22.130
And again the idea is you do X which gives you the three steps to solve a chain rule problem.

44
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.820
And again just by looking at this you dx that should tell you right there that you need to find you.

45
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.890
You'll find the derivatives and then you put in terms of X..

46
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.760
So first step 1 we said you equal to the inner function.

47
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.310
And in this case for example x cubed minus 5 x squared plus 33.

48
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.340
That's it.

49
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.780
This is the inner function first step to which again is the most tricky of this chain rule.

50
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.700
Remember that we have to do

51
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.160
DUI cross DX right.

52
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.000
And then we just put you down here and do you over here.

53
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.760
All right.

54
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.269
So do you id x cross each other and do you.

55
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.920
And do you cross each other as well.

56
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.440
All right.

57
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.370
And to hear it remember that we're multiplying two derivatives a derivative of y in terms of you times

58
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.750
the derivative of you in terms of x.

59
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.410
So you get Y which is the original function and you put it in terms of view.

60
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.450
You basically transform it using what you did in step 1.

61
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.670
So for example in this case you would be the enter function right.

62
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.660
This is the inner

63
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.800
and this would become you to the tenth power.

64
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.880
All right.

65
00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.430
This is this in terms of you know axes anymore just you the tenth.

66
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.060
That's what we do here.

67
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.050
And of course not only do we need to put y in terms of you we need to find the derivative of that y

68
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.670
in terms of view and then we multiply this by you in terms of x.

69
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.620
Again us just the inner function.

70
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.530
So it's already going to be in terms of x.

71
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.260
So first derivative times this other derivative.

72
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:32.040
And finally for the last step this X over here is to put it back in terms of x.

73
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.150
So are you going to get an answer that's a mix of both x and you.

74
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.260
Well you need to do is take the use and substitute them back.

75
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:48.400
So if you're equals x squared minus 5 x squared plus 33 where ever you see and you know the answer you're

76
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.570
going to put x squared minus 5 x squared plus 33.

77
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.610
You're just putting it back in terms of x because we have no use for an answer that has a new.

78
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.320
Everything has to be X right.

79
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.300
And finally I wanted to say that very important in practice this rule a lot.

80
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.400
All right.

81
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.400
I'm not going to lie.

82
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.740
The chain rule can be tricky especially when you have tricky derivatives that you need to apply the

83
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.150
chain rule for.

84
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.120
Not only that you have this mnemonic which you need to make sure that you remember this part specifically

85
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.660
D-y over you times do you over dx and what it means and how to do it.

86
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.310
All right so I want you to practice this rule a lot.

87
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.250
We'll go through a couple of problems like I said.

88
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.460
So there you get some practice with this rule.

89
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.960
But don't think that you're going to do three problems with the chain rule and then you'll be ready

90
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.800
for the test.

91
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.570
It doesn't work like that specially for the chain rule.

92
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.480
So do the problems that I will present to you next.

93
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.170
But also remember to always practice and that's it.

94
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.550
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
