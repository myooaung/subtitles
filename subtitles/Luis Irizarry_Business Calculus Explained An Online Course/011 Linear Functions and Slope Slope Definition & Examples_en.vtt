00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.520
All right.

2
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.450
So let's get into the question of how linear functions are changing.

3
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.140
In fact it's very easy to do to determine how a straight line is changing.

4
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:38.280
We'll work with a concept which you know already which is called slope or just good old slope.

5
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.740
I know you're getting those fifth grade memories back.

6
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.370
All right.

7
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.910
Slope

8
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.190
measures.

9
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:13.890
A linear function is changing.

10
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.190
And what is slope Exactly.

11
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
Well if you remember from middle school slope equals

12
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.540
rise over run.

13
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.850
Remember that if you don't remember that's OK we'll go into the concept a little bit more deeply now.

14
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.950
But in general that's how they taught it back in middle school slope equals rise over run.

15
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.090
Now what exactly does that mean.

16
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.010
So remember how we said that the graph of a linear function is always a line.

17
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.290
Well it turns out that lines have slopes.

18
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.600
What is this slope again.

19
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.200
Slope is a measure of how linear function is changing.

20
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.860
In other words a slope is a measure

21
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.310
of the inclination of the line.

22
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.210
Which line then line that you get when you graph the function.

23
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.990
So for example

24
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.900
this is our cartesian plane.

25
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.550
Let's say we have this function here.

26
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.320
All right.

27
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.760
The graph is a straight line.

28
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.650
So we know it's a linear function.

29
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.480
Now let's say that we have this other function here.

30
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.660
Now let's get one more function over here.

31
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.900
So what are all these.

32
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.570
Well these are all graphs of linear functions.

33
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.300
We know that because they are straight lines even though they're going in different directions.

34
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.420
It doesn't matter.

35
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.290
And each of these lines has a different slope.

36
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.870
Why.

37
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.700
Because each of these lines has a different inclination.

38
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.320
So for example this one has a certain slope.

39
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.340
However this one here with kind of like greenish blue color has a steeper slope right because it goes

40
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.550
higher.

41
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.480
So if you compare this from left to right which is this one looks like it's harder to climb.

42
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.780
Right.

43
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.200
It's a lot steeper even more.

44
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.940
This one here the green one is going in the opposite direction.

45
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.130
So it has a completely different slope.

46
00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.740
The point is that each line has a slope and the slope measures the rate of change of that line.

47
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.360
In other words it measures the rate of change of a linear function.

48
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.470
So whenever you have a linear function and you want to know how it's changing you're going to do it

49
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.410
with slope and you might be thinking OK this is all nice and dandy but what is rate of change.

50
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.300
Anyways what does that mean.

51
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.860
Well let's go back to our lemonade stand that we mentioned already.

52
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.150
Let's say that on a really good day I calculate that I'm selling five lemonades per hour

53
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.140
starting at 9:00 in the morning.

54
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.420
This means that at 10

55
00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:05.920
I will have sold 5 lemonades right one hour later at 11 I will have sold how many 10 because it's the

56
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.340
five that I originally had at 10 plus five more that I make every hour.

57
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.800
Plus five more that I sell every hour.

58
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.090
What about a 12.

59
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.970
It's noon.

60
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.630
Everybody's thirsty but still I sell 15.

61
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.620
So at 10 I will have sold 5 or 11 I will have sold 10 and 12 I will have sold 15.

62
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.190
So what's the pattern here.

63
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.890
The pattern here is that every hour that passes we sell five lemonades and that's what's called a constant

64
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.080
rate of change.

65
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.030
OK.

66
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.490
We know it's constant because I'm not selling 7 at one hour and then 10 and then 15 and then 27 and

67
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.830
then 33.

68
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.450
I'm only selling five.

69
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.430
Every single hour the number of lemonades I'm selling every single hour is the same it's always five.

70
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.900
That's why it's constant constant means that it doesn't change.

71
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.800
So what is the function for this.

72
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.080
Well think about it

73
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.960
so I can say OK let me get a function for this.

74
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.010
That tells me how many lemonades have sold X hours after 9.

75
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.300
What would that be.

76
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:54.790
Well I sell five an hour x y 5 X because X is a number of hours after 9:00.

77
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:04.330
So if I plug in one here it's one hour after 9:00 so it's 10 and 10.

78
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.720
I have sold five.

79
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.050
So it's just five times one right.

80
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.190
Which is five.

81
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.350
This matches what we have here.

82
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.740
What about 11.

83
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:27.490
We plug into because it's two hours after 9:00 9:00 plus two hours.

84
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:34.460
It's 11:00 and we plug in here five an hour times two hours.

85
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:41.230
We have sold 10 which again matches with what we have here at 10:00 in the morning.

86
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:50.180
Our have sold 10 lemonades even though the glasses of lemonade I sell because they accumulate I have

87
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.800
first five and then 10 and then 15.

88
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.170
But the actual rate of change how many lemonades I'm selling every hour.

89
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.430
That's not changing.

90
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.600
It is always five.

91
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:08.600
That's why this problem is given by this function f of x equals 5 x.

92
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.730
So now let's figure out how to measure the slope of a linear function.

93
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.240
All right so going back to slope we know that slope is

94
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.210
rise over run.

95
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.310
Let's figure out what that means right now.

96
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:37.690
So let's pick our example again that we have f of x equals 5 x and let's try to get some slope.

97
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.110
So remember that to graph a linear function.

98
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.419
All you need is two points.

99
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.420
So let's build the table here.

100
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.430
It's X and Y and let's get two points.

101
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.000
So first of all let's plug in

102
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.580
so five times one is five.

103
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.920
So our first point is one five.

104
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.120
And then let's plug in zero just to make it easy.

105
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.390
Five times zero is just zero.

106
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.940
So our second point is actually zero zero.

107
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.110
Very convenient.

108
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.150
So let's try to grab this right here.

109
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.150
All right so our first point is 1 5.

110
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:34.040
So we move one to the right because x is positive and 5 up because the Y is positive as well.

111
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.090
And then our second point is 0 0.

112
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.440
This is called the origin.

113
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:51.040
By the way to the point 0 0 is called The Origin and we put that here for you 0 0 is origin.

114
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:56.670
All right.

115
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.090
So we have two points because it's a linear function.

116
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:14.500
We can just draw a line through them and we'll will have the graph over function.

117
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.010
All right there we go.

118
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:22.670
That is the graph of f of x equals 5 x linear function.

119
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.630
The graph is a line.

120
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.870
So what is the slope the slope is right.

121
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.070
Overrun.

122
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:38.990
So remember right over overrun means how many units are you going up per every unit that you move to

123
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.510
the right Lemme repeat that again.

124
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:50.430
How many units are you going up for every unit that you move to the right.

125
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.840
So let's start at the origin.

126
00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:04.140
We move one to the right and five up there we move one to the right again and five up one to the right

127
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.360
again and five up.

128
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:12.890
So you see how we always move one to the right and the same amount of units up.

129
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:21.190
That means that the slope of this function is five because you're right five for every run that you

130
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.300
make to the right

131
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.090
slope.

132
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.840
In this case equals five.

133
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:46.270
So the rate of change of this function is also five because remember that slope measures rate of change.

134
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.820
All right.

135
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.610
So is there some sort of formula that we could use for slope instead of having to go through this graph

136
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.670
and try to guess you know how many you move to the right for every one that you go up instead of trying

137
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.170
to guess how many go up for everyone you move to the right.

138
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.410
Yes there is a formula for slope and the formula is

139
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.730
lied to.

140
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:21.790
Line is why one over x 2 Mine is x 1.

141
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.830
That is the formula for slope.

142
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.870
So what does that mean.

143
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.240
It means you're going to pick two points.

144
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:43.970
So your first point is going to be x y y 1 and x 2 y 2 and you're going to plug them in into this function

145
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.640
to get to slope.

146
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:51.350
So basically to get the slope of a linear function all you need to do is get two points as if you were

147
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.950
going to graph it and plug them in here.

148
00:12:54.410 --> 00:13:01.370
So let's pick the point that we just work with which where 00

149
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:14.600
and one five Let's plug them into this formula for slope.

150
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.450
So every time you have two points it really doesn't matter which one is point one.

151
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.230
Point two but you have to be consistent.

152
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:33.240
So if x one is one then why one has to be the corresponding y or this could be point 1.

153
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.610
But then the corresponding y has to be zero.

154
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.670
You see what I mean.

155
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.080
So for example let's say that for example this is point 1.

156
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.060
And this is point 2.

157
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:51.780
So this is X1 y one and the point below is x to y 2.

158
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.010
So let's plug into this formula.

159
00:13:54.590 --> 00:14:03.400
So we have y to so the y of point 2 which is 5 minus.

160
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:10.140
Why one so why one is the y value of the first point which is zero.

161
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:24.910
Over X 2 which is the x value of point number 2 which is 1 mine is the x value of the first point which

162
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.110
is x y in this case it is 0.

163
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.270
And I hope you see where this is going.

164
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:39.580
5.0 0 5 one minus zero is 1 rice over 1 5 or 1 is just 5.

165
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:46.950
This is the slope of this function which again also measures the rate of change of the linear function.
