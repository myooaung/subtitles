00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.990
All right so let's go ahead and identify the following graphs are concave up and concave down.

2
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.720
Remember we have a mnemonic for this which tells you but I'll let you finish the problem.

3
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.980
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

4
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.350
All right.

5
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.340
So remember we have a mnemonic for this.

6
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.400
So if you get the word concave remember that contains the word cave and the mnemonic says where does

7
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.310
the cave open up.

8
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.570
That's where you know where a function is concave up and concave down.

9
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.050
Look at where the cave is opening up.

10
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.060
So let's start with this one here.

11
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.480
If you look at this it's closed on the top but it's open on the bottom.

12
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.690
So it is actually opening down.

13
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.060
So it's concave down in this part right.

14
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.750
And then once you get to approximately here there's an inflection point meaning that concavity changes.

15
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.240
And from this point onward it looks like it opens up right.

16
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.960
It's open on the top here.

17
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.560
So it is concave up over here.

18
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.570
All right.

19
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.090
Let's go to the next one.

20
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.630
So the next one is kind of similar.

21
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.320
We start like this.

22
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:52.420
So there's a mountain meaning it opens down it's open down here so it's concave down in this part and

23
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.700
right around here the origin.

24
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.200
There's an inflection point.

25
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.490
So it switches concavity.

26
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.950
And as you can see from here on it actually opens upward so it's concave up.

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.419
And finally let's go to the third one.

28
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.130
So here we start with concave up because it's open on the top and then at some point here there's an

29
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.980
inflection point because we switch cavities.

30
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.360
Now we're actually pointing down.

31
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.130
So we open down at this point and again there's an inflection point right around here.

32
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.640
And then we keep going.

33
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.430
So we see that here it actually opens up.

34
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.680
So we'll put an arrow going up right here concave up and we have an inflection point around here.

35
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.720
Concavity changes and from here on it actually opens down.

36
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.770
Right.

37
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.170
So

38
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.960
opens down concave down.

39
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
And finally we have one more concavity changes around here.

40
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.580
So there is an inflection point around there.

41
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.310
We see that here the graph is opening up again.

42
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.810
So it's concave up and this part.

43
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.380
So let's do a legend.

44
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.550
Pointing up is concave up

45
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.770
pointing down is concave down

46
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.550
oh and I meant concave up for the arrow up and concave down for the arrow pointing down and of course

47
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:50.210
these points are inflection points.

48
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.540
And remember that at these inflection points these are points where the concavity changes.

49
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.640
So for example here we a concave down to about here where it became concave up.

50
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.510
So the concavity changed at this point.

51
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.790
Same for this point over here.

52
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.480
And the same for all of these points in the last graph.

53
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.700
Right.

54
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.170
That's pretty much it for this.

55
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.660
Pretty easy right.

56
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.890
Hopefully that wasn't too bad.

57
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.800
And now we know hard to identify.

58
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.760
And by now you should know how to identify when a graph is concave up or concave down.
