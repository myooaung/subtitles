1
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,780
All right so here it is.

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:31,800
Here is the most feared derivative rule there is the chain rule says the derivative of f of g of X is

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,570
f prime.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,230
Evaluated a g of X times g prime of x.

5
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,820
Wait what exactly.

6
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,200
That's why people do not like the chain rule.

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,200
I mean look at this only by looking at it.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm confused already.

9
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,700
What's going on here.

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,750
So what's going on here is.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,830
So we have g of X the inner function plugged in into f of x right.

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:07,660
This says you're going to find the derivative of f of x with g of X applied and then you're going to

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,720
multiply that by the derivative of g of x.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,660
The inner function and I think this is better shown with an example.

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:27,970
So let's say that we have f of x equals x cubed and g of X equals

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,400
5 x plus 3.

17
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,870
All right.

18
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:47,020
And let's say that there is a third function of x and this function is equal to the composition of these

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,570
two.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:57,960
So we're going to take g of X and we're going to plug it into f of x so h of X equals f of g of X

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,240
and that's it right.

22
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,470
So again this third function here H of X equals to plug in and go of X into f of x.

23
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,330
So let's go ahead and do that.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,650
F of x says.

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,370
Are you going to take the input and cube it.

26
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:27,230
So you will have an input and you're going to Kubit and that input is g of X right.

27
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:35,400
This is the input also called the inner function.

28
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,860
All right.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,570
So we're in g of X into f of x and g of X is 5 x plus 3

30
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,850
OK.

31
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,370
So we want to find the derivative of H of X.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,700
In other words we want to find the derivative of this composition.

33
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,740
So what is a derivative of the composition.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,300
Let's use the chain rule.

35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,940
It says find the derivative of the outer function so the outer function is execute.

36
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,380
It's a function that's wrapping the other function.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,510
So the typical derivative for this is we bring down a dictator.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,490
So that's three

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,480
right.

40
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,630
And then we substitute balas powerful leader so that's two.

41
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,660
Now what goes inside is g of X..

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,240
So you see that we got the derivative of the outer but we don't put X here as usual.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:48,720
We put g of x which is the input and g of X is 5 x plus 3.

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,160
All right.

45
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,810
And then we need to multiply that by the derivative of g of x.

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,800
So the derivative of the input.

47
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,220
Is a derivative of giove x.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,680
So we have constant multiple odds of five and then derivative of X is just one.

49
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,510
So we don't market plus the derivative of a constant which is zero.

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,250
So at the end of the day the derivative of 5 x plus 3 is just 5.

51
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,750
So finally we simplify and we say three times 5 is 15.

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:32,520
And within the parentheses we have 5 x plus 3 squared.

53
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,360
All right.

54
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,100
And this is our derivative.

55
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,840
That is a derivative of the composition.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,390
But I mean check it out.

57
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,560
It's kind of messy right.

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,250
You have all these f of G over and then you have f prime of G VAX times a derivative of g of x.

59
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,450
This is complicated.

60
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,860
Nobody wants to do this.

61
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,540
All right.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,340
Once something easy one something that's far easier to remember for easier to apply.

63
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,450
So you know it's coming.

64
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,050
It's our mnemonic.
