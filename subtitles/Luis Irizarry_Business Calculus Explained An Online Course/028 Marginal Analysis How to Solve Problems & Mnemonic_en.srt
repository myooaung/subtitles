1
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,990
All right so how do we solve marginal analysis problems.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,290
It's actually very easy.

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,630
There's only two things that you need to do.

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,900
So remember we're doing marginal analysis right.

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:37,450
So number one we need to find the marginal function of the quantity so that quantity can be either profit

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,100
it can be revenue or it can be cost.

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,600
Those are the three that we mentioned and the other section.

8
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:55,450
So you're going to find the marginal function that means they are going to find the derivative.

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:55,950
All right.

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,400
So if you're talking about cost then you're going to find the derivative of cost that's going to give

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,739
you a marginal cost.

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,900
All right so that's step 1 and step 2 is the secret sauce to marginal analysis.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,070
This is where the magic happens.

14
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,850
So check this out.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,700
It says you plug one less and the unit of production into the marginal function.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,570
So you plug in one last

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,150
than the unit of production.

18
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,840
All right.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,760
So marginal analysis is used to estimate quantities right.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:43,110
So for example if we're asked let's estimate the revenue that producing a tenth unit would bring.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,280
So we want to estimate the revenue that the 10th unit will bring.

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,890
So the unit is 10 and the quantity is revenue Right.

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,620
So is this the first step would be to find the marginal function of this quantity revenue.

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,020
So we would find the derivative of revenue that's marginal revenue

25
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,070
and then we would go ahead and plug in one less than the unit or production.

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,820
So if we're trying to estimate what the revenue you're producing the TENS unit will be guess what you

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,680
do not plug in 10.

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,770
You plug in nine.

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,640
You always plug in one less.

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:43,990
So this would be given this estimation by our prime of 9.

31
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:52,250
Right because we need to plug in one less than the unit that we're looking for into the marginal function.

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,760
And this is fundamental.

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,870
So for example if you see tens unit you know let me get revenue and the derivative and I'm going to

34
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,830
plug in 10.

35
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,620
No that is wrong and I was going to give you the wrong answer.

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,240
That is why I said this.

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,480
Step two is the secret sauce to marginal analysis.

38
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:20,850
You need to remember to plug in one less not the unit itself and to help you remember that of course

39
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:31,870
we're going to do a very simple mnemonic.

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,380
All right.

41
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,220
So here we have our mnemonic for marginal analysis.

42
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,030
This is probably the simplest mnemonic I've ever made.

43
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,310
And you got to give him some credit.

44
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,260
It doesn't rhyme 100 percent but it does.

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
Right.

46
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:58,170
And it says when doing marginal It's minus one marginal minus one marginal minus one.

47
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,640
All right.

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,130
I just want you to drill that into your head.

49
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,610
Marginal is minus one.

50
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,730
That means that if we're estimating the seventh unit

51
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:21,250
we plug in six.

52
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:29,290
That also means that over estimating how the revenue will change when the production level goes to 33

53
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,110
units.

54
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,600
Then why do we plug in.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:45,410
Remember marginal mine is one we plug in 32.

56
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:52,020
What's that you want to find out how cost changes when production level goes to four.

57
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:09,710
So you want to find for the fourth unit marginal mine is one used to plug in one less.

58
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,160
All right.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,950
So again not a lot more to talk about here.

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,550
Marginal minus 1 marginal minus 1.

61
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:21,190
Repeat that to yourself barge in all minus 1 marginal minus 1.

62
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,410
That's how you'll know that when you're doing marginal analysis you need to plug in the unit that you're

63
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,490
estimating minus 1 into the marginal function into the derivative of whatever quantity it is that you're

64
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,040
working for profit revenue or cost.

65
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,980
Now in marginal analysis sometimes you might be asked to find the actual amounts not the estimate the

66
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,750
actual amount.

67
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,220
And in that case something else that you need to do for that.

68
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,170
But it's very common sense and we'll do that in no problem.

69
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,240
All right.

70
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,500
So again for marginal analysis.

71
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,470
So when you're doing an estimate or approximation

72
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,600
or the problem says hey estimate the revenue when the production level goes to 9 or we might say approximate

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,700
how the profit is changing when the production unit goes to 125.

74
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,290
So this is for estimates and approximations

75
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:40,410
So remember again you're either estimating or you're finding the actual amount and that will cover the

76
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,920
problem finding the actual amount.

77
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,260
So for estimating approximating something what is the keyboard marginal.

78
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,440
Mine is one.
