1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,150
Hey they're welcome to another session of limit less calculus.

2
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,200
Today we're going to cover relative extrema.

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,150
So as we always do let's start off with the graph of a function.

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:53,640
So let's say we have a function whose graph looks like this.

5
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,120
All right.

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,570
So definitely lots of curves going on.

7
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,160
As you can see this function is a curve and it has parts that are increasing.

8
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:10,630
So here it's going up and then it starts to go down and then it goes up again and then it goes down.

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,380
And finally it goes up.

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,280
All right.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,840
As you might have noticed by now these functions that look like curves have high points and have low

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,610
points.

13
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,200
Now we're not talking about the highest point in the graph because for example this point over here

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,490
is not the highest point because you have points that are even higher over here.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,470
However compared to the points that are nearby it kind of looks like a mountain right.

16
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:52,300
So this point here is high compared to the point nearby in the same way this point down here is low

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,760
compared to the points nearby because you're going down you're going down you're going down then you

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,370
get to the lowest part and then you start going up again.

19
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,610
Same thing happens here.

20
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,210
This is another point that's high and this one here is another point that slow.

21
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,080
And again it's all relative to the points that are nearby.

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,950
It turns out we actually have a name for these points.

23
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,560
So the points that are high are called relative max.

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:42,560
So for example here we have a relative abbreviated as raúl relative Max but then down here we have a

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,870
relative minimum.

26
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,450
And then as we keep going.

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:00,980
We have another max over here as is also a relative Max.

28
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:09,690
And then as we go down here we have another relative min.

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,720
And if you think about the names of these that kind of makes sense it's relative because again it's

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,910
a high point compared to the points that are nearby in the same way.

31
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:28,010
This one is a relative of men because it's a low point relative to the points that are nearby.

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,770
So I like to think of these as mountains and holes.

33
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,310
So if you look at this at this Max it kind of looks like a mountain.

34
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,020
Right.

35
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:48,210
And if you look at those men it kind of looks like a whole a way to think of these is max points.

36
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,370
Are mountains

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,940
and midpoints

38
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,540
are holes.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,840
So let's go deeper into the definition for each of these.

40
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,420
All right so here we have relative maximum.

41
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,769
And like we said it's a point that's higher than other points nearby.

42
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,110
And again it looks like a mountain because you pretty much go to the peak of the mountain and then you

43
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,460
come back down and just another example of this.

44
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,450
You have this function.

45
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,100
All right.

46
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,580
So let's identify the relative maximums here.

47
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,770
Where are the points that are higher than other points that are nearby.

48
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,920
So as you go up.

49
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,830
All right so it kind of looks like you have a point here a relative Max.

50
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,520
And then you started going down and then you go up again.

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,900
And here you have a no other point relative max and you go down and then it keeps going up.

52
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,640
So here we have two relative maximums.

53
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,910
And by the way the way to call a group of relative maximums is relative

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,910
Macsyma

55
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,070
so relative Maxima is a group of relative maximums.

56
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:44,840
I'll put together.

57
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,400
All right.

58
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,000
So for example the relative Macsyma of this graph let's say that it's this point and this point I would

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,260
just give them random values.

60
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:04,780
So let's say that the first point is at 0 and then you go up 3 0 3 and for this one let's say that you

61
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,520
go to the right 8 units and then you go up seven units.

62
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,890
So your point is eight seven.

63
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,630
This is a relative Macsyma.

64
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,470
All right.

65
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,970
Relative maximum

66
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,130
on the other hand.

67
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,040
Let's go and visit a relative minimum.

68
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,640
All right so here we have the counterpart to relative maximums.

69
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:42,270
This is relative minimums and a relative minimum is a point that's lower than other points nearby.

70
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,720
So again let's do an example.

71
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,530
All right.

72
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,320
So let's identify the relative minimums in this graph.

73
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,370
And remember we think of them as holes maximums or mountains and these are holes.

74
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:15,120
So you go up this way and then you have a max over here and then you come down and you have a min right

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,730
here.

76
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,910
See how it's lower than all the other points nearby.

77
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,390
All right.

78
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,720
So then we keep going up.

79
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:31,240
We have a max we go down and it seems that we have a man here as well right.

80
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:42,350
So just like we have relative Macsyma which is a group of relative maximums we also have relative

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,790
minima.

82
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,400
Which is a group of relative minimums

83
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,020
Let's go ahead and assign some values to these two points.

84
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:19,020
So the relative minima for this function would be let's say that this point is negative 5 3

85
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:35,710
and let's say that for this point it is four and negative for.

86
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:48,490
So this would be the relative minima because we have more than one point of this function.

87
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,210
All right.

88
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,310
So we have relative Max relative men.

89
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,650
We actually have a name for the combination of all Macs and all men together.

90
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,820
And let's see how that's called.

91
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,870
All right so here it is relative extrema relative extrema refers to all relative maximums and relative

92
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,420
minimums of a graph.

93
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,840
So again if we have this graph of a function

94
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,400
and we would like to identify all relative extrema it would be all the relative Max and the relative

95
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,270
Mint's.

96
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:39,900
So here we have a max that we go down and we seem to have a man over here.

97
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:48,180
We go up again and we have a max then we have a man and that's pretty much it.

98
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,490
So we have two axes and two minutes.

99
00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:00,290
So whenever you hear the word relative extrema again as does all the relative Max and mennes put together.

100
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:09,870
So it's basically all the mountains like this one and this one and all the holes like this one and this

101
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:18,380
one as you might have guessed we did not always have a graph to know what the relative maximum amount

102
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,050
of homes are.

103
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,630
So we need a way to find relative Maxson means mathematically.

104
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,160
How do we do this.

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:35,680
So there's a very cool connection between relative extrema and critical points as you might remember.

106
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,060
Critical points is one the derivative either equals zero or is undefined.

107
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,470
So something interesting about relative extrema is this.

108
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,220
Check it out.

109
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,230
If you draw a tangent line on all of these relative extrema what happens.

110
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,750
So here we have a tangent line right here.

111
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:10,800
Then you have a tangent line right here and you have a tangent line right here and you every last tangent

112
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,960
line right here.

113
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:21,070
So I hope you're seeing the pattern what is common with all these lines.

114
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,940
They kind of look like horizontal lines right.

115
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,460
None of them have any heights so they seem to have no slope at all.

116
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,710
That's the case for this one here for this one for this one and for this one.

117
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,690
So actually none of these lines have slope.

118
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,740
So that means that the slope for each one is zero.

119
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,480
Slope here is zero slope here is zero.

120
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,620
And the slope here is zero.

121
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,060
So going back to critical points.

122
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:02,070
So remember that by definition critical points have two checks and in the first check you check where

123
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,400
the derivative equals zero.

124
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,490
But what does a derivative measure the derivative measures the slope of the line tangent to the graph.

125
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,610
Therefore if the slope of the line tangent to the graph equals zero that means that the derivative equals

126
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,480
zero.

127
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,110
So in other words relative extrema occur when you have a critical point.

128
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,840
And this is very important.

129
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,080
So write this down.

130
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,000
So relative

131
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:33,870
extrema

132
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:51,920
only occur at critical points.

133
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,830
All right relative extrema only occurs at critical points.

134
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,610
Very important.

135
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,470
So in fact this right here is a critical point.

136
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,850
This one is also a critical point.

137
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,950
This one is also a critical point.

138
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,480
And this one as well.

139
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,250
Why.

140
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:15,600
Because one of the conditions for a point to be a critical point is that the derivative equals zero.

141
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,780
Since the slope of the line tangent is zero that means the derivative is zero.

142
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,950
All right so not only are these relative extrema.

143
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,380
These are critical points as well.

144
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,290
Now you might be thinking OK so for critical points one of the conditions is that the derivative equals

145
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,190
zero.

146
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,280
But there is another condition where the derivative is undefined.

147
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,880
Remember that critical points either the derivative is zero or it is undefined.

148
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,500
So there are some cases of graphs where you have for example something like this.

149
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,200
So it turns out that for something like this the derivative is undefined at this point.

150
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,480
We don't have to get into the reason why but a derivative is undefined.

151
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,950
Even then it's still a critical points because again by definition if the derivative is undefined at

152
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,330
a point then it makes it a critical point.

153
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,810
And at the same time it is a relative Min Right because it's down here.

154
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,770
It doesn't look exactly like a hole but this is a special kind of graph.

155
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,670
The point is it is lower than other points nearby.

156
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,120
See that.

157
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:41,870
So this tells you again and I want you to remember this relative extrema only occurred at critical points.

158
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:51,140
So when you're finding relative extrema the first step is to find all the critical points of the function.

159
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,120
Now the remaining question is once you find the critical points.

160
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,160
How do you determine if it's a relative Max a relative men or neither.

161
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,040
Well that's an interesting question.

162
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,150
And there are several ways of finding that out.

163
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,290
There's the first derivative test and the second derivative test and we'll look at those and other sections.

164
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,150
I just wanted to give you an intro to relative extrema.

165
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,010
Let's go into our summary.

166
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,940
All right so this lesson was more a concepts than anything else.

167
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,400
But these are critical.

168
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,380
No pun intended for your learning of what's coming next.

169
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:37,770
So let's go over a quick summary so graphs can have points that are higher or lower than nearby ones.

170
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,040
So if you have a point that's a little bit higher than the ones close to it or a little bit lower then

171
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,230
you have what's called the relative Max and relative min.

172
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,750
So relative maximums are higher than points close to it and they look like mountains.

173
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:02,290
So a relative Max looks something like this a group of relative maximums is called relative Maxima.

174
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,760
All right.

175
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,440
On the other hand relative minimums are lower than points that are close to it.

176
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,640
So they kind of look like holes not always exactly like this.

177
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,780
They could also look something like this.

178
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,590
The point is no pun intended that the actual moon is down here or here.

179
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,860
And by the way the max is up here.

180
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,610
Now just for being thorough.

181
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,670
You can actually have a max here as well.

182
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,340
All right.

183
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,280
And the point would be up here this one with a straight line is a very special case.

184
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,710
Most of the ones you're going to see are going to be either this you or a whole or this malintent over

185
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,040
here and a group of relative minimums is called relative minima.

186
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:01,720
So you have relative Macsyma all the maximums and relative minima all the minimums and then relative

187
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,859
extrema refers to all Maxson ments of a graph.

188
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:12,069
So all the relative maximums and all the relative minimums make up relative extrema and then we have

189
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,099
the last point which is the most important point here.

190
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,050
We have that relative extrema can only occur at critical points.

191
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,940
So as we know critical points occur when the derivative is zero or undefined.

192
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,480
So let me repeat that once again relative extrema can only occur at critical points.

193
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:40,490
So if you're asked to find the relative extrema of a graph the first step that you need to do is to

194
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,840
find all the critical points.

195
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,060
All right.

196
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
So basically when you're finding relative extrema there are two steps.

197
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,590
Number one is find the critical points and number to classify them as relative Max relative men or is

198
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,650
neither.

199
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,690
And that's what we're going to do in the next section with the first derivative test.

200
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,830
So this is set and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
