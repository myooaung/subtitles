1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,290
All right.

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:27,630
So we'll do a couple of exercises for the product rule remember that a product is a result of a multiplication.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,830
So the first thing we're going to do is for a couple of functions we're going to identify with the multiplying

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,580
functions are remember that we know the two functions are multiplying.

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:47,710
If there's a dot if there are parentheses or if there is actually nothing in between them

6
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,290
so pretty much any of these three tell you that two functions or more are multiplying.

7
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,170
So I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

8
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,140
So the best way to break this up is to have a coefficient the X and then exponent.

9
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:15,880
All right.

10
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,970
So we're going to call that combination a function.

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,980
So again it's coefficient X and exponent and you have seen this often.

12
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:36,230
So for example if you see something like you know like three x squared plus five x to the three Mine

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,150
is 22 x etc..

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,100
These are called terms.

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,690
So this is one term three x squared.

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,260
Then there's another 5 x cubed.

17
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,430
This is another 22 x etc..

18
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,570
I notice they are composed of this coefficient the coefficient is a constant multiple.

19
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,090
All right.

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,840
It's also called a coefficient.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
It's just this number here at the beginning.

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:10,300
So these terms are composed of the coefficient of an X and exponent and let me take this out because

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,830
it's not part of the problem.

24
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,520
All right so we're going to identify what the multiplying functions are for this f of x.

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,650
So as you might have noticed there are no dots nor parentheses in here.

26
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,790
So your first function is going to be what.

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:37,840
Well it's going to be this for X to the negative to write coefficient pace and exponent.

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:54,850
For x to the negative to and your second function is going to be whatever's left 35 x squared.

29
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:02,150
So this up here is basically function number 1 being multiplied by function number 2.

30
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:11,820
And again we know this because there's actually nothing in between them that implies a multiplication.

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,940
All right let's check out another exercise.

32
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,420
All right.

33
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:24,620
So here we have a next function f of x equals x squared plus three Everything times 2 x cubed minus

34
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,970
five.

35
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,880
So notice we have parentheses.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,530
What does that tell you.

37
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,150
I'll go ahead and let you pause the video and give it a shot.

38
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,740
All right.

39
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,610
So there you go.

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,600
Let's find out what would be the first function.

41
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:50,450
Well because we have parentheses this actually tells us right there which one is the first and which

42
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,270
one is the second.

43
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,250
Right.

44
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,970
So our first function is between these two parentheses.

45
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,820
And our second one is between these two.

46
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,250
All right.

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,740
So first function is just x squared plus three.

48
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,730
So notice here in this case our function is actually x squared plus a number.

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,540
Right.

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,660
So it's not simply like the X squared by itself and again in this case it was pretty clear because it

51
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,470
has parentheses around it.

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,030
But in the other case we just did.

53
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,850
We had to break it up.

54
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,540
So we decided to go ahead and grab the first term and the second but then here they actually tell you

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,510
what the first function is and what the second one is.

56
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,150
So here we know the function.

57
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,650
The first function is this whole thing.

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,020
Same thing for the second function.

59
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,710
We have 2 x cubed minus five.

60
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,610
All right.

61
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:56,080
So we know that this is our second function because these two functions are multiplying.

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,540
Remember though what you're doing is you're looking at this and saying OK which function is multiplying

63
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,370
what.

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,030
In this case again it's pretty obvious that this first function is multiplying.

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
This second function.

66
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,110
All right.

67
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,190
So here we have another example which is more like the first one.

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,330
We don't have any parentheses we don't have any dots so we have to break it apart.

69
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,460
We have to say which are the functions that are multiplying.

70
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,800
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

71
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,360
All right.

72
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,330
So let's see it once for the first function.

73
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,180
Well let's see what we have here.

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Maybe you notice that instead of having two functions that are multiplying we actually have three right.

75
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,400
So we could break it up with three functions and let's see how like I said when it's in this format

76
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:59,690
then the way to break it up is to say OK let me grab a coefficients a base and a exponents and I'll

77
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,570
call that a function.

78
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,230
So here it's pretty clear that the first function would be 10 x to the 9

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,760
right.

80
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,630
Let's keep going second function.

81
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,130
What would it be.

82
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,390
Well it would just be this x to the negative one.

83
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,940
The coefficient here is implied to be 1.

84
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,160
That's why it's marked right.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,370
So we just say that our second function would be x to the negative 1.

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,870
And finally our third function must be what's left which fits in nicely because it's just a coefficient

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,040
a base and an exponent.

88
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,220
So it's five execute.

89
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,650
These are three functions that are multiplying up here.

90
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,980
And remember our mnemonic only works with two functions.

91
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,190
So in this case we would have to regroup and say for example that one and two multiplied is the first

92
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,890
function and then the number three is.

93
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,580
The second function will see an example of that in just a bit.
