00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.330
Say so what's going on.

2
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.750
All right.

3
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.890
So let's go ahead and find the domain of a couple of different functions.

4
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:36.120
So remember the domain is the allowable input into a function it's whatever you can input remember sometimes

5
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.770
there are some values that you cannot input.

6
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.350
So let's get started.

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.470
Find the domain of f of x y and f of x equals x plus 3.

8
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.690
So let me know what are the values that are allowed to be input into this function X plus 3.

9
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.270
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

10
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.620
All right.

11
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:10.310
So remember that domain is all real numbers except in three situations.

12
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:27.050
Those three situations are division by zero.

13
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.510
Then we have negative numbers.

14
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:43.050
Under even root's.

15
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.200
And finally we have practical applications.

16
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.760
All right.

17
00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.370
So these are the three situations in which the domain cannot be all real numbers.

18
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.240
So in this case x plus 3 we do not have any division by zero.

19
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.680
We do not have any even roods and we're not given any context as to what this function is.

20
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.580
So there's really no practical applications involved for that reason the domain for this function is

21
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.380
all real numbers.

22
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.650
All right.

23
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.110
That means you can plug in whatever number you want into this function and it's going to be OK.

24
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.110
You're going to get a results.

25
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.030
Let's look at another example.

26
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.450
All right.

27
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.790
So here is our next example.

28
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:55.410
Find the domain of f of x when f of x equals 3x over X plus 1 times X minus 2.

29
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.140
Let's find the domain of this function.

30
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.040
Go ahead and pause the video and try it out.

31
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.470
All right so let's see what you got for this one.

32
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:18.970
So remember division by zero negatives under even roots and practical applications are reasons why that

33
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.300
domain couldn't be all real numbers.

34
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.650
Remember we could have a combination of maybe two or maybe all three but which one do we have here.

35
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.950
If you look at it I think it's pretty obvious that it is division by zero.

36
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.340
See this.

37
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.550
It has a bottom.

38
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.790
It has a denominator and this denominator could be zero.

39
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.180
How could it be 0.

40
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.440
Well it turns out that you have two things that are multiplying.

41
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.560
And the bottom here.

42
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.930
X plus 1 an X minus 2.

43
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.750
And remember that if you multiply something by 0 then you get 0 everywhere.

44
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:11.190
So if either this is 0 or this is zero then you're going to get division by zero.

45
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.700
So we need to check for two cases when this is zero.

46
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.910
And when this is zero.

47
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.529
So let's first deal with this.

48
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.610
X plus 1.

49
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.640
So one is X plus one equals zero.

50
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.140
Well what we do is we pretty much put X plus one equals zero and we solve for x.

51
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.310
So we need to move this plus one to the other side and to do that we subtract one from both sides.

52
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:55.230
X equals zero minus 1 which is minus 1 and in fact it kind of makes sense if you put minus 1 plus 1

53
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.710
that's going to give you zero here and then zero times whatever you get here which doesn't matter gives

54
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.140
you a zero on the denominator.

55
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.060
So this function can not accept this negative one as input.

56
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.650
What is the other case the other case is when X minus two equals zero.

57
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.940
So when does X minus two equals zero.

58
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.050
Well go ahead and write X minus 2.

59
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.080
We're going to set it equal to zero and we're going to solve for x.

60
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.620
So this is a negative 2 to move to the other side.

61
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.030
We need to do plus two and both sides.

62
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.100
Cancels out x equals zero plus two.

63
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.940
That is a two.

64
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.330
And again that makes sense because if you plug in two into this function when you get to this part you're

65
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.040
going to have to minus two which is zero.

66
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.310
Therefore this too cannot be input into the function either.

67
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.870
After that we know that we do not have any roots and we do not have any practical applications.

68
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.580
Therefore the domain of this function is all real numbers

69
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.090
accept

70
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:32.250
negative 1 and 2 because when you plug in either negative one or two into this function you get division

71
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.470
by zero.

72
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.400
This right here is your answer.

73
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.520
All right so here we have another example.

74
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:52.710
Find the domain of f of x when f of x equals the fourth roots of X minus 6.

75
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.680
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

76
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.250
All right so let's see how you do it.

77
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.830
So we do not have division by zero and we do not have practical applications.

78
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:16.250
However we do have an even root that could have a negative number here depending on the input.

79
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:23.160
So remember that because this is an even rudes a number and side cannot be negative.

80
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.100
So how do we make sure of that.

81
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.130
Well what we need to do is we need to say X minus 6

82
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.850
is greater than zero.

83
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.350
And after we do this we need to solve for x.

84
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.390
So we do we have a negative six on this side.

85
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.880
So we do plus six.

86
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.730
Both sides

87
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.890
cancels out.

88
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.630
We have x is greater than 6 see that.

89
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:06.260
So if you plug in a number that's greater than 6 into this function that's going to give you a positive

90
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:12.010
number and it makes sense because for example if you plug in 5 into this function.

91
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.490
So let's say for five

92
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.760
so five mine is six.

93
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.910
It's asking for the fourth root of negative one.

94
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.140
Again this gives us imaginary numbers.

95
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.570
We do not like that.

96
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.659
So this is less than six.

97
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.659
Let's actually try a number greater than six.

98
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:45.320
Let's plug in seven.

99
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.810
So we're going to go ahead and plug in seven minus six

100
00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:01.330
for root of 1 which is just want because one times won Times want one is one.

101
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.190
All right so this one is good.

102
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.590
This one is not so we just tested this so we got over here x is greater than six is true.

103
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.990
Ha but I actually missed something.

104
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.260
See that.

105
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.560
So it turns out that the square root of 0 is a valid choice.

106
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.810
So we don't want numbers that are just greater than 6.

107
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.340
We also want to include the 6.

108
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.900
So we say greater than or equal and here will do the same thing.

109
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.050
Greater than or equal right.

110
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.730
So x is greater than or equal to 6 because if we go ahead and plug in 6

111
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.800
We're going to get 6 minus 6

112
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.520
fourth root of 0 which is valid.

113
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.090
OK.

114
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.330
That's going to give us zero.

115
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.830
This one is OK as well.

116
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.220
All right.

117
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.480
So I just forgot to include the equals and I just put it in.

118
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.680
So numbers that are less than 6 not good 6 are greater.

119
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.940
They're good to go.

120
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.260
So a domain is

121
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.920
all real numbers.

122
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.970
That are a greater than or equal to six.

123
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.190
There you go.

124
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.960
All right.

125
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.440
That's pretty much it.

126
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.340
Let's do another example.

127
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.320
With roots all right so here it is.

128
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:48.320
Find the domain of f of x where f of x equals the third root of x minus 3.

129
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.440
Go ahead and pause the video and try this one out.

130
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.780
All right so what you get.

131
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.580
This one was a little bit tricky.

132
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.690
I had to admit I like giving my students tricky problems every once in a while because sometimes you'll

133
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.840
get tricky problems on a test on a midterm on a quiz on a final.

134
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.700
So you need to make sure you're ready for those curveballs.

135
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.460
OK.

136
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.210
So you might have seen this and you said oh OK so we have a route there for the number down here cannot

137
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.030
be negative.

138
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.840
And if you thought that I don't blame you because this looks very similar to the problem we just did.

139
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:38.690
However remember that for a domain The problem is only with even roots.

140
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:52.450
All right even means 2 4 6 8 etc. etc. Even means divisible by 2.

141
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.500
So this gives you a problem

142
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.330
when you haven't even roots you cannot get a negative number under there.

143
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.280
However we haven't even read here.

144
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.490
We do not.

145
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.680
It's odd.

146
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:18.170
Right because it's three remember that odds are 1 3 5 7.

147
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.640
In other words not divisible by two.

148
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.000
So because we have an odd route it's OK to have negative numbers under here.

149
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.000
All right.

150
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.910
And again we do not have any practical applications and we do not have any division by zero.

151
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:46.100
Therefore the domain of this function is surprisingly all real numbers.

152
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.290
All right and here we have our last exercise.

153
00:12:53.290 --> 00:13:01.090
So let's say that f of x represents the pollution levels of a city and X the input is the number of

154
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.250
days since January 1st 1996.

155
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.780
What's the domain of f IVAX.

156
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.510
Go ahead and pause the video and try this one out.

157
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.600
What do you think is the domain here.

158
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.490
So X the input.

159
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:31.020
Remember that domain relates to input is the number of days since January 1st 1996.

160
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:40.660
Let's say that before 1996 we didn't have any pollution data only on January 1st 1996 we started recording

161
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.320
this data.

162
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.980
So would it make sense to plug in negative 20 into this function.

163
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.550
The problem with that is like I said we do not have any pollution data from before this date.

164
00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.750
So it looks like you cannot plug in any negative numbers into this function.

165
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:03.350
All right.

166
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.070
So that's number one.

167
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.620
No negative numbers

168
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.110
OK what else is there.

169
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:23.000
And by the way notice that we were not even given the function f of x the function itself doesn't really

170
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.550
matter.

171
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.410
Okay.

172
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.900
So we can plug in negative numbers what else.

173
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.200
So we're counting number of days.

174
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.430
That means that it doesn't make sense to plug in point seventy five or two point twenty three or a five

175
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:45.850
point forty nine plugging in numbers with decimals does not make sense because we're measuring by days.

176
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.230
So no decimals

177
00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.220
so no negative numbers allowed no decimals allowed.

178
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:09.430
Then with this we know what our domain is our domain is not all real numbers because our real numbers

179
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.700
would include the negatives and it would also include the decimals.

180
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.660
So it cannot be all real numbers.

181
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.760
So if you cannot plug in any negative numbers it starts at zero.

182
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.610
Right.

183
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:35.200
And if you cannot plug in decimals then you're plugging in whole numbers whole numbers are 0 1 2 3 cetera.

184
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.870
Are you counting numbers basically.

185
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.880
Right.

186
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:45.290
So it turns out our domain is all whole numbers.

187
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.720
This is our answer.

188
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.510
So it turns out that whole numbers do not include negative numbers by definition.

189
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:14.240
Ok so if we say all home numbers that is 0 1 2 3 4 5 etc. etc. Remember that we have something called

190
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.330
integers.

191
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:24.860
Integers look like this as well 0 1 2 3 etc. but integers include negative numbers and we said no negative

192
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.000
numbers.

193
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.150
So you could technically write this as zero and all positive integers.

194
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:37.430
That's another valid option for the domain but we chose to go with whole numbers because the definition

195
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.210
of a whole number fits perfectly with the domain for this problem.

196
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:48.320
The main takeaway from here is sometimes you'll have practical constraints that tell you that you cannot

197
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.980
plug in certain numbers into certain functions.

198
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.300
In this case we're starting to record pollution since this date.

199
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.260
So we cannot go back in time because we have no data.

200
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:08.420
And second since we're measuring number of days not parts of days then we cannot have any decimals.

201
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.910
That's why our domain is all whole numbers.

202
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.829
All right.

203
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.770
The more domain problems that you do the better you will get at it.

204
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.930
So so go ahead and take your homework and do some problems on domain.

205
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:27.849
If you were not assigned any problems just go to the book and take three four maybe five problems and

206
00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.510
find the domain for those.

207
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.720
All right I'll see you in the next tutorial.
