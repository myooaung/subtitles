00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.160
Hey there what's going on.

2
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.490
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.900
Today we're going to cover continuity so in business calculus there's this concept called continuity.

4
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.240
What does this sound to you.

5
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.270
Write it down so you have it in mind.

6
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.750
By the way if I sound a little different it's because I'm sick.

7
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.290
So just bear with me.

8
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.150
I should be OK for the next tutorial.

9
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.340
So it's

10
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.930
Kaante nudity.

11
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.160
So what do you think that is.

12
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.069
What does that sound like.

13
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.160
Well to me it sounds like something that has no interruptions.

14
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.630
Right.

15
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.290
It just keeps on going.

16
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
You can think about your favorite series from 10 years ago.

17
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.380
Do you remember when after an episode ended on a cliffhanger and you just wanted to see more but it

18
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.190
was over.

19
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.150
And then he would say to be continued.

20
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.440
Well to be continued means that you'll have more of the series later on.

21
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.510
But that means the series is not stopping it's still going.

22
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.260
So continuity has to mean that something is not interrupted.

23
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.620
Right.

24
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.240
It just keeps going on and on and on.

25
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.750
On that same token functions can be continuous or discontinuous.

26
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.760
And let's go into an informal definition of what continuity is.

27
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.360
All right so here we have the definition of continuity.

28
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.930
Now this is a very informal definition.

29
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.810
It's mostly use when you have a graph and you want to check if it's continuous or not.

30
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.400
It says a function is continuous if Fed can be drawn without lifting your pencil.

31
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.030
Again a function is continuous if it can be drawn without lifting your pencil.

32
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.650
What the heck does that mean.

33
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.350
So remember that if we have our piecewise function you know something like this like we've done in the

34
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.440
past let's say we have a function here.

35
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.700
And then this one jumps to this function here.

36
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.230
And then that one jumps over to this function over here.

37
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.940
Etc..

38
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.740
All right so this from keeps going and keeps going down and let's do a couple of jumps.

39
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.850
So you have this one here is defined down here.

40
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.850
And you have this one here defined down there and open circle over here.

41
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.420
All right so you should have seen this before.

42
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.850
Because we covered it in a different section.

43
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.620
This is a piecewise function.

44
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.330
And basically it's a function composed of different functions for different inputs.

45
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.300
So from here to the left we have the pink function then from here to here we have the blue function

46
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.340
and from here to the right we have the green function.

47
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.740
So let me ask you a question.

48
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.240
Can you draw this function without lifting your pencil.

49
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.700
Well let's see.

50
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.710
So you start drawing from the left you come here you draw your circle.

51
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.470
Put what happens.

52
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.840
You need to go down.

53
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.560
You need to go down here.

54
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.890
Can you do that without lifting your pencil.

55
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.250
No you kids you actually have to lift your pencil and then you have to come down here.

56
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.820
After that you draw a circle over here.

57
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.240
Then what happens again.

58
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.459
Well you have to lift your pencil to keep drawing.

59
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.150
So you left your pencil.

60
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.890
You move it up here and then you keep on drawing.

61
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.120
But see we had to lift our pencils twice in order to draw this piecewise function.

62
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.880
This whole thing of three functions for that reason this function is nuts.

63
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.400
Continues

64
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.030
All right.

65
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.150
Because we had to lift our pencil to draw it.

66
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.520
It is not continuous.

67
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.920
What is another example.

68
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.360
See

69
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.420
what about a nice little parable over here.

70
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.560
Something like this.

71
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.360
All right so do we need to lift our pencils to draw those.

72
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:21.270
So let's see you start here and then you go and ANS you go to here.

73
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.730
Nope we didn't have to lift her pencil.

74
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.400
That's because there are no jumps like we have here.

75
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.960
Here we jump for example from this point to this point.

76
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.080
And at that point we need to lift our pencil case we did not need to do that.

77
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.940
It's always a curve.

78
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.000
So you can just draw the curve continuously.

79
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.030
All right.

80
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.780
For that reason this function is continuous

81
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.370
right.

82
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.120
So we can actually call this the pencil test if you want.

83
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.650
So we can actually refer to it

84
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.100
right to the pencil test as a function is continuous.

85
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.950
If it can be drawn without lifting your pencil.

86
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.600
So if you get a graph and you want to check if it's continuous You just have to check if you can draw

87
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.710
it without lifting your pencil if you can.

88
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.790
It is continuous.

89
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.540
If you cannot it is not continues and it didn't pass the pencil test.

90
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.810
Now something to note here is where checking for continuity everywhere.

91
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.560
All right.

92
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.890
So we're checking if this function is continuous everywhere.

93
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.710
That means for all x values the answer is No.

94
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.570
And for this one we're also checking if it's continuous everywhere.

95
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.850
The answer is yes because you can draw it at any point without lifting your pencil.

96
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.470
However there's a concept of continuity at a certain point.

97
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.670
All right.

98
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:10.710
So for example from here to here guess what the function is continuous because in these points you do

99
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.290
not have to lift your pencil to draw them.

100
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.290
So to draw from this part of the line to this part of the line it's OK.

101
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:26.190
The same thing for example from here to here it is continues right there because you do not have to

102
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.170
lift your pencil to draw this segment of a line.

103
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:37.420
So now we'll look at a continuity at a specific point instead of doing continuous everywhere.

104
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:47.670
All right but again just to recap this function as a whole is not continuous everywhere and this function

105
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.870
as a whole is continuous everywhere and that's it.

106
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.100
So let's go into a more formal definition of continuity.

107
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.320
OK so we just covered continuity in a very informal way.

108
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.120
You're just given a graph and you kind of have to see oh what I have to lift my pencil for me to draw

109
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.200
this or not and that's how you determine if the graph is continuous everywhere.

110
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.940
But now let's go into a more formal definition.

111
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.970
So what if you're asked if a graph is continuous at a point where X equals a.

112
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.710
How do we determine that.

113
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.990
So there are three conditions for continuity.

114
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.650
So we have three conditions that need to be true.

115
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.410
So that the function is continuous right for continuity.

116
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.900
And let's assume we're talking about a point where X equals a.

117
00:08:55.110 --> 00:09:14.350
So your input is a whatever that is or condition number one is is that f of a is defined.

118
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.940
What does the fine mean.

119
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.610
What does it mean that f is defined.

120
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:24.520
Well remember how we talked about domain and about how some values are allowable to input and some others

121
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.810
are not.

122
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.070
That's what this means.

123
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:35.830
If FOIAs find to it means that when you plug in a you do not get division over zero or you did not get

124
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.080
a negative number on there and even Rood's etc..

125
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.110
So basically you have to make sure that a is part of the domain.

126
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:51.310
If you plug in a and you get a number back you're good to go because it means that a is part of the

127
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.350
domain.

128
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.840
All right so again first thing f of a needs to be defined.

129
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:09.350
Number two is that the limit of the function f of x and this f of x is whatever function you're working

130
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.930
with.

131
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.000
As x approaches a

132
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.080
exists

133
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.120
OK.

134
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.840
So something very important.

135
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.640
Check it out.

136
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:32.250
We have for condition one that f of a is defined and for a condition to the limit of f of x.

137
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.990
X approaches a exists.

138
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:41.510
Notice this a from point one was the same a as from point 2.

139
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:47.530
So whatever the X is approaching or number two is the same thing that you need to plug in.

140
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:53.820
Number 1 whatever that a is whatever that number is.

141
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.560
All right.

142
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.090
And remember we talked about limits.

143
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:03.210
When does a limit exist when the limit from the lat equals the limit from the right.

144
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:09.880
So for this to be true the limit from left

145
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.080
equals the limit from right

146
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.510
so I've ever raised it fine but the limit from the left is different than the one from the right than

147
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.190
the limit of f of x x approaches.

148
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.590
A does not exist and therefore the function is not continuous.

149
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.890
Right.

150
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.760
So the third point is pretty cool.

151
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.830
Third point says that number one needs to be equal to number two.

152
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:59.470
So f of a has to be the same as the limit of f of x

153
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.250
x approaches a.

154
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:06.890
Interesting.

155
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:14.310
So not only does it need to be defined for a and not only does the limit of f of x as x approaches a

156
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.680
must exist they have to be equal to each other.

157
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:25.080
If one of these three conditions is not true then the function is not continuous at that point where

158
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.740
X equals a.

159
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:33.030
And of course this might seem very complicated it will do a very cool mnemonic so you can actually remember

160
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.700
this very easily.

161
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:54.310
All right so here we have it our mnemonic is d equals L and I like to think about that as driver's license.

162
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.380
So what is this.

163
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.970
Well first of all the abbreviation of driver's license is DL.

164
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.290
That's where the d l comes from.

165
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.290
Now what does a D equals l mean.

166
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.170
So for a function to be continuous at a point three things need to happen.

167
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:20.510
So first of all the function needs to be defined at f of a.

168
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:34.280
Then the limit as x approaches a must exist that C L for limits and the definition must equal the limit.

169
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:40.980
Right so you have all those three rules in this simple statement that equals L.

170
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.950
So let me write this for you.

171
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:51.090
So the first thing that needs to happen is the function is defined

172
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.370
at f of a.

173
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:05.770
So when you plug in a into the function it gives you back a number because it's part of the domain then.

174
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:16.120
Point number two is the limit of f of x as x approaches A

175
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.190
exists.

176
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.140
Remember this means that the limit from the right is equal to the limit from the left.

177
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.400
And finally for the equal sign

178
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.880
right f of a

179
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.760
is equal to limit of f of x

180
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.970
x approaches a.

181
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:55.400
So if you plug in a into this function that's the same as finding the limit of the function as x approaches

182
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:55.920
a.

183
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.560
These two are equal.

184
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.920
All right so hopefully it's easier for you to remember.

185
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.400
I like to think of it the following way.

186
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.530
So a driver's license when you get it you don't have to get it every day.

187
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.970
You don't have to go to the DMV every single day to get your license right.

188
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.820
It's valid for a continuous period of time.

189
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.860
So that's how you make the connection.

190
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.560
Driver's license it's continuous.

191
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.130
And for that reason you can just say driver's license.

192
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.550
The abbreviation is d equals L.

193
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.450
And then from D L you get your three rules.

194
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:45.100
Number one the function is defined at f ave then number two the limit of f of x x approaches a exists

195
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:54.400
and then you're a third point which is that the D definition is equal to l the limit.

196
00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.480
Let's go over a quick example and let's find out if a function is continuous at different points.
