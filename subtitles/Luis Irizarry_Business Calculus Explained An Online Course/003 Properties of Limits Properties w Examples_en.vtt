00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.100
Are right.

2
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.370
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.840
All right.

4
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.100
So we just covered what limits are.

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.790
And now we're going to find out how exactly the work is so great.

6
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.330
So how do we use limits in business calculus.

7
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.080
You will be asked to find limits or functions as input x approaches a specific number.

8
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.030
Here's an example

9
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.410
so limit of 2 x squared.

10
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.710
I'm just putting it in parentheses.

11
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:12.190
We usually do 2 x squared plus 10 x as x approaches 3.

12
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.740
So in the last video we did two things.

13
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.200
Number one is we tried graphing the function and then you know with the graph of the function trying

14
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.080
to see which number it is approaching.

15
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.720
However that's not very efficient.

16
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.830
We don't want to graph every function that we want to find a limit for something else.

17
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.980
We tried was plugging in numbers that are approaching that three.

18
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.850
But again that's not really exact.

19
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.830
That was more like a guess because we have evidence that it's approaching a number.

20
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.490
But we want something that's more reliable and quicker to do and easier.

21
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.350
That is why we're going to learn how to solve limits algebraically by the way if you're one network

22
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.630
algebraically means Eumenes using algebra.

23
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.920
OK so we're just going to use numbers and letters.

24
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.730
All right.

25
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.920
So we're going to go back to this problem in a bit.

26
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.729
For now however let's first cover properties of limits so that you can know how to apply them when finding

27
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.030
the limits of functions.

28
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.840
So there are a couple of rules.

29
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.960
Now don't be scared by the number of rules that are because each one is pretty much doing the same thing.

30
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.660
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

31
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.140
So I'll go over each rule and I'll go ahead and give you an example right there.

32
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.390
So let's cover properties

33
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.790
of limit's

34
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.990
so property number one is

35
00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:01.140
the limit of a constant as x approaches A and A can be any number just equals the constant itself.

36
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.510
So remember what a constant function is a constant function looks like this x equals a number.

37
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.540
Right.

38
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.010
So for example it could be equals nine and on the other hand remember that a limit is the y value that

39
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.930
a function is approaching.

40
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.720
However remember that for a constant function the y values are always the same.

41
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.560
So it doesn't matter which way you're approaching here you're always going to be approaching the same

42
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.150
Y value which is the seed self.

43
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:47.730
So for example if I say limits of 9 9 is my F X as x approaches.

44
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.690
And again it doesn't matter what this number is.

45
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.820
It could be 22 that's still going to be 9.

46
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.340
Why.

47
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.920
Because this is a constant function and the y value of a constant function never changes.

48
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.670
So the limit of a constant It doesn't matter what you're approaching is the same constant and by the

49
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.660
way for all these rules I don't want you to memorize them just like that.

50
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.900
I want you to think about it.

51
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.470
So if you see the limit of a constant I want you to think to yourself.

52
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.070
OK.

53
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.120
So the y value of a constant never changes.

54
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.930
That means that doesn't matter which x value I'm approaching the limit is going to be c..

55
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.700
So once you think about it and you try to figure it out then you're going to have a much better chance

56
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.010
of getting the problem right.

57
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.710
I don't want you to look at this problem and just think oh limit of knowing what does that mean.

58
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.070
Well it's a constant.

59
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.070
So I wanted to go through that thought process and to try figuring out stuff that's a way that you're

60
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.230
going to succeed in the class.

61
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.530
OK so property number two.

62
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.490
So if you have a limit

63
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.140
of a constant times a function

64
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:19.740
as x approaches a then what you can do is you can take this constant outside of the limit.

65
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.540
You can bring it over here.

66
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.110
OK so this is going to be outside times.

67
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.070
And now we're going to get the regular limit.

68
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.230
So limits of fallbacks as x approaches a

69
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.190
right so what do we do.

70
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.920
We actually took this constant multiplying this function.

71
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:57.550
We take it outside and we just get the regular limit of f of x without the C because it sees now outside.

72
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.280
So for example you have it

73
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.740
of three x squared

74
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.790
x approaches 7

75
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.530
this equals Well remember we have a constant here.

76
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.570
There's three multiplying the x squared which is f a vector.

77
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.720
In this case.

78
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.020
So what we do is we take this three and we put it outside of the limit.

79
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:35.060
So we say three times and now we get the limit limits of remember that 3 is not there anymore because

80
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.810
it's outside.

81
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.060
So we just get the limit of x squared

82
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:50.970
as x approaches 7 by the way this is not solving the limit this is just using a property so that we

83
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.630
can eventually solve it later on we'll actually do some examples of what it means to solve a limit.

84
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.940
OK so let's go into our third property here.

85
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:16.200
So the third one is actually a combined property because we say if you have the limit of two functions

86
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:29.350
of x and g of X and the functions are either adding or subtracting one of the two as x approaches a

87
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:39.810
and I'll put these in parentheses then that equals the limit of the first plus or minus whichever one

88
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.660
you were doing.

89
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.080
The limit of this second.

90
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:52.330
So if you have the limit of f x plus or minus g of x x x approaches a that's going to be divided into

91
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.950
the limit of the first.

92
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:08.200
So Lim of f of x as x approaches a plus or minus the limit of g of X

93
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:18.980
as x approaches a arised or we're just breaking it up and doing the limit of each.

94
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:30.670
For example if I have that of x squared plus x cubed

95
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.990
as x approaches 2 then we have a sum.

96
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:47.760
So we can use property number three we can break it apart and say limits of x squared.

97
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:55.050
The first function as x approaches to and again don't forget this x approaches whatever.

98
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:01.230
For every limit that you do don't do only limit of x squared plus limit of execute right you got to

99
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.920
do this x approaches 2.

100
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:10.320
So we have limit of x squared as x approaches 2 plus because initially we're adding We just keep the

101
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:20.580
plus side limits of execute as x approaches 2.

102
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.660
And if this had been subtracting.

103
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.390
So if you had x squared minus execute.

104
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:34.190
The only difference would be that here instead of a plus you would have a minus.

105
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.530
Remember it's this property applies to both plus or minus.

106
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:45.940
So if you have X plus G of X then when you break it apart you're going to have a plus if you have F

107
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.200
X minus g of x and you are going to have a minus.

108
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.850
You just keep the same sign that you had initially.

109
00:09:53.870 --> 00:10:02.060
That's why here the limit of x squared plus X cute becomes the limit of x squared plus the limit of

110
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.590
execute.

111
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.880
All right so bear with me.

112
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.340
We're going to do just a couple more properties.

113
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.330
It's going to be over before you know it.

114
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.920
Just like the dentist said.

115
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.010
So for number four

116
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.670
the limits of

117
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.920
f of x times g of x

118
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.780
x approaches a 1 to take a guess.

119
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.380
I think you know the answer already.

120
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.080
The limit of a multiplication is just the multiplication of the limits.

121
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:47.490
So what we do here is we just get the limit of f of x x x approaches a times the limit of g of x.

122
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:55.670
So we just take the limit of each so as becomes limits of the first function f of x

123
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:15.020
as x approaches a times the limits of g of X as x approaches a.

124
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:24.290
All right so quick example let's use the same functions we had and the other problem limits of x squared

125
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.950
times execute as x approaches a.

126
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.870
So in theory you could just multiply them inside and you know at the exponents as you can that would

127
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.330
give you access to the five.

128
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.830
However for the purposes of this example let's break it up and apply that property.

129
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:50.600
So we have two functions that are multiplying x squared times x cubed.

130
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.250
So what we do is we get the limits of x squared

131
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.600
as x approaches.

132
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.370
And by the way I had a pusses were doing an actual problem.

133
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.870
This has to be a number so let's make it nine.

134
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.370
All right.

135
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:19.940
As x approaches 9 times because again we take the limit of the first times the limit of the second limit

136
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:26.810
of x cubed x approaches 9.

137
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.020
That's it.

138
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.950
Moving on to our next one.

139
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.960
So if we had multiplication we need to have the version right.

140
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.680
These two always go together.

141
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:44.140
So limit of f of x over g of x.

142
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:52.890
So here we are dividing two functions as x approaches a well as you might know already.

143
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.270
What we do is simply we get the limit of the top over the limit of the bottom.

144
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:07.780
So we have limits of X as x approaches a.

145
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:17.230
All of this over the limits of g of X as x approaches say

146
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.690
see an example limits

147
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:40.530
to x squared minus one over 4 x to the third.

148
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:47.250
So the limit of that as x approaches zero that's going to be equal to.

149
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.200
And again we use a property because we're dividing two functions.

150
00:13:51.200 --> 00:14:06.760
It's going to be the limit of the top limit of 2 x squared minus 1 as x approaches zero does not look

151
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.140
like a zero.

152
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:19.700
This one does over limits of 4 x cubed.

153
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.900
And again these parentheses you don't really have to put them.

154
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.540
Sometimes I do sometimes I don't.

155
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.740
It depends on the function.

156
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.490
It's up to you whether you want to keep them or not.

157
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:34.170
A limit of 4 x you as it approaches zero.

158
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.190
All right let's go to our number 6 which is are second to last property

159
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.830
so the limit of a function

160
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.200
raced to the nth power

161
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.490
as x approaches a.

162
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:09.110
So here we have the limit of a function that traced to a certain power and could be two could be three.

163
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:19.500
Could be whatever as x approaches a that just means that we're going to get the limit of f of x as x

164
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.700
approaches a and then we're going to raise the whole limit to the nth power.

165
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.360
So instead of only raising this function to the nth power we're going to take the limit first and then

166
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.510
raise everything to the nth power.

167
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.820
So limit of f of x to the n as x approaches a becomes

168
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:56.010
the limit of f of x as x approaches a and then the limit itself is a one being raised to the nth power.

169
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.590
So for example

170
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.450
limits of

171
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:22.260
X plus one to the third x approach is negative on this equals the limits of X plus 1.

172
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:28.800
So it's the function without the power as x approaches negative 1.

173
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:36.250
And then this whole limit to the third power.

174
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.160
All right.

175
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:43.630
So again you just take the limit of f of x and then when you get that you raise the whole limit to the

176
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.720
nth power.

177
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.040
And now we're going to do our last property for now which is number 7.

178
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.820
And it's kind of an extension of number 6.

179
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.680
But I'll do it as a separate property.

180
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.180
So it's more clear.

181
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.270
So if you have limits of

182
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:09.700
a roots of a function and the root doesn't have to be squared it could be you know the third root the

183
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.200
fourth root etc..

184
00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:21.520
So we'll just say n as x approaches a want to take a guess of course.

185
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.450
So we take.

186
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:33.840
And then you do the limit inside limit of f of x x approaches a

187
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.260
right.

188
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:44.210
So just like we did with the exponent rule where we take the limit of the function and then raise the

189
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.500
limit to the exponent.

190
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.870
Here we do it with a root.

191
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:56.350
We take the limit of f of x and then we put everything the whole limit under a root.

192
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.730
And by the way this is an.

193
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:16.330
So for example if you have the limits of the cube root of x squared plus three x approaches 1 that's

194
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.080
going to be equal to the roots of the whole thing.

195
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.560
Limits of just the function by itself.

196
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:34.120
So it's X queered plus three as x approaches 1.

197
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.480
And there you have it.

198
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.490
That is your limit.
