00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.220
So I wanted to mention that there is a special type of logarithm called the common logarithm.

2
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:38.210
So for example if you have logarithm of 16 with base 2 and we're looking for a number so that when you

3
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.030
race to to that number you get 16.

4
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.080
That number is going to be four because two times two times two times two.

5
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.580
So two multiplied by itself four times or two to four equals sixteen.

6
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.740
Two to four equals 16.

7
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.160
So in the examples we've done we always have a base.

8
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.730
But what happens if you do not have a base

9
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.630
to for example you have a log of 100 no base.

10
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.490
Well if you see no base then it is assumed that the base is a specific number.

11
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.140
And let's go into the definition of the common logarithm to check that out.

12
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.370
All right so here it is coming logarithm.

13
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.910
So a common logarithm is a logarithm with base 10.

14
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.170
And again this is implied if no base is specified.

15
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:49.990
So for example if I say let's find the log of 100 and the base is not specified then it's implied that

16
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.690
the base is 10.

17
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.530
OK.

18
00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.500
So in other words logarithm of a hundred equals logarithm of 100 with base 10.

19
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.860
All right so 10 is like the default value for logarithms.

20
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.790
If no other base is specified and there's no base then the base is 10.

21
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.030
All right.

22
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.090
And what would be the answer to this.

23
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.080
Well 10 raised raced toward power gives you 100 Well 10 times 10 is 100.

24
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.790
So the answer would be to because 10 to the two equals 100.

25
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.490
All right was to another example

26
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.120
log of a million.

27
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.100
All right.

28
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.950
So first thing that we check is what's the base.

29
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.320
The base is not specified.

30
00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.090
So that means that the base is 10 and to what number do we need to raise 10 to get to a million.

31
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.310
It's actually 6.

32
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.780
All right.

33
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.920
So that would be the answer to this problem.

34
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.170
So again very simple.

35
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.720
This is called the common logarithm and it's a logarithm with base 10.

36
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.540
If the base is not specified then the base is 10.

37
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.640
If it is specified and it says for example log of 100 base 2 then the base is literally 2.

38
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.970
But if nothing's there the base is 10.

39
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.020
That is a default value for logarithms.
