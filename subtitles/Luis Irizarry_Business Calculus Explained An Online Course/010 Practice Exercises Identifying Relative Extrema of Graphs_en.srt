1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,200
All right so now that we know about relative extrema In other words max and Menz let's identify them

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,060
and graphs.

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,310
So go ahead and identify other relative extrema in the following graph.

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,130
So I wanted to point out the max and the mens in this graph so go ahead and draw it out.

5
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,850
Pause the video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,940
All right.

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,390
So let's see this one shouldn't be too bad we're identifying relative extrema.

8
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,960
So all the relative Max and the relative minutes.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,690
So let's start with the Maxxis.

10
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,440
These are.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,970
Remember at the top of the mountain.

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:10,050
So we have a max here and then we go down.

13
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,940
And we have another max here.

14
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,400
And of course these are relative Max because that's all we've learned so far relative.

15
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,400
And what about the mints.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,410
Remember we're finding relative extrema.

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,490
So we need to find the men as well.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,360
So let's see.

19
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,840
Looks like we have a man right about here and relative men

20
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,920
and it looks like we have a men also down here.

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,870
All right.

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:57,120
So we have to Maxxis this one and this one and two men's this one and this one that is all the relative

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,640
extrema that we have in this graph.

24
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:07,700
Just a reminder that Maxxis are at the top of mountains and men's are at the bottom of these holes and

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,580
the names themselves say it Max.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Top high right men low.

27
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,490
That's pretty much it.

28
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,340
Let's check out another graph.

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,890
All right so here is our second graph.

30
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,370
Again identify all the relative extrema in the following graph.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
Go ahead and pause the video.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,480
Draw it out and give it a shot.

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,310
All right.

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,700
So let's go ahead and do it together.

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,080
And again this should be pretty easy.

36
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,850
So here we have a relative men because it's down there even though this one does not look like a traditional

37
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,710
men.

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,730
So this one doesn't look like this but that's OK.

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,230
It's still a point that's lower than all the other points that are nearby.

40
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,170
So that qualifies it as a mint.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,430
And as we go up seems that we have relative Max right there.

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,090
And then we keep going down.

43
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,120
We have a men over here

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:26,820
and then we go up again and it looks like we have a relative Max right here.

45
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,120
Finally we have a men right here

46
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,770
and it looks like that's it.

47
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:44,100
So remember it doesn't have to look like in you all the time for it to be a man nor like a mountain.

48
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:51,560
For it to be Max as long as a point is lower than all the other points nearby it can be relative men.

49
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:58,260
Same thing for the max as long as a point is higher than all the other points nearby that it can be

50
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,070
a relative Max as well.

51
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,270
All right.

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,490
So for a last example now we have two graphs.

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,350
So identify all the relative extrema in the following graphs.

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,990
We have a parabola that opens down and the parabola that opens up.

55
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,959
So go out and pause the video.

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,290
Draw it out and give it a shot.

57
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,040
All right so a little bit of a trick question not too much though.

58
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,260
So for this first graph.

59
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,460
So we go like this and we have a max summary here.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,470
Relative Max not only is it a relative Max is actually an absolute max because it is the highest point

61
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,560
in all of this graph.

62
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,780
So to the left it goes down and to the right it also goes down.

63
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,850
So it doesn't get any higher than this but we haven't this cause absolute extrema so we don't need to

64
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,070
get into that for sure though it is a relative max.

65
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,260
However what would be the relative men in this graph.

66
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,450
Well it's kind of hard to tell right.

67
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,180
This goes down forever and ever on both sides left and right.

68
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,570
So it turns out that this graph does not have any mens so no Men's

69
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,980
I want you to be aware that this is possible.

70
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,560
Some times graphs will not have any relative Max or any relative mennes.

71
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,580
So for example if a graph is always going up then it's not going to have a max.

72
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,340
And if a graph is always going down then it's not going to have a min.

73
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,480
In this case it goes up up to here.

74
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,570
But after that we did not have any mindes because it always goes down.

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,820
Let's check out the example next to it.

76
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,050
So for this one.

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,750
Well if we go down it looks like we have a men somewhere around here.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,240
Right.

79
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,210
Relative min.

80
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,310
But after that is the graph just grows and grows and grows.

81
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,120
So it keeps going up for that reason.

82
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,920
This graph has no max

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
Maxxis I guess we'll say.

84
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,310
All right.

85
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,700
So this one has no means again because after you get to the max it goes down forever never comes back

86
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,510
up.

87
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:36,670
And this one has no Maxxis because as you get to this point it just goes on and on and on up forever.

88
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:43,070
So there's not really a relative Max because it grows infinitely.

89
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,410
All right.

90
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:51,750
So if you're asked to find relative extrema sometimes your answer will be there are no max or no mins

91
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,550
or neither.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,550
Sometimes there are neither Max or Mint's and this is not part of the example but I'll put it here just

93
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,520
in case.

94
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:13,340
So what if you have a line like this.

95
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,200
Do you have a man.

96
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,970
Well not really because the graph is always going up.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,500
So what happens with this one is this graph is always increasing but then it never goes down.

98
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,130
It's not like this one where it increases a lot and then it goes down forever.

99
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,070
Nor like this one where it decreases and then it increases forever.

100
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,270
This one Joh's increases infinitely.

101
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:49,970
Therefore this line over here has no relative extrema.

102
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,330
It doesn't have any points that are higher than the ones above.

103
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,450
So if you picked for example random points over here the points on the left are lower but the point

104
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,060
on the right are higher.

105
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:12,430
So it's neither a man nor a max Maxxis have points that are lower on both sides to the left and to the

106
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,740
right and many have points that are higher to the left and to the right.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,670
But for example this points is lower on the left and higher on the right.

108
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,380
So no relative extrema.

109
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,800
That is it for relative extrema.

110
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,340
Later on we'll see how to find relative extrema using derivatives.
