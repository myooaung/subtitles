00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,640
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,050
This is going to be a short one.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,670
I just want to go over quickly the different types of notations for derivatives.

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:36,960
Now before we do that I want you to remember one thing remember that y equals f of x.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,940
This is the typical notation for a function.

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,190
Right.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,860
So we have that why is the output

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,880
we have that x is the input

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,790
and that is the rule that you apply to the input to take this input X you put it through a rule f and

10
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,040
then that gives you a result.

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,050
Why.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,770
Remember we talked about this in the first last and I think it was the very beginning where we were

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,710
talking about functions.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:19,370
So knowing that y equals f of x we can jump in into the notations for derivatives.

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,780
So we have three main ways of denoting derivatives.

16
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:28,300
So the first one is the prime notation

17
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,200
that is number one.

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,770
So how does a prime notation look.

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:56,340
Well if we are given a function f of x then its derivative is f prime of x so f prime of X is just f

20
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,770
of x with the apostrophe in between.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,050
That's called the prime.

22
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,280
Kind of like Amazon Prime.

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,199
So this is read as if Prime of x

24
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,110
so when it looks like this f prime of X this is a derivative function if you want to find the derivative

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,190
at a specific point you would just say f prime and then you would actually plug in the x value.

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,230
So for example Prime of 3.

27
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,120
All right.

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,660
Prime of 10 prime of 0.

29
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,390
So remember what we talked about where derivative can either mean the derivative function or it can

30
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,370
mean the specific rate of change after you have found the function.

31
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,500
So you either find the function or you find the function and then you plug in an x value.

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,070
Also because we know that y equals f of x we know that the derivative of this can also look like y prime.

33
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,690
Right so f of x is the same as y.

34
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,820
So instead of saying f prime of X we can say y prime.

35
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,900
OK.

36
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,250
So this is a prime notation.

37
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,310
All you do is you put an apostrophe in between the F and the x or you just put it at the end of the

38
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,900
Y and that gives you your derivative.

39
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:30,600
That's how you know you're dealing with derivatives the second one is the differential notation.

40
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,980
You don't really need to know the names of each of each of these.

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,000
All you need to know is OK to have a prime to have a differential.

42
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,230
OK I'm dealing with a derivative.

43
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,070
All right.

44
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,160
So the differential notation

45
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,700
looks something like this.

46
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,190
Do you why over dx.

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,800
All right.

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,280
So D-y over dx it looks like a fraction but it really isn't.

49
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,840
We don't really need to get too technically into what it is and what it isn't just know that this means

50
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,750
that you're finding the derivative of Y.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,720
So here finding derivative

52
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,930
of Y.

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,540
All right.

54
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:29,930
By the same token because y equals X we can also say the f of x and we'll put this in parentheses over

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,380
the X right.

56
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,610
This means pretty much the same thing.

57
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,250
So you have D and instead of Y we put at the actual f of x over dx.

58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:49,650
Now if you want to find the derivative at a specific x value with this notation what you do is you can

59
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,320
say something like D-y dx

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,970
and you draw those vertical line and then down here you say when X equals three for example this means

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,600
find the derivative function and plug in three.

62
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:14,250
When you find that derivative function this would be the same as what we have here Prime of 3 is the

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,090
same as D-y over dx at X equals 3 Inka.

64
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:30,630
So don't get confused if you see something like Deal dx of x squared remember this is the derivative

65
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,540
of x squared and we know already that the answer is to x.

66
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,670
All right.

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
That's pretty much it.

68
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,430
We'll do a couple of examples in the problem section so you can get acquainted with each of these and

69
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,470
then we have the last one.

70
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,710
This one we don't really see a lot.

71
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,340
Personally I haven't seen this one in our calculus courses that I've taken but I'll throw it in just

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,220
in case.

73
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,930
And it's called Euler's notation

74
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,420
and it looks something like this.

75
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,860
So dx with a small x right there of f of x.

76
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,380
All right.

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,150
So here we're saying find the derivative of f of x.

78
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:37,820
But this one again is not really used at all.

79
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,430
All right.

80
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,420
So the main thing I want you to take away from this is number one and number two.

81
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,710
So the prime notation and the differential notation.

82
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,510
So again the prime notation you have this apostrophe whenever you see an apostrophe that means you need

83
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,640
to find a derivative.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,980
So if you see for example f prime of X that means find the derivative function.

85
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,650
However if you see f prime of 3 that means find the derivative function and plug 3 into it.

86
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,730
OK.

87
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,820
And prime of x can also be called Y prime.

88
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,290
Right.

89
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:21,640
And for the differential notation the main notation is D-y DX which again kind of looks like a fraction.

90
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,560
This just means find the derivative of Y.

91
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,600
All right.

92
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:34,570
And this can also be written as d of f of x over DX right because f of x is the same as y.

93
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,670
And finally to find it at a specific point you just say Do y x x x equals 3.

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:50,880
And here's an example D over dx of x squared is just a derivative of x squared which is 2 x.

95
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,330
Very quick summary of what we just covered.

96
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,930
Like we said there are three main notations for derivatives.

97
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,980
You have prime you have differential and you have Euler's.

98
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,420
So just to put them here again in prime.

99
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,880
You have this little apostrophe.

100
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,950
And that's what's called the prime.

101
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,930
So it can look something like a prime of x which is the same as y prime.

102
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,010
Right.

103
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,730
Or you could have to add a specific points.

104
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,240
So prime of 5 for example.

105
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,460
All right.

106
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,960
Then you have the differential notation which is the one that looks like a fraction.

107
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:41,740
So the Y over DX which can also be written as d dx of f of x

108
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,130
and we know this because we know that y equals f of X..

109
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,470
So instead of using Y we can also use F X.

110
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,130
OK.

111
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:04,170
And if you want to find it at a specific point you do D-y dx at X equals whatever X equals 11 for example.

112
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,190
Right.

113
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,560
And finally we have Euler's notation which again we don't really use it where you have it in the form

114
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:20,960
of for example DX f of x that means find the derivative of f of x and that's pretty much it.

115
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,110
So the main ones like I said are prime and differential.

116
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,610
Those are the ones that you will see in your textbook all over the place.

117
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:35,630
And the main takeaway is whenever you see an apostrophe or a D-y over ADX you know you're dealing with

118
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,540
derivatives.

119
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,670
So you know you need to find some sort of derivative function.

120
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,190
Maybe you need to plug in a number into it.

121
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:49,190
Etc. but it's very important not to get confused between f of x and its derivative.

122
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,230
One thing is the original function f of x something else is its derivative.

123
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,310
If you plug in a number into the Runk function.

124
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,720
So for example if instead of plugging it into a derivative you plug it into the original function.

125
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,060
It's not going to work.

126
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,850
All right.

127
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,740
So that's pretty much it for annotations of derivatives you get acquainted with these notations very

128
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,940
quickly because we'll be doing a lot of derivative problems.

129
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,150
So again there's nothing to worry about and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
