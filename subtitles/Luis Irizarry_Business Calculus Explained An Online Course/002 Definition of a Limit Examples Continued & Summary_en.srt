1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,600
So continuing on with this problem we're about to determine the limit of f of x as x approaches 1 from

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:41,150
the right limit of X as x approaches one from the right equals what.

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,470
Well let's build another table.

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,620
So by the way when you're approaching it from the left that means that the numbers are getting bigger.

5
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,260
Right.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,310
Because if you have for example a number line

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:19,190
and you have one here that means that to the left of one have 0.9 zero point nine nine etc. up until

8
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:28,670
you get to 1 and then to the right of one you have one point zero or one let's divide these over here

9
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,080
we go

10
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,220
Warrenpoint won etc..

11
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,670
So once here if you approach it from the left the numbers keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

12
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:49,170
If you approach one from the right then the numbers need to get smaller and smaller and smaller.

13
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:49,760
All right.

14
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,410
So that's why here we are approaching it from the left.

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,270
Then the numbers that we have we're getting bigger.

16
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,990
We went from zero point nine to zero point nine nine nine.

17
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,620
We're going to do the opposite.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,400
When you're approaching it from the right so as x approaches one from the right well we can pick a couple

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:27,290
of values that are close so we can say WAHM point one one point 0 1 and 1 point 0 0 1.

20
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,430
So you can probably tell that these numbers are getting smaller and smaller because again we're approaching

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,690
it from the right.

22
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,780
And again I have the values ready for you and the values are.

23
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:48,690
So for a one point one it's three point two for a one point zero and one is three point zero two.

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:57,320
And then for a one point zero zero one it's three point zero zero two.

25
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,080
Check it out as your eggs gets closer and closer to one from the right.

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,280
In other words as the numbers get smaller and smaller and closer to one the y values.

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,390
What are they approaching.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,230
Well first you have 3.2 then three point zero two and three point zero zero two Ha.

29
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,220
It looks like it's approaching three as well.

30
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,670
Right.

31
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,240
It's getting closer and closer to three.

32
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:33,560
So the limit of f of x as x approaches 1 from the left is three and the limit of f of x x x approaches

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,420
1 from the right is 3.

34
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,160
So the limits are the same if you approach this one from the left.

35
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,170
The value is approaching is three.

36
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,590
And if you approach it from the right the value is also approaching 3.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,820
So the limit from the left and from the right are equal.

38
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,580
That means that the limit exists but that's something that will cover in a later section.

39
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,220
What I want you to get though is again as we get closer from the left the numbers get bigger and bigger

40
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,170
and bigger.

41
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,860
And as you get closer from the right the numbers get smaller and smaller and smaller.

42
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,710
All right.

43
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,750
So how is this going to help you in business calculus.

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,399
Well in business calculus you will sometimes be asked to find limits or functions.

45
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,810
Sometimes you'll have a graph.

46
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,210
Sometimes you won't.

47
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,570
And it really depends on what type of problem you get.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,260
But this is a good introduction to what limits are and some of these problems are straightforward some

49
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,880
other limits problems.

50
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,440
They actually require some sort of manipulation.

51
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,740
I will go into detail in later sections.

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,710
So right now let's just go to our summary.

53
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,150
All right.

54
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,090
So a quick summary for the intro to limits.

55
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,410
Again a Limits is a Y value.

56
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,880
And again I emphasize that because it's very important Ltd's the y value function is approaching.

57
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,430
That's another key word here as it's x value approaches a number.

58
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:14,000
So again as the input approaches a number the output approaches another number for limits.

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,170
The keyword is approaching.

60
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,310
It doesn't matter what the actual value is at the point.

61
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,150
Remember we did the piecewise function.

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,670
Jump from one point to the next.

63
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,230
It doesn't matter that the function is not defined for that x value.

64
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:37,470
What matters is if it's approaching the y value notation for limits is the following that is limit or

65
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:49,210
a limb of f of x which is your function as x approaches c and c is again the number they are approaching

66
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,430
the x value then that equals to L which is a limit.

67
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,770
Limits can be found as x approaches a number from the left or from the right.

68
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,980
Remember we did two examples.

69
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,690
If it's from the left the approaching x values get bigger.

70
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:15,490
So you for approaching 1 then you want to try 0.9 0.9 nine zero point nine nine nine etc. that's approaching

71
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,520
it from the left and the values that you're trying out.

72
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,910
They are smaller than one but they keep getting bigger and bigger and closer to one from the right.

73
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,950
It's the opposite if it's from the right they get smaller.

74
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,830
So the approaching x values they are bigger than 1 but they are getting smaller and smaller.

75
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,720
So 1.1 one point zero one one point zero zero one etc. etc..

76
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,270
All right so that's it for the intro to limits.

77
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,110
We'll learn a lot more about limits on how they work and what their properties are in the next sections.

78
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,640
So I'll see you in the next tutorial.
