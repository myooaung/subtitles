00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.320
All right.

2
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.810
So let's do a couple of exercises with the constant multiple rules.

3
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.870
So first one says find f prime of X if f of x equals 3 x to the 8.

4
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.650
So the constant multiple here is three and it's multiplying this x to the 8.

5
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560
I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

6
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.700
All right.

7
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.620
So remember are a constant multiple rule says.

8
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.010
It says if you have a constant multiplying a function you can leave the constant outside get the derivative

9
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.720
of the function and then multiply the constant back end.

10
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.210
So here we have a constant and we have a power function.

11
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.970
So we're going to use both the constant multiple rule and the power rule.

12
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.550
All right.

13
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.770
So a derivative is

14
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.560
or a constant.

15
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.150
We put it on the side so we have three times the derivative of the function x to the 8.

16
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:31.670
So we just bring down our dictator eight and we substitute by a last power for leader so eight minus

17
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.670
one that becomes a seven.

18
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.330
So sometimes I'm not going to put the actual 8 minus 1.

19
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.110
I'll just go straight to the 7.

20
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.300
And once you're comfortable with the power rule you can do that too.

21
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.720
So just remember that we substitute a less powerful leader.

22
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.880
So eight minus one becomes a seven.

23
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.950
All right.

24
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.560
And finally we'll just multiply the two constants Three times eight.

25
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.820
That gives us 24 x to the seventh and we are done.

26
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.110
That is our answer.

27
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.490
All right.

28
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:24.240
Moving on to our next exercise find prime of X if f of x equals 9 x I'll let you pause a video and give

29
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.150
it a shot.

30
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.800
OK.

31
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.140
So let's find the derivative are a constant is nine.

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.740
So we put it on the side and we get the derivative of X..

33
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.330
Now remember what is the derivative of x.

34
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.140
So we bring down a dictator so our dictator is actually won right.

35
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.670
To the one we just don't market.

36
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.010
So we really have to bring it down because it's going to make a difference.

37
00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.770
Right.

38
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.980
And then we substitute a less powerful one.

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.550
So we have one minus one on top.

40
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.100
That's going to be nine times X to zero.

41
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.490
Now remember anything to 0 is 1.

42
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.850
Right.

43
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.530
So this becomes a one

44
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.380
that gives nine times one which is nothing

45
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.790
and 9 is our answer.

46
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:44.310
All right so anytime you have this form or you have a constant times X and X you know is only to the

47
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.950
first power not to the second or third just x by itself then the derivative is always going to be just

48
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.780
the constant.

49
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.790
But again it's just super easy to do is go ahead and put the constant aside get the derivative of X.

50
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.290
That's going to give you one and you stay with the constant at the end.

51
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.730
So that is nine.

52
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:17.890
All right for a last example find prime of X if X equals negative 10 x to the negative 10.

53
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.750
I'll let you pause the video and try it out.

54
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.970
All right.

55
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.700
So the same thing we need to use the constant multiple rule for the negative 10.

56
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:40.690
And then the power rule for the X to the negative 10 derivative of this is we put a constant on the

57
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.320
side.

58
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.000
So we put this negative 10 here we multiply by our dictator which we need to bring down.

59
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.460
So this negative 10 comes down multiplying

60
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.050
and then and we have X substituted by a less powerful leader.

61
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:10.730
So negative 10 minus 1 and what do we have we have negative 10 times negative 10 10 times 10 is 100.

62
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.560
Now they're both negative.

63
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.730
Remember that when two things are negative and you multiply them they become positive.

64
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.100
So this negative 10 times negative 10 becomes a hundred

65
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.570
right.

66
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.210
And then you have X to the if you owe $10 and you spend one more then you're going oh 11

67
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.020
and that is your answer.

68
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.290
Now if this had been for example of x.

69
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:59.020
This is another quick example half of X equals 10 x to the negative 10.

70
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.630
So to get the derivative of this one we do the same thing.

71
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.180
I just want to show you something with science.

72
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.980
So we'll put the 10 on this side.

73
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.720
We're bring down a dictator negative 10 and the exponent becomes negative 11.

74
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.740
As you know.

75
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:25.070
So in this case you have positive 10 times negative 10 positive times a negative is a negative.

76
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.270
Right.

77
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.910
So this is negative.

78
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.470
One hundred X to the negative 11.

79
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.560
All right so remember if you multiply two positive or two negatives the result is positive.

80
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.710
I'll put this right here.

81
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:50.970
So if it's positive times positive or negative times negative then the result is positive.

82
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:03.550
On the other hand if you have a positive times and negative or a negative times a positive then the

83
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.370
result is negative.

84
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:13.680
In other words same sign positive results different sign negative results.

85
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.770
So these here are the same sign.

86
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.960
And these here are different signs.

87
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.430
Right.

88
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.570
And this works for both multiplication and division.

89
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.530
So if you have two things that are dividing and they have the same sign the result is positive.

90
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.410
If you have two things that are dividing but there are different signs then the result is negative.

91
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.040
All right.

92
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.550
That is pretty much it for our constant multiple rule.

93
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.490
And a quick reminder remember you have to do your homework whatever your professor assigned to you.

94
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.050
You have to do it.

95
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.670
I like to do exercises so we can put into practice and to get just started.

96
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.940
However the homework assignments that you get from your class are going to be the ones that determine

97
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.840
what's going to be in the exams.

98
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.270
So you're always always always have to do those.

99
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:18.580
Don't get lazy don't come here and just do the ones that I give you because again this is not enough

100
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.370
practice.

101
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.690
You need to do the ones that you get assigned.

102
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.900
So I don't give you a ton of exercises because I want you to do the ones that your professor gives you

103
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.270
every basis calculus class is different.

104
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.640
There's not a one size fits all.

105
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.960
So you have to do your homework.

106
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.750
All right and I'll see you in the next Tauriel.
