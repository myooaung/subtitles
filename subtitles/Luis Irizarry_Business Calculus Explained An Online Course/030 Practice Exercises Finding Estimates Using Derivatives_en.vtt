1
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.860
All right.

2
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.370
So let's get into marginal analysis.

3
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.790
Let's start with this exercise.

4
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.530
A company that builds coffee machines calculates that their weekly costs.

5
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.490
So we're dealing with the costs are given by the function see of X equals 0.10 x squared plus 154 X

6
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.380
minus 20 where X is the number of machines produced.

7
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.120
So we have three questions.

8
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.660
A estimate the cost of producing the one hundredth unit.

9
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.610
Look at the keyword estimate then be calculate the actual cost of producing unit 100 and see calculate

10
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.690
the actual cost of producing a hundred units.

11
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.310
Yes b and c are different things.

12
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.800
Unit 100 is different than 100 units.

13
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.950
All right so might be a little tricky but I want you to get in the habit of understanding marginal analysis

14
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.160
problems.

15
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.540
So go ahead.

16
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.590
Pause the video and give this one a shot.

17
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.140
All right.

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.240
So we have a cost function and then for a one to estimate the cost of producing the 100 units.

19
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.530
So of course the first thing we need to do is find the marginal cost.

20
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.210
Lets call this MC.

21
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.400
Marginal Cost is a derivative of the cost.

22
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:54.700
So marginal cost will be the prime of X right and the derivative of this.

23
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.210
So we have constant multiple.

24
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.410
We have a constant so we put it on the outside that 0.10 times bring our dictator down six times to

25
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.610
X one of less power.

26
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.410
Gives you one.

27
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.290
So we dont market plus constant multiple 1:54

28
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.820
and the derivative of X is just one minus the derivative of 20 which is a constant which is zero.

29
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.450
All right.

30
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:38.110
So in other words our marginal cost function is 0.10 times two is 0.20

31
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.490
X plus 1:54.

32
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.650
All right so were being asked to estimate the cost of producing the 100 units.

33
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.670
So remember we have a mnemonic for this.

34
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.750
The mnemonic says marginal minus one.

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.320
So if we want to estimate the cost of producing unit one hundred marginal minus one tells us that we

36
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.930
need to plug in ninety nine into this marginal cost function.

37
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.350
So instead of plugging in a hundred marginal minus one its going to be a hundred minus one which is

38
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.270
ninety nine see Prime of ninety nine.

39
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.630
This is the secret sauce of marginal analysis.

40
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.050
You plug in one less than the unit that you're looking for.

41
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:40.400
So we're going to plug in ninety nine here so it's going to be 0.20 x.

42
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.810
So we plug in 99 right here

43
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.940
plus 1:54.

44
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.970
If you actually go ahead and plug that in into a calculator that's going to give you one seventy three

45
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.170
point eight and we're talking about dollars.

46
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.590
So I'll put this sign over here.

47
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.870
So our estimate for the cost of producing unit 100 is one hundred seventy three dollars and eighty cents.

48
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.740
Right.

49
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.060
That is the answer for this nice.

50
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.610
All right.

51
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.240
So now we want to calculate the actual cost.

52
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:21.769
All right.

53
00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:27.960
We're not estimating anymore we're calculating the actual cost of producing unit 100.

54
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.070
So here we estimated the cost of producing that unit 100.

55
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.520
Now we want the actual cost of that.

56
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520
So think about this function the cost function.

57
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.200
This one tells you the weekly cost of producing X amount of machines right.

58
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.300
So if you want to find how much 10 machines cost you plug in 10 if you want to find out how much 50

59
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.560
machines cost.

60
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.420
Then you plug in 50 etc..

61
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.810
So we want to find the cost of producing not a hundred units but the cost of producing that specific

62
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.210
unit number one hundred.

63
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.120
There is a difference it is the same unit that we found here.

64
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.880
Unit 100.

65
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.240
So to find the actual cost of producing unit 100 Like I explained in the tutorial what you do is you

66
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.200
find the cost of producing 100 units and you subtract the cost of producing 99 units.

67
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.000
Right.

68
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.840
What's left must be the cost of this last unit and you do not do this with the derivative.

69
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.340
Remember the derivative is only to estimate.

70
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.840
We do this with the actual cost function.

71
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.300
So what we want to find is c of 100 the cost of producing 100 units.

72
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.470
Mine is c of 99.

73
00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:02.800
The cost of producing 99 units so it will plug in 100 and we'll plug in 99 into this function.

74
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.470
So c of 100 was plug in 100 right.

75
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:23.300
Here we have zero point 0.10 times 100 squared plus 154 times a hundred minus 20.

76
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.760
All of this mine is.

77
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.620
And remember this minus.

78
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:34.480
After that we had to put up parentheses because everything else that follows is minus OK its c of a

79
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.710
hundred minus C of ninety nine.

80
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.250
Now we're doing the C of ninety nine part.

81
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.490
So we're going to plug in 99 again into this c of x.

82
00:06:45.690 --> 00:07:02.680
So 0.10 times ninety nine squared plus 154 times ninety nine minus 20.

83
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.190
So let's continue this down here and again feel free to use a calculator for this 100 times 100 is ten

84
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:16.030
thousand ten thousand times point 10 is 1000.

85
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:31.100
So we have 1000 plus 154 times 100 is 15000 400 minus 20.

86
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.850
That is the C of 100 and then we do minus open parentheses.

87
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:48.910
And here we're going to put this c of ninety nine ninety nine squared times 0.10 is eighty times on

88
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:58.210
plus 154 times ninety nine is two 246

89
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.530
minus 20 OK.

90
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.600
So if you grab all of this and you put it in a calculator.

91
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.530
In other words if you grab this sea of 100 that's going to give you one thousand plus fifteen thousand

92
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:31.890
four hundred that is sixteen thousand four hundred minus 20 is three hundred eighty minus whatever this

93
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.490
part was.

94
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:40.970
So let's calculate that eighty point one plus fifteen thousand two hundred and forty six is sixteen

95
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.669
two to six point one.

96
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:54.160
And if you subtract the 20 from that gives you 16 2 or 6 point 1.

97
00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:06.510
Finally if we subtract this from this we're going to get our final answer 173 point nine dollars.

98
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.380
There we go.

99
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.090
That is the answer to this second question.

100
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.820
And actually if you check it out.

101
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.800
So the actual cost of producing unit 100 is 173 0.9.

102
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.600
Our estimate was one seventy three point eight.

103
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.170
That's a pretty good estimate.

104
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.540
It just differs by 10 cents.

105
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.540
Not bad at all.

106
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.980
All right.

107
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.620
And for the last question calculate the actual cost of producing 100 units.

108
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:41.760
So and B we found the cost of producing one unit unit 100 here we want to find the actual cost of producing

109
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.110
the first 100 units.

110
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.010
So all we need to do is plug in 100 into this function for cost.

111
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:56.870
However we already did that in problem B because remember we did see over 100 minus C of 99.

112
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.690
So the amount that we want is actually this one right here.

113
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:07.890
This is c of 100 to see of 100 equals

114
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.020
sixteen thousand three hundred eighty

115
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.580
And that is our answer down here.

116
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.200
All right.

117
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.400
So that is set for this problem.

118
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.760
Again we got a cost function.

119
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.780
So if we want to estimate the cost of producing unit 100 then we find the derivative of this marginal

120
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.420
cost and we plug in one less.

121
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:42.290
So if we want to find for the one hundredth unit we had to plug in 99 next we found the actual cost

122
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.750
of producing that unit one hundred.

123
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:51.620
So thats going to be the cost of the first 100 units minus the cost of the first ninety units.

124
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:58.100
The difference between the two must be the cost of that last one hundredth units.

125
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.570
And in fact we got here that it was one seventy three point nine.

126
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.390
Our estimate was one seventy three point eight.

127
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.060
That was pretty close.

128
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:14.210
And finally to calculate the actual cost of producing 100 units again that was just sea of 100 because

129
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:22.940
were calculating the cost of producing units 1 through 100 altogether different than just unit 100 here

130
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:30.830
were counting all of the units from 1 to 100 and we already had this number because we calculated it

131
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:38.820
and B so the cost of producing 100 units is sixteen thousand three hundred and eighty.

132
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.270
That's it for this problem.
