1
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,170
All right.

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,940
So let's go ahead and quickly cover the properties of integrals.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,940
Now using these properties combined with the rules that we just covered you'll be able to do a lot of

4
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,180
simple integrals and of course you could think of these as rules as well but I wanted to call them properties

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,690
to differentiate them from the actual rules for finding integrals.

6
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,700
All right but you'll see that these two actually resemble a lot the constant multiple rule for derivatives

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,920
and the sum differential for derivatives as well.

8
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,270
Very similar.

9
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,510
All right.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,920
So let's start with a constant multiple.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,710
By this point you already know what a constant multiple is.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,840
It is a constant That's multiplying a function.

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,430
So the rule says the following.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:19,380
If you have the integral of a constant k times a function f of x then you can simply take out this k.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:29,110
You put out the constant outside and then you keep your integral with the function only to see all we

16
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,620
did.

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:37,030
We took this constant k to the outside multiplying and then we just leave the integral of f of x so

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,040
we get the integral of of of X and we multiply it by this k.

19
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,760
Let's do an example.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:54,380
Let's say that we have integral of 5 x to the second power dx so check it out.

21
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,260
We have a constant multiplying this x squared.

22
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,580
Constance 5.

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,770
So that is our AK.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:08,780
We're going to take this constant and put it outside so we do 5 and then we do integral of whatever's

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,250
left which is your function f of x which is x squared.

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,740
DX right.

27
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,140
So again we have a five on the outside and let's find the integral of x squared.

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,320
As you know what we do is we increase and divide.

29
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,840
So we add 1 to the exponents.

30
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:39,060
That's X to the third and we divide it by the exponent which is 3.

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,990
So the 5 is multiplying this execute over 3.

32
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,550
And then we have the plus C at the end.

33
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,210
And this is our answer.

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,180
One thing is we're multiplying the five by the whole integral.

35
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,460
So you might be tempted to multiply the C by the 5 as well.

36
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,050
You don't really need to do that but to be honest it really doesn't matter because C already stands

37
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,450
for any constant.

38
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,440
So if you multiplied by 5 it's still going to be a constant and its derivative will still be 0.

39
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,740
But in general the way we do it is we just multiply the five by this first part and then we do the plus.

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,890
See.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,570
All right.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,650
Let's do another example.

43
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,900
Integral of three over x dx.

44
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,650
Right.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,260
So we have a constant this 3.

46
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,490
So we take it outside

47
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:47,310
and then we have to row of we only have a one left within the integral So that's 1 over x.

48
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,460
Right.

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,200
So if you're confused as to why it's 1 remember we had a 3.

50
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,220
We took it outside.

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,950
That leaves a 1 because three times one is three.

52
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:04,960
All right the D-Backs and let's continue over here.

53
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:12,030
All right so we have three times what is the integral of one over X we just cover this and it is L-N

54
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,930
of the absolute value of x.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,230
So it's being multiplied by this 3 which we took outside and then we do plus see and that is our answer

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,710
right.

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,380
That's it for the constant multiple.

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,510
You take it outside.

59
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,200
You do your integral is regular and then you multiply it back in.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,980
Now the sum of difference property it's very similar to the sum and different SRU and derivatives.

61
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:50,860
It says that for example if you have the integral of a sum or a difference of two functions

62
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,070
then this equals to the roll of the first plus or minus whichever one you're doing.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,930
The integral of the second.

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:13,560
So that is equal to integral of x the X plus or minus the integral of the second function of x dx.

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:13,940
All right

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,290
and of course it doesn't have to be only two functions and could be three four five six seven whatever

67
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,910
whatever number of functions.

68
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,740
What you do is you take the end a rule and you keep the sine in between them exactly like we do with

69
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,830
the sum and different rules for derivatives.

70
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,720
Instead of finding the derivative we're doing the integral of each.

71
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,180
So let's do an example

72
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,110
integral of 3 x squared for

73
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,420
all right.

74
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,070
So we're adding two functions.

75
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,410
We have 3 x squared and we're adding that to 4.

76
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,920
So what we do is we break it apart using this rule and we take the integral of each.

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,440
So for the first couple of problems I'll do the whole thing.

78
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,800
But later on we'll just abbreviated and do it directly.

79
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,810
But for now let's break it down step by step integral of three x squared.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,700
That is your first function right.

81
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:26,450
Plus integral of four right.

82
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,840
All right.

83
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,160
So let's take the integral of this first one.

84
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,600
Well what do we have.

85
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,800
We have a constant.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,190
Right.

87
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,370
So this constant three That's multiplying the x squared.

88
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,770
We can take it outside.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,320
So that's three on the outside integral of x squared DX

90
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,510
plus.

91
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,680
So we keep the plus.

92
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,810
And then we have the integral of four.

93
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,420
Remember that the rule of a constant is the same as saying the constant times x.

94
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:05,650
Right so the integral of four is basically going to be 4 x plus C we cover that in the last video right.

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,230
So we still want to do this integral right here.

96
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,130
Let's see what that is.

97
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,890
So we have three times.

98
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,690
What's the integral of x squared.

99
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,100
Remember increase and divide.

100
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,120
So we have x 3 right.

101
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,050
So we increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponents.

102
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,300
Now here's one thing when you have a sum or difference of different functions you don't need to add

103
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,720
the C on each single integral.

104
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,920
You only added once at the end.

105
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,570
All right.

106
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,940
So you don't need to do it several times as long as you have a plus C at the end then that's great.

107
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,160
So for example for this first integral we don't need to say 3 x cubed over 3 plus C and then add there's

108
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,940
4 x policy again.

109
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,880
That's going to give you two C's.

110
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,580
So since we already have this plus see here we're not going to add it to this one.

111
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,220
We're just going to add this whole part.

112
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,920
So plus 4 x plus C.

113
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:18,470
And here we have three over 3 so that cancels out and the final answer is x cubed plus for X plus seat.

114
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,160
All right.

115
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,040
So we got the integral of the first one.

116
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,390
We added that to the integral of the second one.

117
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,580
And then we added a plus C at the end.

118
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,170
Right.

119
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,380
That is our answer.

120
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,809
Let's do one more.

121
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:54,560
But this time let's do it subtracting.

122
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,950
All right.

123
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,500
So we have the integral of x to the fourth minus X squared dx.

124
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,220
So let's go ahead and do it.

125
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,220
And what we'll do is we'll use the rule to break it apart.

126
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,780
So we have the end row of the first minus the integral of the second.

127
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:19,320
So that's the rule of x to the fourth dx and that's going to be minus because we keep the sign in the

128
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,500
middle.

129
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,680
The integral of x squared dx and again these two are different problems.

130
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,390
So let me separate them here.

131
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:30,990
All right.

132
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,670
And let's get the integral of these two.

133
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,180
So again what we do is increase and divide for the first one.

134
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:50,150
So we have X to 5 over 5 minus increase and divide for the second one.

135
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,960
So X to the third two plus one over three plus C and there we have it.

136
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,610
This is our answer.

137
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,450
So see how easy it is when you have a sum or a difference of different functions you take the integral

138
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,330
of each and then you keep the sign in the middle.

139
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,630
If they're adding then you put a plus or subtracting then you put a minus.

140
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,690
And again if you have not only two but if you have for example four functions two of them are adding

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,430
and two of them are subtracting.

142
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,770
You're going to find the answer Rolovich and keep the corresponding side of each function.

143
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,680
All right.

144
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,260
So armed with these two properties and the other rules we can actually now do a couple of examples where

145
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,550
we put everything we learned to use.
