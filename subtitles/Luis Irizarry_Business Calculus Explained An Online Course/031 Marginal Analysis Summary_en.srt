1
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,090
All right.

2
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,980
So here we have a summary of marginal analysis.

3
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,420
So Marjoe analysis is using derivatives to estimate how profit revenue and costs are changing one production

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,420
level changes by one.

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,580
So remember at the end of the day what we're doing is we're estimating.

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,310
So if you're asked to estimate how these quantities are changing then you use marginal analysis.

7
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,180
And next is just a quick relationship between profit revenue and cost.

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,200
Remember that profit is equal to the revenue minus the cost.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,790
So profit is what you get to keep revenues what you make in total and the causes why you have to pay

10
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,250
as part of you know expenses.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,300
But you're a business student so you already know it's a marginal function is a derivative of the original

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,230
function.

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:18,090
So the marginal profit derivative of profit margin or revenue is derivative of revenue and marginal

14
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,630
cost is just the derivative of the cost function.

15
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,260
All right.

16
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,170
So whenever you hear the word marginal You know you need to get a derivative then to solve marginal

17
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,420
analysis problems.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,110
You need to do two things.

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,590
Number one is to find the marginal function.

20
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,390
So whatever function you're working with profit function revenue function or a cost function you find

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,740
the derivative of it which is a marginal function.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,350
And after that you plug in one or less.

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,610
And again this is a critical one no less than the unit of production that you're looking for into the

24
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,870
marginal function.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,060
So once you get the margin into a function if you're looking for example for the level of production

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,470
when the number of units equals five they need to plug in for it to estimate it.

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,870
And we actually have a mnemonic for this.

28
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,160
And again it kind of rhymes.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,100
So give me some credit.

30
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:20,100
Marginal equals minus 1 marginal minus 1 marginal minus 1.

31
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,650
This is for you to remember that you did not plug in the actual unit that you're looking for.

32
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,660
You plug in one less.

33
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:37,510
So if I tell you estimate the cost as you go from Unit 22 to unit 23 you're estimating unity 23.

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,190
Right.

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:46,010
So you're going to have to plug in units 22 into the marginal function which by the way don't let that

36
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,540
catch you off guard.

37
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,270
In the example we did we just say find for example the revenue for Unit 101.

38
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:03,370
But sometimes it's written as like the example I just gave as you go from the 20 second unit to the

39
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:13,010
23rd so at the end of the day you're really estimating at 23 that means you need to plug in 22 into

40
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,850
the marginal function.

41
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,440
All right.

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,540
And sometimes you're going to get asked a different type of question.

43
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:26,180
Maybe in the same problem maybe in a different one but if you want to find the actual quantity arrive

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,570
you're not estimating anymore you're not approximating if you want to find the actual quantity of profit

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,970
revenue you're a cost for unit n whatever that unit may be.

46
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:46,340
Then you need to go ahead and plug that number and into the original function and then subtract and

47
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,120
minus one plugged into the original function as well.

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,170
And remember this is just common sense.

49
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,940
So whenever you get these problems in Business Calculus I don't want you to think Oh my goodness I don't

50
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,480
remember.

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,150
I don't know which ones which.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,260
Think what you're doing for finding the actual quantity you plug into the original function.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,910
You're not estimating anymore.

54
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,420
Like I said for example you know what let's use his example over here.

55
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,200
Let's say that we want to find the profit as we go from 22 units to 23.

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,590
We want to find the actual profit.

57
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,210
So what we do is we find the profit of producing 23 units.

58
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:37,690
So we find profit of 23 and we subtract the profit of producing 22

59
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,360
right.

60
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:47,980
What's left is going to be the profit of the 23rd unit by itself.

61
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,500
All right.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,150
Just think about what you're doing.

63
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:58,130
Don't just blindly try to plug in numbers into derivatives and original functions and don't start crying

64
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,070
in the middle of the exam because you did not know what you're doing.

65
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,390
You do know what you're doing.

66
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,650
You're just nervous.

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,620
Think about what it is that you're trying to find.

68
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,470
All right you got this.

69
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:19,970
Next is remember it's just a quick distinction that P IVAX with an upper case P is profit and P of X

70
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,790
lowercase P is price.

71
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,320
Just remember that profit revenue cost costs go together and these are all capital P R and C so don't

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,560
confuse P of x and x.

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,110
In any case in our problem they're not going to trick you and you know just make you guess which ones

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,590
which they're going to tell you.

75
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,080
This is the price function or maybe they'll call the price function something else but I just want you

76
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,010
to be on the lookout that if you see a B you need to make sure that if it's a briquets it's profit and

77
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,300
if it's lower case it's price unless a problem tells you otherwise.

78
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,620
And finally here we have an alternative formula for revenue.

79
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:08,030
So you know if you want to find revenue and you have profit and cost you can solve for our IVAX and

80
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,050
then get it.

81
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:16,610
But if you're not given profit nor cost and you want to find revenue and you're actually given the price

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,780
function then you can just multiply the number of units X times that price function and that is going

83
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,960
to give you the revenue function.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,860
All right.

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,450
So that is it for marginal analysis.

86
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,920
This is probably the most business ish lesson we've done so far is just an application of business calculus.

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,720
So hopefully that's not too bad.

88
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,770
And again we'll do a couple of problems for you to get used to this and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
