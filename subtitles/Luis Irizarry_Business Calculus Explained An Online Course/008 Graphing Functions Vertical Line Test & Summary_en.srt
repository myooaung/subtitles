1
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,870
So one more thing I want to cover before we go is the vertical line test and the vertical line test

2
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,830
is used to check if a graph belongs to a function or not.

3
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,570
As we mentioned before by definition a function can only have one output per every input.

4
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,520
Going back to the washing machine analogy washing your Michael Jackson T-shirt on Tuesday and washing

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,980
it on Friday will give you back the same result.

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,640
A clean Michael Jackson T-shirt.

7
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,700
You're not going to get you know green pants on Tuesday.

8
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,430
And Michael Jackson T-shirt on Friday.

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,950
If you always plug in one thing you're going to get back the same results if you plug something into

10
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,020
a function.

11
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,480
You're always going to get the same Y for that x.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,630
Therefore if a graph has one or more points above or below an existing point it cannot be a function.

13
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,870
Let me show you what I mean.

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:32,910
So let's say you have a graph that looks something like this.

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,970
So this is a curve as you can see it looks very similar to the ones we did and will do the vertical

16
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,190
line test to determine if whatever produced this graph is a function or not.

17
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,480
So the vertical line test says if a vertical line touches the graph at more than one point then it's

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,090
not a function.

19
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,590
Let me repeat that again.

20
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,710
If a vertical line touches the graph at more than one point then it's not a function.

21
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,830
So for example let's try drawing a vertical line here.

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,860
So this vertical line here touches the graph only at this point.

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,260
So we're good.

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,830
Nothing nothing bad there.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,080
Let's draw another vertical line.

26
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,070
Let's start for example here.

27
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,310
Yeah that's supposed to be a vertical line.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,150
You get the drift.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,820
OK.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,110
So again this vertical line only touches the graph at this point.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,760
So again no problem there.

32
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,580
However what happens if we draw a vertical line right over here.

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,820
Ha ha.

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,410
So it looks like this vertical line is touching the graph here.

35
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:00,950
Here and also over here so this vertical line is such in the graph at three different points.

36
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,910
One up here one in the middle and one below.

37
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:10,840
And again the vertical line test says if a vertical line touches the graph and more than one points

38
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,500
then it's not a function because this vertical line touches the graph at three different points.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,060
This is not a function

40
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,750
OK.

41
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,850
It's not a function.

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,530
It does not pass the vertical line test because it's touching the graph at several points.

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,840
Let's try another example.

44
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,170
And we'll see if it is a function or not.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,470
Let's do it very simply.

46
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,480
This graph over here.

47
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,800
OK so let's use a vertical line to us to the chairman if it's a function or not.

48
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:07,000
Well this was actually pretty easy because if you try to do a vertical line even right here then what

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,030
happens.

50
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,900
It's touching the graph at two different points.

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,920
It's touching it here and it's touching it here as well.

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,010
So because it's touching the graph at more than one point with a vertical line then it's not a function

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,430
either.

54
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:32,450
So just like the first example this is not a function.

55
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,120
All right.

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,310
So again very easy.

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,400
You can use vertical lines to determine whether a graph is represented by a function or not.

58
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,260
So in our first example this vertical line touched the graph at three different points.

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,060
So that makes this not a function.

60
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,650
And in the second example our vertical line touches the graph at two different points which is also

61
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,600
not a function.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,100
So by the way for the vertical line test if you had only checked here then it would have been a function

63
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,750
right because it's only touching the graph at one point.

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,540
So that's why it's important to know how the graphs of function look.

65
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,240
OK.

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,760
So again in this example over here we were good.

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,750
And over here we were good as well.

68
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,620
However here we were not good in this one.

69
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,480
Pretty much any single vertical line touches a graph of two points.

70
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,400
So that was a lot easier.

71
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,600
All right.

72
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:39,920
Let me quickly show you why the other graphs that we drew before were functions so for example a parabola

73
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,420
looks like this.

74
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,000
All right.

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,020
So the parabola looks like this.

76
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,760
Here you can draw all the vertical lines you want and you're not going to find a line that touches the

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,280
graph at two points.

78
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,950
OK.

79
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,130
See how they always touch it.

80
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:07,520
At one point here here and here.

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,050
Same thing for the cubic

82
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,190
looks like this.

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,430
And again you can draw all the vertical lines you want.

84
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:33,050
You're not going to find a line that touches the graph at more than one point.

85
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,160
So this one touches a graph here.

86
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,970
As one touches it here and this one touches it here but it's only one point.

87
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,210
So these two are actually functions OK.

88
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,960
That's good for the vertical line test.

89
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,430
All right.

90
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,070
So a quick summary of what we just covered.

91
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,520
Functions can be graphed by the x and corresponding y values in a Cartesian plane.

92
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,730
Remember the Cartesian plane looks like this.

93
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,350
There you plot your function and the Cartesian plane the horizontal axes for x.

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,730
So this is X and the vertical axis is for y.

95
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:23,060
This is why so a point X Y represents the input X and the output y.

96
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:30,470
So if you have something like 1 3 1 is your X 3 is your Y.

97
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,580
That means you move one to the right because one is positive and 3 up because otherwise positive.

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,010
So this would be somewhere around here.

99
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:51,240
Linear functions which we cover next have that are always straight lines and we'll see that in the next

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,450
section we'll see how they are where they go from left to right.

101
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,160
Sometimes they have positive slopes negative slopes etc. besides linear functions other functions have

102
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,180
graphs that are curves or both curves and lines.

103
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,500
You could have that to graphs are useful to determine the behavior of a function.

104
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,450
Again you can see if the function is going up if it tends to go down and how it works in general.

105
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,050
And finally you can use a vertical line test to determine if you're looking at the graph of a function

106
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,290
or not and the vertical line test says that if the vertical line touches the graph at more than one

107
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,050
point then it's not a function.

108
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,530
So again if you draw a vertical line somewhere in the graph and it touches the graph at two or three

109
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,950
or four or five points etc. then that is not the graph of a function.

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,890
OK so remember the vertical line.

111
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,700
If it's true then it's not a function.

112
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:57,630
If it touches the graph at more than one point it is not a function that's pretty much it for graphs

113
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,470
of functions.

114
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,160
Again later on we'll see how the graph functions with more detail in the next section actually we'll

115
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,790
go over how to graph linear functions.

116
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,410
And then after that in other sections We'll look at how to graph curves which are more complex functions.

117
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:13,860
All right.

118
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,640
So remember to do your problems that are coming up and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
