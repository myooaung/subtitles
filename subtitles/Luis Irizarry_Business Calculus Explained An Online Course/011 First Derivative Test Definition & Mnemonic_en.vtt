00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.140
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
And today we're going to keep talking about relative extrema.

3
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.600
So in the last video I said that to find the relative extrema of a graph there are two main steps.

4
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.180
So

5
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.560
to find

6
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.630
relative extrema

7
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.080
you need to do two main things.

8
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.090
Number one is find the critical points

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.450
of f of x and once again remember that critical points exist where the derivative is equal to zero or

10
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.850
it's undefined.

11
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.570
We know that already.

12
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.230
The second step is to actually classify

13
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.430
the relative extrema.

14
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.970
So remember we talked about relative maximums and relative minimums after we find the critical points

15
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.100
we need to know if that critical point represents a max a min or neither.

16
00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.020
And the first way that we're going to learn how to classify relative extrema is with the first derivative

17
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.160
test.

18
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.610
Let's go into that right now.

19
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.090
All right.

20
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.270
So here we have it.

21
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.210
It's called the first derivative test.

22
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.960
It is a test to use to classify relative extrema.

23
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.720
And again it's not the only test.

24
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.470
There's another test called the second derivative test.

25
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.860
Look at that a little bit later and the first derivative test is actually pretty easy.

26
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.860
It tells you this for a critical number a so in other words if you find the numbers that make the derivative

27
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.630
equal to zero or undefined Those are your critical numbers.

28
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.220
And then what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and grab your critical numbers to the term

29
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.300
and whether the points for that x value is a max a men or neither.

30
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.490
And in fact if you did a session on increasing and decreasing intervals this is going to be very similar.

31
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.250
It's similar because you have to test values Latin rite of the critical number and plug them into the

32
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.460
derivative.

33
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.980
Basically you grab your number 8 right and you put it in a number line.

34
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.060
And what you're going to do is just like increasing and decreasing intervals you're going to test to

35
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.050
the left and to the right.

36
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.670
So where you're going to do is you're going to grab one value that's less than your critical number

37
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.280
a.

38
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.180
And once has value that's greater than your critical number eight then you're going to plug in the test

39
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.100
values into the derivative and then classify based on the signs that you get if you pick 10 values and

40
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.730
you get positive on the left and negative on the right.

41
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.810
Then that point is a relative maximum.

42
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.410
All right moving forward.

43
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.690
Relative minimum.

44
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.070
So again if you grab your curricle number A and you test a value to the left of that and it gives you

45
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.040
a negative and then a value to the right of that.

46
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.690
And it gives you positive and that is a relative minimum.

47
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.709
And finally if you Tasher values to the left turn right and you get the same sign.

48
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.620
So you get either positive on the left and positive on the right or no right.

49
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.860
Or here.

50
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.960
Both negative on the left and negative on the right.

51
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.060
This means that it is neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum.

52
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.890
So we just say neither.

53
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.800
Ok so just to summarize again this is very similar to what we did for increasing and decreasing intervals.

54
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.160
You find your critical numbers and then you test to the left of the critical number and to the rights

55
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.260
of the critical number and based on the signs that you get then you know how to classify it.

56
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.540
In fact let's move into the Monnick.

57
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.890
So that is very easy for you to remember which one is which

58
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.450
Right.

59
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.110
So here we have our mnemonic for the first derivative test.

60
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.640
Now what Midhat this mnemonic is not like the others.

61
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.700
No it's not a funny catch phrase or something else like that is just simply drawing.

62
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.200
And in fact this mnemonic is how I remember the first derivative rule.

63
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.710
All right.

64
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.110
So then a month access draw a mountain and a hole and look at the slopes.

65
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.830
See it doesn't even rhyme but it doesn't matter.

66
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.980
Again remember mnemonic is a device for remembering something.

67
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.040
And this is definitely how we're going to remember the first derivative test.

68
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:53.350
So like we said whether a point is a relative max or a relative men or neither depends on the signs

69
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.940
that you get to the left and right of the critical number.

70
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.570
So what we're going to do is we're going to draw a max.

71
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.930
So that is your mountain

72
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.310
and we're going to draw our men which is our whole.

73
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:25.430
So we have our max which would be up here then we would have our men which would be down here.

74
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.150
So we have those two.

75
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.200
All right.

76
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.190
And then remember the derivative measures the slope of the line tangent.

77
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.290
So what we're going to do as well we're going to draw a tangent line to the left and to the right of

78
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.970
the max and a tangent line to the left and to the right of the men.

79
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.860
So it's going to be something like this.

80
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.500
And this is tangent but not tangent to the actual max or min.

81
00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.430
It's just tangent to the left or right and if we're going to draw another one like this which again

82
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.160
is supposed to be touching this point.

83
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:10.110
It's just a little bit close here and we'll do the same for the men so we have a tangent line to the

84
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:18.760
left and we have a tangent line to the right and you might be thinking What the heck is this.

85
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.390
Well here's where the mnemonic comes in.

86
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.080
Remember that the slope of a line can be either a positive or negative.

87
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:39.850
If it's going up like this one then the slope is positive and if it's going down then the slope is negative.

88
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.580
Same thing here just in this case it's the opposite.

89
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:50.740
If it's going down it's a negative and then if it's going up it's a positive.

90
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.510
I remember we do this from left to right always.

91
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.260
So it's very easy to see that this is going down and this is going up.

92
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.510
And then again from left to right this is going up.

93
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.200
And this is going down by the way this is not meant to be a next.

94
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.660
It's supposed to be a plus sign.

95
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.140
It's just at the same level as the line.

96
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.030
All right.

97
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:18.510
So for Max when you draw it and you draw the tangent lines and then you put a sign to each line and

98
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.800
you will notice that to the left of the max you have a plus and to the right you have a min and by the

99
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.760
same token to the left of a man you have a minus end to the right of the men you have a plus.

100
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.250
This right here tells you how to classify it.

101
00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:34.690
Again

102
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.110
here is your critical number 8.

103
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.270
And basing this on the left it should be positive.

104
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.520
So all of this should be a positive and to the right according to this it should be a negative because

105
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.640
this negative is to the right.

106
00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.830
So if you get this you know you're dealing with a max let's go for the men.

107
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.550
Again for the men the same thing to the left of the men you have a negative.

108
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:19.680
So if you have your critical number here used to minus on the left and to the right you have a positive.

109
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.740
So to the right you do a positive.

110
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.930
That's it.

111
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.690
All right.

112
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:31.980
So it is as easy as drawing the little mountain and then drawing tangent lines and base in the direction

113
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.760
of the tangent line so you'll know if it's positive going up or if it's negative going down and you'll

114
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.400
know what's on the left and what's on the right.

115
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.660
The same thing for the minute you draw your whole and then you draw tangent lines on the left and on

116
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:54.720
the right and then based on whether the slope of the line is going down or going up you'll know exactly

117
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.380
how it's supposed to be here.

118
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.700
And like we said in the last slide if it gives you the same sign on both sides.

119
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:09.060
So for example if you get positive on the left and positive on the right or negative on the left and

120
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.310
negative on the right same signs then it is neither.

121
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:20.160
But for this mnemonic all you need to do is draw these to the max and the minute and if it's neither

122
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.440
a max or a min it is neither.

123
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.210
Right because it can only be one of the three max men or neither.

124
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.220
So we've talked a lot.

125
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.970
Let's go ahead and do an example so you can put your mnemonic to use.
