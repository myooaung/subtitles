00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.930
Hello Guys welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.650
Today we're going to talk about the constant rules.

3
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.750
Believe it or not the constant rule is the easiest differentiation rule there is.

4
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.350
It is so easy.

5
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.080
Your mind is going to be blown away just like that.

6
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.690
All right.

7
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.760
So what is a constant rule and what does it used for.

8
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.330
So in business calculus the constant rule is just to find the derivative of constant functions.

9
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.250
You might be asking yourself OK so what is a constant function.

10
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.600
Well let's cover that quickly before we get to the constant rule.

11
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.420
All right.

12
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.950
So

13
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.630
constant

14
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.730
functions.

15
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.960
So when you think of the word constant What comes to mind.

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.800
Well constant means that something is not changing right.

17
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.470
So what would a constant function look like.

18
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.880
Well for example let's take the function f of x equals 10.

19
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.260
And now that we have the function of x equals 10.

20
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.220
Let's try plugging in some values into AB of x.

21
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.130
So what if we have half of 1 What does that equal to.

22
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.670
Well you know typically when you evaluate a value at a function you plug it in right here to see what

23
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.640
you get.

24
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.190
However in this case we don't have any axes.

25
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.660
So there's nothing really to plug in.

26
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.690
That means that half of 1 is just 10.

27
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.050
Let's try a different value.

28
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.740
What if we try plugging in seven.

29
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.110
So we want to find half of seven.

30
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.660
Well again there's nothing really there for you to plug in.

31
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.530
So again the value is going to be 10.

32
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.720
And I hope you're seeing a pattern here.

33
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.700
Every one is 10 F of 7 is 10.

34
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.550
All right.

35
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.820
Just to be really outrageous let's try a really big number.

36
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.650
Something like negative 20 2000.

37
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.710
So we're going to plug in negative 22000 into this function f of x equals 10.

38
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.910
Well again because it's only 10.

39
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.050
We go back to the same thing.

40
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.080
Half of negative 22000 equals 10.

41
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.200
So what's going on here.

42
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:14.770
Well one equals ten of seven equals 10 of negative 22000 equals 10 basically what ever number you plug

43
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.970
in into f of x equals 10 you're going to get the same answer 10.

44
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.920
Doesn't matter if it's positive.

45
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.230
Does it matter if you plug in in a negative number.

46
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.360
It doesn't matter if you plug it in zero.

47
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.930
In fact I have a zero also equals 10 What does that mean.

48
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.620
That means that f of x is a constant function because it doesn't matter what the x value is.

49
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.600
Why is always the same.

50
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.970
So let's go to the definition of a constant function.

51
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.630
Ok so here we have a more formal definition which is a constant function is a function whose y value

52
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.300
is always the same.

53
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:17.649
So remember how we had f of x equals 10 Well again let's get a couple of points for this function.

54
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:24.630
So we had said for example that a point would be 710.

55
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.340
So when the x value is 7 the y value is 10.

56
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.760
We also tried negative 22000 Oh you know what.

57
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.070
I'll remove the comma here because you got my get confusing.

58
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.410
So that's going to be negative 22000.

59
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.990
And again the y value is also 10.

60
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.240
And again it doesn't matter which number you plug in.

61
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.530
Again you're always going to have 10 as a Y value.

62
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.910
Again if we plug in zero we also get 10.

63
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.790
So basically again a constant function is a function whose y value is always the same.

64
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.770
It doesn't change.

65
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.300
In this case it is always 10.

66
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.080
So how do we know what we're dealing with a constant function.

67
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.370
Well it's actually very easy.

68
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:28.390
Our constant function is a function where the f of x is equal to a number so if f of x is equal to a

69
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.990
number

70
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:43.970
then you know you're dealing with a constant function.

71
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.030
All right.

72
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.500
In this case that we had here a vaccine was 10 effectively ever x is equal to a number.

73
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.400
Therefore it is a constant function.

74
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:09.610
Another example of a constant function would be of X equals negative to half of X equals 10000

75
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.930
f of x equals

76
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.130
etc. etc. you get the point.

77
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:43.540
Let me just market for you that these are examples of constant functions.

78
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.120
All right.

79
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.750
So one last time a constant function is a function whose y value is always the same.

80
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.210
It does not matter what you plug in and you recognize constant functions because they're equal to a

81
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.810
number.

82
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.280
No axes no letters just a number.

83
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.850
So now that we know what a constant function is we're going to go into the constant rule.

84
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.310
So the constant rule is a way to find the derivative of constant functions.

85
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.320
OK so before we get into the constant rule let's try graphing a constant function so that we can then

86
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.240
jump into the concert rule because are both related.

87
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:34.250
OK so let's say we have the function f of x equals 2.

88
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.690
Again we know it is a constant function.

89
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.030
So let's try and graph that

90
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.810
OK so to graph it we need to find a couple of points in the function right.

91
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.720
So again is a constant function so whatever you plug in is going to give you the same answer.

92
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.290
It's always going to be two.

93
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.780
So let's try plugging in one.

94
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:11.870
Pick easy numbers and let's try plugging in negative 3 which also equals two let's read a graph of that

95
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.470
here.

96
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.140
So

97
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:25.210
first point would be one comma two and second one would be two comma.

98
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.440
I'm sorry the second one is going to be negative three.

99
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.360
Comma 2 OK.

100
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.179
So let's try to find where this point.

101
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:46.620
One two is to remember which one is the x value the Y the two is a Y value.

102
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:54.930
So we have we move one to the right that is x value and then two up which would be or Y value.

103
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.120
First point would be right here.

104
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:04.120
Second point you have to move three to the left because it's negative 3 and then go up by 2.

105
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.920
So we do one two three two to the left and then we go up by two which would be right here.

106
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.440
So what happens.

107
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.690
Well we have two points.

108
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.620
We can now connect them together and we'll get the graph of a function

109
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.160
right as opposed to be a straight line but you know my drawing is not perfect so it looks a little weird.

110
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.510
But again it's just a straight line.

111
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.760
So we know that the graph of this function is just a straight line.

112
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.870
Not only that it is a horizontal line.

113
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.130
Why is it horizontal.

114
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:47.790
Well remember that every y value is always the same.

115
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.740
That means that it doesn't matter if you move to the right or to the left.

116
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.900
It's always going to be at the same height.

117
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.580
Right.

118
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.150
It's always going to be a 2.

119
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.520
For that reason the graphs of constant functions are always horizontal lines

120
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.630
drives of constant functions

121
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:25.280
I'll abbreviate function as F and just the save is a little bit of time are always

122
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:38.110
a horizontal line that is absolutely always true.

123
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.500
All right

124
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.110
doesn't matter what the function is.

125
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.570
What really changes is just the height over the line is.

126
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.200
So you could have like a different function over here.

127
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.080
Bit like that.

128
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.020
This could be like f of x equals 10.

129
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.550
You could also have another function down here.

130
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:09.520
Which could be f of x equals let's say negative 6 something like that.

131
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.650
So again it's always a horizontal line.

132
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:17.410
What really changes is the height of the line which is based on this number over here.

133
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.180
That would be f of x equals whatever number the constant function is equal to.

134
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:30.980
Now that said remember that a derivative measures rate of change how a function is changing.

135
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.890
Right.

136
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.320
A derivative is a slope.

137
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:42.880
So what it really measures is the slope of a line touching the graph at a certain point.

138
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.790
However you know that slope is rise over run.

139
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.460
In this case do we really have a rise.

140
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.900
I mean if you look at this it's basically a straight line horizontal.

141
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.040
It's now going up.

142
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.610
It's now going down as is going to the right.

143
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.760
So there's no slope here because there's no rice right.

144
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:19.690
Remember that slope is by the way remember the sign of a slope is an M let me point that out here slope

145
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:26.700
equals equals Rice overrun.

146
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.010
But for a constant function there's no rice means that the rice is equal to zero.

147
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.890
And the run doesn't really matter.

148
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.420
Right.

149
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.100
Let's say it's 2 0 over 2 is still zero.

150
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.320
What does that mean.

151
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.750
Well let's look into the definition of the constant rule and see what this means.

152
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:59.140
OK so now we have the formal definition of a constant rule because the rule says that the derivative

153
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.220
of a constant function is 0.

154
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:10.640
Again the derivative of a constant function is 0 that is always that is always absolutely always the

155
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.520
case.

156
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:21.730
So any you're dealing with a constant function such as half of X equals 10 which is the one we're working

157
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:28.200
with it's derivative is always going to be zero.

158
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.600
The function is f of x equals negative 2.

159
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.960
Again we know it's a constant function.

160
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.780
No letters are read here.

161
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.860
That means it's derivative is always going to be zero.

162
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.770
Why last example.

163
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.060
F of x equals zero which believe it or not.

164
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.570
It's actually a constant function as well even though it is 0.

165
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.740
Well by definition it's still a number with no letters.

166
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.840
Therefore it's derivative.

167
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.410
It's always going to be zero.

168
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.020
So there you have it the derivative of a constant function is 0.

169
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.190
That's always the case.

170
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.410
And again we know this because of what we talked about a couple of minutes ago.

171
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:26.910
Basically the graph of a constant function is always a horizontal line.

172
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.290
For example the graph of X equals negative two is something like this.

173
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.760
Because it doesn't matter which number you plug in for x doesn't matter how much you go to the right

174
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.900
or to the left.

175
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.910
The height of the function is always going to be at negative 2.

176
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.360
So again like I said before the derivative measures rate of change.

177
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.050
How is a function changing.

178
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.930
Well this function is not changing at all.

179
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:05.130
It's always negative to therefore its derivative is zero.

180
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.650
In other words there's no slope there's no rise overrun.

181
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.050
And because of that it's derivative it's always going to be zero.

182
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.510
So anytime you see a function that looks like this you know f of x equals a number.

183
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.120
You have a constant function and the derivative of that is always zero.

184
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.590
That's it's for the constant function.

185
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.840
I told you it was going to be extremely easy.

186
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.650
All right.

187
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.340
Just remember derivative of a constant function is 0.

188
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.510
Now we're going to go into the mnemonic for this concept.

189
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:50.870
OK.

190
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:56.320
So the mnemonic for the constant rule and again it's a very easy rule to remember but I'm putting on

191
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.290
and want it here in case you want to think about it that way.

192
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:08.410
Let's say that you turn on the TV and they say that the weather tomorrow in your city will have constant

193
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.520
temperature.

194
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:17.770
Well if the weather has constant temperature that means that the change in temperature is zero.

195
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.710
In other words the temperatures not going to change.

196
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.820
Right.

197
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.850
So when you're thinking about costs and functions all you have to think about is ok constant the word

198
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.020
constant means that it's not changing.

199
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:37.720
So if you have a constant function the change in temperature is zero.

200
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:44.180
Therefore the derivative of a constant function is zero.

201
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:50.360
So let's say you have going back to our example of X equals 10.

202
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.410
This is a constant function.

203
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.350
So again think about the word constant.

204
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.700
Well constant could be constant temperature.

205
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:04.400
And when that happens when you have constant temperature the change in temperature is zero.

206
00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:10.440
Therefore the derivative of a constant function is always zero.

207
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.869
Right.

208
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.950
So let's go over what we just covered.

209
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.619
Again we cover a constant functions and the constant rule.

210
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:32.490
So first of all a constant function is a function in the form of X equals C C is a number.

211
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.360
So I know we just said that constant functions do not have letters.

212
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.050
But see here is a placeholder for any number.

213
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.210
OK so when we say F of facts equals see where Seiza number.

214
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.020
It can mean that C is equal to 10.

215
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:56.410
It means that C could be equal to 5 c it could be close to negative 22000 etc..

216
00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:05.670
Again what this is saying is that if a VAX is equal so number then that is a constant function.

217
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.020
Second point pretty much says the same thing.

218
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.150
You can tell that a constant function apart because of x is equal to a number.

219
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.170
No letters.

220
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:21.400
Then we have the graph of a constant function is always a horizontal straight line.

221
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.960
No slope.

222
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.920
We said that this is the case because the height is always the same.

223
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.200
There's no slope because there is no rise.

224
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.880
You're not either going up nor down you're just moving left to right.

225
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:40.900
And finally we have the constant rule which says that the derivative of a constant function is always

226
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.000
zero.

227
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:48.940
OK so this is pretty much it for constant rule and constant functions as always.

228
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:55.220
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask in the forum for the course and I'll see you

229
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.370
