00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.980
All right.

2
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.480
So there are a couple of properties that logarithms have and we'll see how those work in this section

3
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
you might need to use them you know to simplify logarithms to solve equations etc. but I promise you

4
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.650
it's only four of them so it's really not that bad.

5
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.550
And they're really easy to do.

6
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.340
So let's see what they are.

7
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.760
All right.

8
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340
So the four rules vary here.

9
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.630
They are for multiplication for division for exponentiation and for finding the nth root.

10
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.430
So let's do each one with an example.

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.480
So for the first one it's for multiplication.

12
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.110
The rule says the following.

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:14.320
If you have log of X Y and X Y or multiplying each other with base a then that is equal to the log of

14
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
the first plus the log of the second.

15
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.920
So multiplication becomes a sum.

16
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:32.870
So we can break these terms apart by saying a log of x with base a plus log of Y.

17
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.380
With base a.

18
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.690
So not as the base actually stays the same.

19
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.990
It's the same base as we have here.

20
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.670
But what we do is we separate each of these terms multiplying into its own log and then we add them

21
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.130
together and let's do an example.

22
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.450
What if we have log of 32

23
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.479
times 64 with base 2.

24
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.490
So we have two quantities that are multiplying within a log the 32 on the 64.

25
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.270
So let's go ahead and break those apart.

26
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.820
So we have the log of the first term which is 32

27
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.150
with base 2 plus log.

28
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.940
The second one which is 64

29
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.840
and base 2.

30
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.530
All right that's it.

31
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.780
So at this point the problem is not done.

32
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.170
You would have to find each of these.

33
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.140
But again I just wanted to show you how the multiplication and logs can be simplified.

34
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.050
All right.

35
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.610
So just like in multiplication we have a sum at the end and division.

36
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.180
It actually becomes a subtraction.

37
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.950
So we're going to have a minus sign and the rule says that if you have log of

38
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.910
so in the top example we were multiplying here we're going to be dividing X over Y

39
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.120
with base a

40
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.250
and again each one gets its own log.

41
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.020
So the X gets it and the Y gets it as well.

42
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.590
So we have log

43
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.980
x with base a minus see that.

44
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.950
So because they are dividing we have a minus here.

45
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.110
Log of Y with base a right.

46
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.750
So it was a quick example.

47
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.980
So we have

48
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:17.570
Lague of let's say a million 0 0 0 0 0 0 over a thousand

49
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.570
with pace 10 and again this is a common log.

50
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.600
Remember if the base is not specified and it says log then the base is 10.

51
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.200
If it says L-N on the other hand it's a natural log and the base is e.

52
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.260
All right.

53
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.200
And by the way you could totally do this first in here.

54
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.130
So you could literally divide a million by 1000.

55
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.960
That's going to give you a thousand and then just get the log of a thousand.

56
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.860
You can do that that's perfect.

57
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.510
However we want to show how we break it up.

58
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.640
So that's why we're doing it step by step.

59
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.690
We're actually breaking this up into two logs and the same thing for the multiplication.

60
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.550
You could have just multiplied the 32 times in 64 and then find the log of the rest of the product of

61
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.920
these two.

62
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.890
In fact if you're given a problem that's what you would do first.

63
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.370
But again as we're learning the properties of logarithms.

64
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.690
That's why we're breaking it up.

65
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.610
So here we have a division.

66
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.960
So we know that we need to break it apart into two logs and the logs are going to be subtracting.

67
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:43.590
So the log of the first one we have log of a million or 0 0 0 0 0 and I'll put it down here to save

68
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.460
some space.

69
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.780
Mine is the log of the next one is a thousand.

70
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.220
All right

71
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.050
there you go.

72
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.540
I remember these problems are not done we just simplified them.

73
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.240
In fact you should totally finish these up.

74
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.410
So find this phone and also find this one.

75
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.360
The answers were pretty easy to just go for it.

76
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.270
All right so the next one is exponentiation.

77
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.980
So if you have exponentiation within a log you can actually break it apart.

78
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.860
The rule says the following.

79
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.890
So the log

80
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.760
of x to the N with base a is equal to.

81
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:41.870
So what we do here is we grab this exponent N and we bring it to the outside multiplying.

82
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.870
Kind of like we do with the power rule.

83
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.470
Remember we bring down a dictator.

84
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.420
This comes out multiplying.

85
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.980
And we're left with only the eggs inside the log.

86
00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:03.320
So and comes out times Lague of x with base a.

87
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.970
All right.

88
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.360
That's what we do.

89
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.580
That's pretty much it.

90
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.740
Just the end comes out multiplying and you're done.

91
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.800
All right so let's do an example here log.

92
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.580
Nine squared with base 3.

93
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.990
Ok so what do we do with the two.

94
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.340
It comes out multiplying the whole thing.

95
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:39.910
So it's going to be to log of just nine because we took out the squared with base three.

96
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.700
There we go.

97
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.230
And finally we have the nth root.

98
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.510
So how does this work.

99
00:07:47.520 --> 00:08:00.780
The rule says that if you have a log of.

100
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.310
So here we have a route and it's going to be the end route.

101
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.710
So it could be the square root.

102
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.110
The third root the fourth root etc. etc..

103
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.530
And by the way the base is a.

104
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:23.780
So if you haven't and roots with then a log what you do is you take this and so remember how in this

105
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.200
example we actually just brought it outside of multiplying.

106
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.240
Well in this example we're going to bring it outside multiplying.

107
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.840
But in the bottom of a fraction and in the top we're going to have a 1.

108
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:45.180
So we end through it becomes 1 over and and then that multiplies the log.

109
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:54.830
Multiplies Lagann of x with base a.

110
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.320
Right.

111
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:03.370
So the moment we take this out and we put it as one over and the rule goes away we just keep the x.

112
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.810
All right.

113
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.360
So very similar to the exponentiation one.

114
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.110
The only difference is that here it comes as one over and instead of just and like over here.

115
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:22.230
All right so let's do a quick example for this one if we have log of let's say that we're looking for

116
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:30.040
the third root of 27 with the base of three.

117
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.760
All right.

118
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.790
So we have an end through what we can actually go ahead and take this route and put it as 1 over 3.

119
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:51.630
Multiplying right times log of 27 with base 3.

120
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.920
All right.

121
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.560
That is how you break it apart.

122
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:55.990
Great.

123
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.410
So we just went over the four most important properties for logarithms.

124
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.790
So remember multiplication and division and they're very similar.

125
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.950
The only difference is that when you're multiplying eventually you have logs that are adding each other.

126
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.230
And when you're dividing you have logs that are subtracting.

127
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:22.620
So they're opposites and the same way exponentiation and the roots are opposites it's well in exponentiation.

128
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.380
You bring out the exponents multiplying everything else.

129
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.720
And in the end through and you bring down one over the roots.

130
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.630
So the roots and it becomes one over.

131
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:43.200
And I remember that once you bring down this and or this roots then all you have left is just whatever

132
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.130
you were exponentiate ing or whatever you were finding the root for.

133
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.070
So in this case the root goes away.

134
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.780
And in this case the exponent goes away.

135
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.880
All right.

136
00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:02.230
So I want to go ahead and finish up these four problems so this one this one this one and this one again

137
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.580
they should be really really easy.

138
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.500
You probably don't need a calculator for each of these but you're free to use it as well.

139
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.950
All right.

140
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.710
So go ahead and give those a shot.

141
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:19.870
And before we go I want to go over two more properties but I'll give them to you as examples.

142
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:25.550
So the main takeaway is we're doing a log problem.

143
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.740
I want you to think about what you're doing.

144
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.100
So for example what is the log

145
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.680
of B.

146
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.170
With base b.

147
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.850
So we have B as a base and B as a result.

148
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.460
What could this be.

149
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.200
So think about what it is that we're asking.

150
00:11:49.230 --> 00:12:00.240
We're asking to what number do you need to raise be so beat to the what equals Cosby well.

151
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.380
I think it's pretty obvious right.

152
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.100
Be to the one equals B.

153
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.300
Anything else does not equal B.

154
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:17.140
So the answer to this is that the log of B with base b is just 1 1 is the only number so that when you

155
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.670
raise B you get B again.

156
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.460
OK.

157
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:30.390
And the second example is Lague of 1 with base b.

158
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.040
So again let's try to think about what we're doing.

159
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:46.610
So we're saying to which number do we need to raise be in order to get 1 Well remember that anything

160
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:52.200
to the zero power is 1 ok except 0 2 0.

161
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.730
But that's another topic.

162
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.700
All right.

163
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.810
Pretty much anything to the zero power is 1.

164
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:04.370
So the exponent that this B needs to have in order for this to become one is zero.

165
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:11.420
Therefore the log of 1 with base b equals zero right.

166
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.920
So these are our two special properties.

167
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.840
And again you don't really need to memorize this.

168
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:23.400
All I want you to do is while you're doing a problem think about what it is that you're being asked

169
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.090
to find.

170
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.860
I don't want you to see this log of one with base b and get all freaked out.

171
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.670
No.

172
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.670
So OK they are asking B to the Waad equals 1.

173
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.460
Well the answer is zero.

174
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.730
Same thing over here.

175
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.980
I don't want you to look at log B B.

176
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.350
Oh we have two B's.

177
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.600
What's going on here.

178
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.280
No.

179
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:50.420
Again ask yourself what is it that the problem is asking when we elevate B to what it equals beat.

180
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.040
Well when equals one.

181
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.100
Therefore the answer is 1.

182
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.910
All right.

183
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.530
So always always for calculus in general.

184
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.790
Always think about what they're trying to ask you instead of freaking out.

185
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.320
Sit down and say OK what it is that we need to get here.

186
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.810
Is it a derivative is it an equation.

187
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.060
Is it an equation for a line.

188
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.980
What is it exactly.

189
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.960
And then try to figure it out.

190
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.880
All right.

191
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.670
So that's it for the properties of logarithms.

192
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.150
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
