1
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,200
So of course the derivative is a very important concept.

2
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,220
And we'll talk about it a little bit more.

3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,770
But before we do that let's just dive in into an example.

4
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,740
Let's say that we're want to find

5
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,340
the derivative

6
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:55,330
of fallbacks equals x squared.

7
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,360
So we are given a function x squared.

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,470
And we want to find the derivative of that function to do that.

9
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,110
We have to use the definition of a derivative which is what we just cover now.

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,490
F of x plus H.

11
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,310
Minus 5 x

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,150
over h as age approaches zero.

13
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,700
That is the definition of a derivative.

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,000
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to go ahead and use f x.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,550
All right so if we have for example f of x plus H That means that we need to plug in X plus H into f

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,450
right f as a rule.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,020
Remember how we talked about functions and how this is the input.

18
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:55,010
So basically X plus H is going to be the input for x squared.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
So this is equal to.

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,180
And again it will do limits as h approaches zero.

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,150
Of and let's Poyan X plus H into x squared.

22
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,800
That's going to give us X plus H.

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560
Squared.

24
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,570
Right.

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,500
We're plugging in X plus H into this function and this function says take the input and square it.

26
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,010
So we're squaring X plus H.

27
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,730
All right.

28
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,340
And then mine is 5 x Well f of x itself is just x squared.

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,440
So we can say x squared.

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:49,970
All right over h o k is looking kind of weird but you'll see what happens just now.

31
00:02:49,970 --> 00:03:00,210
So again this is equal to limit as h approaches zero of what what we'll do is we'll actually expand

32
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,530
this X plus H squared.

33
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:12,930
So remember we're going to foil if we have X plus age times x plus H.

34
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,000
In other words x plus H squared because you're multiplying it by itself twice.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
We're going to go ahead and foil

36
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:37,120
we're going to multiply the first so X and X then the outer x and h and enter h n x and then the last

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,760
h h.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,480
All right.

39
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,330
So first we're going to multiply the first X times x is x squared.

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,880
Then the outer X times H is x h.

41
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,650
Let's just write it as H.

42
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,630
X which is the same thing.

43
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,460
So that's a plus.

44
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,840
And then we have the inner which is H times x.

45
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,970
So we're going to do plus H times x again.

46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,800
And finally we're going to do the last which is H times h.

47
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:23,810
So that's going to give us h squared right and let's simplify we have x squared and then we have H x

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,610
plus H X..

49
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,170
So you're adding something to itself twice.

50
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,380
That means you're going to have two of them.

51
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,920
So that's going to be two checks.

52
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,070
Right.

53
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,660
And finally we have plus H squared.

54
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,590
OK so we're going to take this and we're going to put it right here.

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,820
So what we did was we took X plus H squared and we just multiplied it.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:05:01,720
All right so now we have x squared plus 2 H x plus H squared right.

57
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,690
This is X plus H squared.

58
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,740
And then we have minus X squared right

59
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,890
I know this looking really weird but we're almost there.

60
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,310
All right.

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,300
Everything over H.

62
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,840
Now what happens.

63
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,990
We have x squared and then we have minus x squared.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,550
So these two cancel each other out.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,400
All right.

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,640
It's like saying three minus three is zero.

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,420
All right.

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,530
So keep going.

69
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,590
And what do we have.

70
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,910
We have limit h approaches zero of what we have to H.

71
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,350
X

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,970
plus H squared over H.

73
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,260
Right.

74
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,260
Now what do you see here.

75
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,420
What you see here is that you have two terms on the top you have two H x and you have h squared and

76
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,590
you have an H on the bottom.

77
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,680
So what can you do.

78
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,930
Well you can actually do is you can actually factor the H on the top because both terms have it.

79
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:23,800
So it's going to look like this limits well limit as age approaches zero.

80
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,810
So what we'll do is on the tub we're going to factor out the h because both terms have it.

81
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,370
So we're going to put it outside right and then we're going to multiply.

82
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,650
So if this term is to H x and we take the h.

83
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,800
What do we have left to x.

84
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,390
And if this term is H squared and we take out one h.

85
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,480
What do we have left just the other H plus H.

86
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,160
Over H.

87
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,320
What do we have now.

88
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,310
Well we have h over h.

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,870
So the reason why we factored is that we can actually cancel out these two H's.

90
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,950
So if one goes away and this one goes away remember that if you have something on the top and then you

91
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,880
divide by that same something on the bottom both cancel out.

92
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,170
It's like saying 6 over 6 just becomes 1.

93
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,320
So you can cancel both of them out.

94
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:38,750
Now to finish up we have lym of

95
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,820
2 x plus H as age approaches zero.

96
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,130
By the way remember when we talked about limits are mnemonics says to find the limb just plug it in.

97
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,870
What would have happened if we had tried plugging this in here.

98
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,830
Well what do we need to plug in.

99
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,500
We need to plug in zero for H.

100
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,150
Right.

101
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,110
But we have an H on the bottom.

102
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,220
So if you plug in at zero on the bottom What do you get.

103
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,750
You get division by zero.

104
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,100
Remember that when you get division by zero and you get zero on the top as well.

105
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,100
Then at that point you need to try something else.

106
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,290
This is something else that we're trying right now so that you can plug in the zero directly but we

107
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,080
had to manipulate it.

108
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,470
Now however we don't have a denominator down here.

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,880
So to find the limb just plug it in.

110
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,919
So limit of 2 x plus H.

111
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
H approaches zero.

112
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:57,060
That's going to be equal to 2 x plus 0 which is equal to just 2 x.

113
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,860
All right.

114
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:06,940
So after all of that we have the derivative of x squared is given by 2x.

115
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,800
Interesting.

116
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,820
What does that mean.

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,160
Well this is a very awesome result.

118
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,210
And let me show you what it means.

119
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,040
So again the original function is x squared

120
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:32,700
it's derivative is to X.

121
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,270
OK so let's draw the graph of x squared quickly.

122
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,190
It is just a parabola.

123
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,460
So it's going to be a very simple graph.

124
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,280
So we have our parabola

125
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,580
Okay perfect.

126
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,880
So this is the function x squared.

127
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,060
The derivative is to X to remember how we talked about a derivative is a measure of the rate of change.

128
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,420
Let's go ahead and plug in three.

129
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,530
Just a random number.

130
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,040
Let's plug in three into this function so f of 3

131
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,630
equals 1.

132
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,500
So we do it three squared which is nine right.

133
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,360
So this point would be somewhere around here.

134
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,300
So this is three and let's say that nine is here.

135
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,660
And the point is right here right.

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:40,330
So what if I want to find the instantaneous rate of change at this point at the Point 3 9.

137
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:46,610
This is 3:9 How do I find that instantaneous rate of change.

138
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,760
Well remember that we said that the instantaneous rate of change is given by the tangent line to the

139
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,230
graph.

140
00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:05,700
At that point so if you draw a line like this this is a tangent line that touches the graph at exactly

141
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,600
that point the slope of this line will be the instantaneous rate of change.

142
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,560
But hold up that's where the derivative comes in.

143
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,770
OK.

144
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:23,870
Remember that derivative is the slope of the line tangent at points.

145
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:30,150
So literally all you need to do to find the instantaneous rate of change at this point is to get the

146
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,210
x value and you plug it into the derivative so

147
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,210
instantaneous rate of change

148
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,250
at X equals three.

149
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,180
You just take this three and you plug it into the derivative.

150
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,410
So this is going to be equal to

151
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,750
2 x replugging and 3 for X is going to be 2 times 3.

152
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,210
That is 6.

153
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,990
Boom 6 is instantaneous rate of change here when X equals 3.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,410
See how awesome a derivative is.

155
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,800
Once you get a function and you find it's derivative all you need to do to find the read of change at

156
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,270
any point in the graph is to plug the x value into the derivative.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,780
What if you want to find it when X equals 10.

158
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,170
When you find the instantaneous rate of change when X equals 10.

159
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:53,830
Well we just plug it into the derivative two times 10 is 20.

160
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,640
Boom.

161
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,670
There you go.

162
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,900
See you don't have to deal with drawing lines.

163
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,470
You don't have to deal with getting a c k.

164
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,500
You don't need to deal with finding a limit.

165
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:10,870
Once you have the derivative all you need to do is you plug in the x value into the derivative and that

166
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,530
gives you the instantaneous rate of change at that x value.

167
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:22,180
See how cool this is Perfect's one quick thing I want to mention we're going to cover this in the next

168
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,900
section.

169
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,350
But the way to know it's a derivative.

170
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:35,590
There are several ways but the main way to do it is just like the original function f of x but with

171
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:48,930
this little apostrophe here this means a derivative of f of x and the way you say that is f prime

172
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,570
of X

173
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:05,030
right so f prime of X is the derivative of f of x that is just the notation and we'll go over a couple

174
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,040
of more notations in the next section.

175
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,070
There's one thing I would like to mention about derivatives.

176
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,810
So the derivative can mean one of two things.

177
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,160
All right so a derivative

178
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,620
can either be

179
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,500
a derivative function

180
00:14:39,080 --> 00:15:01,610
or it can be the instantaneous rate of change.

181
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,980
All right so what does this mean.

182
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:13,170
So for example if I have a function which is f of x equals x squared which is the one that we did

183
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,500
it's derivative as we found out is actually 2 x.

184
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,480
Right.

185
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,160
So if we have the function f of x x equals squared and it tells you to find the derivative the answer

186
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,300
that I'm looking for is 2 x.

187
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,080
In theory though this is the derivative function.

188
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,870
OK.

189
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,130
Because it is a function that comes from another function.

190
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,960
And you can plug stuff into it but it's called a derivative as well.

191
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:58,440
However if I tell you find the instantaneous rate of change of x squared when X equals 2 while remember

192
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,860
instantaneous rate of change is given by the derivative.

193
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,640
And I want to find it at X equals 2.

194
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,880
So what I'll do is I'll plug into into this function.

195
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,990
So in 16 is rate of change I.R.S.

196
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:24,580
add X equals to we're going to go ahead and plug into into this derivative function.

197
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,490
So it's going to be two times two equals four.

198
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,220
All right.

199
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,530
So this is called a derivative.

200
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,720
And this is called the derivative.

201
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,310
You see the difference.

202
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:47,320
One is the generic function used to find instantaneous rates of change for the whole function.

203
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,940
And another one is the actual instantaneous rate of change at a certain point.

204
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,470
So if I ask you to find the instantaneous rate of change at X equals 9 you're going to go ahead and

205
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,020
plug in nine into this derivative.

206
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,480
If I tell you to find the instantaneous rate of change when X equals negative 5 you're going to go ahead

207
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,420
and plug in negative 5 into this derivative.

208
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,250
Etc. etc..

209
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:20,609
So again the derivative can either be the function or an actual instantaneous rate of change.

210
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,670
So how do you know which one to look for.

211
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,010
Well you always have to get the function somehow.

212
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,680
So sometimes in our problem you'll be asked.

213
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,050
OK.

214
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,720
Find the derivative of this function.

215
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,700
In that case we're going to learn about some rules that you can use to find derivative functions like

216
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,870
this.

217
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:44,500
But if in a problem you're asked find how this is changing when X equals something.

218
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,480
That means that first you have to find the derivative function and then you have to plug in the number

219
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,430
here if this is a make a lot of sense right now don't worry.

220
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,290
All right.

221
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,280
Just make sure that you know that derivative can mean one of two things either the function itself or

222
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,820
the result that you get when you plug in a number into the derivative function.
