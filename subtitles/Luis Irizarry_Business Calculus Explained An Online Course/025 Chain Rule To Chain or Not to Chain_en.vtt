1
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.810
All right.

2
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.000
So how can we identify when we need to use the chain rule versus when we don't.

3
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.050
I call this section a chain or not.

4
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
So I don't want you to randomly guess oh you know maybe this is the chain rule.

5
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.759
Maybe not.

6
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.040
I want you to have something to use so that you can determine right away whether you need to use the

7
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.060
chain rule or you don't.

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.600
And the key is this.

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.270
It's an inner function

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.830
and this inner function is not x.

11
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.010
All right.

12
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.170
So for example.

13
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.550
All right.

14
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.120
So on this side I'm going to put examples of functions that require the chain rule to find the derivative

15
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.730
and end this right on this side.

16
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.860
I'll give you examples of functions where you don't need to use the chain rule.

17
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.010
So here chain and here not chain.

18
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.110
All right so not chain an example that I gave you already is f of x equals x cubed.

19
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.300
Why don't we need to use a chain rule.

20
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.180
Well what is the inner function the inner function in theory is X right.

21
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.880
Because you have first X and then you have to cube it.

22
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.530
However this inner function cannot be x.

23
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.440
It needs to be something else.

24
00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:05.740
So for example this we did not change but this we do chain of X equals to X Minus One cubed.

25
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.160
So you see the difference.

26
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.130
This one is just x cubed.

27
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.280
But this one is 2 x minus 1 cute.

28
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.480
Here we have an inner function which is 2 x minus 1.

29
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.500
So when I say inner function I mean the function that's inside.

30
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.870
In this case this 2 X Minus One is inside of the cubed function.

31
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.230
Let me repeat that again.

32
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.950
If there is an inner function then you need to use the chain rule and in this case it is very clear

33
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.800
that we have an inner function that's not X it is 2 x minus 1.

34
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.500
So let's say we have this cube function we're plugging in to X Minus One into this cube function.

35
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.260
All right.

36
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.790
And during my years of tutoring I've noticed that the best way for a student to learn the chain rule

37
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.180
is through examples.

38
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.130
So let's do more of those.

39
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:10.750
So if I have of X equals square root of x Again I don't need to use a chain rule because square root

40
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.610
of x is x to the one half.

41
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.770
And here I could easily do the power rule.

42
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.080
Right.

43
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.860
Because this is a power function.

44
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.670
And what we did in the previous slide which is bring the dictator down.

45
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.040
We subtract one etc. etc..

46
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.820
However if we put something else under this route that's not an x then we need to use the chain rule

47
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.270
for example.

48
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:48.380
Square root of x squared minus 16 all of a sudden we do not have a square root of x by itself.

49
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.590
We have x squared minus 16 under the square root.

50
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.200
So what is the inner function inner function is x squared minus 16.

51
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.980
And let me go ahead and start putting the inner functions next to these functions.

52
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.590
So you know what they are.

53
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.710
And by the way in the chain will the enter functions are denoted by U SO U is the inner function.

54
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.279
Right inner functions are you.

55
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:25.360
So the inner function for this one is to X Minus One because this 2 X Minus One is within this other

56
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.980
cube function right.

57
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.910
So inner function is 2 x minus 1.

58
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.390
Next what does the inner function here.

59
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:44.780
Inner function is x squared minus 16 because this x squared minus 16 is wrapped by this square root

60
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.140
so you equals x squared.

61
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.830
Mine is 16.

62
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.690
So if you see a function wrapped around another function that is a composition like we see in these

63
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.740
two examples.

64
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.720
This function is wrapped by the three and this function is wrapped by the square root.

65
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.990
Let's do a couple more.

66
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:18.500
So if I have this function f of x equals x to the tenth again no need to use the chain rule.

67
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.480
This is just a power function and you can just use the power rule.

68
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.070
Right.

69
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.610
You can use a dictator mnemonic and get your derivative.

70
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.530
However on the other hand if you have half of X equals

71
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:45.700
x plus 1 to the tenth all of a sudden we have a composition of functions this X plus one is being plugged

72
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.260
in into this function that elevates it to the tenth power.

73
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.260
Right.

74
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.850
So what is the inner function for this one.

75
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.760
Remember the inner function is wrapped around another function.

76
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:07.280
So in this case it is the X plus one.

77
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.800
All right.

78
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.530
Let's do another example.

79
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.380
X equals

80
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.710
two.

81
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.020
So the X and we actually haven't done this yet.

82
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.570
This is called an exponential function even though we haven't done it.

83
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.230
I can tell you that we do not need to use any sort of chain rule because you're just elevating to the

84
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.170
X power.

85
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.570
Right.

86
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:46.650
So the input is X However when you have something like this to the x squared minus 3 x so the exponent

87
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.410
is x squared minus 3 x then all of a sudden we need to use a chain rule.

88
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.090
Why.

89
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.070
Because we have one function inside another.

90
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.480
What does the inner function again remember the inner function is wrapped around another.

91
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.130
We have this too.

92
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.480
So this power.

93
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.110
So first we need to get this power and then we can apply to the two.

94
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.370
That means that the inner function is x squared minus 3 x

95
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.520
so this should be making sense by this point right.

96
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.000
Whenever you see a function and it's wrapped around another then you know you have a composition and

97
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.790
we can get the inner function which is the function that's wrapped around the other.

98
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:45.170
So in all of these cases you can do what you would typically do with X that would be incomplete for

99
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.960
the chain rule.

100
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.840
There's an extra step and we'll learn how to do the chain rule and just a second.

101
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.100
Let's do one more example.

102
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.590
All right so we have this function one over x to the seven.

103
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.900
It looks kind of weird though right.

104
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:16.640
So do you remember how we do this the way we do this is we take this x to the 7th and we bring it to

105
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.210
the top by flipping the sign of the exponents.

106
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.460
So this becomes X to the negative seventh.

107
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.120
All right.

108
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:32.909
And after this is just a regular power function and you can just use the power rule as you can see for

109
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.760
all of these examples.

110
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:42.870
The inner function quote unquote is X right x to the third X so the one have X to the tenth to to the

111
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:51.760
x x to the negative 7 etc. etc. in all of these examples however it's never x by itself.

112
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.790
That's why I mentioned that here.

113
00:08:53.790 --> 00:09:02.280
You're not going to have x by itself to X minus 1 x squared minus 16 expletive 1 x squared minus 3 x

114
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.730
etc. etc..

115
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.420
So that is the main difference.

116
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.200
This one only has X and these ones have more than X..

117
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.960
They have X and more stuff.

118
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.480
All right.

119
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:20.520
So like I said here we can do the power rule with no problem but if we get the chain rule version

120
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.510
let's say that we have

121
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.610
x three plus four to the negative seven.

122
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.040
Again all of a sudden we don't have x by itself.

123
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.530
We have x cubed plus four.

124
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.960
So if you want to get the derivative of this you need to use the chain rule.

125
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:50.750
So I think you know by this point that the inner function would be execute plus for

126
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.340
all right.

127
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:04.830
So let me separate this here.

128
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.080
So you might be thinking.

129
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.430
All right.

130
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.640
So we already know when to use the chain rule.

131
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.460
So the question is what is the chain rule and how do we apply it.

132
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.180
And we'll get to that in just a second.

133
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.830
Just before I want to show you something.

134
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.900
So let's say that you want to get the derivative of this function over here.

135
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.850
Right.

136
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.310
X plus 1 to the tenth.

137
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:36.430
So in theory you could go ahead and multiply X plus 1 by itself 10 times and after that you're going

138
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.640
to get like this huge huge thing that you have to simplify.

139
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:56.620
So for example x plus 1 to the tenth equals x plus 1 times exploits won times X was won.

140
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:06.190
Times X was won etc. etc. until you do that 10 times.

141
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.460
All right so you're multiplying X plus 1 by itself 10 times.

142
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.180
Not only that after you write it like this.

143
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.250
Guess what you have to foil every single thing.

144
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.940
So you have to foil these two and then you have to foil these two.

145
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.670
And then you have to do that all over the place.

146
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.020
And that is extremely annoying.

147
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:30.470
The beautiful thing about the chain rule is that it allows us to get the derivative of stuff like this

148
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.240
very quickly.

149
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.100
You don't have to multiply this thing all over the place just to be able to get the derivative.

150
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.200
You can quickly use the chain rule and do it right away.

151
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.020
So once you learn it it's a very powerful tool that you can use to find the derivative of composition

152
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.550
of functions.

153
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.770
Nobody wants to multiply exploits one 10 times and then get the derivative.

154
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.290
That would be ridiculous.

155
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.690
Even for example 2 x minus 1 3 times even that is a lot of work with the chain rule.

156
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.990
We could do it right away.

157
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.250
So how do we apply the chain rule.

158
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.290
Let's get into it.
