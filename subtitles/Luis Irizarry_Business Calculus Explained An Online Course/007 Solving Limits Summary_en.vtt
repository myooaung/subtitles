00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.370
All right so a quick summary of what we just covered.

2
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.150
So number one and this is the most important thing.

3
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.760
Remember your mnemonic your moniker says to find the way.

4
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.259
Just plug it in again.

5
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.740
It even rhymes.

6
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.740
How cool is that to find him.

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.790
Just plug it in.

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.210
Any time you get a LIMIT the first thing you're going to try.

9
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.760
Always always always is to take the number that is approaching.

10
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.400
Plugging that in into the function.

11
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.340
If you get a zero in the bottom then you know you need to do something else but otherwise that is your

12
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.520
limit.

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.010
All right.

14
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.730
So sometimes plugging in a number for a limit will result in a denominator of zero.

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.930
When this happens you can either factor or rationalize.

16
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.160
So we can do one of two things depending on what we have.

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.440
The factory sation is expressing something in terms of multiplication and we cover the difference of

18
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.630
perfect squares and difference or perfect squares is basically this.

19
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.170
If you have A-squared mine is B squared.

20
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.610
So you have a difference of squares right because you are squaring a and you're square in B then that

21
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:40.820
can be broken down into a plus b times a minus B.

22
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.180
And remember a is not a squared is just the A itself.

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
The same for B.

24
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.590
So if you have something like X squared.

25
00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:01.810
Mine is 16 that's going to be equal to x plus four times x.

26
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.550
Mine is for.

27
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.480
So you pretty much take whatever's being squared this X and for the 16 words being squared is a 4 right.

28
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.580
Because Foursquare equals 16.

29
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.320
To not make the mistake of putting a 16 here and a 16 here.

30
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.630
All right cool.

31
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.310
So there are other cases of factorization and we'll find those problems when we do them.

32
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.120
Then rationalization is multiplying a fraction by its conjugate on top and bottom then cancelling a

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.790
term on both top and bottom and plugging in the number.

34
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.640
So remember we did rationalization as well.

35
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.480
And by the way a conjugate is the same expression with a different sign in the middle.

36
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:57.660
So for example if you have a square root of x mine is 64 the conjugate of is will be a square root of

37
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.220
x plus 64.

38
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.190
Let's look at one more concept and the last concept is that not all limits exist.

39
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.360
Sometimes they just don't exist.

40
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.480
So for example when plugging in a limit gives the number over zero.

41
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.070
The limit does not exist at that point there is no need to do any sort of rationalization or factoring.

42
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.340
It just does not exist.

43
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.800
Now when it gives you 0 0 then at that point you can go ahead and you can try some other things.

44
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.360
All right.

45
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.040
That's pretty much it.

46
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.380
So to find a way.

47
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.440
Just plug it in to not forget that and we'll do a couple of problems and the problems section.

48
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.310
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
