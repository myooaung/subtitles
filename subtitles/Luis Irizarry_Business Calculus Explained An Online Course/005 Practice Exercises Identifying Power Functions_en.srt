1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,560
Of all right.

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,060
So let's go ahead and get started with identifying power functions.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,330
So first exercise says Is this a power function f of x equals x to the five.

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,890
So what do you think.

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,170
Yes or no.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,980
Go ahead and pause a video and give it a shot.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,740
All right.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,300
So what do you think.

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,600
Is it a power function.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:52,320
Well the answer is yes it is a power function because remember power functions come in the form X to

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,150
the end and being a number right next to the N N and is a real number.

12
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,480
That means it's not imaginary.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,040
If you haven't seen imaginary numbers yet don't worry about that.

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,710
Basically take it to mean that he can be any number at all.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,570
So the 5 is definitely a power function.

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,290
All right here we have our next example.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,290
Is this a power function f of x equals x to the negative 2.

18
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,870
So X not to the positive to put to the negative 2.

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,240
Is it a power function.

20
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,030
I'll let you pause the video and give it a shot.

21
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:54,170
All right so what do you think the answer is that yes it is a power function because again a power function

22
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,720
has the form at the end.

23
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,620
Right.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,240
It's being elevated to a certain power.

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,810
So in this case the end is negative too.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,300
It doesn't matter that it's negative it's still a real number.

27
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:14,460
So this is why this is a power function.

28
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,960
All right.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:25,970
So our next example is is this a power a function of x equals to the X so to the X let's you pause the

30
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,800
video and give it a shot.

31
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,020
All right.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,570
So what do you think is the X a power function.

33
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,920
Well the answer is that no it's not a power function.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,390
All right.

35
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,560
That was kind of a trick question.

36
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,210
So if you got it wrong don't feel bad because it can be confusing.

37
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,500
So remember power functions have the form X to the end.

38
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:03,340
This is a power function.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,650
So you have X elevated to a number.

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,360
In this case we had the opposite.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
We had two a number elevated to X..

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,170
So this is completely different than X to the end.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,240
This is and the X basically.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,900
So here the input is actually in the exponents and in our power function the input is the base of the

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,800
exponent.

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,850
All right.

47
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,890
So this is not a power function.

48
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,590
This is actually called an exponential function.

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,110
But we'll take a look at that later on.

50
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,570
All right just make sure that you do not confuse the two power function x to the end.

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,140
Right.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,150
So the number is here on top.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,660
All right.

54
00:03:50,670 --> 00:04:01,320
So for our last exercise is this a power function f of x equals x to the 3 over 4 I'll let you pause

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,520
and give it a shot.

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,480
All right.

57
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:14,590
So what do you think the answer is that yes it is a power function.

58
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:21,110
So maybe it looks a little bit weird because you have a fraction and the exponent but again it doesn't

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,640
matter.

60
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,670
Remember that a fraction after all is still a number.

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,340
If you go to a calculator and you plug in three over four you're going to get point seventy five.

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,530
So this is like saying X to the point seventy five.

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,040
All right so this is definitely a power function.

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,550
I will do an example in the next section of how to find the derivative of problems where they have fractions

65
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,460
in the exponent.

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,440
All right but just make sure you know this is also a power function because it's in the form X to the

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,410
end and being a real number.
