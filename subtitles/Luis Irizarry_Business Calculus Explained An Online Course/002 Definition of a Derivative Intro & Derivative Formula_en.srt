00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:27,630
Hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus this session will discuss the most important

2
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,820
topic in all of calculus.

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,670
The concept of a derivative derivatives are the foundation of calculus.

4
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,950
And we're going to talk about them here.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,780
Now a derivative is connected to the concept of rate of change.

6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,230
So let's summarize what we talked about in the last section about average an instantaneous rate of change.

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,680
So remember we have two types of lines.

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:05,200
We have a second line and we have a tangent line.

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,520
So a second line touches the graph at two points.

10
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,720
And again it measures the average rate of change.

11
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:28,920
So how function is changing on average from one point to the next.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,530
On the other hand the tangent line touches the graph at only one point

13
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,880
and instead of measuring the average it actually measures the instantaneous rate of change.

14
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,270
Instantaneous rate of change that is for the tangent line

15
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,100
and the actual value for the rate of change for both of these lines is the slope.

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,180
So the slope of the sequence gives you the average rate of change and the slope of the tangent gives

17
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,790
you the instantaneous rate of change.

18
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:22,980
Now the whole idea behind calculus is to make the two points that a second line is connecting as close

19
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,100
as possible.

20
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,040
And if you remember from the last tutorial basically what we do is this

21
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:59,010
OK so let's say we want to find the average rate of change between this point over here and this point

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,060
over here.

23
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,700
Right.

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:12,570
So we would have pretty much a second line that touches both points and let's call this x zero.

25
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,760
So zero just means that it's a value of x.

26
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,060
We do not know what it is.

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,220
But right now it doesn't matter.

28
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:32,460
And let's say that this points has the value as 0 plus H.

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,260
Ok so things are getting weird.

30
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,420
Why 0 plus H.

31
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,700
So think about it like this.

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,460
Imagine that x 0 is three.

33
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,700
OK.

34
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,790
So for a second think that 0 is 3.

35
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:59,080
So what we're going to do is we're going to add h which is another number 2 x 0.

36
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,730
Let's say that H is 1.

37
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,660
So we have x 0 which is three plus H which is one gives you four.

38
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:18,440
So the x value for this one is just 3 x 0 and the x value for this one is three plus one which is four.

39
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,190
OK.

40
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,650
So let's draw the second line.

41
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,540
It's going to look something like this touches both points.

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,320
OK.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,990
So what if we wanted to get the slope of this line.

44
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,360
Well remember that slope is AM and it is right over run

45
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,410
and if you're a member from the other tutorial that we did on slopes basically rice over run is basically

46
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,460
the change in why over the change in x.

47
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,780
So if you have two points and you want to get the slope of the line connecting the two points your formula

48
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:23,000
is going to be y to minus why one over x 2 minus x 1.

49
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,270
So you have two points right.

50
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,900
You have

51
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,690
X1 y one.

52
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:38,220
That's your first point and you have x to y to and again to get the slope.

53
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:47,240
All you need to do is grab the whys so y to minus y one and then divide that over X to minus x 1.

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,910
That's going to give you the slope of this line.

55
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,020
So using our notation for exit on h.

56
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:03,330
Let's try to find the slope of this.

57
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,410
So in our case we have two points right.

58
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,940
Our first point is

59
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,990
x 0 and f x 0.

60
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,400
Right.

61
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,410
Because we're plugging in zero.

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,460
And that's going to give us a Y value.

63
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,680
We do not know what those numbers are but again it doesn't matter.

64
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:31,530
And our second point is going to be well the x value is x 0 plus H.

65
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,690
And again we set H is just a number that you add to zero.

66
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,330
So the x value here is zero plus H

67
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,060
comma and then the y value is f x zero plus H.

68
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:57,040
Right because we're plugging in this zero plus H into f of x.

69
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,490
All right.

70
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,890
So this is point number one.

71
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,880
I'll put it over here that's points 1.

72
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,310
And this is point 2.

73
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:16,500
These are the two points that the second line is touching and they're both on the curve.

74
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,460
This is point to.

75
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,020
All right.

76
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,190
So let's go ahead and plug these in into our formula for slope.

77
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,750
So again we have point 1 and we have Point 2.

78
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,300
So let's plug these numbers into our formula for slope.

79
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,220
So what is why too.

80
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,350
Well y2 is the y value of the second points which is of zero plus H.

81
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,020
OK.

82
00:07:51,050 --> 00:08:03,540
And then we do minus what does why one just add a vague zero.

83
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:15,960
All right everything over what is x 2 is the x value of point number two it is zero plus H.

84
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:29,630
And we do minus x 1 so x 1 is just the x value of point 1 which is zero.

85
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:34,700
Interesting.

86
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,500
If you look at the denominator here why do we have.

87
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,840
Well we have x 0.

88
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,110
Sorry I forgot the minus here.

89
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,230
We have x 0 minus 0.

90
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,230
What does that mean.

91
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,380
That means that they cancel out.

92
00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:07,840
So this zero goes away and this zero goes away and we're left with equals f of zero plus H mine is half

93
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,760
of zero

94
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,360
over h.

95
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,890
This right here is the slope of the second line.

96
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,770
All right.

97
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,530
All right so let's go to the next screen.

98
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,370
Let me just rewrite what we have so far.

99
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:36,030
So we have that the slope of the second line is equal to half of zero plus H.

100
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,910
Minus Zero.

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Everything over.

102
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,500
H OK.

103
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,600
So.

104
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,120
And let me just redraw the graph on the right here.

105
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:07,330
So it doesn't have to be exactly the same but we know that it was something similar to this and they'll

106
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,800
make it a little bigger so that we can actually zoom in.

107
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,940
So it was something like this.

108
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,110
All right.

109
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,050
Doesn't matter what's on the right or what's on the left.

110
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,570
This is the important part.

111
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,050
So we have the second line between these two points.

112
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,950
So we have this line connecting the two points.

113
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,630
Right now that's all well and good.

114
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,890
We have the average rate of change because the slope of the second line measures the average rate of

115
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,050
change and it's one more thing we have.

116
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,190
This is egg zero right.

117
00:10:50,200 --> 00:11:00,900
This x value for this point and the x value for this other point is zero plus H.

118
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:07,090
So basically h is the difference between the x value here and the x value here.

119
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,560
Right.

120
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,630
Because we have x 0 and then we have X or a plus H.

121
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,010
It's like saying three gallons of water.

122
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,980
And this is three plus one gallons of water.

123
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,850
So the differences one.

124
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,010
Right.

125
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,510
Because you have three and four.

126
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,380
The difference is just one.

127
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,180
Now this is the second line average rate of change.

128
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:36,810
What happens if we want to find the instantaneous rate of change for this point over here.

129
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,330
Remember that instantaneous rate of change is given by the tangent line.

130
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,630
So when you add a line that's tangent to the graph and that touches a graph only at one point.

131
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:56,560
Well like we said in the other tutorial you can actually approximate a tangent line by getting the points

132
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,020
in a second line closer together.

133
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:06,910
So if you want to find the rate of change here what you can do is you can grab the other point and you

134
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,680
can make it closer.

135
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,250
So again let's say that we want to grab this point and want to bring it over here.

136
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:27,870
So we have another second line.

137
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,160
That means that age just got smaller because the x value is not here anymore.

138
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,520
It is actually here because here's where you have this other point.

139
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:46,160
And what if you got closer what if you had a point here and then the second line is between these two

140
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,060
well what happens is you get closer and closer to the tangent line.

141
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,770
So you see that first of all we're started with the blue line which was way over here then we got to

142
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,680
the green line which was closer but not enough.

143
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,900
And then we got to the right line which is getting closer.

144
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:18,000
So what is going on here as h gets smaller then the line resembles more and more a tangent line.

145
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,340
So right now zero plus age is over here.

146
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,920
But if you make H smaller then exurbia plus H is going to get closer and closer to Gero.

147
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:36,260
So you see that you start to get closer and closer to zero until it actually becomes what's called infinitesimally

148
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,850
small.

149
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,980
That means very very very very small in fact so small you cannot even measure it.

150
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,420
And at that point you do not have a second line anymore.

151
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,400
What you have is a tangent line.

152
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,250
All right.

153
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,870
So I don't know if you've caught on yet.

154
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,890
We're talking about making age smaller and smaller.

155
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,400
What does that mean.

156
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,230
It means that age is approaching zero.

157
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,340
What do you use when a variable is approaching a number.

158
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:14,130
Of course we use limits remember limits that we covered way back.

159
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,000
We use them again here.

160
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,780
So this is the slope of the second line.

161
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,260
Let's try to get the slope of the tangent line.

162
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,470
So let me write em 10 so we know we're working with the tangent line.

163
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,410
So what is this.

164
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,690
The slope of the tangent line is let's grab this same thing.

165
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:48,860
So just the CAn't of exit row plus H minus f of zero.

166
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,430
Over H.

167
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,990
But then what do we say.

168
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:02,560
We said that as age gets smarter smaller then we approximate the tangent line.

169
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:11,240
So instead of doing just this we're going to do the limits of all this.

170
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,530
As age approaches zero

171
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,880
this right here ladies and gentlemen is the foundation of calculus.

172
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,010
This little formula over here.

173
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,930
This is it.

174
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,490
It does not get any better than this.

175
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,380
Check it out.

176
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,680
Why is this so important.

177
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:47,090
This formula right here actually measures the slope of a tangent line and what is a slope of a tangent

178
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,660
line.

179
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,930
It's the instantaneous rate of change.

180
00:15:50,960 --> 00:16:01,820
So this formula right here can tell you exactly how a function is changing at any point in its domain.

181
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,430
So with this formula here we know how the function is changing at this point and we know how it's changing

182
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,540
at this point.

183
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,350
And we also know how it's changing at this point.

184
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,910
So it's basically used to find the rate of change of a curve.

185
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
This is it.

186
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,710
So let me just read it here because this is huge.

187
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,440
This is the slope

188
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,080
of a line

189
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,690
tangent to a curve.

190
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,400
We put a couple of exclamation points because this is so important.

191
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,540
I hope you're enjoying this right now.

192
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,250
I hope you're going to throw a party because of this.

193
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,530
This is amazing.

194
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,350
All right.

195
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,750
This is a slope of a line that's tangent to a curve.

196
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,230
In other words it tells you how the curve is changing at a specific point.

197
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,780
All right.

198
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:10,260
Because remember the slope of a tangent line is that instantaneous rate of change awesome.

199
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,089
One more thing I'll do is I'll rewrite this and instead of saying egg's zero because remember F-0 was

200
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,490
as specific x value instead of saying x 0.

201
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm just going to say X which is the generic formula.

202
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,760
All right.

203
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,119
So let me just put it down here.

204
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:33,590
And equals the limit of f of x plus H.

205
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:47,310
Mine is 5 x over h as age approaches zero

206
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,260
bang.

207
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,650
There we go.

208
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,300
And again the only difference between this one and the one we just did is that this one instead of saying

209
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,340
0 it just says X because it's generic.

210
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:15,190
And this ladies and gentlemen is called the derivative of f of x are riveted of f of x.

211
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,230
Right.

212
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,890
So word derivative.

213
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,200
My goodness you're going to hear that word a million times starting from now.

214
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,760
All right.

215
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,630
This right here is the derivative of f of x Let's go over this again.

216
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,570
So what do we have we have.

217
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:46,320
Slope is equal to the limit of f of x plus H minus f of x over age as h approaches zero.

218
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,510
That is your derivative of.
