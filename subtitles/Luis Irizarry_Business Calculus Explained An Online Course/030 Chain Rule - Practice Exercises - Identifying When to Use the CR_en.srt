1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,130
All right.

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,140
So let's go ahead and do some exercises on the chain rule.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,500
So for this first section what we'll do is we'll say whether finding prime of X requires the chain rule

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,950
when f of x equals a certain function.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,460
So we pretty much want to know if you have this function like this then are we going to need to use

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,800
a chain rule to find its derivative.

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,010
So the answer is either yes or no.

8
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:52,460
For this specific one say whether finding f prime of X requires the chain rule if X equals x squared

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,860
plus five to the third power.

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,170
I'll let you go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,180
All right.

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,780
So remember that the chain rule is used whenever you have one function with another function.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,190
So you have a composition of functions.

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,790
In this case it's very clear that you have this function here X squared plus five with then this other

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,610
function that takes it to the third power.

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,000
So we have here an inner function.

17
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,580
Remember that to the terminal whether you need to use a chain rule or not.

18
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,800
First you're going to look at the function as a whole and you're going to think Is there an inner function

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,450
here.

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,070
In this case there is it's X squared plus five.

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,410
So in this case this one does require using the chain rule.

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,630
All right let's go to another example.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,530
All right so this is an example number to say whether finding f prime of X requires the chain rule if

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,960
f of x equals x to the seventh minus 3 x plus 9.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,090
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

26
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,800
All right so does it require the chain rule.

27
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,280
If you look at this all we have is X to the seventh minus 3 x plus 9.

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,080
So this is one function.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,270
However this is not Rabs and any other function right.

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,750
We do not have you know like this.

31
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,990
To the second power we don't have like the square root of this or anything like that.

32
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,650
So is there really an inner function here.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,820
Not really.

34
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,510
This is just a regular function.

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,380
And in fact to find this derivative you know how to do this all you do is take the derivative of the

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:52,520
first one minus the derivative of the second plus the derivative of the third and that's it.

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,350
There's no need for the chain rule here.

38
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,780
So the answer is no no.

39
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,220
Jane

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,520
All right so here we have the next say whether finding f prime of X requires the chain rule f f x equals

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,920
3 x squared times 5 x minus 3.

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,040
Go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,770
So what do you think.

44
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,420
Do we need to use a chain rule here or we don't.

45
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,790
So if you saw these parentheses and you said that kind of looks like a plug in this summer or else than

46
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,610
actually that's not the case.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,260
If you think about it all we're doing here is we'll multiplying two different functions.

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,820
We're multiplying three x squared times 5 x minus 3.

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,220
So when we multiply remember we use the product rule.

50
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,150
There's really no inner function here.

51
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,870
And if that's not very clear Think of it like this let's say we had parentheses here and here.

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,410
All of a sudden it's a lot more clear that we're multiplying two functions.

53
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,160
This one here times this one here there is no inner function.

54
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,860
The only thing being squared is this x.

55
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,070
So no change needed for that.

56
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,730
Just regular power.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,230
So for the reason that we're just multiplying two functions this does not need the chain rule.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,260
All right so here's another example.

59
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,630
Say whether finding f prime of X requires the chain rule.

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:41,200
If f of x equals the square root of 2 x go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

61
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,030
All right so do we need the chain rule.

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,990
Is there an inner function that basically is the question.

63
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,160
So the answer is that whenever you're wrapping up a function that's not X under another function then

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,820
you need to use the chain rule here.

65
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,370
We do not have just x we actually have 2 x therefore we do have an inner function.

66
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,070
This inner function u is 2 x right.

67
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,470
So in this case we do need to use the chain rule

68
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,630
so if I had told you for example find a derivative of a square root of x then here you do not need to

69
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,600
use the chain rule because it's just X.

70
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,440
However here because we have a square root of 2 x so it's not x by itself.

71
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,080
Then you do need to use the chain rule.

72
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,410
All right so this would take out and we stay with this square root of 2 x has an inner function of 2

73
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,080
x we do apply the chain rule.

74
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,630
So here's a kind of a tricky one.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Let's say whether finding a from of IVAX requires the chain rule if f of x equals 5 over execute minus

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,260
1.

77
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,460
Everything squared.

78
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,250
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,010
All right.

80
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,790
So I said this one was kind of a tricky one because if you look at it what are we doing.

81
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,260
We have a division right.

82
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,880
So we have this top function over this bottom function.

83
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,170
So we definitely need to use the quotient rule.

84
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:31,160
If you said to yourself OK this is just a quotient no chain rule then let's look at it together because

85
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,130
eventually for this one we will need to use the chain rule.

86
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,480
So remember that to find the derivative of a division we use the quotient rule and that quotient rule

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,440
says that we place our repeats.

88
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,950
So it's five

89
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,620
x three minus one squared.

90
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,980
And then we just place the other repeat.

91
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:02,700
So that's five times X to 3 minus 1 squared.

92
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,940
And then remember that we take the outer derivatives so derivative of this and derivative of this

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,410
and then we do minus the B-S the bottom squared.

94
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:25,160
So it's X to the third minus 1 squared and we're squaring that again right.

95
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,560
So this would be a derivative.

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,320
So at this point we've only done the quotient rule right.

97
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,060
We just applied that.

98
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,880
However what happens if you look at this especially this part

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,820
it turns out that this is X to the third minus one to the second power.

100
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,970
And we want to get the derivative of that whole thing right.

101
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,840
So for this part you will need to use the chain rule because you have this inner function x cubed minus

102
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,050
one and you're elevating that to the second power and you want to find the derivative of the whole thing.

103
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,320
So what I want you to understand is sometimes in the course of applying other differentiation rules

104
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,200
like the product rule or the some rule or anything like that you might have to use the chain rule with

105
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,910
then using those other derivative rules.

106
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,050
And I know this is kind of confusing.

107
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,430
So we'll do a couple of examples now of using the chain rule and combining it with other things.

108
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,919
The point is that the answer to this is originally No we do not need to use a chain rule but eventually

109
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,169
we do because we run into something like this.

110
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,850
So yes this one requires the chain rule at some point.

111
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,520
All right.

112
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,920
So let's stop it with a theory.

113
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,470
Let's go do some actual exercises.
