1
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:20,560
All right.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,670
So let's do a couple of exercises for functions.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,350
So I'm going to give you a couple of functions and you're going to have to plug in a couple of inputs

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,840
into it and get the outputs.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:43,660
So in this example it says if X equals x plus 3 Find f of to half of 10 and F of negative 20.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,380
So you can go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

7
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,660
Once you have done the problems you can pause it and I'll do the solution with you and we'll look at

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,250
the solution together.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,090
So go ahead and pause the video and give it a shot.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,050
All right.

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,450
So let's go ahead and get these done.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,780
So function is X plus three.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,410
And we're going to plug in these values over here.

14
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,300
So let's start with half of two.

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,850
So remember all we need to do is substitute this ax that we have here by the number where plug it in.

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,630
So in this case it's two.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,090
So that's going to be two plus three

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,140
that equals five.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:52,920
And actually if we build a small table here of input and output remember axes and put the Y is the output.

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,680
So for the input of two the output is five

21
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,150
right.

22
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:04,750
Great.

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:13,570
So let's move on to the next one of 10.

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,050
So again what we do is simply plug in 10 over here.

25
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,610
So that's going to be 10 plus three

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,030
and that's going to be 13.

27
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,820
All right.

28
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,550
So for the input of 10 the output is going to be 13

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,270
great.

30
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:49,580
Now let's plug in our last number so of negative 20.

31
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,470
So we're going to go ahead and plug it in right here.

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,070
So we have negative 20 plus 3

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,390
so if you owe $20 that's represented by the negative you owe money.

34
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,890
All right.

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
Oh $20.

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,720
And then you pay three back.

37
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,740
You're going to oh 17.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,480
It's a negative 20 plus three is going to give you negative 17.

39
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,320
All right.

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:30,270
So for the input of negative 20 output or why value is negative 17.

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,570
That's it.

42
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:38,600
So we just plugged in these three inputs into the function and we got our corresponding outputs right

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,190
here.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,560
All right.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,360
So first second exercise here we have an example that's a little bit more interesting than just x plus

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,030
three we have x squared minus x.

47
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,270
So that means whatever input we give this function we're going to square it.

48
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:03,100
So we're going to multiplied by itself and then we're going to subtract the same input and go ahead

49
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,450
and pause the video and give it a shot.

50
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,390
All right so now we should be good to go and let's work through the solution and see how you do it.

51
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,800
So first we're going to take this three and we're going to plug it into the function.

52
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,810
So half three equals what.

53
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,610
So we plug it in right here.

54
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,700
So we have three squared

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:44,110
minus three three squared is nine minus three is six.

56
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,630
There we go.

57
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,360
All right let's go to the next one.

58
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,090
Let's plug in zero

59
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,380
of zero.

60
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,940
We're going to plug it in right here.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,840
So we have zero squared minus zero.

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,580
So zero time zero zero.

63
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,600
And then we have minus zero.

64
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,940
Of course that gives us zero at the end.

65
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,320
So plugging in zero gives us back an output of zero.

66
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,800
Of course this is not always the case with all functions.

67
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,750
This is just for this example.

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,950
Sometimes you plug in zero and you get some other numbers.

69
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,380
And finally let's play again are negative too.

70
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:51,310
So half of negative to equals we plug in negative to read here so negative 2 squared.

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,880
Mine is and then negative too.

72
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,560
So we do minus negative too.

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,190
All right.

74
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,870
So we have negative 2 squared so it's negative two times and negative to remember that a negative times

75
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,060
a negative is a positive.

76
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,930
And that's something that we'll talk about often in this tutorial.

77
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,950
So negative times negative is a positive.

78
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,750
So negative two terms and negative 2 is positive for all right.

79
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,500
And then we have minus negative too.

80
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,780
But it turns out that this mine is here.

81
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:38,090
It's like it's multiplying this negative to even though it's subtracting when you have a negative in

82
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,790
front of something that changes the sign of that something.

83
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,030
So negative times a negative gives you a positive.

84
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,540
All right.

85
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:57,910
So those negative times negative becomes plus to and that gives us six.

86
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,140
There we go.

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,100
So plugging in three gives us six plug in in negative two gives us six and plug it in zero gives us

88
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,610
zero.

89
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,040
All right.

90
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:17,780
So for the last exercise here's kind of an interesting one of x equals 45.

91
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,050
And we need to plug in three 11 and twenty thousand fifty nine.

92
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,540
All right.

93
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,110
So a pause a video and give it a shot.

94
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,730
All right so how is it a go with this one.

95
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,720
Or is it a little bit weird maybe knew what to do.

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,990
Maybe you didn't.

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,740
Well this function is in fact a little bit weird because if you notice there's no X..

98
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,020
So where do you plug in the input.

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,890
The answer is you don't.

100
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,430
It turns out that the output for this function is always 45 because it doesn't have an X..

101
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,480
You cannot plug in anything into it.

102
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,630
So if we do of three that's going to be 45.

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,740
All right half of 11 is also going to be 45.

104
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,370
And what do you think this one is going to be.

105
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,600
Twenty thousand and 59

106
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,070
a.

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,790
It's going to be 45.

108
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,700
That doesn't change.

109
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,390
So it turns out that all the y values for this function are always going to be 45.

110
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,610
This is called a constant function the y value never changes.

111
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,450
All right.

112
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,039
So good.

113
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:48,930
We just went over a couple of examples of plugging numbers into functions just to get you used to this

114
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,680
idea.

115
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,220
You're going to be plugging numbers into functions.

116
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,130
I can promise you until the day of the final exam.

117
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,400
So this is a concept that you'll be doing over and over and over.

118
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,420
Now as I always like to say I give you a couple of problems to get you used to it.

119
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,920
You need to do your homework.

120
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,560
So whatever problems your professor assigns to you he need to do it.

121
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,910
That is the only way you'll learn if you only do these three exercises and then you call it a day.

122
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,120
You're not going to learn basic calculus and I'm not just saying this.

123
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,340
This is true.

124
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,570
I've had students that take tutoring with me and they only study when we tutor.

125
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,470
So in that one hour that we just go over problems and concepts that is the only time they dedicate to

126
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,890
base his calculus.

127
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,050
Guess what.

128
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,350
A lot of those students do not pass because they don't like to put in the work to learn math.

129
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,540
You really really need to practice.

130
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,380
That is the only way of passing.

131
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,080
So I can tell you right now the problems that I gave you here there are not enough and I don't like

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,740
to give you too many problems because what I want you to do is to learn the concept do a couple of problems

133
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,130
and then do whatever your professor assigns to you.

134
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:15,060
The reason why is that whatever your professor or science see you is where you're going to end up seeing

135
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,100
and quizzes and exams.

136
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,970
All right.

137
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,160
So it's very important that you learn the concepts whether you want to do it in class or you want to

138
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
learn it here.

139
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,380
But the homework that you get you need to do.

140
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,880
All right.

141
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,410
That's going to be a theme throughout these tutorials.

142
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,970
You've got to put in the work.

143
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,490
And I'm here to guide you and to help you learn the concepts more easily.

144
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,380
All right.

145
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,300
So that was it for our topic of functions and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
