1
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,190
All right so here we have it.

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,280
We have that f of x equals 2 x squared over three x cubed plus four x.

3
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,790
So go ahead and pause the video and give that one a shot.

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,030
All right.

5
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,810
So let's see how you did.

6
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,510
And actually I'll call this one D-y over dx.

7
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,670
You know I need to switch up the notation every once in a while so that you get used to seeing this

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,360
D-y over dx.

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,600
Remember this means derivative right.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,120
So derivative is going to be equal to what.

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,800
Well it's a quotient.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:04,310
So we need to use the quotient rule and we use our mnemonic pro minus the B-S.

13
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,460
So the pro says to place our repeats.

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:17,840
So we'll do this once to x squared the top function times the bottom function 3 x cubed plus four X

15
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,870
and then we have two squared.

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:38,040
So just repeating again times 3 x cubed plus four X remember the next step is the oh so take the derivative

17
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,210
of the outer.

18
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,650
So the derivative of this one here and the derivative of this one here and then minus the B-S.

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,400
So we put a minus in the middle

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,980
and then divide by B as.

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,380
Which is bottom squared.

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,100
Three x cubed plus four x.

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,720
All right.

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,930
So let's keep it going.

25
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,930
Do you why we're Dayaks equals.

26
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,500
Well a stick the derivative of this one.

27
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,720
So it's constant multiple.

28
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,100
So that's two times bring our dictator down.

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:26,970
That's two x to the ones that we don't market that times 3 x cubed plus four X

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,960
minus.

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,010
Then we have

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,600
this 2 x squared and then the derivative of this one that's going to be constant multiple three times

33
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,790
dictator down.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,380
So we bring it down is 3 x new exponent is going to be one less.

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:57,000
So that's two plus derivative of four X constant multiple four.

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,560
And as you know a derivative of X is just one right.

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,680
We bring down one then the exponent becomes one of minus 1 and that is x to the 0 times 1 which is just

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
one.

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,810
So this is four times one

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,440
and by the way I forgot to square the bottom here.

41
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,730
So this is bottom squared.

42
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,410
Here we go.

43
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:38,550
So bottom will be 3x cubed plus for X to the second power.

44
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:46,220
And finally we'll go ahead and let's simplify the derivatives that we got and that's it 2 times

45
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,690
2 x 4 x

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:04:04,180
4 x times this over here so that's 3 x cubed plus 4 X minus 2 x squared

47
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,700
and then three times three is nine x squared

48
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,720
plus four.

49
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:28,890
And then on the bottom again we have just this 3 x cubed plus 4 x to the second power.

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,330
All right.

51
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,390
So let's go ahead and finish this problem over here.

52
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,760
This is the last step that we had in the other slide.

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,020
So we'll just continue it.

54
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,900
So remember we already got our derivatives.

55
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,100
What we need to do is just multiply through and then simplify.

56
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,890
So for example this 4 x multiplies here and multiplies here as well.

57
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,460
And then this 2 x squared multiplies.

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,630
Each of these terms.

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,100
All right.

60
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,790
So let's go with the 4 x times this.

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:15,440
So for X times 3 x cubed we multiply the coefficients 4 times 3 is 12 and then x to the one times x

62
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:28,190
to that three is X to the fourth and then for X times 4 x is four times four is sixteen and x times

63
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:37,410
x is x to 1 times x to the 1 is X to the two because we add those exponents right.

64
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,810
Then we have minus

65
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,410
and then we multiply through the two x squared by these two.

66
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,710
So 2 x squared times 9 x squared two times nine is eighteen

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,060
and I'm putting of rather this is here because remember this negative is going to change the sign of

68
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,160
everything here right.

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,040
Not just of the two times nine but also of the two times for Inka.

70
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,880
So minus in general.

71
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,370
And then we do the multiplication inside of here.

72
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:23,490
So again two times nine is 18 and then x times x squared is X to the fourth.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,040
All right.

74
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,360
And then we have two X squared times four.

75
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,180
So it's just two times four is eight.

76
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,380
And at this point it's positive still because we have positive times a positive right.

77
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,900
So two times four is eight and we just keep this x squared

78
00:06:47,810 --> 00:07:00,910
everything over what we have which is three x cubed plus four x everything to the second power.

79
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,500
All right.

80
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,390
So let's go ahead and distribute this negative to each of these terms to this one and to this one.

81
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:23,080
The 12 I'm just writing this part 12 x 2 4 plus 16 x squared and then we do minus times a positive is

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,950
a negative.

83
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,860
Right.

84
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,210
So negative 18 x to the fourth

85
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,170
and we distributed again negative times a positive is a negative.

86
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:56,420
So minus 8 x squared everything over the same thing 3 x cubed plus 4 x to the second power.

87
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,000
All right.

88
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,380
And now all we have to do is simplify.

89
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,890
So we have 12 x to the fourth and we also have 18 x to the fourth.

90
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:15,840
All right so we're going to have xtal the fourth and we just work with the coefficients 12 minus 18

91
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,090
is negative 6.

92
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,280
Right.

93
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,550
So if you have 12 dollars then you spend 18.

94
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,570
Now you 0 6.

95
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,660
So that's it for X or the fourth.

96
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,180
And now we have the x squared.

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,350
So we have 16 x squared minus 8 x squared.

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:47,450
So that means we're going to have an x squared and we have 16 positive minus 8 is positive 8.

99
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:55,130
So that gives us negative 6 x to the fourth plus 8 x squared everything over

100
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:04,410
3 x cubed plus 4 x to the second power.

101
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,520
And this is our answer.

102
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,010
So maybe you are wondering do we always have to simplify this.

103
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,680
Well yes you do because most professors like to see it that way and in fact if you leave it like this

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,870
you might get incomplete points.

105
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,100
So it's definitely worth going the extra step and just simplifying like terms.

106
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:39,600
So the extra the fours like this one and this one and then the x squared is like this term and this

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,470
term right.

108
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,860
So this is our final answer negative 6 x to the fourth plus 8 x to the second power.

109
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:54,000
Everything over three x cubed plus four x to the second power.

110
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,460
That is it.

111
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,220
This was a long problem and that was on purpose.

112
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,630
I want you to get used to doing long problems for the quotient rule.

113
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,040
You'll see those a lot and once you get a problem in an exam I don't want you to choke.

114
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,040
I want you to know what to do.

115
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,250
I want you to know that these problems tend to be long and that you need to make sure they have your

116
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,290
signs and your exponents right.

117
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,320
So as you already know Practice makes perfect.

118
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,230
Go ahead and do your homework.

119
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,950
All right.

120
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,540
Practice practice practice.

121
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,260
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
