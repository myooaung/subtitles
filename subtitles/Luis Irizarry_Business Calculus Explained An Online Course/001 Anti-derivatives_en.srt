00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,990
Hey they're welcome to another session of limit last calculus.

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,570
Congratulations you've made it up to here.

3
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,370
You finished the first part of the course.

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,930
So we went over what derivatives are how they work the differentiation rules and even some applications.

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,860
Great.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,600
Now we're going to go into the second part of calculus which is integrals.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,470
So in essence you have this

8
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,330
you have calculus divided into two.

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,640
So we have differential calculus

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,370
which is the part that we just did.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:12,250
So that's a part with derivatives.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,730
And you also have integral calculus which is the part where we're going to do now.

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,890
All right.

14
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,470
So differential calculus actually makes up most of the Course integral calculus.

15
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,990
Well it's part of the course but is not as broad of a topic.

16
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,410
If you were to take calculus 2 then that's where you would see a lot of integration in calculus and

17
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,530
Calculus 1.

18
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,800
You just get a glimpse of integrals.

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,090
You'll learn what they are.

20
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,600
You'll learn how they work etc..

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,670
But you do not learn any advanced techniques for integrating that you actually do in calculus too.

22
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,440
Now if you're a student you probably won't have to take calculus too.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,900
That's at least based on my experience.

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,720
Maybe your class is a little bit different maybe they do go deeper into integrals.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,250
This course however will cover the main topics and integration.

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:12,690
All right.

27
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,250
So let's go ahead and get started with antiderivatives.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,790
All right.

29
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,260
So like I said let's get started with the definition of an antiderivative.

30
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:33,670
We have that a function whose derivative is f of x is called the antiderivative of f of x and it's given

31
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,910
by f of x with an upper case f.

32
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,090
Let's read that again.

33
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:46,990
A function whose derivative is f of x is called the antiderivative of f of x and is given by uppercase

34
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,270
f of x.

35
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,890
So what does this mean exactly.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,200
Let's go into an example here so I can show you what this means.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,550
All right.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,670
So let's say that we have the function f of x equals 3 x squared right.

39
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,280
And let's say we want to find the derivative of this function.

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,900
So prime of x.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,980
So remember we have a three to a constant multiple.

42
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,320
We leave it outside.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
We bring down the two multiplying.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,490
That gives us 6 and we subtract 1 from the exponent.

45
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,290
So that gives us x to the one which is just X right.

46
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,060
So we have our main function f of x which is 3 x squared and its derivative is 6 secs.

47
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,790
All right.

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,920
So we went from f of x to the derivative f prime of x.

49
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,550
Now imagine for a second that this f of x disappeared.

50
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,230
Boom it's not there anymore.

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,150
All right.

52
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,420
It's gone now.

53
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:08,740
Imagine that all we knew is that there is a function out there whose derivative is six secs.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,550
We do not know what the function is.

55
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,250
We do not know what it looks like but we know that there is a function out there who is derivative is

56
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:27,030
6 x so whatever that function is which we already know it's 3 x squared is called the antiderivative

57
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,310
of this function y antiderivative.

58
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,790
Because think about it instead of going down and getting more derivatives it's like going back up into

59
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,200
the original.

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,710
Right.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,290
For example let's say you want to get the derivative of this one.

62
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,330
This would be the second derivative of the original Right which is just six

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,930
and let's bring back our APH of x

64
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:11,020
so if you have f of x and you find a derivative you get 6 X if you have 6 x and you find the derivative

65
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,260
you get six that's going down.

66
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:21,130
However if you're going up then what you're doing is you're saying OK for six there's a function out

67
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,040
there who's derivative is this six.

68
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,020
That function is the 6 x in the same way.

69
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:38,310
If you have 6 x you say OK there's a function out there whose derivative is 6 x that is 3 x squared.

70
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:46,380
So you see how this works an antiderivative is a function whose derivative is f of X..

71
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
Let's do another example.

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,710
Let's say we have a function whose derivative is

73
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,910
20 x

74
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,360
All right.

75
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,960
So we do not know what the original function is.

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,800
We just know that there's a function out there whose derivative is 20 x so that mysterious function

77
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,540
whose derivative is 20 x is the antiderivative of 20 x because when you differentiate that function

78
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,560
you get 20 x.

79
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,950
It turns out that that function is

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,830
10 x squared.

81
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,560
All right so 10 x squared is the antiderivative of 20 x

82
00:06:49,580 --> 00:07:04,770
here in the same way 3 x squared is the antiderivative of 6 x.

83
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:13,990
I'll just abreviated of x x and guess what 6 x is the antiderivative of 6.

84
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,340
So it's like a chain.

85
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,790
This one is the antiderivative of the next.

86
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,140
And this one is the antiderivative of the next.

87
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,960
If you approach it from the other side this is a derivative of this one and this one is a derivative

88
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,030
of this one.

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,760
All right.

90
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,440
So 6 x is the anti derivative

91
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,100
of six.

92
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,640
So you see how this works.

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,820
So I mean think about the name of this antiderivative.

94
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,700
Instead of finding the derivative instead of going down and getting more and more derivatives you actually

95
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,800
go up.

96
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,740
So if you have 6 x instead of getting the derivative and going down what you do is you go up and you

97
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:07,750
find the original function whose derivative is 6 x that is a common problem an integral calculus.

98
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,820
You're going to be given a derivative and you need to find a function that produced that derivative.

99
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,330
Right.

100
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,220
So we need to find a function whose derivative is that function that you were given.

101
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,800
OK so we already know that if you're given a function and you ask to find it's antiderivative we need

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,480
to find the function that produced that derivative.

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,760
Now a good question is does every function have just one antiderivative.

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
We'll see that next.
