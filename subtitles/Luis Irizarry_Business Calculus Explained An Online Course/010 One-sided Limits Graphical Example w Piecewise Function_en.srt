1
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,190
Hey what's going on.

2
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,030
Welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,940
So continuing on with the topic of limits we're going to cover one side it limits one sided limits remember

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,920
our limits that approach from the left or from the right.

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,820
So we touched on this topic a little bit before but now we're going to go deeper into it.

6
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:53,000
So let's say you have a function that looks like this.

7
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,610
So maybe it looks something like this.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,150
And it goes up to here.

9
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:19,890
And then we have something like this.

10
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:36,960
And finally we have something like this.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,050
All right.

12
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,920
So you might be thinking to yourself what the heck is this.

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,080
Why do we have three callers and why are things just jumping around from place to place.

14
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:59,680
Well we actually talked about this a little bit and this is called a piecewise function.

15
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,420
And in a piecewise function you have different functions for different inputs.

16
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,920
So different functions different offense for

17
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,540
different.

18
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:31,380
So for example this function could be represented by a VAX and then the way we do piecewise functions

19
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,750
we actually open this up like this.

20
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,560
And we say

21
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,290
so for example we can say that this is F X.

22
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,310
This one is g of X and this one is h of x.

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,420
All right so we have these three different functions.

24
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,770
Let's mark some x values here.

25
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,700
So for example let's call this three and let's call is negative four.

26
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,470
All right.

27
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:15,820
So we use effervesce when x is greater than three.

28
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,380
That's why you have this jump when you get to X equals three.

29
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,950
Then you start using F X which is the Green function over here.

30
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,840
So what happens when X is less than three.

31
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:39,570
Well it depends because from 3 up to negative four we use this other function of x so we use g of X

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:55,180
when X is less than or equal to three and is greater then negative for.

33
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,560
All right so do you see what we're doing for differing inputs of facts in this case forgive X when X

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,320
is between negative 4 and 3 including the three but not the negative 4.

35
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,530
Then we use this blue function of x.

36
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,140
So how do we know when we need to put you know greater than or greater than or equal or less than or

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,490
less than or equal.

38
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:25,590
So this point here because it's failed then it tells you that this function is blue function actually

39
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,080
includes the three.

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,700
All right.

41
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:38,950
However by the same token this blue function does not include negative 4 because it is not shaded in

42
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,400
so if it's shaded in means it includes

43
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,870
If it's not shaded in and it's just an open circle.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,830
It does not include

45
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,240
all right.

46
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:11,440
This is why as well for this green one f of x we only use f of x when x is greater than 3 because it

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,720
does not include the three.

48
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,340
However this blue function includes the three but not the negative four.

49
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,220
And then we have our last function of x which actually includes the negative for it because you have

50
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,440
this shaded circle and everything less than negative 4.

51
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,460
So finally we have each of X

52
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:43,110
when X is less than or equal because again we are including this negative for negative for.

53
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,840
OK so we have three different functions.

54
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,620
Each one works with a different input.

55
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,550
OK in this age of X only works when values are less than or equal to negative for this g of X only works

56
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,910
from values between negative for not including up to three including the three.

57
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,990
And finally this green function includes inputs that are greater than three but not including the three.

58
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,890
All right.

59
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,310
So why are we going over this.

60
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,730
We're going over this because we're going to find one side limits.

61
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,390
So for example limit of of x.

62
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,930
I remember f of x is the piecewise

63
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,460
on you know what.

64
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,530
I made a mistake because we have three functions f of x g of x and x.

65
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,000
So the main one should not be called F X as well it should be called something completely different.

66
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,040
So we can call it for example of x.

67
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,360
All right so I went ahead and deleted that and we'll call it.

68
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,000
I have X so we don't confuse it with this f of x.

69
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,790
All right.

70
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,980
So let's try to find the limit.

71
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:09,870
Of I have X as x approaches let's say three from the left.

72
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,170
And remember a limit is a Y value that a function is approaching.

73
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:24,220
So threes over here as we come from the left the y value is going to be up here.

74
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,340
Right.

75
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:35,420
So let's say that this y value is three and this y value is negative 6.

76
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:44,290
All right so as we approach this three from the left as we get closer and closer and closer the y value

77
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,890
approaching is at three.

78
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,260
All right what if we approach it from the right

79
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,760
limit of I have X

80
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:09,070
as x approaches 3 from the right.

81
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:17,660
So as we approach this 3 x value from the right it looks like a Y value is going to be what.

82
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Well looks like it's going to be negative 6 when you get there right.

83
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,590
So that's negative 6.

84
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,130
Let me remind you it doesn't matter what the value actually is.

85
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:37,230
So if you plug in half of three what does a y value associated with this input.

86
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,809
Well according to this graph it's going to be three right.

87
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,539
So when you plug in three you get three.

88
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,340
Notice that the limit from the right is not 3 is negative 6.

89
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:55,320
So let me repeat this once again limits don't care what the value is when you actually get there only

90
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,820
what it is approaching.

91
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,910
All right.

92
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,310
So let's try to find another limit here.

93
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,150
Let's try to find the limit as x approaches negative for

94
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:20,130
limits of IVAX as x approaches negative 4 from the left.

95
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,540
And again remember we mentioned this before but just again if you want to approach from the left you

96
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,410
put a minus so minus means from left

97
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,490
and a plus is from right

98
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,920
I'm not talking about this minus because this is the minors for negative 4.

99
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm talking about the minors or the plus.

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,710
That's to the right of the number.

101
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:58,560
So this little sign here on the top right of the number that means from the left or from the right.

102
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,130
Again if it's negative it's from the left and if it's positive you're approaching from the right.

103
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,260
So what is IVAX approaching as x approaches negative four from the left.

104
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,090
So let's say that this is for

105
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:23,730
as we approach this negative four from the left we get closer we get closer it looks like the y values

106
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
are going to be four.

107
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,080
Right.

108
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,510
So limit is for on the other hand let's approach it from the right.

109
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:45,760
So the limit of X as x approaches 4 from the right I'm sorry not for negative for.

110
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,650
OK so this is negative 4 from the right.

111
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,640
So again negative 4 is already here.

112
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,490
We go to our function and we are approaching it from the right from the right from the right.

113
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:07,690
It looks like it's going to be whatever y value is here which again let's call it negative 7 for example.

114
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,150
So as x approaches negative 4 and this piecewise function the y value is approaching negative 7.

115
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,180
And again if we try to plug in of negative 4 this is not a limit.

116
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,040
This is just the actual value.

117
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,210
So when you plug in negative for is it defined for this function.

118
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,910
Where is it defined for this function.

119
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,390
All right so it is defined for this pink function because this is where the shaded circle is.

120
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,200
And this one does not include the negative for it.

121
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,690
This one does.

122
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:55,170
Olga So when you plug in negative 4 into this function you actually get four.

123
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,120
All right.

124
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,600
So something to note here is

125
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,290
taking that out that the limit from the left is not equal to the limit from the right.

126
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:18,090
So for three the limit from the left is three but the limit from the right is negative 6 and for negative

127
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:24,990
for the limit from the left is 4 and the limit from the right is negative 7.

128
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,930
So when the limit from the left and the limit from the right are not the same then the limit does not

129
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,900
exist.

130
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
So we can say that

131
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,390
I'm just going to do this one first and then this one.

132
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:49,540
So the limit of I have X as x approaches 3 and here it's not from the left or the right.

133
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,350
It's just delivered in general we can say that it does not exist.

134
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,570
How do we know this because the limit from the left is different than the limit from the right in the

135
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:12,720
same way if we have limits of IVAX as x approaches negative 4.

136
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,920
And again not from the left or the right.

137
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,350
Just in general then the limit also does not exist.

138
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,670
Because the limit from the left for is different than the limit from the right which is negative 7.

139
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,990
That's pretty much it for one sided limits.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,990
So for most functions the limit from the left is going to be equal to the limit from the right but for

141
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,930
piecewise functions and some other special functions.

142
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,970
This is not always going to be true.

143
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:48,550
And again if the limit from the left is different than the limit from the right as x approaches a specific

144
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:56,490
number then the limit as x approaches that number in general does not exist.

145
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,270
And that is how you determine limits graphically.

146
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,590
So if you're given a graph you can just pretty much run through the graph and start figuring out limits.

147
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:12,660
So if again for example if I'm approaching this guy from the left as you go from the left the y value

148
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,360
looks like it's going to be 4.

149
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,540
But as you come from the right the y value looks like it's going to be negative 7.

150
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,190
If you hear as it approaches from the left don't just go oh let's go left.

151
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,950
It's actually the opposite.

152
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:34,370
If you're approaching from the left then you're going right because you're coming from the left.

153
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,310
So if you're approaching this guy from the left you're actually coming right and you're getting closer

154
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,100
and closer right.

155
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,070
This is the left right here and that's where you're coming from in the same way if you're approaching

156
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:56,000
from the right then you're coming from the right which is here and you're getting closer and closer

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,720
and closer.

158
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,170
All right.

159
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,780
So that's how limits from the left and the right work.
