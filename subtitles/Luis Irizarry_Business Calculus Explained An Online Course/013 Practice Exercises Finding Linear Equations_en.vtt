00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.650
All right so now we have our last type of problem which is find the equation of a line.

2
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.310
All right we're looking for an equation of a line whose b equals three and that passes through the points

3
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.550
three four and one two.

4
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.180
So remember we're looking here for an equation.

5
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.150
How do we get an equation for a line for a linear function.

6
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.070
We went over that and the tutorials.

7
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.540
In fact there's a mnemonic for it.

8
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.940
So try to pick your brain and see if you remember what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.700
And if you do you're going to know exactly where B goes.

10
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.700
So even if you don't remember just go ahead and pause the video and try to give it a shot.

11
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.850
All right so did you actually remember how to find the equation of a line.

12
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.810
Well remember we have a mnemonic for the equation of linear functions.

13
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.360
Remember why Mexico bro.

14
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.100
There you go.

15
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.120
That's what it is.

16
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:35.470
So why Mexico bro reminds you that the equation of a line is why Mexico stands for X and then the Breau

17
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.810
is the plus b c that.

18
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.960
There you go.

19
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.130
So we have the B.

20
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.310
Right.

21
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.170
It's equal to 3.

22
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.530
We just need to find m which is the slope.

23
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.270
So let's go ahead and find the slope of the line that's passing through these two points.

24
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.790
So again slope is wide to minors why one over to mine is x.

25
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.700
Let's say this is point 1.

26
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.110
And this is point to so y2 is the why of this point.

27
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.350
So that's two.

28
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.960
Mine is why one the why of the other points.

29
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:33.020
So that's four over x to the X of this point which is one minus x 1 which is the x value of this points

30
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.450
which is three.

31
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.280
So we have two minus four is negative two and one minus 3 is also negative 2 negative over a negative

32
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.180
as is positive and 2 over 2 is 1.

33
00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:04.290
All right so the equation of this line is slope is 1 x plus 3.

34
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.880
However since we have a 1 we can just take it out and leave X because 1 times X is always x.

35
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.400
So the equation finally is X plus 3.

36
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.960
And there we go.

37
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.430
All right.

38
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.240
So let's try that one more time.

39
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.060
Find the equation of a line whose b equals negative for this time and that passes through the points

40
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.420
negative 1 negative 1 and 5 7.

41
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.680
So go ahead and pause your video and try it out.

42
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.280
So again we go to Arno Monnick.

43
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:57.330
Why Mexico bro y equals x plus B and again we have the B which is negative for and we just need the

44
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.140
M.

45
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.270
All right.

46
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.070
So let's go ahead and find the M which is the slope again.

47
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.640
That's why two minors while one it's always good to write down equations even if you know them so that

48
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.950
you can just look at them and plug in stuff more quickly and more easily right.

49
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.140
So let's say that this is point one and this is point 2.

50
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.860
So why two is the y value of point 2.

51
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.240
So that's 7 minus why one white one is negative 1.

52
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:43.330
So 7 minus negative 1 over and then we have x 2 which is the x value of the second point.

53
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.100
That's five minus x 1 which is the x value of the first points.

54
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.740
So minus negative 1

55
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.970
and remember when we have a negative and a negative it becomes a positive.

56
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:09.740
So on top we have seven and plus one and on the bottom we have five negative times a negative is a positive

57
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:21.750
plus one of five plus one finally or slope is going to be 7 plus 1 which is 8 and 5 plus 1 which is

58
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.950
6.

59
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:33.720
We can actually simplify this 8 over 6 so 8 over 6 if we divide both top and bottom by 2.

60
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.140
So we divide 8 by 2 that's 4.

61
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.920
And if we divide six over two that's three.

62
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.120
But in theory this is correct.

63
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.680
If you leave it as 8 over 6 that's fine.

64
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.470
But it's always good to simplify whenever you can.

65
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:56.080
So slope is going to be for over three most professors like to see simplified answers.

66
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.180
So most of the time I simplify in this tutorial.

67
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.470
So you get in the habit of doing so.

68
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.840
All right so we have a slope we have or B.

69
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.470
What is the equation it is y equals and the slope is for over three.

70
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.720
So for over 3 x and then plus B.

71
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.800
In this case the B's negative.

72
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.730
So it's minus four and that is the equation of our aligner.

73
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.810
We are done.

74
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.560
All right so we covered finding slopes we covered drawing graphs of linear functions and we covered

75
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.420
finding equations of lines when given B and when given two points that the line crosses.

76
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.970
I'll see you in the next tutorial.
