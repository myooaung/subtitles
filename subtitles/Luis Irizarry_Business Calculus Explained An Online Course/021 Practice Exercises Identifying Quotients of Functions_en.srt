1
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,440
All right so for the quotient rule we're going to do the same thing that we did for the product rule.

2
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,560
But instead of finding the functions that are multiplying.

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,470
We're going to find the functions that are dividing we're going to identify what those functions are.

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,900
Now this should be pretty easy because the top function is always on top and the bottom function is

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,130
always on the bottom.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,280
But just to get you into the habit of saying OK we're dividing here's a first function and here's a

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,400
second we'll do a couple of examples and let's start with f of x equals 2 x cubed plus X everything

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,480
over X minus 2.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,230
So go ahead and pause the video and let me know what the dividing functions are.

10
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,760
In other words what's dividing what.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,220
All right.

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,980
So there should have been pretty easy.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,980
So function on top again.

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:28,890
It's whatever's above this line so that's to execute plus X and then the function on the bottom is just

15
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,450
X minus 2.

16
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,080
All right.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,540
So these are the two dividing functions.

18
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,980
That's pretty much it.

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,240
Let's go to the next one.

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,600
All right so here it is we want to find the dividing functions for this f of x and x equals on the top

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,160
X plus 1 times X minus 1.

22
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,240
And on the bottom just 3 Remember that a function could be just a number.

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,710
In this case it's only 3.

24
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,830
So go ahead and pause and give it a shot.

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,600
All right so let's identify the two functions that are dividing.

26
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:17,080
Then on the top it's again x plus 1 times X minus 1 because that's what's above the line.

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:29,240
So the first function X plus 1 X minus 1 and then the bottom function is going to be whatever's down

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,950
here which is just 3

29
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,760
again whatever's on top is the top function and whatever's on bottom is the bottom function.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,560
Now let's stop identify let's start doing some quotient rule problems.
