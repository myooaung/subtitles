00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.330
Hey they're welcome to another hey they're welcome to another session of limitless calculus.

2
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.780
Let me tell you something.

3
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.320
This is it.

4
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.740
This is the moment.

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.310
This is when the men separate from the boys and the women separate from the girls.

6
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:47.340
The chain rule is here the chain rule is probably the most hated the most mis understood and the most

7
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.120
misused derivative rule there is.

8
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.320
Most students that I teach absolutely hate the chain rule and I think part of the reason why it's because

9
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
number one it can be difficult to know when to use it.

10
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.830
And number two it's a little bit tricky because maybe you don't really know what's going on.

11
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.210
There are some new things that we do that we haven't done before and so it is just weird overall.

12
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.850
So in general people don't like it but I'm here to tell you that the chain rule doesn't have to be hard.

13
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.610
It doesn't have to be that difficult.

14
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850
It doesn't have to be impossible.

15
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.300
In fact all go over the chain rule.

16
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.630
What we use it for.

17
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.390
And of course your favorite mnemonic for the chain rule so that you'll never ever again forget how the

18
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.020
change rule works.

19
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.570
Let's do it.

20
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.010
So let's say that I have this function

21
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.480
so I have this function f of x equals x to the third power.

22
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.650
If we want to get the derivative of that we already know what to do.

23
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.730
It's a power function so we can use the power rule and the power rule says that you bring down your

24
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.650
dictator.

25
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.890
So you bring down the 3 x and substitute back less powerful leader.

26
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.720
So that gives us a two right.

27
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.090
Very easy power function.

28
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.040
That's all we need to do.

29
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.540
Now let me ask your question.

30
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.270
What if I gave you this function instead.

31
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.060
So f of x equals

32
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.250
x plus 5 to the third power.

33
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.930
What would be the derivative then.

34
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.680
So what is the difference between this one and this one and the first one.

35
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.560
You only have X to the third power so it is a power function in this one.

36
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.400
You do not have a power function.

37
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:12.140
What you have is one function X plus 5 with then another function which elevates it to the third power.

38
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.090
You see that by definition this is not a power function so we can't just say let's bring down or dictate

39
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:27.410
or three and then keep X plus 5 and then the less powerful leader too.

40
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.940
This is not correct because this is not a power function anymore so this is not right.

41
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.020
Let me give you another example.

42
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.630
What if we have F X

43
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.030
equals square root of x

44
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.980
so we can actually get the derivative of this one because square root of x is the same as saying X to

45
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.660
the one half

46
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.490
and then we can get the derivative by saying.

47
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.810
So bring down a dictator.

48
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.450
That's what one have X and then substitute by a less powerful leader.

49
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.110
So remember that's going to be one to have minus two over two.

50
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.880
Right because we have 1 have minus 1.

51
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.950
We turn that into 1 over 1 and then we multiply top and bottom by 2 so that these two are going to have

52
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.700
the same denominator.

53
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.520
We went over this back in the power.

54
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.510
So one minus two is negative 1 over 2.

55
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.420
So this is negative 1 1/2

56
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.940
and then like we know how to do we bring down this x to the negative one half to the bottom.

57
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.180
We do that by flipping the sign of the exponents.

58
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.100
So we have one on top over the two.

59
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.980
That was already there and we bring down this so we have access to the one half because we flip the

60
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:16.600
sign again on the exponents and we can finally simplify and say one over to this extra one half becomes

61
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.510
a square root of x we done right.

62
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.310
This is our derivative.

63
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:33.950
But what if you have instead of half of X equals square root of x why if you had square root of x squared

64
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.960
plus five x

65
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.220
right what is your derivative.

66
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.620
So what is the difference again between this one and this one.

67
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.300
And the first one you have.

68
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.170
Square root of x in this one you have a square root of a more complicated function.

69
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.730
So to get the derivative for this one we can't simply copy what we got here and say for example one

70
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.940
over two square root of you know take this x squared plus 5 x and call it a day.

71
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.490
This is not right.

72
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.410
So I hope you're seeing a pattern here when you have X to the something or square root of x or something

73
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.890
like that just with X as a base then we know how to get the derivative.

74
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.230
However when you have one function with then another function.

75
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:40.310
So for example in this case the function inside is the expo's 5 and the function outside is elevating

76
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.890
the expo's five to the third power.

77
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:51.440
In this case we have something similar inside function is x squared plus 5 x and then the outside function

78
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.070
is getting the square root of this inside function.

79
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.720
So it kind of looks like we need a different technique to find derivatives.

80
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.680
When you have one function inside another enter the chain rule.

81
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:15.400
So let's go into the chain rule the chain rule is a differentiation rule used to find the derivative

82
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.820
of compositions of functions.

83
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.680
So just like the product rule is used for multiplication of functions and the quotient rule is used

84
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.250
for division and the sum rule is used for additions.

85
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.510
The chain rule is used for composition.

86
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.350
That is the key word here.

87
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.750
So if you do not know what this is the composition of functions let me give you an example.

88
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.840
Let's say you have f of x equals x squared.

89
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.280
All right.

90
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.700
So you know you can plug in numbers into this.

91
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.020
You can plug in three.

92
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.940
It's going to give you three squared is nine.

93
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.410
You can plug in 10 that's going to give you 10 squared is 100.

94
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.260
You can plug in four that's going to give you four square.

95
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.690
That's 16 right.

96
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:10.830
So we can plug in numbers or we can plug in another function into this function.

97
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.080
Yes we can actually do that.

98
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.030
So let's say we have this other function of x

99
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.520
and this function is 3 x minus 2.

100
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.070
All right.

101
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:32.179
So we have two functions of x x squared and g of x 3 x minus 2.

102
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:44.980
So we can do a composition like this.

103
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.190
So this is a composition of G.

104
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:57.200
That means that we're plugging in G into F so let's go ahead and do that here.

105
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.700
Let's take this g of x 3 x minus 2 and plug it in into f of x.

106
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.650
So the rule for F X is square the input.

107
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.450
All right.

108
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:16.260
So this is equal to saying f of g of X

109
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.170
right.

110
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.900
This might be a little bit weird looking.

111
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.550
But here's what's going on.

112
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.660
We're taking G of x.

113
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.780
That is the input

114
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.850
and we're plugging it in into the rule f.

115
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.310
So let's do it.

116
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.830
The rule says take the input and square it and what's the input.

117
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.100
The input is this other function of x.

118
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.670
So this is the input 3 X minus 2.

119
00:09:49.890 --> 00:10:00.370
And we're going to square it so 3 X minus 2 everything squared is the composition.

120
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.160
Composition G.

121
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.780
So we plugged in G into F.

122
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.600
All right.

123
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.460
Let's do another example.

124
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.480
Let's say we have 4 x

125
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.810
equals the cube roots

126
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.820
of X and g of X equals

127
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.350
x squared.

128
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:38.040
Minus nine and we want to find composition G.

129
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.150
So this circle means composition.

130
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.890
By the way this composition thing it's not something that you need need need to know for sure for the

131
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.670
chain rule but it's good to know exactly what's going on.

132
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.360
All right.

133
00:10:52.360 --> 00:11:01.920
So remember we're going to plug in G into F. So says take the cube root

134
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.460
of the input and again we said that the input is G.

135
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:15.740
So cube root of x squared minus nine.

136
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:22.740
So you see what we did we have this function f of x and we plugged in this x squared minus nine and

137
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.450
substituted the X..

138
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.490
By this other function.

139
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.420
So you might be saying to yourself OK close that's all good and well but how is this useful.

140
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.910
Well it turns out that when you're finding the derivative of compositions of functions you need to use

141
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.190
the chain rule.

142
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.680
You cannot use the regular derivative methods.

143
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.620
So let's go into some examples of when to use the chain rule and when not to use it.

144
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.780
So you get a better idea of what's going on.
