1
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,760
Now this only works when you're given a graph.

2
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,420
So what if you're not given a graph and you're not asked to build a graph you're just told approximate

3
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,570
the limit algebraically.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
How do we do this.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,070
Well it's actually very easy.

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:39,940
So for example let's do a simple function here and we actually did this before but just to refresh your

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:57,100
mind we'll do let's say we want to find the limit of X plus 3 as x approaches 1 from the left.

8
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,880
So what we can do is we can actually build a small table

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,280
of values that are approaching this one from the left.

10
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,210
And if you look at the number line

11
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,020
and one is here then as you approach from the left

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,980
you have values that are close.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:34,190
For example you have 0.9 zero point nine nine x cetera.

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:48,150
In the same way if you approach from the right you have 1.0 on one point one etc..

15
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,520
OK.

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,250
So let's actually use these values to plug them in here.

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:09,810
So we have from the left 0.9 zero point nine nine and zero point nine nine nine.

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,260
So these numbers are getting bigger but they're still less than 1.

19
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,200
So they're approaching one from the left.

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,930
We plug them in here of course we're going to get for zero point nine.

21
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,600
We're going to get 3.9

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,020
for zero point nine nine.

23
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:34,270
We're going to get three point nine nine and four zero point nine nine nine.

24
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,770
We're going to get three point nine nine nine.

25
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:48,230
So as these x values get bigger and closer to 1 the y value is getting closer to what well it's getting

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,300
closer to 4.

27
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,460
Obviously it goes from three point nine then three point ninety nine and then three point nine nine

28
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,940
nine.

29
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,720
So it's obviously four.

30
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:04,600
So the limit from the left is going to be for on the other hand.

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,540
What's the limit of X plus 3.

32
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:21,310
As x approaches one from the right and again will builds another table here of x and y.

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,800
So now we're approaching one from the right.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,930
So from here.

35
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,430
So we have to pick values that are getting smaller and smaller and closer to one.

36
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:43,880
So let's pick one point one one point zero one and one point zero zero one.

37
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:53,430
So we just plug them into this function and see what we're approaching for 1.1 we get 1.1 plus three

38
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,250
is 4.1 4.1

39
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:08,000
for 1.0 one in the same way it's just four point zero one and for one point zero zero one is four point

40
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,580
zero zero one.

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,920
So as the x values get smaller and smaller and closer to 1 the y values are getting closer to what.

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,550
Well it's 4.1 then a four point zero one and then four point zero zero one.

43
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,680
So it's obviously getting closer to 4.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,730
In this case then the limit from the left equals four and the limit from the right equals four because

45
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,660
the limit from the left and from the right are equal.

46
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,010
This is equal to this.

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:59,380
That means that the limits of Expo's 3 as x approaches 1 in general not from the left or the right.

48
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,090
Just in general exist and it is equal to four.

49
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,890
Right.

50
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,340
This is our answer.

51
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,920
So again just to recap what we did was we found the limit from the left as x approaches 1 and from the

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,940
right as x approaches one as well for the function x 3.

53
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,720
So for the left we pick values that are getting closer to 1 which are these.

54
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,020
And from the right we're pick values that are also getting closer to 1 but they're getting smaller.

55
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,930
So if you approach from the left the values get bigger and if you approach from the right the values

56
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,300
get smaller.

57
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,740
In both cases left and right they both approach a four because the limit from the left and the one from

58
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,140
the right are equal then the limit in general exist and it equals four.

59
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,280
And let's go into our summary.

60
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,960
All right.

61
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,620
So for a summary of what we just covered limits can be evaluated from the left or from the right.

62
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:11,570
That's what's called a one sided limits and a minus means from the left and a plus means from the right.

63
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:21,590
So if you have a limit as x approaches 3 with a negative here that means it's from the left.

64
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:30,000
And if you have a limit of x x x approaches negative 2 with a plus or rehear that means it's from the

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,320
right

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,980
so the sign at the beginning is just a sign of the number itself the sign on the top.

67
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,570
Here is a sign of where are approaching from left or right.

68
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,540
Piecewise function has different functions for different inputs with jumps at certain values.

69
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,800
We did an example of that at the beginning where we have IVAX and it's composed of f of x g of x n h

70
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,280
of X..

71
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,240
Each one has different inputs.

72
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,000
Then a limit from the left is not always equal to a limit from the right.

73
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,160
We saw an example in the piecewise function.

74
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,710
Sometimes you approach a valley from the left and it gives you a certain a y value and then you approach

75
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,290
it from the right and it gives you another Y value.

76
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,450
So they're not equal to evaluate one side it limits graphically.

77
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,630
That means when you're given a graph follow along the graph from left and right.

78
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,380
So for example if we have something like this

79
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,810
let's say that we have a piecewise function that looks something like this.

80
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:48,190
All right so if we're approaching the limit here as you approach it from the left you start on the left

81
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,750
side because it's from the left and then you get closer and closer and closer.

82
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,460
So the limit is whatever y values are over here.

83
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:04,870
If you approach it from the right however then you start at the right because it's from the right and

84
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,650
you get closer and closer and closer and then the limit would be whatever y value is defined over here.

85
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,280
And remember that circle that's shaded in means that it is defined for this function.

86
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,210
And if the circle is not shaded in then that point is not defined for this function right.

87
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,390
It's approaching it but it's not defined as the X when you actually get there.

88
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,370
And moving on to evaluate one side it limits algebraically pick close values from left and right.

89
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:43,270
This is where we build our little table of for example 2.9 two point ninety nine and two point nine

90
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,510
nine nine.

91
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:51,070
And then from the other side would be three point one three point zero one and three point zero Israel

92
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,850
one.

93
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,890
Both of these examples are approaching three but one is doing it from the left and the other one from

94
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,150
the right.

95
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,570
And finally this is probably the most important point in this lesson is the limit from the left and

96
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:11,970
the right are different so they're not equal to each other than the limit in general does not exist.

97
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,270
All right.

98
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:19,690
So limit from the left has to be equal to the limit from the right for the limit in general to exist

99
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,430
if they're different.

100
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,330
The limit does not exist.

101
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,570
So that was it for limits for now.

102
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,280
Later in the future we'll look at limits with infinity.

103
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,240
But that's going to be for later on.

104
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,390
So after this we're going to go into continuity which is related to limits but it's a little bit more

105
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,010
than that.

106
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,590
All right.

107
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,820
So I'll see you in the next tutorial.
