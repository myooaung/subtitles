1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,680
See.

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,910
All right so here's a fun one for you.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,080
The second derivative is the derivative of the derivative interesting right.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,660
You remember that Christopher Nolan movie Inception with Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and those guys.

5
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,480
And in that movie you had a dream within a dream and that's when it started to get complicated.

6
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,050
Well here we have something very similar.

7
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,280
So it's a derivative of a derivative.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,540
Let me give you an example.

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,400
So let's say your function is f of x

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,010
I would say that it is x to the fourth.

11
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,590
All right.

12
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,470
So we're going to find the derivative of f of x.

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,600
It's going to be as prime of x.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,770
So again it's a power function.

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:19,000
So we bring down a dictator for X and we substitute bailout's power for a leader that's going to give

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,850
us a three on top.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,190
Now what if we wanted to get the derivative of this derivative.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:34,520
So this is the first year of it if so this is with two primes instead of one.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:44,240
The second derivative and the second derivative is just a derivative of the first derivative.

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,930
So we take the derivative of this constant multiple We have a four.

21
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,000
So we leave it outside times we bring down a dictator.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:59,390
That's at three X and subtract one from the exponent that gives us a two.

23
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,780
So that's going to be four times three is 12 x squared.

24
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:22,010
This right here is your second derivative.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,990
Now notice this second derivative is the second derivative in relation to the original function.

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:38,500
Right so f of x is the original the first derivative of f of x is f prime of X and the second derivative

27
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:49,260
of f of x of the original is double prime of x so again this second derivative is second in relation

28
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,960
to the original derivative.

29
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,790
It's kind of like if you have a grandparent

30
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,600
and that person has a child

31
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,290
which is a parent's

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,680
of another child

33
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,010
so check it out.

34
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,610
You have grandparents that person has a child but that child is a parent of another child.

35
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,580
All right.

36
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:39,070
So this child has this parents but this child also has this Grandparent the same relationship.

37
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,070
So again to find the second derivative all you need to do is find the first derivative and take the

38
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,570
derivative of the first derivative that's going to give you the second derivative.

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,490
And in case you're wondering yes you can get a third you can get a fourth you can get a fifth you can

40
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,450
get however many levels you want of derivatives.

41
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,890
Now the third derivatives not really use that much and anything after that.

42
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,850
Not at all.

43
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,000
But the second derivative does have some applications.

44
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:15,440
Now one thing I want to mention is remember that if you have a function f of x then the derivative at

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,480
prime of X measures the rate of change of f of x right.

46
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:29,180
So it follows that if you have a function f prime of x which is a derivative and you get the derivative

47
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,450
of the derivative.

48
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,160
So if you get the second derivative then this second derivative measures the rate of change of the first

49
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,120
derivative.

50
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,930
All right so it's like a chain.

51
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,220
This one measures the rate of change of this one.

52
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,600
But then this one the second measures the rate of change of the first.

53
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,670
So I'll put it right here.

54
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,100
Second derivative actually measures

55
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,410
rate of change

56
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,280
of the first derivative at prime of X

57
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,830
because that's what derivatives do.

58
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,490
They measure rates of change.

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
OK so now we know what the second derivative is.

60
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,580
Let's go ahead and find concavity for functions.
