00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.330
You know what's going on.

2
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.430
Welcome to the first actual tutorial for limit less calculus.

3
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.740
Thank you for being here.

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.890
And the fact that you're here means you care about your education and that you want to pass this class.

5
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.320
You want to make sure that business calculus will be something of a memory in the past and I'll help

6
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.010
you do that.

7
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.520
All right.

8
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.380
So we'll go over a lot of concepts.

9
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.460
We'll go over a lot of fun mnemonics.

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.360
We'll go over a lot of problems to make sure that you're ready and that you're good to go.

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.570
Today we're going to talk about something that's critical.

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180
The foundation really for calculus.

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.440
You need to know what a function is.

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.860
You need to know how they work.

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.800
You're going to see functions starting now until the end of the course you're going to see functions

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.230
in every single problem.

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.340
So I'll give you a way to quickly remember what a function is you know do some analogies and we'll take

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.170
it from there.

19
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.470
So like I said functions are a part of the foundation of calculus and it is very important to understand

20
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.900
what they are and how they work.

21
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.590
So to better understand what a function is and how they're used in business calculus Let's use an analogy.

22
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.620
Let me ask you a question.

23
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.750
When you think of a machine what do you think about what does a machine do.

24
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.240
So let's say we have a machine over here.

25
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.120
OK.

26
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.890
So I know you love the drawing of a beautiful machine.

27
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.930
I know it's actually and you don't have to tell me it's all right.

28
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.220
So think of a machine what does the machine do.

29
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.780
Well machine what it does is it receives an input

30
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.560
and it gives you back an output.

31
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.060
OK so you put an input into it.

32
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.810
It does something to that input and it gives you back an output.

33
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.570
OK.

34
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.060
So inside this machine there's some sort of process that goes on

35
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.920
that converts input into a specific output and let's do a quick analogy.

36
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.020
In fact I want you to think of a washing machine.

37
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.410
So how does a washing machine work.

38
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.030
What it does is it takes clothes and detergent and fabric softener.

39
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.220
If you're a fan you look at them as input.

40
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.410
It applies a washing process to it and it gives you back wet clean clothes.

41
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.290
So let's represent that process here specifically with the washing machine.

42
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.180
Again my drawing skills are not the best.

43
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.690
So please bear with me.

44
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.560
Let's assume that this is a washing machine.

45
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.370
So the input that it takes is close let's call it dirty clothes to be more specific.

46
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.870
It gives us back Queen clothes

47
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.570
Queen

48
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.120
clothes and of course there's a washing process that's in here.

49
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:14.590
Which basically means the clothes.

50
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.510
So this is a washing machine and put it over here.

51
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.200
All right.

52
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.410
So that is a good analogy for what we're all going to be working with for functions.

53
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.650
In other words again you would take an input which is in this case of a washing machine it's dirty clothes.

54
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.750
We apply a washing process to dirty clothes and we end up with clean clothes.

55
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.600
So what does this have to do with a function in calculus.

56
00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:03.480
Well what actually happens is that a function works basically like a washing machine.

57
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.000
So we function

58
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.420
innocence is a washing machine

59
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.500
I know it sounds very silly but I'll bet you you're not going to forget this right.

60
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.760
Every time you see a function you're going to think Oh that's right a washing machine dirty clothes

61
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.700
washing process clean clothes.

62
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:38.540
So it is similar to a washing machine in the sense that a function also takes an input overhear dirty

63
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.990
clothes it applies a process to it and then it gives you back an output.

64
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.100
So let me write this down for you.

65
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.950
OK so here we have it a function receives an input.

66
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.480
Apply a process and returns an output.

67
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.570
So we take something in it does something to that input and it gives you back a result.

68
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:12.330
So here's an example of a function in the words Graben number add 5 to it and return it.

69
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.070
Let me put that here.

70
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.810
As an example

71
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.200
and again we're doing this in words so we're saying grab number

72
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.020
add 5 to it

73
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:51.180
return output.

74
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.370
So what happens if we give a number to this function.

75
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.780
What happens if we give it three.

76
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:08.770
So if we give it three we apply the process the process says grabber number it's 3 5 2 it gives us 8

77
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:18.030
3 plus 5 is 8 and then return the output that would give us 8 but we pick another number.

78
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.910
What if we pick ten Well we put 10 through the same process.

79
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.010
We grab a number which is 10.

80
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.350
We had five to it.

81
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.120
And we return an output that gives us 15 still one more.

82
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.000
What if we have negative 3

83
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.700
so we grab a number negative 3.

84
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.350
We had five.

85
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.710
Two it was negative three plus five.

86
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.130
Well if you owe three dollars and then you pay five back you staying positive.

87
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:55.850
So that gives you positive to and return the output which is true.

88
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:02.890
So as you can see for every input that you have you have some sort of output associated to it and the

89
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.900
process in this case is to add five to whatever number you were given.

90
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.940
That is the essence of a function.

91
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:15.850
Again a function gets something it does something to that something and then it gives you something

92
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.950
back.

93
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.280
In other words it takes an input.

94
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.530
It applies a process to that input and it gives you an output of function does manipulate whatever you

95
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.530
feed into it and give you something back.

96
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.809
So that said let's go over something very important.

97
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:42.990
The input of a function is usually called X and the output is called Y.

98
00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.870
We'll cover that notation next.

99
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.290
So we all function in words such as take a number add 5 to it and then return it.

100
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.230
What is the mathematical notation for functions.

101
00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:03.610
In other words how do you know a function when you see one as mentioned in Gen X is the input of a function.

102
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:10.580
And why is the output so X is input

103
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.880
and why is the output

104
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:33.080
so x and y are pretty much placeholders they're used before we know the actual input and the actual

105
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.620
output and something else.

106
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:47.630
Is that a function is typically given in this form y equals F X.

107
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.240
This is what a function looks like.

108
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.660
And when you look at this it might seem a little bit weird but it actually makes sense.

109
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.360
Remember that X is the input.

110
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:14.930
So when you say F of eggs you're saying you're going to give X to this rule f and that's going to give

111
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.560
you back a Y value.

112
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.360
OK.

113
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.390
Again X is the input.

114
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.730
Why is the output you give X to this rule f that's going to do something to it.

115
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:34.090
And then that's going to return a y value that is y y equals f of x.

116
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.540
So going back to her washing machine analogy this would mean the following

117
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.430
clean clothes

118
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:47.960
equals

119
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.950
washing process.

120
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.530
Apply to what.

121
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.310
To the input which is dirty clothes.

122
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.600
See this is why this is your output the clean clothes.

123
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:27.780
This is X your dirty clothes where your input and this is the rule f that you apply to the input.

124
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.390
So you take your dirty clothes you apply the washing process and they give you back clean clothes OK.

125
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.910
So one more thing I wanted to mention this is the typical notation you will see for a function y equals

126
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.570
f of x but it's not the only one.

127
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.350
So sometimes for different quantities we use different letters.

128
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:54.380
So for example in physics we have something like the equals f of T.

129
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.900
Because we're plugging in time and that's going to give us our velocity.

130
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.570
And again it could be you know random letters like equals

131
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.730
and it really doesn't matter.

132
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:17.120
The point is when you see something like this in this form why equals f of x.

133
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.110
So a letter equals f of something else another letter.

134
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:28.360
You know you're plug in in this input and you're applying this rule to get this output.

135
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.670
So if you see something different with a different letter that's not why you cause of X to not worry

136
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.140
it's going to be still a function if it is in this form.

137
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.080
OK.

138
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.910
All right so now we're going to talk a little bit about how we actually work with functions.

139
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:43.620
OK.

140
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.800
So when you're given a function in a problem sometimes you might not see the why.

141
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:57.260
So for example you might be given something like this for VAX equals

142
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.420
x plus three.

143
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:11.650
So many times again you're not going to see the y equals f of x you're just going to see f of x equals

144
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.430
to something else.

145
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:19.910
So what is this telling you this is telling you the actual rule that you're going to apply to your input.

146
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.270
So in this case f of x.

147
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:28.330
So the rule that's being applied to x is equal to x plus 3.

148
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:34.140
This means that you're going to grab X and you're going to add three to it.

149
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.700
All right so let's see this play.

150
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.640
Let's try to build a small table.

151
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.060
You know something like this.

152
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.500
Here we have are X and here we have our Y.

153
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.170
Remember X is input.

154
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.850
Why is the output.

155
00:13:50.310 --> 00:14:00.690
So by the way the way you plug in stuff into a function is you actually substitute the eggs by the number

156
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.680
that you're plugging in.

157
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.690
Remember that X is a placeholder for input.

158
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.890
So let's say we want to plug in 1.

159
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.850
Notice the difference.

160
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.630
We used to have an X which is the generic function and now we have a half of 1.

161
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.060
So we were actually applying one to this rule.

162
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.480
So we substitute the X by the 1.

163
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:36.330
So it becomes one plus three equals for so the input was one the output was for.

164
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.230
Let's try another number of zero.

165
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.820
What if we plug in zero into this function.

166
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:52.030
Well if we plug in zero we have zero plus three equals three

167
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.490
is zero for input and 3 for output.

168
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.810
Remember these are read like this.

169
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.510
So this is one result.

170
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.350
This is another results.

171
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.720
This is the point.

172
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.200
Well actually yeah they're actually called points.

173
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:25.250
So this point one for remember this is your X and this is your why this other point is 0 3 etc.

174
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.670
Let's try working with another function.

175
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.540
So what do we have for X equals x squared.

176
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.590
Interesting.

177
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:43.360
So what we need to do is we need to plug in numbers and square them let's build another table here.

178
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.070
To keep track of what we plug in

179
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.940
so what do we plug in.

180
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.580
Three into half of X over here.

181
00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.740
Well we're going to have three squared which is equal to nine.

182
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.630
So for the input three our output is nine.

183
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.410
So let's try another.

184
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.760
So let's try another value of five.

185
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:25.270
So that's five squared that's just five times five which is 25.

186
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:34.270
So for the input 5 our output is going to be 25 and you can just keep plugging values in and then and

187
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.860
then and then and you're going to get a whole table full of values.

188
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:45.940
So something you've noticed here is that so every time you put a number into a function so you plug

189
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:52.930
in for example 3 into this function x squared you're going to get one result back and only one.

190
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.300
It's never going to happen that you're going to plug in three into this function and you're going to

191
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.490
get one result one time and a different result another time.

192
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.680
In other words three squared is always going to be nine.

193
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.240
And that is one characteristic of functions.
