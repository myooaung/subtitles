00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.790
[Autogenerated] There are many options available for training,

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.970
including AWS instructor led training, A swell as various online options,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940
including Pluralsight.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.310
I will compare AWS instructor led training to using

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.640
Pluralsight as a learning option.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.560
Since you're watching this video,

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.760
you're most likely already a Pluralsight subscriber.

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.710
So you already have access to all of our great resource

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.660
is to help you learn AWS as far as, the AWS official courses go.

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.940
The material is presented as though it matches the certification.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.840
The problem is,

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350
when you go to those classes and you talk to the instructor

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.310
because I personally attended a class,

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.760
they'll tell you that the class will only give you

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.990
about 50 to 60% exam coverage.

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.020
Those classes are focused on foundations and not on specific aspects

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.850
of the exam that you may or may not already know.

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.840
If you are already familiar with the product and have been using AWS,

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840
these classes can be really helpful because they can

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.440
help you solidify your mental model.

21
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.130
They're also very expensive.

22
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.610
You know, you could spend $1800 are more on these classes,

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.200
takes three days of your time, so you'd be out of the office.

24
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.400
Most likely they do have online offerings as well, but it's it can be.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.440
It's not for everyone,

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.880
and it's also the problem is your access to the resource is the labs.

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.340
Etcetera will be limited to class,

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.340
so may or may not be a good option for everyone.

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.910
Another option is Pluralsight Pluralsight.

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.040
Training videos will give you a very high level of exam coverage.

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.990
If you can learn at your convenience, this is a great way for you.

32
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.900
If you're one of those people that's disciplined,

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.090
URL I can sit down and take time out of your schedule to learn things.

34
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.050
It's a way to go because the S3 exercises or the videos

35
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.070
are relatively short and you can go back and re watch

36
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.940
them as many times as you want.

37
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
I personally use Pluralsight videos when I was preparing for some of my AWS

38
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.940
certification exams and it worked really well for me.

39
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.730
Having examined both options, we can now compare them side by side.

40
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.280
The Pluralsight option is gonna be really hard to beat because of its

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.040
flexibility because of the exam coverage and the cost.

42
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.040
Even though the Pluralsight option worked great for me,

43
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.290
it may or may not work that way for you because it required me

44
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.300
to have discipline and time management to get through all the

45
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.440
materials and feel confident with what I learned.

46
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.170
If you happen to be one of those people who lacks discipline than the

47
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.040
rigor of being in class might work better for you.

48
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.930
But you will still have to fill in gaps due to the lack of exam

49
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.240
coverage from AWS instructor led training.

50
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.450
When you're ready to take that step toward training,

51
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.900
then I would recommend you start with Pluralsight.

52
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.140
Since you already paid for a subscription,

53
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.740
watch a few videos, go through some of the demos and see how it works for you.

54
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.680
Like I had mentioned earlier, that worked well for me.

55
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.740
Pluralsight was very beneficial for me for passing my AWS certification exams.

56
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.010
Even if you read all of the AWS documentation,

57
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.300
watch a bunch of videos and learn all the theory.

58
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140
It's only going to take you so far.

59
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.150
Hands on experience is critical to mastering AD DS and

60
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.640
ultimately being able to pass the exam.

61
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.040
So why hands on Well,

62
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.370
hands on is gonna help you take concepts that you've

63
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.940
learned about AWS and put them into practice.

64
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.670
It's not only going to help you prepare for the exam,

65
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.040
but it's gonna help you towards your goal of achieving AWS mastery.

66
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.270
Even in the AWS training classes,

67
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.040
they clearly state that the best preparation for certification

68
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.440
is hands on experience with the product.

69
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.650
We're gonna briefly discuss three options available for you to gain some

70
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.760
hands on experience with AWS after discussing these options,

71
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.890
will take a deeper look at quick laps, and I will do some demos for you as well.

72
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.110
I will show you how to set up an account in quick labs,

73
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.360
and then I will show you how to navigate quick labs

74
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.040
and find some interesting labs.

75
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.830
And finally,

76
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.620
we'll talk about some custom projects that you can also do

77
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.840
to help you as part of hands on training.

78
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.580
Let's briefly discuss using the AWS free to your account with the

79
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.640
Pluralsight demos to provide hands on experience using AWS.

80
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.800
So what is free tier by itself,

81
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.390
Free tier can be a bit overwhelming because it does

82
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.740
not provide you with any direction.

83
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.590
However,

84
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.140
when we combine free tier with our demos that are performed by the

85
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.340
instructors and Pluralsight training videos,

86
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.960
we can usually follow along as they're doing their

87
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.240
demonstrations in our free tier accounts.

88
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.950
Free tier offers free use of many AD DS services,

89
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.740
and it's automatically applied when you create a new account.

90
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.830
Some of the free services will expire after 12 months.

91
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.030
Others will continue indefinitely.

92
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.240
After that,

93
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.140
setting up free tier accounts is discussed in other Pluralsight courses,

94
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.440
so we will not be doing that here.

95
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.590
Rather than just trying to use free tier by itself or

96
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.440
watching an instructor performed demos.

97
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.640
A much better approach is to combine the two.

98
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.040
Use your free tier account along with the Pluralsight videos.

99
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.790
Having your own account can have risks associated with it as well.

100
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.070
Because a free tier account is not some restricted type of account.

101
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.640
It is a full AWS account with no restrictions whatsoever on it.

102
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.590
You're just getting discounts on billing and,

103
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.390
in some cases free access to certain services.

104
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.550
But not everything is free.

105
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.460
Something's are just discounted, and some things may not be discounted it all.

106
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.720
So it is possible to run up a large bill within AWS.

107
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.110
It's very important to make sure you understand the resource Azure

108
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.940
deploying and make sure they fall under the free TLS ID lines.

109
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.220
The other issue that comes up with free tier is that you have to

110
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.160
manually set up your resource is and any underlying

111
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.540
infrastructure for the services you wanna use.

112
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:44.140
For example, if I wanna work with I am policies and see how they impact access,

113
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.670
then I'm gonna have to create some.

114
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.140
I am.

115
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.000
Resource is, I may have to create some users.

116
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.710
I may have to create some groups.

117
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.730
I'm have to create some roles.

118
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.210
I may even have to create some policies if you Wi-Fi

119
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.660
following along with an instructor on a video.

120
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.080
He may have done this in an earlier video,

121
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.240
so he's assuming these things were already set up,

122
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.110
so it makes it harder for you to watch videos out of order.

123
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.020
The other issue that comes up is that when you're done,

124
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.830
you have to manually clean up.

125
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.980
Your resource is so you're gonna have to make sure you make a

126
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.950
careful note of what you created and what you deployed so that

127
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.620
you can go back and clean those up.

128
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.080
Otherwise, you may incur costs for those.

129
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.030
Resource is,

130
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:30.140
she's really important to be careful with us While this is a great option,

131
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.470
Azure AWS skills increase my recommendation in the

132
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.530
early part of your learning Azure.

133
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.330
Still building your mental model and you're trying to understand

134
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.470
a W s and getting familiar with the services that this is

135
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.240
probably not the best way to practice.

136
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.820
Once you've developed some of the skills and you feel more comfortable in AWS,

137
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:58.380
this is gonna be by far the best way to learn because it's unrestricted access

138
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.840
and you can do anything that you want to in your AWS account.

139
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.040
Through this,

140
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.980
using free tier along with Pluralsight demos is a great way to learn.

141
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.450
And it can really help you get off to a good start because you've got an

142
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.740
instructor there that's gonna walk you through demos,

143
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.970
those types of things.

144
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.860
However, doing this alone is not gonna help.

145
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.300
You have enough to achieve mastery.

146
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.220
There is a very powerful tool called quick labs that can take your

147
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.540
learning to the next level because it has in depth labs.

148
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:39.340
I highly recommend this to anyone trying to master AWS.

149
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.540
So what is quick labs?

150
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.090
Quick Labs is an online learning environment,

151
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.660
along with a set of instructions think lab God that walks you

152
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.840
through live real world and scenario based use cases.

153
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.340
What are the advantages of quick laps?

154
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.680
Well, quick labs is performed in a sandbox environment,

155
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.460
so the expenses are controlled.

156
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.060
You're not using your own AWS account.

157
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.840
You're using an account provided to you by quick labs,

158
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.680
so you don't have to worry about these.

159
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.440
Resource is that you've been using, so it helps you control costs.

160
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.840
Secondly, Quick Labs offers two ways to pay for labs.

161
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:31.040
There's an option to purchase credits, which can be used to by labs,

162
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:37.140
and labs will vary anywhere from one credit up to like 15 or more,

163
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.720
so they can get rather expensive.

164
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.790
But there's a better way to do that.

165
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.180
There's a monthly subscription that lets you do is many labs as you want,

166
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.680
and repeat them as many times as you want during that 30

167
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.940
day period for the monthly subscription.

168
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:59.040
In my opinion, the monthly subscription is the most cost effective way to learn,

169
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.410
as long as you're actually using it, because a lot of people,

170
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.060
they sign up for it and they get busy and forget about it.

171
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.780
So they're spending 50 bucks a month for the subscription

172
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.400
that they aren't really taking advantage of.

173
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.740
I don't recommend you keep it for a long term.

174
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.630
My recommendation is as you've gone through all the Pluralsight

175
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.450
training and you're ready to take your skills to the next level

176
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.740
and a and test your mental models.

177
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.240
Purchase a month subscription with quick labs,

178
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.660
go through, do all of the labs, theirs quests within quick labs.

179
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.850
And I'm gonna show you this in a demonstration.

180
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.160
But these quest our exams specific,

181
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.300
focused objectives that walk you through the other great thing

182
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.410
about quick labs is automatically set up.

183
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.800
Resource is so I don't any supporting resource is that if we did it ourselves,

184
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.520
we would have to set up a swell.

185
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.080
It does all that for us.

186
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.700
So we're able to do complex labs that happen to do a bunch of extra stuff.

187
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.930
This then allows us to focus on learning objectives because quick

188
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.340
labs is built around specific learning objectives.

189
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.850
So if I'm learning about lifecycle policies and S3 I can focus on that

190
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.340
and not have to focus with creating all these I m policies and rolls

191
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.140
and users and all of that kind of thing,

192
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.540
quick labs also makes use of many as well as expensive.

193
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.940
Resource is so there's some labs, you know.

194
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.540
It'll be 10.

195
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.890
Resource is to get deployed.

196
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.550
Well, if you did that yourself,

197
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.170
some of these things may not even be on free tier.

198
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.040
So you're gonna run the risk doing yourself of the cost.

199
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.340
You also won't have the luxury of having a lab.

200
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.620
God, there that walks you through the process with using these resource is.

201
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.650
And that, like I said, is the real power of quick laps.

202
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.240
It is a lab God.

203
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240
Finally, quick labs will automatically tear down.

204
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.840
All of the resource is that were created during the activity.

205
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.890
So you don't have to keep track.

206
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.900
Oh, yeah, I deployed this resource.

207
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.090
I deployed this resource.

208
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.740
No, you don't need to worry about that.

209
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.280
And there's some features a native yes, that you cannot perform with quick laps,

210
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.790
For example, AWS organizations and sub org's.

211
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.640
That's one example of a feature you can't really do in a quick labs account,

212
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.190
but you can do those types of things in your own account.

213
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:27.740
But for the associate level exam, you don't have to worry about those features.

214
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:39.000
Every exam Objective-C for the associate level exam has labs to cover those materials to test your learning model.
