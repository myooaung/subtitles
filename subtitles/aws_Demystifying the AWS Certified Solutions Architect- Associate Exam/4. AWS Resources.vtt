00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.900
[Autogenerated] Let's discuss what types of resource is are available

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.040
from AWS to help us on our journey to AWS mastery.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.850
To achieve mastery,

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.390
you're gonna spend many hours going through these types of

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.240
resource is and getting hands on experience.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.790
We start with a full services documentation,

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.760
and we're gonna go through and talk about each of

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.340
these briefly over the next few slots.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.440
From there, we'll talk about a NetBeans services fake use.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.740
We'll talk about white papers and why those are important.

11
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.240
We'll talk about AWS event videos.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.920
We'll discuss the AWS architectures center and why that's

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.240
important and we'll look at AWS answers.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.030
The full service documentation is gonna be the final word for

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.640
any questions you have about any AWS services.

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.840
You will use this to answer questions Azure journey through AWS,

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.910
as well as to gain deeper insights into services that you're interested in.

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.520
When I was studying for my certification exams when I was learning AWS,

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.840
I would spend hours reading through this official documentations.

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440
At times, it can be a bit dry,

21
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.940
but there is gold to be found in this authoritative resource.

22
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.650
There are multiple ways to view the documentation you can use a Web browser.

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.170
You can download the documentation.

24
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.340
It's a Pdf file.

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
You can look at the documentation and GitHub and imported into GitHub,

26
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.410
or you can use a Kindle reader to look at it.

27
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.980
When I was learning at W S,

28
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.040
I would download a Kindle version of the documentation that I was interested in.

29
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.160
Put it on my iPad and use it as reference and pick it

30
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.770
up and read it from time to time.

31
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.350
You probably don't want to read most of these documents from

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340
cover to cover because it's a bit dry.

33
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.570
Instead, you wanna pick out areas that are interesting and read those sections.

34
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.560
Many of these documents will contain step by step examples to do

35
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.780
configurations so that you can practice what you've learned from

36
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.640
the full services documentation.

37
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.740
We move over to the AWS services FAA cues.

38
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.390
These documents can be quite lengthy,

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.080
so trying to read them from cover to cover is probably not the best approach.

40
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.640
It's also very dry reading.

41
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.340
There's gonna be a few of these that I did read from cover

42
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.830
to cover as I was preparing for the exam.

43
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.040
But that's the exception rather than the rule.

44
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.560
As I was studying for the exam,

45
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.610
I would refer back to these as I would review practice questions,

46
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.340
or I would be looking at forums and see questions that people posted

47
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.900
these F a qs can see very helpful to answer that.

48
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.770
And sometimes an exam question will come from something you learn in an F A.

49
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.330
Q.

50
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.700
Another part of your journey to AWS mastery will take you through white papers.

51
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.480
You don't need to read all of these.

52
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.890
There's literally hundreds of these documents out there,

53
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.440
and they're not all gonna be applicable for this exam.

54
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.610
Reading White Papers works best for those that prefer

55
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.850
static and visual presentation.

56
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.640
That's great for that.

57
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.330
My recommendation is that when you're building your mental model in

58
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.620
getting started in your AWS journey that you read the following three

59
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.550
white papers architect ng for the Cloud AWS best practices AWS security

60
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.220
best practices and the overview of Amazon Web Services those will help

61
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.740
you establish your mental model.

62
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.530
Initially,

63
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.760
you're just going to want to read these to get your foundation in place,

64
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.640
but as you move into exam preparation later,

65
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.830
you're gonna actually want to study these in a little bit more detail Once you

66
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.910
have grasped the concepts of AWS and you feel like you really understand it

67
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.590
and you're ready to start studying for the exam,

68
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.080
there's other white papers that you wanna look at as well.

69
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.240
The AWS storage services overview the AWS well architected framework.

70
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.740
And then the overview of security processes will be fundamental

71
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.940
to you mastering AWS and passing the exam.

72
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.940
Another area I would like to encourage you to look at are the EBS event videos.

73
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.890
You don't need to watch every single video that's out there.

74
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.240
There are a ton of videos out there.

75
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.250
You're going to be better off focusing on foundational videos that are evil.

76
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.540
Either a level 300 or a Level 400.

77
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.270
Level 300 is gonna be kind of an intermediate level,

78
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.750
and 400 is gonna be more, um, of an advanced level.

79
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.320
But it's gonna be the level of knowledge you're gonna need when you're

80
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.040
trying to master AWS and really get your mental model down.

81
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.440
So personally,

82
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.940
I would avoid the Level 200 videos because there's simply too basic.

83
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.520
If you're just trying to get a real quick understanding of how

84
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.270
some service works and they might be okay,

85
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.740
but I would focus in on the 304 100 videos.

86
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.140
And remember, you are trying to build a mental model.

87
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.680
An example of a video that I found really helpful when I was

88
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.380
learning wasn't it was called Another day,

89
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.640
another billion packets.

90
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.240
This is a Level 400 lecture that was taught at reinvent,

91
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.300
and basically it goes into the whole life cycle of a packet.

92
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.770
It's very interesting, and it will help you build your mental model.

93
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.170
This approach to learning with the videos is gonna work best for

94
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.980
someone who prefers auditory and visual presentations.

95
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.140
The next area you wanna look at is the AWS Architectures center.

96
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.660
The Architectures center is a website that describes best

97
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.540
practice architecture from different scenarios.

98
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.360
There will be things like website hosting or web application hosting or

99
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.770
media sharing or online games will provide examples.

100
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.810
Architects who have been through the process will share

101
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.990
their solution and give you direction on it.

102
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.130
The other thing about the architecture center.

103
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.430
There's a whole bunch of CloudFormation templates within the

104
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.240
architecture center that you can download and then deploy into your own

105
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.680
environment so you can experience how these architectures work and get

106
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.340
hands on experience playing with them.

107
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.130
Reviewing the architectures is a great way to confirm your mental model.

108
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.570
Azure knowledge of AWS increases the final piece we wanna look at.

109
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.640
If the AWS answers page,

110
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.790
this website will provide you with answers to come in

111
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.940
architecture questions and help you further refine your

112
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.150
mental model as you develop mastery of AWS.

113
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.630
I personally did not use this when I was learning AWS

114
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.340
because it wasn't available then.

115
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.990
But I do refer to it often now because it's a very useful resource,

116
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.620
and it's got lots of good answers to questions about you're

117
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:19.000
architectures and your deployment and how to build and deploy. So I definitely recommend AWS answers as a resource Azure learning AWS.
