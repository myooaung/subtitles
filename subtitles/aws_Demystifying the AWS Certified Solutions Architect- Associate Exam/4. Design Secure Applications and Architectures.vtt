00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.370
[Autogenerated] Let's talk about designing secure

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.960
applications and architectures in this exam objective will

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.060
be focusing on securing our cloud.

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.350
Resource is we'll cover subjects like securing our networks,

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.820
securing our applications and securing our data in the cloud.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.890
So how do we secure infrastructure to answer

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.260
security related questions on the exam?

8
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.130
You must understand the shared responsibility model.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.360
You need to know what AWS is responsible to manage versus what you is a

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.030
customer a responsible for because this is so important,

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.980
we have a diagram on the next slide.

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.340
To look at this a little closer.

13
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.070
The next area of security that you need to understand

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.340
is the principle of least privilege.

15
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.470
When creating user accounts and rolls,

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.100
you should always grant the minimum privileges needed to do the job and no more.

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.620
Pay very close attention to questions being asked on the exam and

18
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.840
never grant on account more access than it needs.

19
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.300
You will see this on the exam in the form of scenarios,

20
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.720
and some of the answer choices will clearly grant too much access within AWS.

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.360
The way we manage users and rolls is using what's

22
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810
called identity and access management,

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.150
or I am It's a service that allows us to centrally manage our users in native.

24
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.910
Yes, with I am.

25
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.870
You can create users,

26
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.940
groups and rolls and apply specific access policies to them.

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.190
Remember that when you create a new resource and I am,

28
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.440
it will have no permissions.

29
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.910
And that is referred to as an implicit deny and implicit than I

30
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.340
can always be overridden with an explicit allow.

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.240
But an explicit deny will always win.

32
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.950
So if you have a policy that explicitly denies access to, say, S3 or E C.

33
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.610
Two,

34
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.730
it doesn't matter what other policy exists if you apply both of those policies.

35
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.640
These explicit did not always wins.

36
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.070
I am convey integrated with Microsoft A D and with A W S directory

37
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.740
services using SAML 2D a to identity federation.

38
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.670
In addition,

39
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.270
web Identity Federation Convey used to allow users from open IDE

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.340
providers such as amazon dot com and Facebook to have rolls assign

41
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.290
using the security token services when possible.

42
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.480
You should choose a role instead of a user account because roles are

43
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.650
more secure and they don't risk exposing access keys because when you

44
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.340
use a associate a user with some application,

45
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.110
it's going to require an access key in a secret access key,

46
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.720
and those can get you in a lot of trouble if those get exposed,

47
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.330
so try to use a role whenever possible.

48
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.940
So when you see an exam question, look for the question that uses a role.

49
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.840
The share responsibility model is something you need to

50
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.050
memorize so that you clearly understand the differences between

51
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:39.040
security in the cloud and of the cloud.

52
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.170
Security in the cloud is gonna be your responsibility is the customer.

53
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.820
So make sure you understand these blue boxes on the customer side of this.

54
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.680
Also,

55
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.130
make sure you understand the yellow boxes on the AWS

56
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.740
side known as security of the cloud.

57
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.290
Again refer back to the documentation that's included with

58
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.080
this course if you need a refresher.

59
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.190
But you should have learned these things as you were building

60
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.320
your mental model and going through the various courses to

61
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.140
understand the topics and to Master AWS.

62
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.030
These questions can be really tricky on the exam if you don't

63
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.210
have a clear understanding of this diagram.

64
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.780
If you're not familiar with it,

65
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.140
takes some time to study it before you take the exam.

66
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.540
The next thing we want to look at is that we need to have a clear

67
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.240
understanding of how networking works and how VPC s work.

68
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.640
We need to know how to create a VPC from scratch rather than using the wizard.

69
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.410
So it's important that you understand all the pieces that make up of VPC VP

70
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.020
CSS themselves are organized into sub nets and include routing tables for

71
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.170
routing the traffic to secure a vpc we can make use of security groups and

72
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.500
knack ALS and to direct traffic into and out of the vpc we can use things

73
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.290
like internet gateways or virtual private gateways that we're dealing with

74
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.540
VPNs and Nat gateways.

75
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.140
We'll talk about these.

76
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.790
You need to know the difference between security groups and knack,

77
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.570
ALS and the key features of each.

78
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.140
A security group is what we call staple,

79
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.140
meaning that any traffic that's allowed in will also be allowed out.

80
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.320
Nak als are stateless,

81
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.540
meaning that traffic must believe explicitly allowed both into and

82
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.940
out of the network what we call egress and ingress.

83
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.100
Make sure you understand that only knack ALS have explicit deny rules.

84
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.110
Security groups do not have deny rules.

85
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.890
Security groups are applied to your E and I Level and knack

86
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.540
ALS are applied at the sub net level.

87
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.570
You should start with security groups and layer on complexity with knack.

88
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.630
ALS is needed.

89
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.170
There are two types of sub nets and AD DS public sub nets and private sub nets.

90
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.300
You must understand the difference between them and know

91
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.340
when to use each of them in architecture.

92
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.450
For a sub net to be public,

93
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.320
it must contain a route table entry to the Internet Gateway and the resource

94
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.590
is in the public sub net must either have a public IP address or an elastic

95
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.340
IP address for resource is in a private sub net.

96
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.200
To access the Internet,

97
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.340
they must have a route to the Nat instance or a Net gateway

98
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.120
that will allow them to access the Internet.

99
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.960
Even though these resource is can access the Internet to get their updates,

100
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.300
they will not be accessible from outside.

101
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.640
The network is far as vpc connections go.

102
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.800
You need to understand all the services.

103
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.840
They get traffic into and out of the network.

104
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.040
Internet gateways provide connective iti to the internet.

105
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.340
VPC peering connects multiple vpc s together.

106
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.140
NEC gateways allow internet traffic from private sub nets.

107
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.510
Virtual private gateways provide connection to VPN.

108
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:26.240
Jest and Direct Connect provides dedicated private connections to AWS.

109
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.940
We now want to talk about securing data.

110
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.840
There's two ways to secure data.

111
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.230
The first type we look at is what's called data in Transit.

112
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:42.440
This involves the transfer of data into and out of AWS.

113
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.170
We can use things like SSL certificates for web traffic or use IP sec for VPNs

114
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.540
to secure traffic from an on premise data center in to AWS.

115
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.170
We can also use IP SQL Direct Connect since direct connect by

116
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.440
itself does not have any way to encrypt traffic.

117
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.740
We can put in IP sect tunnel inside of our direct connect.

118
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.740
What about data at rest?

119
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.510
How do we secure that traffic depending on the service that we're using?

120
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.880
A native?

121
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.940
Yes, there's various options available.

122
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.520
If you remember,

123
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.710
Amazon S3 has four ways that we can encrypt data that

124
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.740
will be residing in the bucket.

125
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.440
The first way is using what's known as Amazon S3 Managed keys or S S e S3,

126
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.340
which uses A S to 56 to encrypt data.

127
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.980
The next type is Amazon S3 with kms known as S E K.

128
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.950
M s and we can use that to encrypt our data.

129
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.740
The third type is Amazon S3 with customer manage keys where the

130
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.040
customer provides the keys that are uploaded with their data and

131
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.600
the final option would be to encrypt the data clients side and

132
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.740
then uploaded into AD DS.

133
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.110
This is known as client side encryption.

134
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.050
In addition,

135
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:16.190
Amazon EBS supports options to encrypt data using kms for the

136
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.740
data that is residing on the EBS volumes.

137
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:25.900
This is known as encryption at rest AWS Kms,

138
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:31.050
also known as he management services.

139
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:37.040
A managed service provided by AWS to manage all of our encryption keys.

140
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.260
It is integrated with many other eight of your service,

141
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.540
which makes it a great option for encrypting data in AWS.

142
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:52.360
What you need to know about Kms is that AWS manages the key for you.

143
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.840
AWS holds the master key.

144
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.130
It never sees the light of day.

145
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.640
They back this up, they keep it safeguarded for you.

146
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.820
Also,

147
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:11.120
AWS kms supports what is known as 51 40-2 compliance but it

148
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.280
only supports up to level two for that.

149
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.820
This is because kms is a multi tenant solution.

150
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.720
As part of preparing for the exam.

151
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.140
Make sure that you review the most recent list of AWS

152
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.250
services that are integrated with K.

153
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.940
M s.

154
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.440
Because the list changes frequently.

155
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:39.130
When you have workloads that require level three of Phipps compliance,

156
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.840
we then can use a hardware appliance known as Cloud HSM.

157
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.390
Cloudhsm is a hardware device.

158
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.340
It is not an easy to instantiate.

159
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.220
It does not look like an easy to instance in the console.

160
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.220
It runs on a Linux platform so that you can access it

161
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.550
to do configuration and management.

162
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:06.100
You do this through an SSH interface, so you SSH into this device.

163
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:12.140
But it is a physical hardware device that is dedicated to UI.

164
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.230
It resides within AWS.

165
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.430
Because of this,

166
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.600
Amazon will take care of the backups and the replication between nodes.

167
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.440
If you have this in a cluster,

168
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.910
which you should do because this could be a single point of failure,

169
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.140
that could be a disaster.

170
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.780
Because if you lose these keys, anything you've encrypted with it,

171
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.340
you've now lost access to for the exam.

172
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.940
You don't need to understand the inner workings off cloudhsm,

173
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:46.760
but you need to remember that it is the only Phipps 1 40 Dash to Level

174
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.140
three Solution that's currently available in AWS.

175
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.390
Now let's take a look at a couple of more practice

176
00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.880
questions before continuing to the next exam.

177
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.220
Objective-C on E c.

178
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:07.340
Two instantiate host of voting application that accesses a dynamodb table.

179
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.690
The two instants needs to be able to.

180
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.040
Access the table in the most secure way possible.

181
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.180
Which of the following is the most secure way for the

182
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.740
instance to access the dynamodb table,

183
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.270
Use kms keys with permissions to interact with dynamodb.

184
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.870
To assign those keys to the application using I am user account that is

185
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:35.980
designed and designated as a service account to ensure minimum required

186
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.130
credentials and assign that to the instance use.

187
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.820
And I am role with permissions to interact with

188
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.280
dynamodb and assign that to the sea.

189
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.190
To instance or configure of VPC Gateway endpoint to allow

190
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.740
the resource is to access dynamodb.

191
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.900
Take a minute.

192
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.140
Think about this question and then come back.

193
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.640
Did you pick C?

194
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.050
That's the correct answer.

195
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.240
If you remember, we talked about I am,

196
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.430
and we talked about users groups and rolls,

197
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:18.290
and I had told you that you should always choose a roll over a user account.

198
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.250
If we look at these questions and these answer choices,

199
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.910
answer is obviously wrong.

200
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:29.800
You do not use Kms keys to interact with Resource is like this.

201
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.640
That's not how they're used.

202
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.780
Option B is also wrong because now we're using a user

203
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.810
account that we're calling a service account.

204
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.370
But because of that, we're now using access teas and secret keys,

205
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.960
which we said we do not want to use.

206
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.470
It's not secure enough Option D to configure a VPC gateway endpoint.

207
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.170
That's not gonna help us with this option.

208
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.120
C.

209
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.500
Use a role with permissions to interact with dynamodb and assign it to the EEC.

210
00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.490
To instance,

211
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.720
that is the correct answer because we're using rolls to

212
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.640
interact with dynamodb instead of user accounts.

213
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.540
Let's look at another question.

214
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.640
You need to ensure that data stored in Amazon S3 is encrypted.

215
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.890
Which of the following encryption methods can do used,

216
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:27.640
assuming that you do not want to manage the encryption keys CSS CSS3,

217
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:38.440
CSS CC, SSC Kms or SSC Kms with club HSM again,

218
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:44.000
take a minute, pause the video and see what you come up with.

219
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.040
Did you select day?

220
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.240
In that case, it's the correct answer.

221
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.970
You remember SSC S3 doesn't use Kms.

222
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.030
It uses the original way of encrypting files and S3.

223
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.940
It uses A S to 56 to encrypt that data.

224
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.940
So there's no keys for us to manage its just all managed through S3.

225
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.020
So SSC S3 would be the best answer in this case before we

226
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.040
move to the next objective for the exam.

227
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.840
Let's look at some tips to help you on the exam.

228
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.640
First of all, lock down the AD DS root account.

229
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.950
Any questions that you get about the root account,

230
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.440
you should always focus on keeping it locked down and secure,

231
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.840
probably using multi factor authentication on it to really lock it down.

232
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.490
Secondly, remember security groups do not have explicit deny options.

233
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.440
If you want an explicit deny for your network traffic,

234
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:54.340
you have to use knack ALS, which are also known as network access control lists.

235
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.490
Third,

236
00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:02.320
remember nak ALS support explicit deny options and fourth

237
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.880
use rolls over access keys at all times.

238
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.230
Because rolls do not require you to use access keys or secret access keys,

239
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:19.000
a role will allow you to securely access. Resource is in native Yes,
