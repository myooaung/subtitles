00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.090
[Autogenerated] AWS has designed their infrastructure around services

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.710
and there are many categories of services within AWS.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.330
As you can see from this diagram to the novice,

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.670
this can feel really overwhelming because there's so

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.540
many different components to AWS.

6
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.340
Even within each of these categories where we see these service categories,

7
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.640
there are multiple services in many cases.

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.750
So it would be really nice if AWS told us what specific

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.700
services were covered on the exam.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.240
But unfortunately they do not.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.470
Looking at the exam blueprint,

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.770
you will discover there are five knowledge areas that are

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.540
required to succeed on the example.

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.450
But again,

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.640
AWS does not provide us with a breakdown of what services are involved in this.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.410
Instead,

17
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.040
they give us categories based off of the well architected framework model,

18
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.140
and questions will be scenario based on the exam using these categories.

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.780
If you're completely new to AWS,

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.840
this breakdown will not make a lot of sense to you.

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.230
So if we're trying to master AWS itself,

22
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.720
this category approach is not really going to help us.

23
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.240
We'll refer back to this diagram later in the course when

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.420
we actually get into discussion of the exam itself to help

25
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.310
you dissect this information.

26
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.110
I would like to present you with a more refined a list of AWS services that

27
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.440
you can focus on to pass the exam with this new view.

28
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.740
Instead of looking at 18 categories, we're only going to need to focus on 10.

29
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.140
Initially, this still might seem like a lot,

30
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.000
but many of these services inter operate with each other as we're going to see as we go through this process.
