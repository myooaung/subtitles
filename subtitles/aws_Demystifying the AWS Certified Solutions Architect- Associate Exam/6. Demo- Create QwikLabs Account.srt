[Autogenerated] Now that we understand a little better what

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,240
quick labs is and what it can do for us.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,700
Let me walk you through a simple demo of creating an

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,650
account for quick labs from our web browser.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,950
We're gonna want to browse to the Quick Labs website.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,620
Quick labs dot com We're gonna want to find the

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,840
joint option at the top of the page.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,200
We're going to click on the joint option.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,390
This is gonna present us with two options.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,240
We can either join with Google or join with email.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,770
We're gonna choose the joint with Google option,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,420
but you could use the joint with email option if you wanted to.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,540
And it's a very simple process.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll select my Google account that I want to use, and it's that simple. Your Quick Labs account is now being created using your Google account.
