00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] Now, throughout this course,

2
00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.006
you've been introduced to JDBC, RDBMS,

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:05.006
and all kinds of stuff.

4
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.006
And I want to give you a little bit of a rundown

5
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.002
of what we've looked at

6
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.008
before we jump into where you should go next.

7
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:17.002
So again, we introduced the concepts of RDBMS, JDBC,

8
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.006
and the Postgres database

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.001
that we were going to use throughout this course.

10
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.003
We then jumped into code

11
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.000
and talked about basic CRUD operations,

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.009
and you had a challenge exercise

13
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.004
where you got to work on a DAO that spanned multiple tables.

14
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.004
Then we jumped at some advanced concepts

15
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.006
like paging, sorting, and using stored procedures.

16
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.000
And then we did some very basic introduction in transactions

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.007
and transaction management,

18
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:45.003
and we also talked about commits and rollbacks,

19
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.003
and exception handling.

20
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.009
Now, we've taken all of this as a whirlwind

21
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.009
of information in this course,

22
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.003
but where do you go next?

23
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.009
Well, I alluded to it a little bit ago

24
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.000
when I talked about JPA,

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.009
that you definitely should go learn JPA

26
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.003
and other ORM technologies out there.

27
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.001
You should also study Spring data access patterns.

28
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.009
In my opinion, Spring data access

29
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.007
is one of the far superior ways of doing

30
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.004
data access within the Java language.

31
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.006
But that again is my biased opinion,

32
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:22.002
but at least study it to see how they do data access.

33
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.005
You might learn a thing or two,

34
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.001
even if you don't want to use Spring,

35
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.001
I do highly encourage you to learn Hibernate,

36
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:33.000
and learn Hibernate how it works, not just how to use it,

37
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.002
because then you can study

38
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:37.002
the pros and the cons of Hibernate.

39
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.008
I have built very large systems leveraging Hibernate,

40
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:44.003
but I've also shot myself in the foot more than once.

41
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.002
So, consider that.

42
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:47.007
And the only way to really do that

43
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.007
is to play with it and learn the technology itself.

44
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.004
And regardless of which way you go,

45
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.007
whether you do JPA and ORM or you do Spring data

46
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.005
or Spring data JDBC,

47
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.007
I highly encourage you to learn SQL.

48
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.001
If you're doing RDBMS systems development,

49
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.009
SQL is your friend.

50
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.005
The better you understand it,

51
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:11.006
the better you're going to troubleshoot performance,

52
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.008
the better you're going to write quality queries,

53
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.009
and the better you're going to get code out the door

54
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:20.000
that is usable by multiple systems.

55
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.006
Finally, I would just want to tell you

56
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.006
how much I appreciate you spending your time with me.

57
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.002
I know that your time is valuable as a developer,

58
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.006
and whenever you take your time

59
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.001
to listen to one of my courses,

60
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.007
it actually does matter to me,

61
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.006
because I believe that this is my calling

62
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:36.001
to get information out,

63
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:39.001
and I appreciate you taking the time to be with me.

64
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.000
I highly encourage you, if you watch any of my courses,

65
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to reach out to me on LinkedIn.

66
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.003
Can also follow me on Twitter @fpmoles.

67
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.001
And I'm on Stack Overflow.

68
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.009
I answer questions from developers

69
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.007
who watch my videos all the time,

70
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.007
and I do so through one of these mechanisms.

71
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.004
Please, if you have any questions

72
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.008
about this video or any of my videos,

73
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:02.008
or if you just want to ask

74
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:04.008
some general development questions

75
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:06.008
or get involved in some of the conversations

76
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:08.003
that I'm involved in,

77
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:11.002
these are great media by which to reach out to me

78
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.003
and to find what is actually getting me moving

79
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:15.009
on a daily basis.

80
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.000
And after all, in a community setting,

81
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.001
that's how we all get along.

82
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.002
Thanks again for your time,

83
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.009
and I hope you learned a little bit about JDBC,

84
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.000
so that you can take it to the next level.
