00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] So now that we've created some data

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.003
and we've read some data, it's time to jump in

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.005
and actually update some data in our database.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.005
I'd like you to open up your IDE

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:10.004
And once again,

6
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.000
we're going to go to source main Java,

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.004
open up our base package and open up the customer DAO.

8
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.009
Once again, we are going to add in,

9
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.003
A private static final string,

10
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.000
and this time we're going to call it update,

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.005
and we're going to set that equal

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:34.008
to give a little bit more real state here on the screen.

13
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.001
We're going to create a statement

14
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:42.001
that says update customer set

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.002
and then we're going to go through our whole object

16
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.004
and set all of our values.

17
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.001
So first name equals question mark,

18
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.003
last_name equals question mark

19
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.007
and all the way through the rest of our object.

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.008
And then we're going to set it where,

21
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:03.004
Customer ID equals question mark.

22
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:08.005
And that's all there is to the update statement itself.

23
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:13.004
So now let's scroll down to our update method,

24
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.004
and we're ready to implement it.

25
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.000
So just like we've done before,

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.009
we'll create a customer object and set it equal to null,

27
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.004
and then we were going to do our try with resources.

28
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.003
And as we've also done before,

29
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.009
we will catch our sequel exception

30
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.003
and now we're ready to implement our method.

31
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:36.008
So just like in our creates statement,

32
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:38.007
we're going to go through our list.

33
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:39.006
But this time notice

34
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.007
that we're also going to have to add an ID at the end.

35
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.007
So we actually can come down here to the create statement

36
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:51.000
and copy everything.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.002
And then at the very end just add, statement.setLong,

38
00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:03.004
and it's going to be nine and dto.getId.

39
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:07.007
And once that's done, we will do a statement that execute.

40
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:15.002
And then we will set our customer equal to this.findById

41
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:19.007
and again, pass it in our dto.getId,

42
00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:20.009
and now the very end of our method.

43
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.004
We will return our customer

44
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:29.000
and that's all there is to the update statement itself.

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.002
Now let's go back to our JOBC executer,

46
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:36.007
and we're going to modify our method here a little bit.

47
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:40.003
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a customer,

48
00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:45.000
equal to customer DAO.findById.

49
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.007
And we're going to pass it in 10,000.

50
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:50.004
Now that should be the value for the George Washington

51
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.007
that we added a couple of videos ago.

52
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:56.002
However, if you had issues on your create,

53
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.003
you may have increased the sequence number a few.

54
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:00.006
And if you've done that,

55
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.007
go ahead and run a postgres command,

56
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:09.004
to select all in or by the customer ID in descending order,

57
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.007
so that you can actually get the value

58
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.001
that you need to put in here.

59
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.000
But essentially this is what you created

60
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
with the create customer.

61
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.001
So we will do a System.out.printline,

62
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.007
and we will send in as we've done before,

63
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:32.005
our customer.firstname plus a space,

64
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:37.009
plus our customer.lastname,

65
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:46.002
plus a space plus a customer.getEmail.

66
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:47.005
And that should give us some idea,

67
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.008
of what we want to print here.

68
00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:51.005
So now we're going to take our customer

69
00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:54.009
and we're going to set our email,

70
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.002
instead of what we had before of George.Washington.

71
00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:05.000
We're going to set this to gwashington@whitehouse.gov.

72
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And then we will do a customer on our customer DAO.update,

73
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.003
and we will pass in this customer object itself.

74
00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:18.007
So now we've got a new handle on it

75
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:24.004
and we will simply copy and paste this printout command.

76
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:29.004
And now we're ready to run our method.

77
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:32.006
So what you will see is the first round went through

78
00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:35.009
and we printed out the george.washington@whitehouse.gov.

79
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.006
And then after we made our update,

80
00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:40.007
it's now gwashington@whitehouse.gov.

81
00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:43.006
And that's what we expect to see on a simple update command.

82
00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:46.000
And that's how you do updates in JOBC.
