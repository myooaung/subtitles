00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.007
- [Frank] There are very few applications in the world today

2
00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:06.006
that don't have some aspect of data access.

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.008
In fact, I might even argue

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.003
that out of all of the common constructs

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.005
for application developers today,

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:18.003
data access is shared by the majority of developers.

7
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:23.000
In the Java world, JDBC is the most common technology

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.004
for accessing relational database

9
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:30.004
from a relational database management system, or RDBMS.

10
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:35.006
The modern RDBMS can span from the embedded in-memory type

11
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:39.008
to the traditional large deployment on big iron hardware,

12
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.009
leveraging custom components and disks.

13
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.000
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.003
I'm a software developer, architect, and technologist

15
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.003
who has spent a significant amount of my career

16
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.008
using JDBC to access data for my applications.

17
00:00:55.008 --> 00:01:00.000
In this course, I will show you the power of JDBC

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.006
while focusing on best practices.

19
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.009
With JDBC in the Java world,

20
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.004
we can get data into and out of any application

21
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:15.000
on any platform using any relational database.
