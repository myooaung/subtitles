00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] So now we're going to jump in

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:02.008
and actually create our project

3
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.008
that we're going to use throughout the rest of this course.

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.005
I'd like you to start with your IDEA,

5
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.007
in this case, I'm using IntelliJ ultimate edition.

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.004
Now most of these functions that I'm going to use

7
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.006
are actually built into every IDEA.

8
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.009
You may have to hunt around a little bit

9
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.006
for your specific version,

10
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.009
but I'm not doing anything that's too off the wall abnormal

11
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.007
as far as working with an IDEA.

12
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.007
So look up the documentation for your specific IDEA

13
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.002
if you don't know how to do these functions.

14
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.009
The first thing that I'm going to do, however,

15
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.001
is I'm going to create a new project.

16
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.001
Now I'm going to be presented with a whole bunch of options,

17
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.000
and I'm going to start with the Maven project.

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.007
I'm going to make sure that my project SDK is set at 11

19
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:43.007
because that's what I'm going to use

20
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.008
throughout the rest of this course.

21
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.008
And I'll go ahead and set Next.

22
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.006
Now I'm going to put some Maven specific information

23
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:52.006
into this window.

24
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.008
So I'm going to start with my group name

25
00:00:54.008 --> 00:01:01.003
and my group name is going to be Come-Frankmolly-lil-jdbc.

26
00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:07.000
And the name of my artifact will be learning-jdbc

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.002
and I will set my version to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.

28
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.003
Now, if you've worked with Maven,

29
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.004
this should all look very, very familiar

30
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.003
and IntelliJ just gives me a nice wizard

31
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.007
to go ahead and create the POM file,

32
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.000
which is what we're going to do.

33
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So the next thing is I need

34
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.004
to actually pick where I want to put this.

35
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.003
Now I'm going to use a local directory

36
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.003
in my home directory called code,

37
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.007
and I'm going to do /learning-jdbc.

38
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.003
Now, if you're using the exercise files,

39
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:33.008
you can definitely leverage it

40
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.000
from the exercise files itself, but that's up to you.

41
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.005
This is just where I'm going to put my code.

42
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.006
So now that my project is actually opened up,

43
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.009
we're starting with the POM file itself,

44
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.009
which is the heart of how Maven does dependency management

45
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.000
as well as builds.

46
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.006
And we're going to add a few things to our POM file.

47
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:58.007
I'm going to start here and add a property section.

48
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.002
Now there are a lot of properties

49
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:01.004
that can be built in a Maven,

50
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.007
and we're going to leverage some of those.

51
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:07.002
The first is a internal property we will create

52
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.008
called java.version.

53
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.001
And we will set that to 11

54
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.003
and now Maven runs a compiler plugin,

55
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.003
and this is how it actually does its compilation.

56
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.002
So we're going to set our Maven compiler target

57
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.007
to the value of java.version.

58
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.009
Now you may ask why we're doing it in this way.

59
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.002
And the simple fact is that

60
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.004
now I can actually just change the version

61
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.001
in one spot instead of multiple.

62
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.002
The other one that we're going to set here

63
00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:37.009
is Maven compiler source.

64
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:43.007
And again, we'll use our java.version

65
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:47.003
and now we're ready to build out a dependency section.

66
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.002
So we'll start with some dependencies

67
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.005
and we're going to go ahead and add our first one.

68
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:58.004
Now the artifact name that we're going to add is PostgreSQL

69
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:04.003
and the group that we will use is PostgreSQL.

70
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.007
And then we will specify a version.

71
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:19.000
And the version that we are going to use is 9.1-901-1.jdbc4.

72
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.009
Now, I have my IDEA set up to auto import Maven,

73
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.005
and it's gone ahead and done that.

74
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.009
And I can show you if we open up the extra libraries

75
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.003
that I have a Maven Postgress dependency,

76
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:32.002
which is what I would expect.

77
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:36.009
So now we're going to open up the tree in source main Java.

78
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.005
We're going to create a new package

79
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:43.000
and the name of that package will match our group name.

80
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.003
So Come-Frankmolly-lil.jdbc.

81
00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:49.007
In my case, yours may vary

82
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.004
and I'll go ahead and select, OK

83
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.007
and that creates my package.

84
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:56.008
And that was in that package.

85
00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.007
I'm going to create a new Java class file.

86
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:07.006
And the name that I'm going to give this is JDBCExecuter.

87
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.002
And basically the purpose of this class

88
00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:12.005
is just going to give us a main entry point of our application

89
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:15.002
so we can run all of the functions that we're going to do

90
00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:16.008
throughout the rest of this course.

91
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:22.006
So we will just add a public static void main method

92
00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:28.003
that takes a string array of args.

93
00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:35.005
And we will simply do a system.out.println,

94
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.005
"Hello Learning JDBC."

95
00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:38.008
And this is really just a test

96
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:41.000
that we've got everything set up going forward.

97
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.004
Now IntelliJ, I get this nice little ability

98
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:45.008
to run this main method.

99
00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:48.002
Every IDEA has a way to turn a main method

100
00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:50.007
on to run internally in the IDEA.

101
00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:52.001
I'm going to leverage the quick connect,

102
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.004
but you guys all have something very similar.

103
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.003
What we want to do here

104
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.002
is actually just run this main method

105
00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:58.003
and running it in the IDEA

106
00:04:58.003 --> 00:05:00.001
is really the easiest way to move forward.

107
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:03.000
So I'll go ahead and click my play button here

108
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.005
and allow it to run.

109
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.007
And it's going to compile, and once it's compiled,

110
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.006
it's going to execute the program

111
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:13.007
and you'll see, I have, "Hello Learning JDBC"

112
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:14.009
as I would expect.

113
00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.000
So at this point, our project is ready to go.
