00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] So we're about done talking

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.008
about all of the high level material

3
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.005
before we actually get into code.

4
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.008
And the last thing I want to talk

5
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.002
about is the database itself,

6
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.001
and in this case, Postgres.

7
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.003
Now Postgres is

8
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.000
an object relational database management system.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.006
Now what does that actually mean?

10
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:18.007
What it means is that it is

11
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.006
a relational database management system,

12
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.007
and that's what we're going to focus on.

13
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.002
But they've also added support for object models,

14
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.000
which gives you some similarities

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.006
to an object oriented programming construct,

16
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.002
and that's why a lot of developers

17
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.000
in the OOP space like Postgres.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.002
One of the most important things from my perspective

19
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.008
is that it's free and open source software,

20
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.006
and it is truly free and truly open source,

21
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.004
and I love that.

22
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.007
It was started at University of California Berkeley,

23
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:53.003
and it is a fully ACID compliant and transactional database,

24
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.002
which is very important if you're doing systems

25
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.000
that require all of your relations

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.003
to be transactionally written and to be ACID compliant.

27
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:05.005
Some of the other features that I like about the database

28
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.004
and a couple of which we will leverage in this course

29
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.007
include things like the fact

30
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.008
that it supports materialized and updatable views.

31
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.006
It also supports triggers natively.

32
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.001
Many databases don't support triggers,

33
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.004
or things that get added on to

34
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.006
remove the ability to use triggers,

35
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:26.002
and I find triggers to be very valuable in the real world

36
00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.002
when you're trying to trigger asynchronous actions

37
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.001
based on data being written.

38
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.006
Postgres also supports functions and stored procedures,

39
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:39.006
and we're going to leverage stored procedures in this course.

40
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:41.008
Another key feature is that Postgres runs

41
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.009
on every major operating system and it runs in Docker,

42
00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.000
which is how we're going to leverage it in this course.

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.009
But again, it runs on every major OS,

44
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.009
so if you don't want to mess with Docker,

45
00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.000
you can run this on any operating system

46
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.001
that most of us would be using.

47
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.004
So again, why did I choose it

48
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.008
as the database for this course?

49
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.000
It's easy to run locally,

50
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.002
and we've talked about that ad nauseum at this point.

51
00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:10.003
It also supports a large section of ANSI standard SQL.

52
00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:14.003
And I'm a big fan of not using vendor specific SQL,

53
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.007
unless you absolutely have to.

54
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:19.009
Using ANSI standard SQL allows you to leverage

55
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.008
that SQL across multiple databases.

56
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.006
It also supports stored procedures,

57
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.001
which is a learning concept

58
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.004
that I wanted to add into this course.

59
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:32.005
And finally, it has a solid security model.

60
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:33.009
Now we're not going to manipulate

61
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.002
the security model per se in this course,

62
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.002
but I don't want to use a database

63
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.000
for such an important topic

64
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.004
that doesn't have a built-in solid security model

65
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.001
from the beginning.

66
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.001
And with that,

67
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.007
we're ready to jump in and actually start working

68
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.000
with the database and with some Java code.
