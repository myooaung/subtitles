00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] In order to be successful in this course,

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.006
there are a few things that you need to know

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.007
so let's jump in.

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:07.005
First and foremost

5
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.004
you need to know the basic syntax of Java.

6
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.002
Now I don't expect you to be an expert in the Java world,

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.001
but I do expect to be able to read and write

8
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.008
some basic flow control

9
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.004
and some basic aspects of the language itself.

10
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.000
I also expect you to be able to use common libraries

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.006
from the Java and Javax packages,

12
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.007
and I expect you to understand how imports work

13
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:32.008
and how to import code from those packages.

14
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.005
Now for this course we're going to use a Java 11 baseline,

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.007
but most of what we're going to do

16
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.000
should work with older versions of Java like 1.8

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.004
and it should be relatively future-proof

18
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.002
until the JSR spec is updated.

19
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.003
We're also going to use Maven throughout this course

20
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.000
and we're going to do so in order to set up our environment,

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so I need you to use basic Maven commands.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.005
Now I'm going to show you those commands

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.009
but you will need to have Maven installed on your system.

24
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.002
I do want you to understand the basic concepts

25
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.008
of dependency management in importing libraries.

26
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.001
Now for this course,

27
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.006
basically, we're going to use Maven

28
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.003
to bring out driver onto the class path

29
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:14.008
so that we can use it

30
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.000
in any other logging

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.005
that we may want to add to our application.

32
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.009
We're not going to do a whole lot

33
00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.002
but we will leverage it.

34
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.003
So I do ask you to have it installed

35
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:26.006
and understand the basics.

36
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.005
Now in this course,

37
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.006
we're also going to use Docker

38
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.000
and we're going to do it to actually run our database.

39
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.004
Now there's a reason that we're going to use Docker

40
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.007
and that's because it's the easiest path

41
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.003
for everybody to get a database running on their system

42
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.006
regardless of operating system.

43
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.001
If I had to show you how to install Postgres

44
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.003
on windows and then Ubuntu

45
00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.006
and then Syntax

46
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.002
and then Windows

47
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.000
and then Mac

48
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and then the next version of Windows,

49
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.009
it would be crazy.

50
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.009
With Docker, we can run it everywhere

51
00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.007
simply by leveraging the Docker container.

52
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.002
Now I'm going to provide commands

53
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.003
to run it in Linux and Mac,

54
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.003
but it should be relatively similar

55
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.007
for a Windows environment.

56
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.009
Now I do want you to understand how to install Docker

57
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.000
on your machine

58
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.007
and I'm not going to show you how to do that,

59
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.001
but if you follow this link on the screen,

60
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.003
you can do it yourself,

61
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:23.003
with their very useful documentation.

62
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.004
Now there's a few other tools

63
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.003
that I'm going to use throughout this course.

64
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:27.006
I'm going to use a text editor

65
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.008
and the text editor that I use as Atom.

66
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.000
You do not have to use Atom,

67
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.006
you can use any text editor you want,

68
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.007
that's just what I choose to use.

69
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.009
I'm also going to use an IDE for all of my Java code.

70
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.008
Now I use IntelliJ ultimate edition.

71
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:45.003
You are free to use any IDE that you want.

72
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.008
I made us some generation of code,

73
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.001
but I promise you if you read the documentation on your IDE,

74
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.002
you will have very similar functions

75
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:56.003
for most of what I can do in IntelliJ.

76
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:57.009
I'm also going to leverage the terminal.

77
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.001
Now I'm on a Mac system

78
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.000
so the terminal will be BSD specific,

79
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.005
which is similar enough to Lenux

80
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.004
that most of the commands should work on both.

81
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.004
If you're on windows

82
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:10.002
you may need to make appropriate changes

83
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:11.005
but I'll explain what I'm doing

84
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.005
when I actually jump into terminal

85
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.003
and start typing things.

86
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:18.008
There won't be a lot of it but it is there.

87
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.000
The final piece of code that you're going to need

88
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.009
is you're going to need a Postgres client.

89
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.003
Now we're going to use Postgres as our database of choice,

90
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:30.000
because I love free and open source software,

91
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.007
and it is one of the better

92
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:35.005
free and open source relational databases today.

93
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.006
You will need that client side library

94
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.003
in order to baseline the database

95
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:42.005
that we're going to use throughout this course.

96
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:48.000
Now on my machine I can install just PSQL using Homebrew

97
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.002
and if you're on a Mac system

98
00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:52.006
it's a great way to get PSQL on your machine.

99
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:55.006
You can always install the full Postgres package,

100
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:57.007
and if you choose to do that,

101
00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:00.006
you don't necessarily have to use Docker.

102
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.007
I'm going to use Docker again because it's easier

103
00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.007
but if you're doing the full install,

104
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:07.000
it kind of removes some of the needs of Docker,

105
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.001
but you're going to be on your own

106
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.000
as far as running the database,

107
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.002
if you install the full thing locally

108
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.008
and want to do so.

109
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:16.000
We're not going to use PSQ all lot,

110
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.003
but we will use it a few times.

111
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:21.003
So it's important to make sure you've got it running.

112
00:04:21.003 --> 00:04:24.001
Now there is OS-specific documentation

113
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.006
at the link on your screen,

114
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:27.008
on how to install Postgres

115
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:29.001
and a search of the web

116
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:30.009
will show you everything you need to know

117
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.009
about just getting the client library on your machine.

118
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.009
One side note,

119
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.005
many IDEs including IntelliJ ultimate edition,

120
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:41.006
have a built in editor

121
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.009
that allows you to use the driver

122
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.002
and actually allow you to execute SQL statements

123
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:47.003
on your machine.

124
00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:48.002
If you want to go that route

125
00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:49.002
it's super easy

126
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:51.003
and then you don't have any downloads,

127
00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:52.005
but again, you're going to be on your own

128
00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:54.001
if you choose to do that,

129
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.000
but if I were you,

130
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.004
that's actually the way I would go,

131
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.003
because it's simple and easy,

132
00:04:58.003 --> 00:04:59.008
especially if you're using an IDE

133
00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:02.000
like IntelliJ or Eclipse

134
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.005
or NetBeans that have those libraries built in,

135
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.005
but that's all you need

136
00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.002
and we're ready to get started

137
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:10.000
with a little bit of JDBC code.
