Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.090
In this lesson we will learn how to highlight the link in our header navigation that corresponds with

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.020
the section of the page that the visitor has currently scrolled to.

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.400
Just so we're on the same page.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510
Here's a bit of footage of the finished product.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.960
All right.

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.810
So now we know what our goal is.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.190
Let's get started and make it happen.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.930
So what should our first step be.

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.500
Where should we begin.

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.800
Well within our each TMI all we need to create some sort of a relationship between each section of the

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.670
page and its matching header link.

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.310
Let's jump over to our text editor and OPEN UP OUR each TMF file and I'll show you what I mean.

14
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.630
So within app let's open up index start each GMO and within this file let's look for this our beginning

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:01.520
link in the header so if we scroll down just a bit here is the NAV element that lives in the header.

16
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.330
And here is the our beginning link.

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.650
Let's go ahead and give this link element a unique I.D..

18
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.550
So after this a ref value what's out of space and say I d equals and we could name this anything we'd

19
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.980
like but let's just call it our beginning link.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.530
All right.

21
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.940
Next within our HDMI file let's find the actual our beginning section of the page.

22
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.170
So in our HDMI file if we scroll down a bit

23
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.090
here we see the our beginning page section div.

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.360
And we need a way to relate this div to the header link that we just gave an I.D. to.

25
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.470
So here's what we can do.

26
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.420
Check this out.

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.050
We can give this element a custom attribute custom attributes.

28
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.550
Begin with the word data and then a dash.

29
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.080
But then from here we can choose any custom name we want.

30
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.580
Why don't we call this data matching link.

31
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.000
All right.

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.440
And what should the value be.

33
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.200
Well why don't we just provide a CSX like selector that points back to the link that we just gave an

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.140
I.D. to so we know that we can use the pound sign to select an element that has an I.D..

35
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.600
And then we just type in the I.D. So it was our beginning link.

36
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.140
All right.

37
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.780
So now that we've spelled out this relationship we just need to use javascript so that when this section

38
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.380
of the page gets scrolled to.

39
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.760
So when this area gets scrolled to we use this divs custom attribute and we give that target element

40
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.750
a modifier CSX class that makes it yellow but before we write that JavaScript let's first go ahead and

41
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.270
create a relationship for the remaining two sections of the page so features and testimonials.

42
00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.730
So back in our HMO if we scroll back up to the header navigation here is the features link.

43
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:11.950
Let's give it an I.D. of features link and let's give the testimonials link an idea of testimonials

44
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.240
link.

45
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.610
All right.

46
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.620
Next let's find the actual features section of our hmo.

47
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.660
So the div that houses this content and we will give it a custom attribute that points back to this

48
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.850
link.

49
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.470
So in our HMO Let's scroll down to find our features section.

50
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.070
Here it is let's give it a custom attribute.

51
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:48.240
So data matching link and let's just set the value to pound sign and then features link.

52
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.600
All right.

53
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.520
Let's scroll down to find the testimonial section.

54
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.860
Here it is.

55
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.910
Let's give this div a custom attribute.

56
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:08.440
So data matching link and let's set the value to point back to the header link so pound sign testimonials

57
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.880
link.

58
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.360
All right.

59
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.760
Now at this point we are ready to begin writing the javascript that will actually make something happen.

60
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:25.460
So let's save this file and then jump in to app assets scripts modules sticky header.

61
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.120
All right.

62
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.090
Let's write some javascript.

63
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.700
So the first thing we should do within our constructor.
