00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.290
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.290
In this lesson we will learn how to smoothly animate or transform one icon shape into another.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
In this instance we will be focusing on our top right menu icon.

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.400
Let's review what we currently have at the moment.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.750
Our menu icon is simply a square and our goal for this lesson is to UCSF to turn it into the three bars

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.950
hamburger menu icon and once it's tapped.

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.250
We want to turn that shape into an X to indicate that it can be clicked again to close the menu.

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.770
All right.

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.690
So now that we know what we want to do let's go ahead and get started.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.070
So the first thing that we should do is remove the background color from this icon element so that it

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.300
no longer looks like a solid square.

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.490
So let's jump into our text editor and within our styles modules folder let's open up site header dot

13
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.990
CSX.

14
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.200
If we scroll down this file a little bit further than halfway we will find the rule for our menu icon

15
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.050
element and let's just go ahead and remove this background color line.

16
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.600
Now if we save this and check things out in the browser even though we can no longer see that top right

17
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.060
icon it still exists.

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.360
We can still tap on it and it still works.

19
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.370
So now our next step is to simply add those three horizontal bars within the currently empty menu icon

20
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.140
div.

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.130
So in order to do that let's actually jump into our h t AML file indexed on each GMO and let's scroll

22
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.690
down a bit.

23
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.490
We are looking for the menu icon div.

24
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.510
Here it is.

25
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.840
And in between the opening and closing tags let's drop down to a new line and let's create a new div

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:57.660
that has a class of site header underscore underscore a menu icon underscore underscore top.

27
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810
Be sure to close out that div.

28
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.570
So our hamburger menu icon should have three horizontal bars and this element will be the top bar in

29
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.730
order to create the middle and bottom bars.

30
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.310
Let's just copy and paste this div.

31
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:20.460
So let's paste it and change this name to middle and what's pasted in again and change this to bottom.

32
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.800
Let's go ahead and save this and then begin writing the CSF to turn these into the three horizontal

33
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.070
bars.

34
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.140
So back in our site header CSX file within our menu icon rule right before this media query.

35
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.890
Let's create a new line and let's use the ampersand symbol so we don't have to type this out again.

36
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.010
And then we can simply say underscore underscore top.

37
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.400
All right.

38
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.790
So how are we going to create the first horizontal bar.

39
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.940
Well let's use position absolute and say that the top bar should sit in the very top left corner.

40
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.540
And let's say that this bar should have a width of 20 pixels.

41
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.840
Since we know that's how wide the menu icon parent div is let's give the top bar a height of three pixels

42
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.970
and let's give it a background color of white.

43
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.580
Let's go ahead and save this and check things out in the browser.

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.120
Perfect.

45
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.920
So there is our top bar.

46
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.520
Now we just need to do the same thing for the middle and bottom bars.

47
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.060
So back in our CSX let's just copy and paste this top bar copy paste it back in and let's change its

48
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.740
name to middle.

49
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.080
And instead of saying that it should be positioned in the very top corner of its parent div let's say

50
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.120
that it should set eight pixels down from the top.

51
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.230
Let's see how that looks in the browser.

52
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.920
Looks good.

53
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.780
Let's create the bottom bar.

54
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.550
We still have this rule in our clipboard so down below the middle rule.

55
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.650
Let's just pasted in again.

56
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.660
Let's change the name to bottom and instead of saying that it should sit at the very top so top zero.

57
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.320
Let's change this to bottom zero.

58
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.310
So it'll set at the very bottom.

59
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.510
Let's check it out in the browser so there is our bottom bar.

60
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.960
But if I zoom in and we look really closely it looks like the gap between the middle and bottom bar

61
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.160
is like one pixel larger than the gap between the top and middle bar.

62
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.060
So to fix that let's just move the bottom bar up a pixel.

63
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:31.070
So to do that back in our CSX let's actually scroll up to our main menu icon parent element and let's

64
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.510
change its height from twenty pixels to 19 pixels.

65
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.960
Let's check this out in the browser.

66
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.830
And I know it's subtle but I think that looks a lot better.

67
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.120
So at this point our hamburger menu icon is complete.

68
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.850
But before we begin working on transforming it into an X when it gets tapped on.

69
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.260
First I want to show you a way that we can clean up our HD CML a bit.

70
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.350
So back in our text editor let's jump into our index start each TMI file.

71
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.340
Now currently we have these three empty divs to create the three horizontal bars.

72
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.460
But what if I told you we could create that same exact visual effect using only one empty div instead

73
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.440
of three.

74
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.290
So check this out.

75
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.370
Let's delete this top bar and let's also delete the bottom bar.

76
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.300
Let's leave the middle bar intact and let's go ahead and save this.

77
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.230
And then let's jump back into our CSX and this code that was targeting the top div.

78
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.980
Let's change it selector to an ampersand which will use its parent selector and then we can say colon

79
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.880
colon before.

80
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.190
This will create a pseudo element that we can style to look just like the top bar in order to make sure

81
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.030
that this pseudo element appears we can just say content and just include an empty pair of quotes.

82
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.160
So if we go ahead and save this and check out the browser we have a top and middle bar.

83
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.230
So now we just need to perform that same pseudo content trick for the bottom bar.

84
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.980
So if we scroll down a bit here is the bottom rule.

85
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:16.200
Let's just change this selector to an ampersand colon colon after then let's be sure to say content

86
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.520
a pair of empty quotes.

87
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.420
Let's save this.

88
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.710
And now we have the exact same visual effect but we saved a few bytes in our HDMI out.

89
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.550
Now at this point we are ready to begin transforming this icon into an x.

90
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.360
Once it's tapped on to do this let's edit our javascript for the mobile menu module and let's set things

91
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.690
up so that when this icon is clicked we add a new modifier class to it and then we can simply target

92
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.760
that modifier class with our CSX.

93
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.340
So over in our text editor let's open up the relevant JavaScript file.

94
00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.740
It lives in app assets Scripps modules and its name is mobile menu.

95
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.040
Now on this line we can see that we've already saved the menu icon DOM element to this property named

96
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.000
menu icon.

97
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.920
So down within our toggle the menu method let's just add a new line of code that targets the icon element.

98
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:22.850
So this dot menu icon dot class list dot toggle.

99
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.590
And let's give it a modifier.

100
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:32.120
Class of site header underscore underscore menu icon dash dash.

101
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.800
And let's call this close x.

102
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.550
Let's save this file and then jump back into our site header CSX file.

103
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.010
Let's find our menu icon rule and let's find the very bottom of this rule

104
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.120
so down here is where that menu icon rule ends.

105
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.290
Let's create a brand new rule.

106
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.950
Let's start with ampersand which will give us site header and then we can say underscore underscore

107
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:09.660
menu icon and then target that modifier dash dash close x.

108
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.830
And now within this rule we can simply target each of the three horizontal bars and modify them.

109
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.080
However we need to in order to create the x.

110
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.470
Let's begin by targeting the top horizontal bar so we can select it by saying Ampersand colon colon

111
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.320
before.

112
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:33.090
Let's actually look at the browser really quickly and ask ourselves what do we need to do to the top

113
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.480
bar in order to make this look like an x.

114
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:44.150
Well we would want to rotate the top bar clockwise about 45 degrees so that it's diagonal.

115
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:54.690
So over in our CSX let's say transform let's use the rotate function and we want to rotate it 45 degrees

116
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.010
clockwise.

117
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.280
Let's save this and see how it looks.

118
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.200
So when we click on the icon.

119
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.580
Well that's not exactly what we had in mind.

120
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:10.020
So the top bar now is sitting diagonally but it's positioned very oddly and this is because it's transformed

121
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.530
origin or if you think about it as its pivot point is currently set to its center meaning the center

122
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.400
of this top line is still exactly where it was before the rotation.

123
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.610
That's not what we want.

124
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.450
We want the top left corner of this bar to stay exactly where it is.

125
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.370
So we want the top left corner to be the pivot point.

126
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:37.800
So let's jump back to our CSX and let's scroll up a bit to find the base find style for that top bar.

127
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.880
Here it is.

128
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.230
And let's add a property named transform or origin.

129
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:49.770
Now by default web browsers will use a transform origin of 50 percent 50 percent meaning the horizontal

130
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.070
center of the element and the vertical center of the element.

131
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:59.120
So if we want to set the very top left corner to be the transform origin we can just say zero 0.

132
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.700
Let's save this and check it out in the browser.

133
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.170
So now when we click the icon the top bar is positioned correctly.

134
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.310
But once it's turned diagonally we need to make it a bit longer so that it can reach the very bottom

135
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.390
right corner.

136
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:18.780
So back in our CSX Let's scroll down to find our close X modifier rule.

137
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.570
And within this same transform line we can add another function the scale function.

138
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:31.460
And if one is the elements natural size we can increase its size by saying maybe one point two five.

139
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.050
However we don't want to increase the top bars width and height.

140
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.290
We only want to increase its width.

141
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.180
So instead of scale we can actually use scale x.

142
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.100
Let's go ahead and save this and check out the browser and the difference is subtle but now the top

143
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.380
bar reaches the bottom right corner.

144
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.640
All right.

145
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.460
So our top bar is complete.

146
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.130
Next let's focus on our bottom bar in order to create an X shape.

147
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:03.870
We just need to rotate the bottom bar counterclockwise 45 degrees so that it's diagonal as well.

148
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:09.120
So back in our C Ss within this close X parent rule.

149
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.040
Let's create a new rule that targets the bottom bar Ampersand colon colon after.

150
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:23.470
And really we can just copy and paste this line pasted in here the only difference is that instead of

151
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:29.770
wanting to rotate 45 degrees clockwise we want to rotate counterclockwise so we can just say negative

152
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.580
forty five.

153
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.110
Let's save this.

154
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.380
We see that the bottom bar is now diagonal but its positioning is way off and that's because of its

155
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.110
transform origin or its pivot point.

156
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:47.680
So back in our C Ss just like we did for the top bar let's scroll up to find the baseline rule for the

157
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.650
bottom bar.

158
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.570
Here it is and let's add trans form origin.

159
00:11:53.890 --> 00:12:00.550
And in this case we actually want the bottom left corner of the element to be the transform origin so

160
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.770
to specify the bottom left corner.

161
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.800
We can say zero to point towards the left corner and then we can say 100 percent to point towards the

162
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.250
very vertical bottom.

163
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.090
Let's save this and check it out.

164
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.540
Looks good but if we zoom in and look really closely to my eye it looks like the bottom bar that is

165
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:25.320
now pointing towards the top right is sitting maybe just one pixel up too high.

166
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.800
So I'd like to push it down just a single pixel so to do that within our CSF.

167
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:38.080
Let's scroll back down to our close X modifier rule and while we are adjusting the bottom bar let's

168
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:45.280
just add on another function named translate Y which allows us to adjust the y coordinate or vertical

169
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.150
positioning for an element and let's just say one pixel.

170
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:54.760
Let's save this and check out the browser and I know it's a tiny detail but that looks a lot better

171
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.500
to me.

172
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:02.800
So at this point we have our X. Now we just need to hide the middle bar so within our C Ss within our

173
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.970
close X modifier rule let's create a new rule that targets the middle bar and in this instance we are

174
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:16.090
not going to begin with an ampersand because that would use this selector as our base and our middle

175
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.240
bar does not have close X in its name.

176
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.020
So what we can do instead is just use a good old fashioned nested rule.

177
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:30.340
So a dot to look for a class name and then we can just manually type out site header underscore underscore

178
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:36.960
menu icon underscore underscore middle and when we are trying to create the X shape.

179
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.170
Let's hide the middle bar by setting its opacity to zero.

180
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.530
Let's save this and check out the browser and we now have an X icon.

181
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.340
If we tap it again it turns back into the three bar hamburger icon.

182
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.050
However we don't want to just abruptly switch between these two icons.

183
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.900
We want the shapes in the icons to animate and gradually transform and transition into the other shape

184
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.580
and to make that happen.

185
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.980
All we need to do is go into our CSX scroll up a bit to find the baseline styles

186
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.260
so within our original menu icon rule.

187
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.020
Here is the code for the top bar.

188
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:24.300
Let's just give it a new property of transition and say that it should gradually transition its transform

189
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.110
property over the course of 300 milliseconds.

190
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.360
And let's use an easy out transition style.

191
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.270
Let's save this.

192
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.740
And check out the browser.

193
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.050
So now when we click on the icon we see that at least the top bar is animating.

194
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:44.550
So now we just need to apply the transition property to the other two bars to the top bar has been taken

195
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.450
care of on the middle bar.

196
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:54.060
We want to transition not the transform property but the opacity property over the course of three hundred

197
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.560
milliseconds.

198
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:05.700
Let's use the easy out transition style and for the bottom bar we want to transition to transform property.

199
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.160
Point three seconds is out.

200
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.530
Let's see how this looks.

201
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.930
That looks excellent.

202
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.130
But I think we could make it look even better if when it transitions from the three bars into the x.

203
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.930
If the middle bar instead of just fading away with opacity.

204
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:28.940
If it also shrunk from its full width down to zero width this effect that I have in mind might be hard

205
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.500
to describe in words.

206
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.490
But let me just write a bit of CSF so you can see it in action.

207
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:41.270
So back in our text editor if we scroll down a bit to the close X modifier rules within the code for

208
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:48.700
the middle bar let's say transform and we want to shrink down its width from 100 percent down to zero

209
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.790
down to nothing.

210
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.590
So let's say scale x 0.

211
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.110
All right.

212
00:15:54.140 --> 00:16:00.380
And then if we scroll back up to the baseline rule for the middle bar let's change the transition line

213
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:06.850
so that instead of only transitioning the opacity property it transitions all properties.

214
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.090
Let's save this and see what it looks like.

215
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.690
Now it's a very subtle effect.

216
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.770
So let me replay that a few times.

217
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.090
So watch the middle bar.

218
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.870
So instead of just fading away with opacity it's also shrinking away.

219
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.570
Now I think we can improve this even further because currently it's transform.

220
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.070
Origin is its center so you can see that it's shrinking in from both the left and the right.

221
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.810
And I think it would look better if it only shrank in from the right so that it was treating its left

222
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.250
corner as the pivot point.

223
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:44.170
So back in our code within this baseline rule for the middle bar let's set the transform origin to be

224
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.450
horizontally zero.

225
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.980
So that's the left edge and vertically.

226
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.870
Let's say 50 percent which is the perfect center.

227
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.590
So let's save this.

228
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.870
And now when we click the icon this is exactly what I had in mind.

229
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:04.180
The middle bar not only fades away with opacity but it also shrinks or retracts it into the left edge.

230
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.460
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

231
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:12.150
And at this point our mobile menu is complete now in our next lesson.

232
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.180
We will be changing gears a bit.

233
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:20.650
We will work on the our features section of the site and we will set things up so that these four feature

234
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:27.490
items are hidden originally and only when you scroll down just far enough so that they would begin to

235
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.730
become visible.

236
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.710
Only then will we fade them into view.

237
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.230
We will use a nice combination of JavaScript and CSX to make that happen.

238
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.710
It should be a lot of fun.

239
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.380
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
