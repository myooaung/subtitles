00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,850
In this video we will talk about job interviews.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,570
This video has two main components to it.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,140
First we'll learn how to get more interviews and then secondly once you've gotten the interview we'll

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,040
learn how to interview well.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,810
Now I've personally been on both sides of developer job interviews the applicant side and the hiring

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,520
side.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,620
So I'm going to share my top tips.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,310
These are things that worked for me when I was job hunting and these are also things that I was looking

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,390
for an applicants when I was on the hiring side.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,440
So without further ado let's dive right in and let's learn how to get more interviews.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,390
My first tip is to consider working remotely.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,550
This will allow you to simply cast a wider net.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,990
This tip may seem obvious but believe it or not I see a lot of people who are job hunting who make the

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,490
mistake of only looking for jobs in their local area.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,380
This isn't 1950.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,960
You're a developer you work on a computer you can work from anywhere you are throwing away countless

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,600
amazing opportunities.

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,950
If you refuse to work remotely.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,740
Now if you happen to live somewhere where there is a wealth of local opportunities that's fantastic.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,510
But if you live somewhere where there isn't as much going on locally you really need to ask yourself

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,540
would you rather work for a disappointing local company or a thriving fun supportive company that just

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,570
happens to be across the country.

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,300
To me the choice is obvious.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,900
Working remotely is an attractive option.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,250
Now you might be wondering where to look to find remote jobs.

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,820
Well Web sites change over time so I won't mention any specific site names in this video.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,950
But in the text discussion for this video I'll include a few links to the top remote developer job board

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,200
sites.

30
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:59,350
My next tip is don't limit yourself to officially listed openings only sometimes you can create an opening.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,770
So if you see a company that you like and you honestly think that you would bring value to their team

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,400
reach out to them.

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,390
A lot of companies are always on the lookout for talented new team members and many will have a career

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,570
page on their company Web site that says they are accepting applicants even though they haven't necessarily

35
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,060
posted any openings on official job board sites.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,060
So the point is don't wait for an opening.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,670
Sometimes you can create an opening.

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:33,570
My next tip can be referred to as call their bluff meaning you need to be able to tell when a job description

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,890
is lying.

40
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,600
Now when I say lying here's what I'm referring to.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,630
Sometimes a job posting will include a description of who they're looking for and they will basically

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,110
describe a non-human genius alien with superpowers that knows everything about everything.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,060
Well I'm here to tell you that that person doesn't exist.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,060
So we need to call their bluff.

45
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,910
So even if you don't have everything that the job description mentioned as long as you have the majority

46
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,240
of the things they list I want you to go ahead and apply.

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,290
So for an example a lot of companies will mentioned that they're looking for a full stack developer.

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,600
Now while some of these companies are indeed actually looking for a senior level well-rounded developer

49
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,750
who can do it all a lot of companies use that phrase full stack developer pretty lightly.

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,790
They might not actually be looking for a full blown genius phenomenon.

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,710
They might just be looking for someone who is at least familiar with several different aspects of development.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,060
So trust your gut you know you'll have a general feeling of whether you're qualified or not for the

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,650
job.

54
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,360
But I would say to try and error on the side of overestimating yourself instead of underestimating yourself.

55
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,900
Don't let the job descriptions intimidate you.

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,440
Basically don't pre reject yourself.

57
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,930
It never hurts to try.

58
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:56,340
The great Michael Scott once quoted the great Wayne Gretzky and said You miss 100 percent of the shots

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,410
that you don't take.

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,320
So in your gut if you think you even got a small chance I want you to apply.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,500
My next tip is to customize your message for each job that you apply to.

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,900
When I say your message I'm referring to your cover letter or the email you send or the little text

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,690
box message that the job site lets you include.

64
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,150
Notice I'm not saying I want you to completely rewrite the message for each job but just make minor

65
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,990
adjustments to it.

66
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,210
So after you read a job description and you research the company even just for three to five minutes

67
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,610
you'll get a feel for what specific qualities and experiences they're looking for and you'll get a feel

68
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,860
for what traits they value in people.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,720
And I want you to highlight those skills experiences and traits in your message.

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,970
Now I don't want you to lie or make stuff up.

71
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,340
I want you to be honest but think about how you align with what they've said they're looking for.

72
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,470
So for example if a company mentions a certain piece of software they use and you have experience with

73
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,530
that software mention that in your message.

74
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:01,200
Basically I just don't want you to copy and paste a generic cookie cutter cover letter and use it for

75
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,880
every single application.

76
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,810
Don't do that.

77
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,330
It only takes a couple of minutes to customize your message for each job.

78
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,700
My next tip is to keep that message relatively short but not so short that you don't look interested.

79
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,250
This is about finding that happy middle ground so no one wants to read a novel but you do want to write

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,070
enough that you wet their appetite.

81
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,600
So as a general guideline I'd say begin with a sentence where you introduce yourself and then no more

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,670
than one medium length paragraph where you talk about your experience and your strengths.

83
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,010
After that no more than one or two sentences about why you like the sound of their company and why you

84
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,370
think you'd be valuable and that's it.

85
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,060
Anything longer than that and you run the risk of sounding self-important or like you're compensating

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,010
for something.

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,260
So basically keep your message short and sweet.

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,510
My next tip is to create a personal website for yourself that you can linked to in your job applications.

89
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,540
There's no excuse for you to not do this.

90
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Now that you know how to use GitHub pages for free and even if you don't have a portfolio of real world

91
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,190
projects to show off that's OK.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,630
Just create a site that simply has a paragraph about yourself.

93
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,720
Maybe a photo and a list of things you're interested in.

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,340
Why is this so important.

95
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,690
Because your website is a chance for the company to see your code to see that you understand best practices.

96
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:28,070
The website itself the HMO CSX the javascript that is your portfolio they can check it out.

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,180
They can ask themselves Is it responsive.

98
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,510
Is it mobile first.

99
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,830
Does it load quickly.

100
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,000
Does this applicant stay current.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,990
I know this tip sounds super obvious but you'd be surprised how many applicants I've seen that don't

102
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,010
have a Web site.

103
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,030
So again don't worry so much about your personal site's content.

104
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,790
The content only needs to be one step above law met some dummy content but just treat your site as a

105
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,950
design exercise as a coding exercise to show people what you can do.

106
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,320
My next tip is don't use bootstrap on your personal site.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,760
Now I'm not saying that bootstrap is bad and I'm not saying that it's never the right tool for a job.

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,290
I'm just saying don't use it on your personal site.

109
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,710
It would be like if someone was applying to be the lead chef for a five star restaurant and in their

110
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,230
resume.

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,280
They said that they make dinners from boxed Rice mixes and they make desserts from boxed cake mixes

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,490
using Bootstrap makes you look like the opposite of an artisan craftsman who takes pride in building

113
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,430
Web sites bootstrap makes you look like you just wanted to finish the site in the most economical rushed

114
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,710
way possible.

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,010
So again this is an antique bootstrap propaganda.

116
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,910
I'm not saying it's not the right tool for certain jobs but I am saying for your personal site it's

117
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,050
a no no.

118
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,220
And here's my final tip for getting more interviews.

119
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,380
Find a way to demonstrate that you stay current.

120
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,620
There are a ton of different ways to do this.

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,790
On Twitter you can tweet about new things that you're learning or start a blog and post about what you're

122
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,650
excited to learn next.

123
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,160
Or even just mentioned new technologies that you're interested in on your Web site.

124
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,100
I know that Staying current is important in any industry but in ours it's even more important because

125
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,120
technology moves so quickly you immediately become an applicant that is at least worth considering.

126
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,570
If you can present yourself as someone who makes an effort to stay current.

127
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,700
All right now let's change gears let's say that you've landed an interview and now you want to be sure

128
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,040
to interview well.

129
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,830
So here are a few tips.

130
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,440
Tip number one is that it's OK to be nervous if you're nervous or stressed out about an interview.

131
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,220
That just means that you're human.

132
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,080
The interviewers know that everyone gets nervous and they aren't going to judge you for it.

133
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:45,150
Also even though you think you might look super nervous it probably isn't as bad as you think it is.

134
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,050
As far as they can tell you probably seem at least relatively calm.

135
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,470
My next tip is to prime yourself before the interview.

136
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,750
Again it's normal to be nervous or stressed out but you don't want to be so nervous that it robs you

137
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,130
of your personality.

138
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,690
So try to prime yourself before the interview to be in a somewhat playful mood.

139
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,650
Watch a few videos that make you laugh or listen to your favorite music.

140
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,280
You want to do something that keeps you grounded in your personality.

141
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,470
That way you can own your nervousness instead of it owning you.

142
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,920
My next tip is to remember that an interview is a two way street and this might help you feel less nervous.

143
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,930
So an interview isn't just you trying to convince them to hire you don't feel like all of the pressure

144
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,030
is on you.

145
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,340
You are also finding out if you like them they are in the hot seat to you are finding out if you would

146
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,030
even want to work for them.

147
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,360
So don't mentally give away all of your power before you go into an interview.

148
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,930
Don't think of it as a meeting where you need to convince someone that you're good enough you are good

149
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,630
enough.

150
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,110
Just think of it as a meeting where you want to see if you can be friends.

151
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,270
So what would you do in a social situation.

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,540
Well you'd want to give off a positive vibe.

153
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,580
You'd want to be kind.

154
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,000
You want to be humble.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,620
You want to speak confidently about the things you're good at and that interest you try to approach

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,640
it like that.

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,180
My next tip is don't try to make yourself seems super intelligent.

158
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,680
It's more important that you seem likeable.

159
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,540
The best way for me to describe this tip is to just share one of my own personal experiences.

160
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,250
So we were interviewing applicants for a mid-level developer position and we ran into a candidate who

161
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,590
is the smartest most talented developer by far.

162
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,960
It wasn't even close.

163
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,190
He was a genius.

164
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,160
But during the entire interview he didn't laugh even once he barely smiled and he didn't say anything

165
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,030
positive about anyone or anything other than himself.

166
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,760
Now again even though he was the most skilled person we interviewed by far he just wasn't likeable.

167
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,620
And because of that we did not pursue him as a candidate.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,040
So smile laugh.

169
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,910
Employers want positive likeable people someone who is positive instantly seems like someone with leadership

170
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,900
potential.

171
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,240
So in a nutshell being likeable is more important than being super intelligent.

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,600
My next tip is to try and convey enthusiasm in this industry things change super quickly.

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,330
So the best developers are the ones that love what they do because this leads to them spending the time

174
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,600
to stay current.

175
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,850
You don't want to seem like this is quote just a job to you.

176
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,070
You want to seem passionate you've got to remember that we have the luxury of working in an area that

177
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,880
we are interested in that engages us that challenges us in a good way.

178
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,690
Millions of people would love to be mentally stimulated by their work the way that developers are.

179
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:41,290
So be thankful for the field you're in and let that gratitude and enthusiasm come across in your interview.

180
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,020
My next tip is don't be afraid to present yourself as a specialist.

181
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know something.

182
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,190
So for me it's a turnoff.

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,020
When an applicant tries to act like they know everything about everything because I know they're lying.

184
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,510
If someone really was that proficient at that many different things they wouldn't even need the job

185
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,860
that they're applying for.

186
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,150
They would have already invented the next Facebook.

187
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,020
So I'm much more impressed when an applicant presents themselves in a realistic light.

188
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,340
They talk about the things they're strong at and they also open up and maybe be a little bit vulnerable

189
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,730
and talk about the things that they are still working on improving.

190
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,470
My next tip is that even though you don't need to know everything about everything.

191
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,870
Building up your vocabulary as much as possible is always a good idea.

192
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,120
You want to familiarize yourself with as many different technologies as possible.

193
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,140
Notice I'm not saying you need to learn as many technologies as possible just become familiar with them.

194
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,970
Just being able to use a technology word in a sentence correctly and talk about how what you do know

195
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,590
interfaces with the technology in question shows that you're a valuable candidate.

196
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:54,190
So for example maybe you don't know how to use Mongo D.B. in javascript to save data to a database but

197
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,670
just knowing that Mongo D.B. is a database system is helpful.

198
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,900
So basically you don't need to know everything but building up your tech vocabulary certainly helps.

199
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,930
And my final tips interview well is to prepare a custom question beforehand.

200
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,030
What I mean by this is that most interviewers will ask you if you have any questions for them.

201
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,740
You want to have at least one question preferably multiple questions that show you are picturing yourself

202
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,670
working there.

203
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,520
Your questions show that you are genuinely interested and engaged and can imagine yourself in the job

204
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,830
in a perfect world we would be able to think of a question on the fly about something in the interview

205
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,230
but thinking on your feet like that can be tricky.

206
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,810
So why don't you come into the interview with a semi canned question in your pocket now don't have a

207
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,130
completely generic cookie cutter question that you ask in every interview.

208
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,100
Instead research the employer before the interview check out their Web site and their social media and

209
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,120
create a question about something you saw that interests you that way.

210
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,110
If you can think on your feet and come up with the perfect question in the heat of the moment great.

211
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,740
But if you can't you know that you have a solid question in your back pocket all right before we bring

212
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,410
this video to a close.

213
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,770
I've saved the most important big picture tip for last and that is that most likely the biggest challenge

214
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:20,710
you'll run into during your job search is running out of patience because finding the right developer

215
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,540
job can take a surprising amount of time.

216
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,960
I know personally the last time I was job hunting it took me longer than I thought it would and I have

217
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,960
a close friend who even with a degree in computer science from a good school still took longer than

218
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,590
you might think to land the job that he wanted.

219
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,860
So don't be so hard on yourself.

220
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,120
This doesn't happen overnight for anyone you might think it's taking you quote too long to find a job

221
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,290
that there's something wrong with you that you aren't good enough and that's why you haven't found a

222
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,290
job yet.

223
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,250
Stop.

224
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,170
It's normal to have those thoughts.

225
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,650
If you're having those thoughts it just means you're human.

226
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,470
But deep down you know those thoughts are not true.

227
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,160
You are more than good enough.

228
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,990
You know it.

229
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,010
I know it.

230
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,070
I know it because you've made it through my five million hours of rambling in this course and that alone

231
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,330
proves that you're driven you have ambition and that you're going to get what you want.

232
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,230
The only problem is that you've ran out of patience.

233
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,380
You think the job search is taking too long.

234
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,730
And so now your mind is trying to punish and attack you.

235
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,640
So let me try and help you strengthen your patience.

236
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,650
First of all know that it's normal for a job search to take what feels like an eternity.

237
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,950
Secondly maybe none of the jobs you've interviewed for so far were the right one for you so personally

238
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:41,030
during my last job hunt I had met with several companies and just didn't click with any of the people.

239
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,450
So obviously I didn't get the jobs and started to bring me down.

240
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,890
When you have multiple interviews in a row where you don't get the job it's normal human behavior to

241
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,870
feel discouraged but then I had an interview with a company that I had a good feeling about.

242
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,190
The interviewer was friendly and someone that I immediately gelled with the job needed a certain skillset

243
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,630
that I was strong in so my weaknesses weren't a big deal.

244
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,910
And by the end of the interview I was convinced that this would be a really good fit and I really wanted

245
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,730
the job.

246
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,240
And it made me stop and think that I was glad the previous few companies had passed on me.

247
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,180
I stopped feeling bad about those rejections because if any of those companies had hired me I wouldn't

248
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,310
have ever interviewed with this amazing company and the amazing company would actually go on to hire

249
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,220
me and it would become the best job that I ever had.

250
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,730
So long story short the job search can take a lot longer than you thought it would.

251
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,650
And you've got to stay patient.

252
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,580
I don't want you to let anyone including yourself tell you that you can't get the job that you want.

253
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,250
You know fully well that there are things you are downright amazing at and you would add so much value

254
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,250
to so many teams out there.

255
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,990
You can contribute to a project through get you right clean HDMI all super organized CSX modular object

256
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,790
oriented javascript.

257
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,080
You're a beast.

258
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:07,460
You understand what no JSA is and how to leverage NPM and build tools like web pack and babble.

259
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,170
I am not exaggerating when I say that there are tons and tons and tons of companies out there looking

260
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,150
for the exact skill set that you now possess.

261
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:22,230
All you need to do is keep your patients stay positive and sooner or later you will walk into an amazing

262
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,270
opportunity.

263
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,650
If you need to come back in a month or two and re listen to this last part of the video to remind yourself

264
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,130
what a catch you are go for it.

265
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,280
I'll be here waiting.

266
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,120
That's going to bring this video to a close in our next lesson.

267
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,640
We'll look at next steps you can take and we'll talk about career progression should be interesting.

268
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,350
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
