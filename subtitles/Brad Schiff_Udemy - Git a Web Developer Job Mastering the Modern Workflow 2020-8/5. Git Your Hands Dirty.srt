1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,870
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,840
In this lesson on gift you will finally get your hands dirty.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,190
This is the lesson where I want you to start following along step by step on your computer.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,120
We are going to do a few things in this lesson.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,910
Number one I will help you make sure that gate is installed on your computer.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,400
Number two I will help you find the command line on your computer.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,130
Yes I do actually want you to use the command line.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,860
That program that reminds you of computers from the 80s using the command line will give you a stronger

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,270
understanding of how it works.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,400
A lot of jobs will expect or even require you to use get from the command line and a lot of the other

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,180
technologies that we will be learning about in this course.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,120
Things like node NPM web pack all of these things use the command line as well.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,170
Now there's nothing to be afraid of the command line is way less intimidating than it might seem at

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,230
first.

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,510
And we are going to get our feet wet and walk through things step by step together.

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,790
And number three we will try out a few get commands together.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,750
All right let's get started.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,810
Now this process of installing get and finding the command line is a bit different depending on whether

19
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,250
you are using a Windows based computer or if you're using a Mac.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,580
Either way this lesson has got you covered.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,730
Let's begin with the Windows side of things and then we'll hop over onto the Mac side.

22
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,630
If you are using a Mac you don't need to download anything so please ignore the following windows instructions.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:47,710
So if you are running Windows open up a web browser and head over to get dash SVM dot com.

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,790
If you perform a Google search for simply get this should be the first result.

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,620
Here's what the Web site looks like and what you want to do is come down to this teal colored computer

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,640
and there will be a download button.

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,510
Now I'm on a Mac so it says downloads for Mac but on your computer it should say download for windows

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,470
or something similar to that.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,530
Go ahead and begin the download.

30
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,260
And when it finishes open the installer file from here it's very self-explanatory so you can pause this

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,510
video right now and just click next.

32
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,190
Next Next through the installer all of the default options are a ok.

33
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,990
Once the installation is complete come back to this video and on posit OK.

34
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,180
Welcome back.

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,800
I will assume that if you're watching this part of the video you've installed get the next step is to

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,510
click onto your start menu or wherever your full list of programs is.

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,920
And look forget but more importantly I want you to look for the program named get bash.

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,090
This is the command line that I want you to use throughout this course.

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,780
So whenever you hear me say command line I want you to think get bash the Get Back program.

40
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,780
So right now go ahead and open the gate bash.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,670
And once you've done that pat yourself on the back you have installed it and you have found a working

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,640
command line for all of you Windows users you can now skip ahead a bit in this video because right now

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,950
we are going to take a look at the Mac side of things.

44
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,990
OK so on your Mac you are looking for an application named Terminal One of the simplest ways to find

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,380
this app is to go in the top right corner of your screen and click the magnifying glass and then start

46
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,830
typing the word terminal.

47
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,720
Go ahead and hit enter or return and there's your command line.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,140
Now your terminal might not look exactly like my terminal visually but rest assured you've got all of

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,980
the functionality that you need.

50
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,830
If you do want to customize the color scheme and appearance of your terminal check out the description

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,690
for this lesson I will include a link to a guide on that but let's not worry about appearances right

52
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,430
now.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,260
Instead let's focus on making sure that gate is installed on your Mac.

54
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,190
There's a very good chance that it is already installed and to make sure.

55
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,770
Just type in this command at your command line.

56
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:17,470
Get dash dash version and hit enter as long as you see something along the lines of Get version to dot.

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,290
No no you are in business you're good to go.

58
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,980
If instead you get a response of command not found or Unknown command that means that gate is not installed

59
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,940
and you'll just want to go to the get dash SC and dot com Web site and just like we did for Windows

60
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,120
earlier you want to download gate for Mac.

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,210
So go ahead and pause this video if you need to install get on your Mac and then come back and resume

62
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,250
the video once you're good to go.

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,640
All right.

64
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:53,670
So at this point in the lesson now everyone watching whether you are on a Windows computer or a Mac

65
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,660
has get installed and you have opened the command line.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,020
This means we are all on the same page.

67
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,300
We are all on even footing.

68
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,860
So now we can walk through a few get steps together.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,780
All right let's begin by personalizing a few of your guest settings when get tracks your changes.

70
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,020
It also tracks who is making those changes.

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,800
So we want to let get know about your name and your e-mail.

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,080
So type this in.

73
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:33,210
Get config dash dash global user dot name and then quotes and you would type in your name but I'll type

74
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,650
in my name.

75
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:41,740
Hit enter next we want to do the exact same thing but with our email address instead of our name.

76
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,440
So the command is very similar.

77
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:54,080
Get config dash dash global user dot email and then just type in your email address your email address

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,510
dot com but you'd put in yours.

79
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,030
Hit enter.

80
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,790
All right.

81
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,170
So now your copy of get is all set up and ready to go.

82
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,010
Now we can have get actually do something.

83
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,950
So the first thing I want you to do is create a new folder on your computer somewhere.

84
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,760
Can be anywhere can be on your desktop or folder of your choosing.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,840
But I want you to name this new folder something generic like projects or sites once you've created

86
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,860
a new folder.

87
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:31,780
Our next step is to navigate to that folder from within the command line the command line is always

88
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,490
working in or pointing towards a directory or folder on your computer.

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,370
And we can change where your command line is pointing very freely.

90
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:47,560
We can see where the command line is currently pointing towards by typing P WD this means print the

91
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,950
working directory.

92
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,450
So it looks like my command line is currently pointing towards the user's Brad directory.

93
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,230
But I want it to be pointing towards this new sites folder we just created.

94
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07,150
So what I'm going to do is type C D this stands for change directory and then I enter the space and

95
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,450
instead of trying to type out the location for this folder what you can do is actually just drag the

96
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:19,070
folder that you just created a moment ago on top of your command line.

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,760
I will hit enter and now I can try P WD again to print the current working directory.

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,960
You don't have to run P.W. D I do it just to make sure I'm in the right place which I am.

99
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,250
All right.

100
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,630
So once you've navigated your command line to the folder that you created just a moment ago we want

101
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,860
to create another folder for a particular imaginary project.

102
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:51,190
Now we can create a folder from the command line by typing M.K. Diaw stands for make directory space

103
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,550
quotes and then I'm going to title this new project.

104
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,250
Hello dash world hit enter.

105
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,690
OK so all that did is within the folder we created a moment ago it created a new folder named hello

106
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,620
world.

107
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,420
Let's begin.

108
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,100
An imaginary get repository within this hello world folder.

109
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,180
So first we want to navigate in to the hello world folder.

110
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,540
So to do that.

111
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,520
Seeds for change directory.

112
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,720
And then hello world.

113
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,530
Or another way of navigating to that hello world folder it would be the type C.D. space.

114
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,280
And then do what we did earlier which is just drag that hello world folder onto your command body.

115
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,610
So that's the same exact thing.

116
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,370
Now here is the moment of truth.

117
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,040
Here is what we've all been waiting for.

118
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,660
Let's tell get to begin tracking.

119
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:47,990
Anything that happens within this hello world folder or in other words let's create a brand new repository.

120
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:56,350
All we do once we've navigated to the folder that we like typing get in it stands for get initialize

121
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,450
hit enter.

122
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,810
And you've just created your first repo.

123
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,740
Let's test it out.

124
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,650
Let's make sure that it's tracking changes.

125
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,800
So let's create a super simple each TMM file.

126
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,070
We can actually create new empty files from the command line by typing touch and then the name of the

127
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,240
file that we want to create.

128
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,440
So let's try.

129
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Touch index start each T.A. hit enter.

130
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,610
If we navigate to Hello world there it is.

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,260
So go ahead and open this new file with your favorite text editor.

132
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,090
We don't really need anything in this file but just to prove a point I will create an H1 and say hello

133
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,530
world.

134
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,840
Go ahead and hit save.

135
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,790
Now back in the command line if we type get status get tells us that I've made two changes to the folder.

136
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,550
This is a system file on Mac and we will learn in the future how to tell get to ignore that completely.

137
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,460
But we see that the only other file that's changed is the index that each team mail file that we just

138
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,420
created.

139
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,630
So we want to add this to the staging area so that we can commit it.

140
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,690
So I will type get add and then the name of the file that I want to add to the staging area.

141
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,900
So get add index that each team so we can try to get status again to see how things are looking changes

142
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,950
to be committed.

143
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,580
Yes.

144
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,290
This is the only thing that I want to commit.

145
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,420
So this staging area looks good.

146
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:35,020
So I will type get commit I will include a message my first commit hit enter and congratulations you

147
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,710
just made your first commit to a repo.

148
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,630
Now let's really drive home the point of why that's cool.

149
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,330
Which is because now no matter what happens to your files you can always revert to the way that files

150
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,390
were when you just made this comment.

151
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,750
So for example maybe your cat walks on your laptop and hit save.

152
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,170
Or maybe that file simply gets deleted entirely.

153
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,860
Now all we need to do to restore our files back to that comet or back to the last comment would be to

154
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,210
type.

155
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:12,580
Get check out dash dash space and then a period hit enter and that's all that it takes to restore the

156
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,080
files back to the way they were when we made our commit to index that each team ls back.

157
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,430
And it's without that line of cat gibberish at the bottom.

158
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,630
Excellent.

159
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,700
Okay now this lesson is almost complete but there's one small fun section at the very end here.

160
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,190
But before we get to it I want to recap what we've learned so far.

161
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,360
So far we've installed get on our computer.

162
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,530
We've opened the command line.

163
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,510
We learned how to navigate to a particular folder and create a brand new repo.

164
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:49,780
And we made our first commit now really quickly I want to point out that we created a brand new repo

165
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,130
from scratch.

166
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,950
And while that can be useful I think more often than not what you'll do instead is you'll want to clone

167
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,260
an existing repo from a server to your hard drive.

168
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:07,000
So for example let's imagine that you and I are co-workers and I've been working on a Web site and I

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,350
want you to help me so the website already exists so you wouldn't create a brand new repo.

170
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,930
Instead you would want to take the existing repo that already exists on a server somewhere and clone

171
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,310
it or copy it to your computer.

172
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,560
And that is exactly what we are going to do in this last section of the lesson.

173
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,820
It's super simple.

174
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:35,680
So back in the command line I want you to navigate to not the hello world folder but to the main sites

175
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,220
or projects folder that you created in the beginning of this lesson.

176
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:47,710
So I will take CDE space and then I will drag this site's folder onto my command line hit enter and

177
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,700
now we can pull down an existing repo with one command.

178
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
We just type get clone.

179
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:04,720
And then here's an address that you can type in H TTP s colon forward slash forward slash get hub dot

180
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:17,920
com forward slash learn web code forward slash welcome dash to dash get dot get hit enter

181
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,200
and now if you look within the sites or projects folder that you created in the beginning of the lesson

182
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,300
you will see a new folder named welcome to get you just clone this from the server.

183
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:38,950
So go ahead and try to open up the index dot h t AML file in your browser to do that you can just drag

184
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,760
this file on top of an open Chrome or Firefox or Internet Explorer or Safari window.

185
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,930
There will be a friendly surprise waiting for you and that's where this lesson will come to a close

186
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,010
in our next lesson.

187
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,700
I will help you create a free github account and we will get started on the real meat and potatoes of

188
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,730
this course we will begin building the mobile first Web site together and you will be able to commit

189
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,230
and push your progress at the end of every lesson up to your own personal GitHub repo.

190
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,310
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

191
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,570
This is where things really start to take off.

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,550
I will see you in the next lesson.
