00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.540
In this lesson we will continue to build out the travel Web site in particular.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.660
We will focus on styling the testimonial section.

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.090
Let's dive right in and get started.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.790
So here we are in the browser.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.850
In this lesson we are going to transform this testimonials section into what we see in the design file

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.890
which is this now before we write even one line of new code.

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.670
Let's go ahead and jump to the command line and create a new get branch for this testimonial section.

9
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:48.930
We can create a new branch and check it out or switch to it in one move by typing get check out dash

10
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.760
be for branch and then the name of the branch that we want to create.

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.840
Let's name it testimonials.

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.030
Perfect.

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.020
And let's jump back to the design file.

14
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.380
Let's begin by finding this content in our hmo.

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.100
So over in our text editor within the HMO file we can find that content by searching for real testimonials

16
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030
real testimonials.

17
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.430
All right.

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.920
So here is that heading.

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.630
I think the first thing we should work on is adding in this bit of vertical spacing at the top of the

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.740
section.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.000
So in our HMO we already have this div surrounding all of the testimonials content.

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.600
Why don't we go ahead and give this a class that we created.

23
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.940
Many many lessons ago page section.

24
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.380
All right.

25
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.830
So that created the vertical spacing at the top of the section.

26
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.830
If we take a look at our design file I think the next thing we should do is add in this background image.

27
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.760
So within our HMO let's add a modifier class to the main testimonials parent div.

28
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.560
So page section dash dash to indicate a modifier class and let's call this modifier testimonials.

29
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.750
Save that.

30
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.680
Now let's go ahead and open up our page section CSX file to create that modifier rule.

31
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.170
So within app assets styles modules.

32
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.630
Here is the page section CSX file underneath this blue modifier class.

33
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.950
Let's create a new rule testimonials.

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.310
And let's go ahead and apply this background image.

35
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.140
So in our CSX let's just say background we want to use a U.R.L. that points towards an image.

36
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.130
Let's go to the root directory that is being served up and then go into the assets folder and then the

37
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.360
images folder and grab the testimonials dash BGP dot JPEG file.

38
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.140
Let's tell this image to be aligned towards the top of the section and horizontally.

39
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.780
It should be aligned in the center.

40
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.870
Let's also tell the image that it should not repeat or tile.

41
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.480
It should only display once.

42
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.210
And let's add another property named background size that will shrink or stretch the image to always

43
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.010
be large or small enough to perfectly cover the containing div.

44
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.700
So let's go ahead and save this and check out the browser looks good.

45
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.670
Next let's adjust the testimonial content so that it doesn't use the full browser window width but instead

46
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.150
only uses the middle twelve hundred pixels of the screen so we remember that in earlier lessons we created

47
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.780
a reusable block named wrapper that will do just that for us.

48
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.440
So over in our HD CML within the testimonials div let's just create a new div with a class of wrapper

49
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.250
and then let's cut and paste all of the testimonial content into that wrapper div.

50
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:07.290
So let's cut this pasted into the new wrapper div save this and check out the browser perfect next.

51
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.150
Let's go ahead and style this title headline.

52
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.950
If we check out the design file this headline style looks very familiar to me.

53
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:23.480
And it's because it is identical to the section title we set up for the outer features area except that

54
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.170
now the text is blue instead of white.

55
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.730
So let's go ahead and reuse the section titled block that we created so here the testimonials headline.

56
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.900
Let's go ahead and leverage the block that we created a few lessons ago.

57
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.100
So section title

58
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:54.550
all right now let's go ahead and move this icon into that heading level to so let's cut that pasted

59
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.000
in right here.

60
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.730
And if we look at the design file it looks like the word testimonials should be bold so let's wrap that

61
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.320
word in a strong tag

62
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.350
and I just remembered that back when we used this section title block in the our feature section we

63
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.920
actually gave the image element a class so that we can position it differently for small screens and

64
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.360
we gave it a class of section title underscore underscore icon

65
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.390
next.

66
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.560
Let's make this heading.

67
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.350
Text blue instead of dark gray.

68
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:42.350
So in our H2 demo let's go ahead and give that heading level to a modifier class of section title dash

69
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:53.780
dash blue and then let's open the section title CSX file and create a blue modifier class and we can

70
00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.360
simply assign the color of our main blue variable perfect next.

71
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.060
Let's adjust the vertical positioning of this icon.

72
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.360
I feel like we can do a better job of aligning it with the text.

73
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.400
If we moved it down a few pixels so back within our section titled CSX file.

74
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:26.060
Here is the icon rule within this media query mix in let's say position relative top eight pixels.

75
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.440
So this will push the icon down eight pixels.

76
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.170
So let's save that.

77
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.280
I think that positioning looks better.

78
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.990
And if we check out the design file once again I think the next thing we should work on is creating

79
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.680
this three column layout so within our each team how underneath the heading level two that we were just

80
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.310
working on.

81
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.430
Let's create a new div that has a class of row.

82
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.480
So we know that we want three columns.

83
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:05.110
So let's create a div with a class of row underscore underscore medium for if we think in terms of a

84
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.230
12 column grid one third of 12 is four.

85
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:18.450
And we want three equal width columns and we only want these columns to exist for screens that are considered

86
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.670
at least medium or larger.

87
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.200
We want to maintain a single column stacked view on small screens.

88
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.220
So this is one call them let's go ahead and copy and paste this.

89
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.790
So there are three of them.

90
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.300
And then let's go ahead and begin cutting and pasting each section of testimonial content into column.

91
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.890
So this first group that consists of an image two headings in a paragraph.

92
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.060
Let's cut that pasted into this first column scroll down again.

93
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:56.980
Let's cut this next group and pasted into the next column and finally let's cut this final group and

94
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.990
paste it into this column and be sure to remove these extra empty lines

95
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.500
so that gives us a three column layout.

96
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.160
Next we want to set things up so there is a margin or gutter in between the columns.

97
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:26.400
So in our H2 GMO within the container row class we can give it a modifier of road dash dash gutters.

98
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:26.950
All right.

99
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:33.610
So at this point if we compare this with the design file I think we are ready to begin creating a reusable

100
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:39.610
block named testimonial that will be responsible for creating this styling.

101
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.000
So let's adjust our HDMI out.

102
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.950
So this first bit of content uses a new testimonial block.

103
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.820
And once we have things looking good then we can apply that block to the other two testimonials as well.

104
00:08:52.630 --> 00:09:01.060
So over in our H GMO within our first column let's go ahead and create a new div and give it a class

105
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.670
of test.

106
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:13.360
So let's close that div and go ahead and indent this content and let's create a brand new CSX file to

107
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.910
go along with this new testimonial class name.

108
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:26.640
So within our modules CSX folder let's create a new file let's name it underscore testimonial dot CSX

109
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:37.890
create a class testimonial and before we forget let's go into our main styles dot CSX file and import

110
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.690
this new file.

111
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.390
So import modules underscore testimonial.

112
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.700
Let's save that and jump back into the new testimonial CSX file.

113
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:55.500
So I think the first thing we should do in this file is give the testimonial block a background color.

114
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.050
So if we check the design file if you look closely you can see that this is not a solid white background

115
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.660
color but it's actually transparent.

116
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.290
You can see a bit of the background image shining through.

117
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.910
So in our CSX instead of just saying background color solid white let's not use a hexadecimal color

118
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.840
code like that.

119
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.760
Let's use an be a color.

120
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:26.340
RG B.A. stands for red green blue and then the A's for Alpha transparency.

121
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.910
So to create the color white we max out the red green and blue.

122
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.900
So two fifty five for the red green and blue values.

123
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:42.660
And then if we want the White to be halfway transparent or halfway C through we can just do point five.

124
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.220
That's a bit too transparent.

125
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.980
Let's raise that two point seven.

126
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.630
I think we can raise that even a bit more to point A.

127
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.890
That looks good.

128
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.090
Next let's give this testimonial block a bit of padding.

129
00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.760
So the content doesn't sit up against the very edges.

130
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.490
So if we check the design file let's measure how much padding we should use.

131
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.370
This looks like about twenty nine pixels to me.

132
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.570
So to put that into Rams twenty nine divided by sixteen let's copy that value to our clipboard let's

133
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.260
say padding.

134
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.900
We don't need any on the top.

135
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.750
Let's paste in that amount for the right padding.

136
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.950
Let's give it just one pixel of bottom padding.

137
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.480
I'll explain why in just a moment.

138
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:37.970
And for the left padding Let's paste in that value again and save room now even though we only gave

139
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:44.240
this element one pixel of bottom padding we clearly see more than one pixel of space here.

140
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.600
This is because the bottom margin on this paragraph can create space for us.

141
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.040
But if the containing element doesn't have any bottom padding.

142
00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.940
So let's set this to zero the paragraph still has bottom margin but it leaks outside of it's containing

143
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.010
element.

144
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:09.160
So by giving the container element just even one single pixel of bottom padding it gives the bottom

145
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.770
margin of this content something to push up against next.

146
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.810
Let's begin styling the actual content of the testimonial.

147
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.010
So let's start at the top and work our way down.

148
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.360
So we will begin with the image.

149
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.370
First things first.

150
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.980
Let's go into our HDMI out and give that image a class that we can target with CSX.

151
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.510
So here is that image.

152
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.780
Instead of giving the image itself a class I think I will wrap the image in its own div.

153
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:44.940
So let's give it a class of testimonial underscore underscore photo.

154
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:51.600
Let's close out that div and be sure to indent the image so let's create a new rule that targets that

155
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.980
class underscore underscore photo.

156
00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.630
If we check the design file I think the first thing we should work on is making the image appear to

157
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.370
be a circle instead of a square.

158
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:10.000
So back in our CSX we can create rounded corners by using a property named border radius.

159
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:17.620
So if I say border radius 30 pixels we don't see any change because the image is allowed to protrude

160
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:25.760
outside the edges of the containing div but if we tell this photo div to set it's overflow to be hidden

161
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.090
we see that these corners are rounded by 30 pixels.

162
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.580
Now the reason we don't see those rounded edges on the right side is because that containing div is

163
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.420
using the full available width.

164
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.060
So it's right side corners actually are rounded.

165
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.280
There just isn't any content for us to see the difference.

166
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.700
So we can give the illusion of the image being a circle.

167
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:57.930
If we tell the containing div to have exactly the same width and height that the image has we can find

168
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:05.180
out the exact size of this image by right clicking on it and click open image in new tab and then if

169
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:11.720
you hover your mouse over that tab you can see that it says at the end 160 by 160.

170
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.010
So let's do this.

171
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:18.600
Let's tell this div to have a width of one hundred and sixty pixels and a height of one hundred and

172
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:26.170
sixty pixels so now we can see the rounded edges on all four corners and now all we need to do to create

173
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:32.420
a circle is increase the border radius to be exactly half of the width or length of the image.

174
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.820
Right.

175
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:38.200
So if this rounded corner extended all the way to here and it was like that on all four sides that would

176
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.500
be a circle.

177
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:45.790
So let's increase the border radius from 30 to half of 160 which is 80

178
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.810
Perfect.

179
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.210
Next let's center this image horizontally.

180
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.250
To do that we can use margin let's use for shorthand.

181
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.280
So top zero.

182
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.740
Right.

183
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.890
Auto bottom zero left auto

184
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.570
looks good.

185
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.460
I used full shorthand because we are probably going to want to customize the bottom margin in just a

186
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.190
moment.

187
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.630
Next if we compare what we have in the browser to our design file it looks like we need to position

188
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.870
the image so that the top half violates the top edge of the containing element.

189
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:32.860
To do that we can use position relative so within our CSX let's say position relative.

190
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:39.070
So if we want the top half of the image to violate the edge we need to pull the image up half of its

191
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.520
height which would obviously be 80 pixels.

192
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.600
So let's say negative 80 pixels.

193
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:46.990
All right.

194
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:51.420
So that gave us the desired positioning in terms of violating the top edge.

195
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:57.550
But when you use position relative the surrounding content is not aware of the change meaning this content

196
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:04.180
doesn't know to move up 80 pixels as far as this content is concerned the image is still sitting where

197
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:04.900
it used to sit.

198
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:13.400
So we can counteract that by simply giving the image a bit of negative bottom margin so since we pulled

199
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:21.530
the image up 80 pixels using position relative let's just give it a bottom margin of negative 80 pixels

200
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.840
perfect next.

201
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.560
It looked like in the design file that the image is supposed to have a border.

202
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.800
So if you look really closely that looks like about a six pixel thick border to me.

203
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:42.130
So within our CSX let's go ahead and give this div a 6 pixel border that is solid and what color should

204
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.240
the border be.

205
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.760
Let's just use these same transparent white color that the container element is using for a background

206
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.720
color.

207
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.510
So let's copy that to our clipboard and then pasted it down here looks good.

208
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.960
Next let's work on the styling for these two headings.

209
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:05.770
Let's jump over to our HDMI out and give those headings classes so we can target them.

210
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:14.170
So let's give the first a class of testimonial underscore underscore title and for the next heading

211
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.190
first.

212
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.660
Let's change it to be an H for instead of an h three.

213
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:24.010
So that way from a semantics perspective we are indicating that this headline is more important than

214
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.050
this one.

215
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:32.400
And then let's give this a class of testimonial underscore underscore subtitle.

216
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.130
All right let's save this and jump back into our testimonial CSX file.

217
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.280
Let's create a new rule that targets the title element.

218
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.390
So if we check out the design file that heading should be blue and it should be center aligned.

219
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:55.710
So let's say color main blue text align center looks good.

220
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.420
Next let's adjust the font size.

221
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:04.260
So in the design file that heading looks like about twenty four pixels tall.

222
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.560
So in terms of RAM twenty four divided by 16 is one and a half.

223
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:16.830
So let's say font size one point five RAM and let's also lower the font weight a bit let's say font

224
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.760
weight 500 looks good.

225
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.880
I'm noticing that there's too much vertical spacing though above and below this heading.

226
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.710
So let's give it margins zero

227
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.360
much better.

228
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.240
Next let's focus on the styling for this heading.

229
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:44.140
So let's create a new rule in our CSF file underscore underscore subtitled We know that it should be

230
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.640
orange.

231
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:50.080
So color main orange it should also be center aligned horizontally.

232
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.640
So text align center you definitely don't want it to be too bold.

233
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.000
So let's give it a font weight of 400.

234
00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:06.740
And in terms of font size if we check out the design file that looks like about 15 pixels to me.

235
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:16.450
So in terms of RAM 15 divided by 16 gives us this let's copy that to the clipboard pasted in say RAM.

236
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.520
That looks good but it has too much top margin.

237
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:26.140
If we check out the design file these two headings should be fairly close together so let's give it

238
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:32.710
a margin of only a quarter ram on top and one ram on the bottom.

239
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.090
See how that looks looks good.

240
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:42.730
And that will actually bring Part 1 of this three part lesson to a close in part two we will finish

241
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:48.990
styling the testimonials section and we will also make sure that it looks good on smaller screens.

242
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.450
Let's keep rolling along and I will see you in part two.
