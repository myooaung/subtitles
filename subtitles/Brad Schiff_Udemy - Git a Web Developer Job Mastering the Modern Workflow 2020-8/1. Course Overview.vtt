00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.390
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.600
Welcome to the course was this course all about well you'll begin this course as someone who already

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.350
understands at least the very basics of each Temple and CSX and by the end of the course you will have

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.470
transformed into a rock solid developer that companies are looking to hire.

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.420
How do I know what companies are looking for because as a senior developer I've been on the hiring side

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.550
of developer job interviews and I noticed that a lot of times we'd be interviewing great people who

7
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.950
were very talented but they just didn't have the knowledge we were looking for.

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.560
So we had to pass on them at some point I thought to myself that it would be nice if there was a course

9
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.750
that taught the exact skill set.

10
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.870
We were looking for.

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680
I couldn't find such a course.

12
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.610
So I built this one.

13
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.190
So in this course we are going to build a Web site together from beginning to end and we'll even push

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.280
it live up onto the Web.

15
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.600
Don't worry that part won't cost you a penny.

16
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.170
And once your site is live you can share the link with anyone on the planet.

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.300
Now even though we'll build the site together and have a really nice finished product.

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.300
This course is really more about the journey than the destination because along the way we'll learn

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.100
how to use all of the tools that make up the modern developer's workflow.

20
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.260
Now there are a ton of different tools and it can be tricky to understand how all of the puzzle pieces

21
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.530
fit together.

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.240
So my job is to walk through the jungle of tools and best practices with you step by step concept by

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.460
concept.

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.330
Now we will get into the course outline in just a moment but first I want to address my teaching style.

25
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.320
I tried to explain why we're doing something because I know that personally when I'm trying to learn

26
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.170
something new Nothing frustrates me more than when the instructor technically shows me how to complete

27
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.130
a task.

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.440
But by the end of the lesson I still have no idea why I even needed to complete the task in the first

29
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.520
place.

30
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.290
I don't like it when instructors assume that you already know why you're doing something.

31
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.700
And they basically just want to read a series of instructions to you.

32
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.820
In my opinion that isn't teaching.

33
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.660
That's one step above reading microwave popcorn instructions to people and calling yourself a teacher

34
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.670
anyways.

35
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.140
That's not the way I learn.

36
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210
So that's not the way I teach.

37
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.110
I try to explain why we're doing what we're doing.

38
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.720
All right now let's move on.

39
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.440
Let's talk about the outline for the course.

40
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.180
So what exactly are we going to do and learn.

41
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.320
Well there are seven main topics or sections and here they are.

42
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.020
The first section is about guilt.

43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.880
Now we have an entire lesson dedicated to the question of what is good.

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.690
So for now.

45
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.820
Long story short.

46
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.500
Guilt is what allows us to collaborate with other developers and keep track of how our files change

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.520
over time.

48
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.740
In this section we'll learn Git itself.

49
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.810
And also a popular service named GitHub.

50
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.640
Also in this section we will face our fears of the command line.

51
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.170
We'll learn that the command line is not scary.

52
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.040
If you have a friend walk you through things step by step in the next section of the course we will

53
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.420
learn about node j s.

54
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.880
Now again we have an entire lesson that answers the question what is node.

55
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.570
But basically we'll use node to turn our computer into our own personal assistant robot that performs

56
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.580
all sorts of tasks for us automatically.

57
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.640
And this will free us up to spend our time on more important developer tasks.

58
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.460
In this section we'll also learn about something named NPM which is like a grocery store filled with

59
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.010
code where we can grab any ingredients we need for our site in one centralized place.

60
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.410
Also in this section we'll learn about something named Webb pack which is the tool that will make turning

61
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.690
our computer into our personal little robot assistant much much easier than coding things from scratch.

62
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.850
The next section of the Course is all about CSX.

63
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.360
We will write every single line of CSX for our site together so that way you can see my thought process.

64
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.380
Now you might be thinking Hey I already know CSX and I'm sure you do but companies don't just want developers

65
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.480
who can create a three column layout.

66
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.720
They also want someone who can keep their CSX highly organized even on larger more complex projects.

67
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.860
So in this section we'll learn how to stay really organized and write recyclable CSX by learning about

68
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.590
a philosophy named bam.

69
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.630
The next section of the Course is about mobile first design and performance.

70
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.970
Performance means making our site load as quickly as possible for our visitors.

71
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.250
Now again we have an entire lesson answering the question what is mobile first.

72
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.340
But in a nutshell mobile first is all about making sure that users don't download any more data than

73
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.900
they need to in order for the site to run on their particular device.

74
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.300
So for example a smartphone visitor shouldn't have to download a huge image that suited for a 30 inch

75
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.710
desktop monitor.

76
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.470
Also in the name of reducing how much data visitors need to download we'll learn about lazy loading

77
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.530
our images so images only get loaded in once a user scrolls down to them and it goes without saying

78
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.360
that in this section we'll learn about responsive web design from a mobile first perspective.

79
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.170
The next section of our course is all about JavaScript and this is probably the section of the course

80
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.050
that you will be most excited about because javascript is the single most valuable skill in terms of

81
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.990
what employers are looking for right now in this section we'll learn about the very basics of object

82
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.650
oriented programming.

83
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.180
We'll learn about the module pattern which lets us break up our code into modular super well organized

84
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.050
chunks and we'll also learn how to use popular tools like babble and web pack babble will let us write

85
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:04.330
ultramodern iOS 6 flavor javascript and Westpac will let us use NPM packages in our front end code in

86
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.930
the next section of our course.

87
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.000
We will push our site live up onto the Web.

88
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.320
We will use a free service that github offers so you won't need to sign up for any new web hosting or

89
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.200
anything.

90
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.280
Also we will use the popular net in the fire service and see how easy it is to get started with cloud

91
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.720
or NWS lambda functions and in the final section of our course we will talk about job interviews and

92
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.050
career progression.

93
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.910
So first we'll learn how to get more job interviews and then how to do well in those interviews.

94
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.400
After that we'll talk about next steps.

95
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.520
Things you can learn after this course.

96
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.940
If you want to level up your skills even further.

97
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.460
And finally we'll talk about career progression.

98
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.060
We'll learn how to continually move forward and avoid career burnout or stagnation.

99
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.950
And there you have it.

100
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.680
A complete outline of the course and it's a big course.

101
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.810
I'm well aware but I really believe the reward for completing it will be equally big.

102
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.760
I know that if I was interviewing someone who had the skill set that we were going to learn here I would

103
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.260
give management the green light to hire them.

104
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.920
Now I know there are a lot of topics being covered here and it might seem intimidating but I promise

105
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:22.750
we are going to move at a pace where we can focus on one thing at a time and give it our full attention.

106
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.740
We will take the time to build a genuine understanding of each topic before moving on to the next.

107
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.520
And this will keep us from feeling overwhelmed.

108
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.340
It's actually going to be a lot of fun to see how all of these puzzle pieces fit together.

109
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.890
I would love to have you come along on this journey with me.

110
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.910
So if you're ready to begin your transformation let's dive right in.
