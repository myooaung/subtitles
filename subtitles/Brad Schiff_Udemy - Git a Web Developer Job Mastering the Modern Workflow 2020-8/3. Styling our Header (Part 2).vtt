00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.420
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.310
In part two of this lesson we will continue to style our sites header.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.890
Let's pick up right where we left off and part one and get back to the action now that we have this

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.450
transparent blue bar of the header sitting on top of the large hero block this large hero content no

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.300
longer looks like it's perfectly vertically centered.

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.270
I think we can remedy this by simply adding a bit of top padding to this large hero block content.

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.450
The question is how much top padding should we add.

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.240
Well this transparent blue bar is taking up about 60 pixels.

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.780
So why don't we just add 60 pixels of top padding to this content.

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.780
So over in our CSX let's open up the large hero block.

11
00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:02.740
And within this text content rule let's add a new line that says padding top 60 pixels.

12
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.460
That looks a lot better to me.

13
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.530
So why don't we go ahead and change gears let's begin optimizing the header for small screens.

14
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.120
So here's how the header would look on a mobile device.

15
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.650
We definitely have a bit of work to do.

16
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
Now the designer on our team did not send a mobile design file.

17
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.810
This means that it's up to us as the developer to flex our design muscles a bit and make smart design

18
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.970
decisions for mobile users.

19
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.670
So my first thought is that for small screens we probably don't need to show the navigation links and

20
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.730
get in touch button right away for small screens we can probably hide this content until the user taps

21
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.950
a menu icon.

22
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.290
So for small screens that would really only leave the company logo and I think we should probably shrink

23
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.810
that logo a bit for smaller screens.

24
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.750
Also if the logo is the only content in the header we probably don't need the transparent blue background

25
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.990
for small screens either we can fade the background back in once a user taps the mobile menu icon.

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.190
So let's go ahead and begin making those changes.

27
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.560
Let's start by removing the transparent blue background.

28
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.590
That background is being applied to the site header element.

29
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
So we want to jump into our site header CSX file.

30
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.980
Here is the background color line.

31
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.920
Now we do want this to be applied for larger screens.

32
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.100
So what I'm going to do is cut this into my clipboard and then create a mix in media query.

33
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.530
Let's say once the screen is large enough to be considered medium then we do want that background colors

34
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.930
of paste it back in perfect.

35
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.280
Next let's hide the navigation links and get in touch button for small screens.

36
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:52.550
So let's jump into our HDMI now and instead of hiding the button and the navigation separately for small

37
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.640
screens why don't we just wrap both of these pieces of content in a new wrapper div.

38
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.120
So I'm going to cut this to my clipboard and then let's create a brand new div and give it a class of

39
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.400
site header underscore underscore menu content.

40
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.310
Let's close out that div tag and then within this new div Let's paste in that content.

41
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.900
Let's save this.

42
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.580
And then back in site header CSX we can scroll down to the bottom and create a new rule.

43
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.220
Let's select that new menu content div let's make it hidden by default.

44
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.080
So display none.

45
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.530
But once a screen is considered at least medium so at medium we can tell it to be visible display block

46
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.850
perfect next.

47
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.650
I think we should adjust the company logo so that it is horizontally centered for small screens.

48
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.620
So let's jump to our CSX towards the top of our site header file.

49
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.760
Here is the rule for the logo.

50
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.120
Why don't we just go ahead and say left 50 percent now by itself.

51
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.490
That will push the logo too far to the right.

52
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.740
But then all we need to do to get it perfectly centered is pull it back to the left half of its own

53
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.860
width so we can do that by saying transform translate X negative 50 percent

54
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.030
all right.

55
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.500
Now it's perfectly centered but we don't want it to be horizontally centered on larger screens.

56
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.910
So what we can do within this logo rule is create a media query so mixed in at medium.

57
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:51.030
And we basically just want to undo these two properties so we can say left auto and transform translate

58
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.830
x zero so the company logo is back to its original positioning on larger screens.

59
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.820
And it's still centered for small screens.

60
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.470
However the size of this dark blue logo area does not work for a small screen.

61
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.030
So why don't we adjust things so that for small screens there's a bit less padding around the logo image

62
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.650
to do that back in our text editor within our logo rule.

63
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.690
Let's just duplicate this padding line so that it also lives in the media query.

64
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.110
So just select this line copied into your clipboard and then within our app medium media query just

65
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.290
paste that in.

66
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.470
Now for the media query for medium screens and larger we can leave these numbers when referring to the

67
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.360
padding numbers.

68
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.620
These can stay the same.

69
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.710
But for our baseline styles for small screens let's reduce this.

70
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.860
So instead of 25 let's put this to maybe 13 instead of 36.

71
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.940
Let's try.

72
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.380
Twenty nine.

73
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.040
Let's give that save.

74
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.100
I think our next step should be to add in a mobile menu icon.

75
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.690
Right about here that users can tap in order to reveal these navigation links and then get in touch

76
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.590
button.

77
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:12.220
So in order to add in a mobile menu icon here let's jump to our each demo and right before our site

78
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:21.400
header menu content div let's add a few new lines and create a new div that has a class of site header

79
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.070
underscore underscore menu icon.

80
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.700
Be sure to close out the div and we can actually leave this div empty.

81
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.110
Let's save this file and then go create a rule for this new class.

82
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.730
So over in our site header CSX file.

83
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.330
Let's scroll down to the very bottom right before this menu content rule.

84
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.530
Let's add a few new lines and create a new rule for menu icon.

85
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.900
Let's begin by simply creating a white square that's positioned right about here so we can say with

86
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.660
20 pixels height 20 pixels.

87
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.710
Let's give it a background color of white.

88
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.470
And then in order to position it perfectly in the top right corner we can say position absolute.

89
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.030
It should sit down from the very top 10 pixels.

90
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:20.430
And it should sit in from the very far right 10 pixels so there we see it on mobile.

91
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.080
However we do not want this icon to exist on larger screens.

92
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:34.770
So what we can do within this menu icon rule is include a media query so we can say app mix in at medium.

93
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.390
Let's just go ahead and hide the icon completely.

94
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.060
So display none.

95
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.030
So now larger screens won't see the icon at all but it still exists for smaller screens.

96
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.750
Now we don't actually want this to be just a white square.

97
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.440
Instead we want it to be the famous three horizontal bars icon that practically every menu in the world

98
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.170
uses in the post-production for this lesson.

99
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.410
I will overlay an example of the icon I'm referring to.

100
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.470
Now don't worry we will set up that icon style in a future lesson.

101
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.940
And when we do we will build the icon styles in such a way that when a user taps on it it will smoothly

102
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.560
transform and fade from the three bars icon into an X.

103
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.580
And when the user taps the X the menu will be hit and once again.

104
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.160
Now the reason we will set this up in a future lesson instead of right now in this lesson is because

105
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:33.250
in order to respond to events like that like a tap or a click and subsequently modify the page in some

106
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:39.760
way we will need to write code in another language aside from each TMM and CSX.

107
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.030
We will need to leverage javascript and it just so happens that in our very next lesson we will begin

108
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.830
a new chapter in the course.

109
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.140
We will begin our dive into javascript and we won't write just any old sloppy javascript.

110
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.810
We will learn how to write super organized modular javascript.

111
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:04.310
We will write the kind of javascript that will impress your peers and potential employers alike.

112
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.880
I know what I'm about to say has already been said about 30 times in the course but this time I truly

113
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.570
mean it.

114
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:16.540
This upcoming section should be a lot of fun because in my mind that moment when something in your brain

115
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:23.050
clicks and the chaos that was once javascript is replaced with something that feels organized.

116
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.740
That is the moment when a professional web developer is born.

117
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.120
And that is the moment that we are going to create for you in the next section.

118
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.600
In case you couldn't already tell this is probably going to be my favorite section in the course.

119
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.620
I think we are going to learn a lot.

120
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.160
So let's keep rolling.

121
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.360
Let's keep our forward momentum and I will see you in the next lesson.
