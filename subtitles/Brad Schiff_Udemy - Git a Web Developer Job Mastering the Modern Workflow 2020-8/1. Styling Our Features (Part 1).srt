00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,030
In this lesson we will resume styling our travel Web site to be specific.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,270
We will work on the our features section.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,940
Let's dive right in and get started.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,780
So here we are in the browser.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:28,320
If we scroll down a bit in this lesson we want to transform this our features section into what we see

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,730
in the design file which is this.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,330
All right.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,190
So the first thing that I want to work on is the main title to this section.

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,590
So this element which is supposed to look like this.

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,560
Let's begin by finding this element in our H2 PML.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,390
So over in the text editor let's open up the HDMI file.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,170
We can find that element by searching for our features.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
Here it is.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,360
And I actually want to create a brand new block for this element.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,060
So let's go ahead and give this a class of section title.

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,450
All right let's save this file.

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,960
And now let's create a new CSX module file for this new class.

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,890
So within app assets styles and within the modules folder.

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,750
Let's go ahead and create a new file.

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:32,620
Let's name this new file underscore section dash title dot CSX.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:32,900
All right.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,150
And let's create a new class section titled save this file.

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,770
And before we free it let's open up our main styles dot CSX file and import this new file.

25
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:53,900
So import modules underscore section title save this file and let's jump back to our brand new section

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,610
title file.

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,050
All right.

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,820
So what CSX Should we write.

29
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,060
Well if we compare this to the design file the first thing that I notice is that we need a much larger

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,760
font size.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,960
So if I measure from the top of these letters down to where a letter has a dissenter like the letter

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,580
Q or why would be.

33
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,500
That looks like about 60 pixels tall.

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,980
We want that in RAM.

35
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,730
So sixty divided by 16.

36
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,990
Three and three quarters let's copy that to our clipboard.

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,050
Font Size pasted in Ren.

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,020
That looks better.

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,400
I also noticed in the design file that the entire title should not be bold.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,410
Only the word features should be bold.

41
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:48,400
So let's lower the font weight a bit font weight 300 and then within our HMO let's wrap the word features

42
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,240
in a strong tag.

43
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,610
It looks to me like there's not enough difference between not bold and bold.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,130
So let's do this within our CSX file.

45
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:12,430
Let's say that any strong tags nested within this class should have a font weight of 500.

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,350
I think that looks better.

47
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,670
We also want this title to be centered horizontally.

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,760
So let's say text align center.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,320
And we also want these star icon to be positioned next to the title.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:40,840
So within our HMO let's just cut and paste the image that is right above the title into the H2 element

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,270
right before the text it's right here.

52
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm just going to paste

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,980
looks good.

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,970
Let's give this image element a class so we can give it a bit of right margin and increase the space

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,030
between the icon and the text.

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,280
So here is that element.

57
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:07,060
Let's just go ahead and give it a class of section title because that is the block that it belongs to

58
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,680
underscore underscore to indicate that this is an element of a block and let's name it icon.

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:23,660
So then back in our CSX let's create a new rule icon and let's say margin right.

60
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,420
Let's give it just a little bit.

61
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,240
Let's go with half of a ram.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,830
See how that looks.

63
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,130
All right.

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,950
So that was subtle but I think it looks good.

65
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,640
So our title element is complete.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,020
If we look at the design file I think the next thing we should work on is creating this two column layout.

67
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:50,050
So over in our h t UML underneath the heading level two element that we were just working on let's create

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:56,320
a new div and let's leverage the row class that we created earlier in the course.

69
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:03,550
If you think back to several lessons ago we created a roadblock or a row class to create this two column

70
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,040
layout.

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,230
So let's go ahead and use it again here to create a two column layout.

72
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:13,670
Once again so within this new dig that has a class of row.

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,590
We want to create two columns that each take up half of the available width.

74
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,070
So if we think in terms of each 12 column grid that means that each column should take up six of the

75
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,080
12 column grid bars.

76
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:36,770
So let's create a column that has a class of row underscore underscore medium 6 and let's go ahead and

77
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,820
copy and paste that.

78
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,690
So there are two of them.

79
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:49,250
And then let's simply move half of the content into one column and the other half of the content into

80
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,570
the other column.

81
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,150
So let's take this block of code in this block of code.

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:03,750
Let's cut that and paste it into this first column and then let's take this section in this section.

83
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,250
Cut it and pasted into this second column.

84
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,620
And let's be sure to get rid of these empty spaces and save this file.

85
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,640
And then within our CSF modules folder let's open up the road at CSX file.

86
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:28,370
So currently this road block supports a two column split of the one third and two thirds.

87
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,530
Now we want to go ahead and allow it to support the two columns that are equal width.

88
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,680
So in our CSX file Let's just scroll down a bit.

89
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,080
Here is the medium for rule which creates a column that is about one third of the available width right

90
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,700
below this.

91
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:53,990
Let's create a new rule medium dash 6 and we will just float it to the left and give it a width of 50

92
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,610
percent so we see that that gives us a two column layout.

93
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,720
However we need a bit of margin or gutter between the two columns.

94
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,400
Now earlier in the course when we originally created the row block we created a modified class that

95
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:21,830
we can place on the row element of row dash dash gutters which does indeed create a margin between the

96
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,680
two columns.

97
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,290
But if we look at the design file I think that this our features section calls for an extra wide gutter.

98
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:39,440
So why don't we just go ahead and create a new modifier class of row dash dash gutters dash large and

99
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,000
then over in our CSX for the row block towards the top right after this original gutters modifier.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,030
Let's just create a new one gutters dash large and if our regular gutters are sixty five pixels let's

101
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,600
make the extra wide gutters or the large gutters about 100 pixels.

102
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,380
So for those gutters large modifier margin right.

103
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,490
Negative 100 pixels.

104
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:16,120
And also underneath this next rule let's create a new corresponding one for our gutters large modifier

105
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,700
class so any direct children that are a div.

106
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,490
So in other words all of the columns instead of padding write of 65 pixels.

107
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,160
Let's give it 100 pixels.

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,130
So let's save that.

109
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,760
And check out the browser looking good.

110
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,850
If we check out our design file I think the next thing we should work on is creating a block for this

111
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,720
style.

112
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,020
Right.

113
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,360
So this layout where the icon sits to the left and the corresponding text sits to the right.

114
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,300
So let's create a new block and apply it only to this first feature item to begin with.

115
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,240
And once we have things looking good then we can apply that block to the other three feature items.

116
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:05,780
So over in our h t demo here is the first feature item consists of the icon the heading in the paragraph.

117
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:15,090
So let's just go ahead and wrap that in a new div that has a class of feature item.

118
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,260
Go ahead and close that div and let's indent this content just to stay organized next let's create a

119
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,190
new CSX file for our new feature item class.

120
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,610
So in our CSX modules folder let's create a new file.

121
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,960
Let's name the file underscore feature item dot CSX.

122
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,730
Let's create a new class feature item save this file and then let's go into our main styles that CSX

123
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,680
file and import this new file.

124
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,920
So modules underscore feature item.

125
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,290
All right.

126
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,110
So back in the feature item file.

127
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,560
Let's write a bit of CSX that will position this text to sit side by side with the icon.

128
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,080
Now there are probably 50 different ways that we can achieve that with CSX the way that I'm going to

129
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,790
do it is begin by giving the image element a class so we can target it with our CSX.

130
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,830
So here is the image element.

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:23,370
Let's go ahead and give it a class of feature item underscore underscore icon now in our CSX.

132
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,540
Let's try this.

133
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,430
Let's give the overall parent item the feature item class.

134
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,080
Let's give it a bit of padding left.

135
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,310
How much should we give it.

136
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,370
Well if we check out the design file if I measure from this left edge of the icon to where the content

137
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,460
begins.

138
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,840
Looks like about ninety four pixels.

139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,520
So let's say padding left ninety four pixels.

140
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,000
All right.

141
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,130
So that pushes all of the content in.

142
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,870
Now we can just position the icon.

143
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,240
Absolutely to sit in the top left corner.

144
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,880
So let's select that icon

145
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,180
position absolute left zero.

146
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,480
And because we want the icon to be positioned in relation to its parent let's be sure to give the parent

147
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,430
element position relative.

148
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,820
So let's save this.

149
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,230
And check out the browser.

150
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,740
And there we have the layout.

151
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,550
The next thing I think we should work on is the styling for this title or heading.

152
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,760
So in our HMO let's give that element a class so we can target it with CSX.

153
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,990
Let's give it a class of feature item underscore underscore title.

154
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,450
Let's head over to our CSX file and create a rule title let's start with font size.

155
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:49,180
So if we check the design file for measure from the top of this letter down to the bottom of the Y in

156
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:58,030
the P looks like about 30 pixels to me in terms of ran 30 divided by 16 gives us this let's copy that

157
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,870
to our clipboard.

158
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,880
Pasted in ran.

159
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,680
And while we at it in the design file I noticed that this does not look like a bold font weight.

160
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:15,200
So let's go ahead and also adjust the font weight to 300 I think that looks good.

161
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,740
Next why don't we focus on the paragraph text.

162
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,910
I think it should use a slightly larger font size and a significantly higher line height.

163
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,560
Now if you think back to several lessons ago we actually created a reusable class named generic content

164
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,800
container and that is how we created the styling for these paragraph elements so we can apply that same

165
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,660
font size in line height to the our features section by heading over to our HD GMO and on the main road

166
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,090
div for the outer feature section.

167
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,690
Let's just give it a class of generic content container

168
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,470
that looks a lot better but I'm noticing that the font weight for these paragraphs looks a bit high.

169
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,250
So why don't we go ahead and open the CSX file for the generic content container block and within the

170
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,050
rule that selects paragraphs.

171
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,800
Why don't we just say font weight.

172
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,370
Three hundred.

173
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,590
It's a subtle change but I think it matches the design.

174
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,160
Next let's reduce the space between the title and the paragraph so to do that.

175
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,800
Let's take two steps.

176
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,960
First let's adjust our generic content container until paragraphs to not have any top margin.

177
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,170
So within this margin line let's just add a couple of zeros.

178
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,040
This is CSF shorthand and it works in a clockwise fashion.

179
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,420
So top right bottom left.

180
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,790
So in other words we are zeroing out all of the margins except for the bottom margin on our generic

181
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,940
content container paragraphs.

182
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,200
So with that change in place we are now free to reduce the bottom margin of this title.

183
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,820
So within our feature item CSF file within these selector for the title element let's say margin bottom

184
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,530
point eight Ram

185
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,200
perfect that spacing matches the design.

186
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,590
All right.

187
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,410
So I think the styling for this block is good to go.

188
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,180
Let's go ahead and apply that same each T.A. pattern to the other three features.

189
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:32,820
So in our HDMI file let's wrap this image heading in paragraph in a div it has a class of feature item.

190
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,320
Here's the closing div tag.

191
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,870
Let's indent these.

192
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,560
Let's scroll down a bit.

193
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,750
Let's do the same thing for these three elements.

194
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:51,340
So did with a class of feature item closing div tag indent.

195
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,910
Let's just go ahead and copy this so we can paste it once again for this section of content.

196
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,320
So let's paste that let's wrap the closing div and let's indent the content.

197
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,020
If we scroll back up to our first feature item we will remember that we added a class to the image element.

198
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,590
So let's just go ahead and copy this and then paste it onto these other three images.

199
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,240
So here here and here.

200
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,520
And if we scroll back up we also want to do the same thing for the heading Level 3 element.

201
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:36,780
So we want to copy this class and then go ahead and paste it here here and here.

202
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,740
So let's save that.

203
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,850
And check out the browser

204
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,940
and everything starts to fall into place.

205
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,780
Now if we go ahead and compare this with the design file the biggest thing that I notice is that we

206
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:55,050
need to add a bit of vertical spacing between the items currently our items in the browser are too close

207
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,860
together.

208
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:03,060
So let's jump over to our feature item CSX file and within the main rule let's just add a bit of padding

209
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,820
bottom.

210
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,430
So let's say padding bottom.

211
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,760
Let's go with three and three quarters REM that looks like a bit too much vertical spacing.

212
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,540
Let's reduce that to two and a half Ram.

213
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,680
I think that matches the design nicely.

214
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,600
And at this point we've actually completed the styling for this section or at least for larger screens.

215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,750
Why don't we see how things look on a smaller screen I see several things that I would like to adjust

216
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,660
for mobile.

217
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,050
The first would be that I think this title should use a smaller font size.

218
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:45,140
So let's jump over to the CSX file for our section titled block why don't we copy and paste this current

219
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:54,230
font size into a media query mix in some mix in at small paste that in and let's lower the baseline

220
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,790
font size to two point five five RAM.

221
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,210
That looks better.

222
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,710
Next let's position things so that this star sits on its own line.

223
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:13,430
So back in our CSX within the selector for the icon element let's tell our baseline styles to make that

224
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,770
element a block level element which will drop the text after it onto a new line.

225
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,570
And now that it's a block level element let's make sure that it stays horizontally centered by saying

226
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,210
margin left auto margin right.

227
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,350
Auto.

228
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,390
Now obviously these will conflict with this previous property that we had but we only want this right

229
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,140
margin to apply if screens are certain size or larger.

230
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,760
So let's cut this line and begin a media query Mixon.

231
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,940
So mix in at small pace that right margin back in.

232
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,750
Let's also offset that left margin that we set for small screen.

233
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,220
So let's say margin left 0.

234
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,880
Let's also tell the icon to be an inline block level element so that on larger screens it won't drop

235
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,600
the text down to a new line.

236
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,110
So let's save this.

237
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,720
That's a step in the right direction but I think it could benefit with a bit of margin vertically in

238
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,740
between the icon and the text.

239
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,200
So why don't we say within our baseline Stiles margin bottom go is just a little over half of a ramp

240
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,100
so point six Ram.

241
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,510
And then we want to undo that for larger screen.

242
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,400
So margin bottom 0 within the mix in.

243
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:32,510
Let's save that think that looks nice for small screens and that will actually bring part 1 of this

244
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,780
two part lesson to a close in part 2.

245
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,750
We will finish optimizing this layout for small screens and we will also learn about an alternative

246
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,740
way to merge our get branch back into Master.

247
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,990
Let's keep rolling along.

248
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,190
And I will see you in part to.
