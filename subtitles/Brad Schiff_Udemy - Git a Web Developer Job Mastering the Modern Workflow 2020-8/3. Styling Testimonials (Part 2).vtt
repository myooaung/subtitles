00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.270
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.240
In part two of this three part lesson we are going to pick up right where we left off in part one.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.890
Let's dive in and get right back to the action.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.270
So let's go ahead and complete the styling for this testimonial section.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.120
The last element that we focused on in Part One was this heading.

6
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.420
It's good to go.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.970
So now let's focus on this paragraph.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.660
This paragraph can use the same font size and line height as we used in this section.

9
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.720
And in this section and we can achieve that font style for paragraph elements by applying the generic

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.240
content container class to one of these paragraphs parent elements.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.890
So in our age DMO on the main road div for the testimonial section let's go ahead and add the generic

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.690
content container class that looks a lot better.

13
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.280
And the styling for this block is actually now complete.

14
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.720
Let's go ahead and apply this same HMO pattern to the other two testimonials.

15
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.260
Let's begin by finding this content in the HMO so if we scroll down a bit here is that testimonial.

16
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.370
Let's wrap this content in a new div that has a class of testimonial.

17
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.550
Let's close out that new div and let's go ahead and indent this content.

18
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.720
So we know that the image should be wrapped in its own div that has a class of testimonial underscore

19
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.140
underscore photo.

20
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.670
It's close that did and indent the image.

21
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:48.440
We want this heading to have a class of testimony to underscore underscore title we want this heading

22
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.140
to actually be in H for instead of an H 3.

23
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.020
And let's give it a class of testimony or underscore underscore subtitle.

24
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.440
Let's save this.

25
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.410
See Outlook's looks good.

26
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.580
We will address this vertical spacing issue in just a moment.

27
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.320
But first let's go ahead and apply the block to this testimonial.

28
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.080
So if we scroll down a bit here it is.

29
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.810
Let's wrap it in a div that has a class testimony to close out that new div indent the content wrap

30
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.900
the image in a div of its own testimony or underscore underscore photo close out that div indent the

31
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.990
image.

32
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.650
Give this a class of testimonial title.

33
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.460
Change this to an H for and give it a class of testimonial subtitle.

34
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.510
And now all three testimonials have been styled.

35
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.420
Next let's address this issue where there isn't enough vertical spacing between the section title and

36
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.100
the top of the testimonial images.

37
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.020
This issue exists because we used position relative to pull these images up out of their natural position.

38
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.230
So if we pull these images up any pixels from where they would normally sit we can counteract this overlapping

39
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.030
issue by simply adding 80 pixels of top padding to this row.

40
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.650
So over an hour each time out was fine.

41
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.800
The main parent row div for this section.

42
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.870
Here it is.

43
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.150
Let's give it a new modifier class of road dash dash Tiefer top and then padding.

44
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.670
Let's save this.

45
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.490
And then within our modules CSSA folder.

46
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.690
Let's open up road of CSX.

47
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:49.220
Let's create a new rule for that modifier class T padding padding top 80 pixels

48
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.830
perfect if we compare this to the design file the next thing that I think we should adjust is that the

49
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.210
gutter or margin between the columns looks a bit smaller or narrower in the design file than it does

50
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.980
in the browser so we can fine tune that by simply adding a modifier class in our HMO to that main road

51
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.350
div..

52
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.320
So let's add a new modifier ro dash dash gutters.

53
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.720
Small.

54
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.650
Let's save that and then back in our road of CSSA file.

55
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.650
Here's the normal gutters rule.

56
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.830
And here is the gutters large rule.

57
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.800
Let's create a new corresponding one for the gutter small margin right.

58
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.760
So if we check out the design file in this instance the girl looks like about 45 pixels.

59
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.740
So from cutters small let's say margin right should be negative 45 pixels.

60
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.560
And then if we scroll down a bit we also want to create a corresponding rule that targets each column.

61
00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.740
So again the normal gutter is 65 pixels large gutter is 100 pixels.

62
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.820
Let's create one for the corresponding small gutters.

63
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.010
So Gunders small look inside that element for any direct descendants that have a tag type of div and

64
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.800
give them all a padding right a 45 pixels perfect.

65
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.200
Now the gutters match the design.

66
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.110
The next thing that I notice is that each of our testimonials is a different height.

67
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.940
But if we look at the design file they are all equal height.

68
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:39.440
So in the design file even though this testimonial text is shorter than this testimonial text the transparent

69
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.360
white background area is still the same height.

70
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.740
So how can we adjust things in the browser so that all three testimonials use the height of the tallest

71
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.420
item.

72
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.670
Well there are several ways to achieve that with CSX the particular way that we will achieve an equal

73
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.820
height lay out is by leveraging something called Flex box.

74
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.460
Let's begin by jumping into our HTL now and giving the main parent Rodier of a new modifier class of

75
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620
row dash dash.

76
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.480
Equal height at medium.

77
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.340
So once the screen is large enough to be considered medium we will apply a bit of CSSA to make all of

78
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.020
the columns equal height.

79
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.430
So let's save this and jump into our road of CSSA file.

80
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.120
But scroll down to the very bottom.

81
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:38.750
And right before the final closing curly bracket let's create a new CSSA comment begin equal height

82
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.080
rules.

83
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.880
We are including this just to stay organized.

84
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:51.770
So after that let's create a new rule that targets the modifier class we just created equal height at

85
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.370
medium.

86
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.610
So let's go ahead and use our media query mixin.

87
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.950
So mix in at medium.

88
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:09.590
So what we want to do is tell the parent row div to use fluxbox so we can just say display flaks now

89
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.870
by itself this won't do anything.

90
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.540
So if we check the browser nothing changed.

91
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:21.080
However if we also tell each of the three columns to use flex box instead of being floated to the left

92
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.800
the contents of each will flex to match the tallest element.

93
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:34.090
So in our CSA as after the media query but still within this rule let's target all of the columns.

94
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:41.330
So the ampersand will give us this selector and then we can say only select direct descendants that

95
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.720
have a tag type of Div.

96
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.910
So this will select all of the columns and then we can tell them to stop being floated and start using

97
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.750
Fluxbox instead.

98
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.860
Display flex.

99
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.680
So let's save this and check out the browser.

100
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.780
And we now have equal height columns.

101
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.870
At this point I think the testimonial section is complete for larger screens.

102
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.400
Now let's see how things look on smaller screens.

103
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.500
Let me scroll up a bit so I think the first thing I would adjust for mobile is to remove this background

104
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.310
image.

105
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:23.280
I think that background image makes sense for larger screens because there's plenty of extra room on

106
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.150
the sides and there's also more vertical margin everywhere.

107
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.480
So there's plenty of extra empty screen space for that background image to really shine through.

108
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.810
But on smaller screens I just don't think the background image is a good fit.

109
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.720
Not to mention it's a fairly large image which means it has a large file size and we don't want mobile

110
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.050
users to have to download a large image file if they really don't need to.

111
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.090
It's just a waste of their data plan.

112
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:56.530
Now we apply that background image in a CSSA file in the modules folder named page section.

113
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.970
We created a modifier rule for the testimonials page section.

114
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:09.720
So why don't we do this let's wrap these properties in a mixin media query so let's say mix in at medium

115
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.730
and let's just paste those properties into the media query.

116
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:23.070
And for smaller screens let's just tell the baseline for this testimonials modifier to be a solid light

117
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.570
blue background color.

118
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.020
So that say background color.

119
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.520
Here's a hexadecimal color code you can type in for a nice light blue each zero the six E-F.

120
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.240
Let's see how that looks.

121
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.440
Perfect.

122
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:43.130
The next thing that I would like to adjust on small screens is that I don't think we can afford to have

123
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.400
this margin and this margin for smaller screens like this.

124
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.570
There just isn't very much horizontal screen space available.

125
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:57.770
And I think we want to do whatever we can to give the actual content or text as much horizontal breathing

126
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.620
room as we possibly can.

127
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:06.410
So why don't we go ahead and remove this margin on the sides so that the testimony or white background

128
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:13.130
uses the full screens available which we can achieve this by adding a modifier class to this section's

129
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.210
wrapper div.

130
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:21.630
So over in our HMO here is the row for the testimonial content and just above it.

131
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.260
Here is the wrapper element.

132
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.970
So this wrapper div is what's responsible for creating this margin that we see on the far sides.

133
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.080
So let's add a modifier class of wrapper dash dash.

134
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.250
No padding until medium.

135
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.500
Let's go ahead and save this and then open up our wrapper does CSSA file.

136
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:51.920
Let's go ahead and create a modifier rule no padding until medium.

137
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.510
So basically we want to offset or zero out these padding values.

138
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.190
So let's just say padding left zero padding right zero.

139
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.890
But for screens that are considered medium or larger We do want padding.

140
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.990
So then we can use a mix in media query say mix in at medium.

141
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.440
Let's add that padding back in.

142
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.530
So we can just copy and paste these lines.

143
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.480
Let's go ahead and save this.

144
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.080
I think that looks better for small screens.

145
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.170
We can even reduce this margin on the testimonial item itself down at the Mobile view.

146
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.920
Why don't we reduce this so that it matches the margin we see throughout the rest of the design for

147
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:42.240
mobile which is the standard 18 pixels from the wrapper div we can adjust this by going into our testimony

148
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.070
or CSSA file scrolling up to the top.

149
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.060
And let's wrap these padding values in a mixin media query.

150
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:58.890
So let's just copy that line mix in at medium pace line in and then let's reduce the baseline horizontal

151
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.010
padding to 18 pixels

152
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.200
perfect.

153
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.300
Let's scroll down a bit.

154
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.820
All right so we see a big problem here.

155
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:19.220
Remember that we used position relative on these images to pull them up 80 pixels out of their natural

156
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.160
position.

157
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:26.080
Now on larger screens that's OK because all of the columns sit by each other side by side.

158
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.690
But on mobile the three testimonials will stack on top of each other.

159
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:37.490
So why don't we go ahead and add a bit of margin bottom to each testimony on smaller screens to counteract

160
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.080
this overlapping issue.

161
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:46.790
So within our testimonial CSSA file right up at the top on the baseline style for the main block element

162
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.470
let's just say margin bottom to simply prevent the images from overlapping.

163
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:59.240
We could give it a margin of 80 pixels and we can see that that lines things up perfectly.

164
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.140
But I think this would look better if there was a little bit of extra vertical spacing between the two

165
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.330
testimonials.

166
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.500
So why don't we add an extra 18 pixels on top of this 80.

167
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:18.630
So 98 I think that looks nice but remember we don't need to add this bottom margin on larger screens.

168
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.930
Now we conveniently already have an at medium medium query here.

169
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:32.210
So why don't we just go ahead and zero out this margin bottom so we can save margin bottom zero perfect.

170
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:38.240
So now we have that bottom margin on smaller screens but we aren't adding unnecessary margin for larger

171
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.320
screens.

172
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.040
If we jump back over to a small screen I think we should try to eliminate this light blue Gap.

173
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:51.530
This gap is being created by the margin bottom that we just added to testimonials and also by the bottom

174
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.600
padding of our page section element.

175
00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:00.860
So to remove this gap let's begin by targeting the third and final testimonial and removing its bottom

176
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.980
margin.

177
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.980
So over in our age.

178
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:11.530
TMF In but scroll down and find that third and last testimonial here it is let's give it a modifier

179
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.460
class of testimonial dash dash last.

180
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:24.000
Now over in our testimonial CSSA file let's create a rule that targets that modifier last.

181
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.620
And let's just say margin bottom zero.

182
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.910
So that got rid of most of the gap we can get rid of the remaining portion by adding a modifier class

183
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.930
to the testimonials page section element.

184
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.250
So over in our HMO we scroll up to where this row begins.

185
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.300
Here and then move up just a little bit further.

186
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.840
The overall testimonials div has a class of page section.

187
00:14:53.910 --> 00:15:04.050
Why don't we go ahead and add on another modifier page section dash dash no be for bottom padding until

188
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.600
medium.

189
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.620
All right so that's the new modifier class.

190
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.740
Let's go ahead and say this and open up our page.

191
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.530
S.c.s s file.

192
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.790
Let's create a new rule for that modifier class.

193
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.710
So no B for bottom padding until medium.

194
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:29.220
So we can just say padding bottom zero and then create a media queries.

195
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.170
So mix in at medium for screens that are medium or larger.

196
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:42.470
We can go ahead and set the padding bottom back to its original value of four and a half rim but save

197
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.930
this.

198
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:51.000
The gap is gone and we still managed to keep our bottom page section spacing on larger screens and that's

199
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.630
actually going to bring part 2 of this three part lesson to a close.

200
00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.220
Our testimonial section is complete both for large and small screens.

201
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:06.300
And in part 3 we are going to make sure that it looks great on medium sized screens.

202
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.870
Let's keep rolling along and I will see you in part 3.
