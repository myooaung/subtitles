00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,240
Hello everyone and this video will talk about the next steps you can take.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,790
This video has two main components to it.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,800
First we'll talk about what you can learn next.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,490
So we've finished learning new skills in this course.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,670
And now you might be wondering what's the next logical step.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,260
What should I learn now.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,680
So we'll cover that.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,800
And then secondly we'll also talk about career progression.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,680
So let's say you get a job that's fantastic.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,750
It's definitely something that's worth going out and buying a cake to celebrate.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,800
But you don't want to stay at that exact job or position for the rest of your life.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,520
You want to be able to grow and continually see progress.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,430
So we'll talk about a few things that can help you in that area.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,200
But first let's talk about what you can learn next.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,220
I want to start out by saying that with everything you've learned in this course I think you'd be valuable

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,710
to just about any dev team out there right now with what you currently know.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,060
But the developer spirit is to never stop learning to always be moving forward.

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,320
So with that in mind here are my recommendations on what to learn next.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,960
Really it's as simple as JavaScript javascript and more Javascript.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,810
It's still a plus to know server side languages like HP or Ruby but honestly at this point in time I'd

21
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,200
say there are more companies that will value javascript.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,750
This is because javascript is now completely ubiquitous.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,400
It's on the front end it's on the back end.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,080
It's in simple brochure type websites.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,890
It's in complex web apps it's in device native apps it's everywhere.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,940
So a developer who knows javascript is incredibly in demand right now.

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,260
Now we definitely learned about javascript in this course but I would still jump at any opportunity

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,830
to learn more about javascript.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,900
Keep practicing keep building new things with it.

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,150
I'll include a few links in this video description where you can read more about javascript news and

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,420
resources and best practices because really anything you do to advance your understanding of javascript

32
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,740
is going to propel your career forward tenfold.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,380
Now my advice is always to learn what interests you the most your natural curiosity is the best motivator

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,260
and teacher.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,710
So I'd say whatever interests you the most just pursue that from a javascript angle.

36
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,600
So if you say that design or front end or user experience interests you the most.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,050
Try to learn a single page application library like react react to super popular right now and learning

38
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,700
it will open all sorts of doors for you.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,300
You can find introduction to react to Tauriel is on YouTube and across Google and if it looks like something

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,850
that interests you at all.

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,830
I wholeheartedly recommend you sink your teeth into it.

42
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,890
Re-act is a great tool to know right now.

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,470
It's very in demand.

44
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,910
Or if you say that back and interests you the most.

45
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,310
So dealing with data and actually making things happen.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,870
Try learning more about no.

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,910
J.S..

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,540
So remember way back in the course when we wrote no js code to programmatically go out onto the Internet

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,450
and save the photo of a dog to our hard drive.

50
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,270
You can do stuff like that only ten thousand times more advanced.

51
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,190
You can learn how to use node to serve up an API or even an entire website.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,730
You can learn how to talk directly to a database with node and if you use a database system like Mongo

53
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,340
D-B your actual requests for the database themselves can be written in Javascript.

54
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,980
So long story short you can do anything with Knode and no developers are incredibly in demand right

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,760
now.

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,290
So again if data and back end tasks are what excite you.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,660
I recommend staying in the know J.S. ecosystem instead of sinking your teeth into something like BHP

58
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,780
or Ruby.

59
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,970
All right so those are my recommendations on what to learn next.

60
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,350
At this point let's change gears and now let's talk about career progression.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,200
The first topic I want to cover is how important it is to know yourself.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,820
So we all have our own unique blend of strengths and weaknesses.

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,670
And if you want your career to grow you need to align your decisions to leverage your strengths.

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,180
Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,220
So some people are super intelligent programming just comes a little bit easier to these people than

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,660
it does for others.

67
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,640
Their minds seem to learn a little bit quicker than others and they can train themselves to see the

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,850
most elegant solution with code.

69
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,530
Their minds are just built that way.

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,270
But that same person might not be a very good leader.

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,550
They might lack charisma they might lack the ability to bring out the best in others.

72
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,370
They might not be very good at seeing the bigger picture.

73
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,780
Maybe they tend to focus on smaller technical details.

74
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,370
So for this person maybe their career progression doesn't involve staying with a mid-level company for

75
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,360
a long time and moving up to a management or executive position.

76
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,970
Considering this person's strengths and weaknesses maybe their best career move would be to try to become

77
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,030
the absolute best developer or programmer they can be and to keep getting developer jobs at bigger and

78
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,260
better companies.

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,620
But let's take a look at a different person.

80
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,590
So some people are good programmers but they're not great or amazing but maybe they do possess leadership

81
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,540
qualities.

82
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,500
Maybe they are good at keeping a level head no matter what.

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,130
Maybe they have the ability to inspire people and they can get a group of people working together in

84
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,050
harmony to complete a huge project.

85
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,760
Maybe they can see the bigger picture for a project and know when to make a judgment call.

86
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,660
So for this person considering their strengths and weaknesses maybe their best bet is to get their foot

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,450
in the door at a company as a developer and then stay with that company and work their way up to a management

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,300
or executive position.

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,250
Now those are just two examples.

90
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,110
There are billions of people on the planet.

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,670
So there are billions of different types of people but the general idea is that we are all good at different

92
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,680
things.

93
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,510
We all have unique gifts.

94
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,460
And the trick is to aim your career so that you're in a position where you get to use your gifts on

95
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,850
a daily basis because if you try to progress in a career path that uses your strengths you will still

96
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:19,110
be met with many challenges but because you are aligned with your natural gifts you will remain energized.

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,250
When we do something we're good at it makes us feel good.

98
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,940
We feel like we are useful and like we're helping others.

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,120
So the analogy here is when your career is aligned with your gifts it's like running on a flat surface.

100
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,750
Running is still difficult and taxing but it's doable and it's rewarding.

101
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,920
On the other hand if you try to progress in a career path that ignores your strengths and overing gauges

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,980
your weaknesses you will become burnt out and probably end up stagnating when your career isn't aligned

103
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,840
with your gifts.

104
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,650
The person in the mirror knows that it's a waste of your gifts.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,740
You're going to feel like you're not giving all that you can give and that's going to take its toll

106
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,300
on you.

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,930
So the analogy here is when your career isn't aligned with your natural strengths.

108
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,910
It's like running uphill nonstop for 50 years.

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,540
It's not sustainable.

110
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,510
So long story short get to know yourself.

111
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,570
Let's move on to my final tip and this is a tip that will help you progress in your career.

112
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,240
Whether that's through promotions at a job or seeing growth in a business you on that tip is to follow

113
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,710
these two rules.

114
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,210
Limit your complaining and try not to dodge responsibility.

115
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,600
Now I think you'd be surprised even if you aren't the best developer in the world.

116
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,190
Just following these two rules will make people want to promote you or it will make people want to work

117
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,060
with you.

118
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,860
Now I know these things sound cliche and are easier said than done.

119
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,630
And unfortunately this isn't a personal development course it's a web development course so I can't

120
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,570
give you effective ways to actually follow these rules but I can tell you that these things are super

121
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,570
important to career progression and that it's definitely worth your time to google how to improve in

122
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,830
these areas.

123
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,870
All right that brings this video to an end.

124
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,910
And actually that brings this course to an end.

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,440
Thank you so much for coming on this journey with me.

126
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,330
I hope you feel like you learned something.

127
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,790
And don't be a stranger.

128
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,110
Reach out to me in the course discussion area let me know how things are going.

129
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,070
Anyways here's my final message for the course.

130
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,060
Don't put your dreams or goals on hold while you quote learn even more.

131
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,560
There's always going to be something else to learn.

132
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,390
And being a developer means learning on the fly as you go and not waiting for that perfect moment.

133
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,140
When you quote know enough and only then jumping in.

134
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,360
You already know what time you already have the skill set and knowledge to go out and make crazy things

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,130
happen.

136
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,880
I guarantee you are underestimating your skills talents and knowledge.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,230
So do not wait.

138
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,920
Make something happen now.

139
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,890
You are enough right now today.

140
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,660
So until the next time we meet in a course I wish you the very best of luck and take care.
