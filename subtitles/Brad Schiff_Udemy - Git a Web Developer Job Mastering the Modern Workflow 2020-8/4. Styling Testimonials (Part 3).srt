1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,530
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,450
In part three of this three part lesson we will pick up right where we left off in part two.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,450
Let's dive in and get right back to the action.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,060
So at this point our testimonials section is complete both for large and small screens.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,680
But what about medium sized screens.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,980
So for example if I make my browser window smaller the layout still looks good.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,730
Even now it still looks good.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,770
But eventually there just won't be enough horizontal space for this three column layout to fit comfortably.

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,160
Now if I keep shrinking the window eventually we will see it switch to a single column view but the

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,050
question is Where is that breakpoint occurring.

11
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,950
Currently we have set up the testimonial section to only apply a three column layout if a screen is

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,650
large enough to be considered medium.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,850
Now in my opinion this does not look good.

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,040
These columns are too narrow and there just isn't enough space for three of them to fit comfortably.

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,310
So I think instead of applying this layout for screens that are medium or larger I think we should only

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,530
apply the three column layout for screens that we consider large or larger.

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,920
Now when I use those keywords of medium and large let me refresh your memory in terms of what I'm actually

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,070
referring to.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:35,180
So in our text editor within app assets styles and then the base folder go ahead and open mix ins dot

20
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,820
CSX.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:45,500
So many lessons ago we created these three mix ins at small at medium and at large and currently the

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,900
testimonial section is using the medium breakpoint which is 800 pixels.

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,730
And it turns out that that just isn't wide enough to comfortably fit three columns.

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:02,250
So let's adjust the testimonial section to not implement a three column layout until these large break

25
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,770
point.

26
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,890
And I think that twelve hundred might actually be overkill.

27
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,890
Let's adjust this to 1010 pixels.

28
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,210
Let's save this file and then jump over to our h t demo and within our testimonial section let's begin

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,710
adjusting these medium breakpoints to use large instead.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,710
So on the main testimonials div let's change this modifier.

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,390
Class that says no bottom padding until medium.

32
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,180
Let's change that too until large.

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,010
And let's go into the page section CSX file to create a new modifier that targets the large breakpoint.

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,420
So page section CSX.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,550
Now we don't want to delete or replace this medium rule because even though we want to use large in

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,160
this particular instance there might be another section or another page in the future where we will

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,500
want to use this medium breakpoint.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,980
So let's leave this intact but let's copy and paste it.

39
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:12,700
And then within this new copy let's change this to large and let's change the media query to at large.

40
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,860
All right let's save that and jump back to our HDMI out.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,470
The next instance of medium is on the wrapper div no padding until medium.

42
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,630
Let's change that to large and let's jump into the wrapper CSX file to create the large version of this

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,060
rule.

44
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,200
Now again we don't want to delete or replace this medium version.

45
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,600
We want to leave it intact in case we need it in the future.

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,370
But let's go ahead and copy and paste it.

47
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:42,990
All right.

48
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:51,750
And within this duplicated copy what's changed this to large and change the breakpoint to at large.

49
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,200
Let's save that and jump back to our H2 CML file.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,680
The next instance of the medium breakpoint is on the row element.

51
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:08,760
So let's change this row equal height at medium to large and then let's jump into our road CSX file

52
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,400
the equal height rules or at the very bottom.

53
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,430
So let's scroll down.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,920
Let's go ahead and copy and paste this.

55
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,850
And then within the new copy.

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:27,460
Change this to at large and change the mix in breakpoint to large as well.

57
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,880
Save this jumped back to our H TMI file.

58
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,190
All right.

59
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,650
Now the only remaining instances of the medium breakpoint are the classes that we added to each of the

60
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,960
three columns.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,070
So on these three column divs let's just change this to large.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,350
So that's the first column.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,370
Here's the second column and here's the third column.

64
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:59,280
Now let's jump back into our row CSX file to make sure that this new class name exists so if we scroll

65
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,760
up a bit

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,370
this at medium media query contains all of our different call them widths for example medium for takes

67
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,790
up a third of the width.

68
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,070
Medium 6 takes up half of the width we can actually just go ahead and copy and paste this entire at

69
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,440
medium media query in all of its contents.

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
So let's begin here.

71
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,420
And let's copy all the way down to here and then just paste it to create a duplicate.

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,900
And then on this duplicate copy let's change the media query to at large and then within all of these

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,020
class names let's just change them to large.

74
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm going to copy the word large into my clipboard so I don't have to keep typing it.

75
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,850
So let's change that

76
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,270
here.

77
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,440
Scroll down a bit to change this and this.

78
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,970
Now if we save this file and check out the browser we see a three column layout because our screen is

79
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,430
quite large but if we shrink the screen

80
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,160
it looks like we forgot to change one of the breakpoints in our testimonial block.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:19,450
So really quickly in testimonial that CSX let's change this breakpoint to at large let's also change

82
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,650
our page section rule so that this background image isn't used until the large break point.

83
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:33,310
So within page section dot CSX we scroll down a bit here is the testimonials modifier.

84
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,480
Let's change this breakpoint to at large.

85
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,410
Perfect.

86
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,370
So now our testimonial section uses a single column layout for small screens.

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,650
And it doesn't use a three column layout until our screen becomes quite large.

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,430
So we see there's the threshold there is the break point.

89
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,400
This is the narrowest that the three columns will ever be.

90
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,020
And I can live with this.

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,770
That means that our testimonial section is now complete for every screen size.

92
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,600
Good job.

93
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,880
Go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back.

94
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,910
But before we bring this lesson to a close.

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,800
There are just a few more things that I want to take care of.

96
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,130
So first why don't we add in hi DP.

97
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,680
Copies for each of the three testimonial images.

98
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,820
And once we've done that let's go ahead and merge this branch back into master.

99
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,160
So let's get started on adding the high DP copies.

100
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,610
Let's jump into our HDMI file.

101
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,480
Let's find the first column.

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,640
Here it is.

103
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,090
Here is the image.

104
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,930
Let's begin by giving it an all to value.

105
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,140
We can simply use the person's name Jane Doe.

106
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,470
All right.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,720
So let's begin by changing the source attribute to source set.

108
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:54,330
And after we list this first image let's add a comma and then we can just copy and paste the path to

109
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,680
the image.

110
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,830
And on this duplicate copy at the very end before dot j peg just add high DP.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,410
Now we want to tell the browser the size of each of these images so it knows which one to choose based

112
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:15,780
on the devices screen size and pixel density for the base image has a width of 160 and the high DP copy

113
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,230
is double that at three hundred and twenty.

114
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,660
And remember that by default web browsers assume that responsive images need to take up the entire browser

115
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,770
window width.

116
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,040
We need to manually tell the browser that this image will only ever need to display at a maximum width

117
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:40,340
of one hundred and sixty pixels so we can use the sizes attribute and specify one hundred and sixty

118
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,460
pixels.

119
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,450
All right let's go ahead and do the same thing for the other two images.

120
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,380
So here's the image in the second column.

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,720
Let's give it an all to value.

122
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,210
John Smith.

123
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,270
Change source to source set.

124
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,190
That's duplicate this path to the image comma separating the two.

125
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,530
The first image is one hundred and sixty pixels wide.

126
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,670
Let's change this second image to end in dash.

127
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,240
Hi DPA.

128
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,660
And it is three hundred and twenty pixels wide.

129
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,880
And we also want to tell the browser that it only needs the display at one hundred and sixty pixels.

130
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,430
Let's do the same thing for the third image.

131
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,930
Give it an all value Cat kitty.

132
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,920
Change source to source said let's duplicate this image.

133
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,250
The second copy should use dash Heidi API.

134
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,800
First copy is one hundred and sixty pixels why the second copy is three hundred and twenty pixels wide

135
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,950
and tell the browser that it only needs to be displayed at 160 pixels.

136
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,530
Now before we save this we can make sure that things are set up correctly by adding a dash eye at the

137
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,660
end of both of these.

138
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:59,490
Let's save this and we see 160 by 160 which is what I would expect because I am using a normal monitor

139
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,700
instead of a high DP or high pixel density screen.

140
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,470
Perfect.

141
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,720
We can go ahead and get rid of that dash eye on both instances

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,580
and we have now 100 percent completed this section now because the testimonial section is no longer

143
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,100
a work in progress.

144
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,990
We can now merge the testimonials branch into master.

145
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,780
So let's go ahead and jump over to the command line.

146
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,850
Let's run a get status to see what has changed all of these changes look good to me.

147
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,760
So I'm going to add everything to the staging area get add dash uppercase a.

148
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,370
I'm ready to go ahead and commit things so get commit.

149
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:46,080
Let's add a message completed the testimonials section.

150
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,520
All right.

151
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,480
So now that we made a commit those testimonial changes are safe.

152
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Been locked away and it gets history.

153
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,270
We can now go ahead and check out the master branch or switch back to the master branch so get check

154
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,440
out master.

155
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,550
And now back in the browser if I refresh while my web pack task is still running in a different command

156
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,330
line we will see that none of our testimonial changes are in place because they only live in the testimonials

157
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,620
branch and we are currently on the master branch.

158
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:25,070
Let's go ahead and merge the testimonials branch into the master branch get merge and then the name

159
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,560
of the branch we want to merge in testimonials.

160
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:29,900
All right.

161
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,670
So we still have the master branch checked out but if I check the browser now our testimonial changes

162
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,370
are in place and we're in business.

163
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:42,290
Now just in case my computer blows up I want all of this code to be safe.

164
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,220
So I'm going to push this up to get hub.

165
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:53,310
So to push our master branch we can just say get push origin master.

166
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,880
All right.

167
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,090
Now get hub servers have the latest copy of my project.

168
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,720
We can let out a sigh of relief and we have officially completed the testimonials feature in our next

169
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,230
lesson.

170
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,210
We'll change gears and begin styling the footer of our Web site.

171
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,200
Let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
