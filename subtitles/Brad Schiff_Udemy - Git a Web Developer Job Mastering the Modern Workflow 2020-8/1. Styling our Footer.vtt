00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.420
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.270
In this lesson we will get back to styling.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.520
Our Web site to be more specific.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.950
We will be styling the footer or in other words we will be adjusting this very bottom section of the

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.950
site to match what we see over in the design file.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060
So let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.990
The first thing we should do is to create a new get branch for the footer efforts.

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.030
We can create a new branch by typing get branch and then the name of the branch.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.510
We would like to create let's name it simply footer and then we can switch to or check out that branch

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.430
by typing get check out footer.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380
All right and if you haven't already.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.110
Make sure that NPM run dev is running in one of your command lines.

13
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.480
OK.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.270
At this point we have a new get branch and our Web packed dev server is up and running.

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.110
Let's go ahead and begin styling this content so we can jump over to our text editor and let's open

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.110
up the H PML file we can scroll down to the very bottom to find the footer.

17
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.600
Here it is.

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.960
Let's begin by giving this footer element a class so that we can target it with our CSX let's name the

19
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920
class site footer.

20
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.330
Let's save this file.

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.570
And next let's create a brand new CSX file dedicated to this class.

22
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.940
So within our app assets styles modules folder let's create a new file.

23
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.500
Let's name this file underscore.

24
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.900
Site dash footer dot CSX.

25
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.900
Let's create the class selector.

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.410
So dot site footer.

27
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.850
And before we forget let's save this file and then jump into our main styles dot CSX file and import

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.670
in this file.

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.540
So import modules underscore site footer save this.

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.380
And jump back into the site footer file.

31
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.750
All right.

32
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.800
So what's the first bit of CSX we should write.

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.160
Well if we compare the browser to the design file I think we should begin by giving it a blue background

34
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.800
and making the text white.

35
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.100
So back in our CSX let's say background color should use our variable named Main.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.750
Blue let's set the color to white.

37
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.080
All right.

38
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.430
So that's a start.

39
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.310
Currently it looks like the margin from this paragraph element is protruding out the top and bottom

40
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.610
edges of the container div we can fix this by giving the containing site footer div a bit of vertical

41
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.730
padding.

42
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.870
So let's say padding.

43
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.750
Let's go with half a room vertically and we don't need any horizontal padding that looks better.

44
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.560
Why don't we wrap the content in a new div that has a class of wrapper so that the content won't sit

45
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.140
against the very far horizontal edges.

46
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.390
So over in our h t AML let's go ahead and cut this paragraph into our clipboard and then create a new

47
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.630
div that has a class of wrapper.

48
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.340
And then within this new wrapper div Let's paste back in that paragraph.

49
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.850
Perfect.

50
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.520
So now we see that this content aligns horizontally with the margin that we are using for the rest of

51
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.020
the site's content.

52
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:39.690
Next let's horizontally align this content to be centered so in our CSX text align center

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.860
all right.

54
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.650
Now eventually we will want to add a bit of horizontal spacing between this text and the orange button.

55
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.960
But first why don't we see how things look on a small screen.

56
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.100
So I think this looks a bit odd for small screens.

57
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.950
I think it would look better if after this text we dropped down to a new line for the button.

58
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.930
So over in our HMO let's wrap the copyright text in a span.

59
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:19.620
Closing this ban tag here and let's give this span a class of sight further underscore underscore text.

60
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.560
Let's save this.

61
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.990
And back in our site footer CSX.

62
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.900
Let's create a new rule for that text element.

63
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.240
We can say display block

64
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.590
that gives us a line break after the text.

65
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.730
Let's also add a bit of bottom margin on that text.

66
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.450
So there's a bit of space before the orange button so we can say margin bottom one Ram.

67
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.780
I think that looks a lot better for mobile.

68
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.520
However back on larger screens we do not want the button to drop down to a new line.

69
00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.580
If we check the design file for large screens the button should sit side by side with the text.

70
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.620
So what we can do back in our site footer CSX is use a media query mixed in within this text rule so

71
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.110
we can say at Mixon at medium.

72
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.770
So once a screen is large enough to be considered medium let's set it back to an inline level element.

73
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.810
So display in line and we won't need any margin bottom any longer.

74
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.460
So we can zero that out margin bottom zero looks good.

75
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.220
And now why don't we add in a bit of horizontal spacing between the text and the orange button only

76
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.780
on larger screens.

77
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:44.380
So within that media query that we just set up we can also say margin right go with one point for RAM.

78
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.780
That looks good.

79
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.570
Now if we compare this with the design file the only big change that I see remaining is that this text

80
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.510
looks like it's using a lighter than default font weight right.

81
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.560
I feel like our text is a little too bold.

82
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:08.660
So within our CSX within this text rule let's simply say font weight 200.

83
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.580
I think that looks a lot better.

84
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.630
And at this point our footer is styled both for larger screens and smaller screens before we bring this

85
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.680
lesson to a close.

86
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.540
Let's take care of things from a get perspective.

87
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.200
So I'm going to jump back to the command line.

88
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.960
You can either press control C to tell web pack to stop running or you can open a new command line tab

89
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.010
or window.

90
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.880
Either way we want to go ahead and commit our changes to the footer branch.

91
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.550
So let's run a get status all of these changes look good to me.

92
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.170
Let's add it to the staging area.

93
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.690
So get add everything and then want to commit those changes so get commit.

94
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:54.420
Let's include a message completed styling the footer.

95
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.710
All right.

96
00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.030
So now that we've committed those changes to the footer branch we can switch back to our master branch.

97
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.980
So get check out master.

98
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.650
If we look back in the browser we see that our footer styling is gone but all we need to do now is merge

99
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.060
in the footer branch so get merge footer.

100
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.430
All right.

101
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.770
So we are back on the master branch and our footer efforts have been merged in.

102
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.880
That's going to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson.

103
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.670
We will begin styling the header of our Web site this very top section.

104
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.770
We will be working to make it match what we see in the design file which is this.

105
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:43.310
So we want to set up the transparent blue bar the company logo and the navigation.

106
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.960
It should be a lot of fun.

107
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.290
Let's keep rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
