00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,360
Welcome to part two of our two part lesson on attention to detail.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,040
Let's pick up right where we left off and get straight to the action in part 2.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,380
Let's fine tune this type polygraphy So the first thing that I would like to adjust is removing this

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,070
vertical gap at the top of this column.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,390
If we look at our design file we see that the top of this heading should be aligned with the top of

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,590
this image.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,480
Now back in the browser this vertical gap is being created by the top margin on this headline.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,500
So let's go ahead and find this headline in our H.T. email so we can add a modifier class to it.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,330
We can find this element by searching for how we got started in our text editor within an hour each

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,170
TNL file command for control of how we got started.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,740
All right.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,410
So here is that element.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,780
Let's go ahead and give it a modifier.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,890
Class of headline dash dash.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,370
No T for top margin but save that.

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,100
And then within our modules CSSA folder.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,960
Let's open up head blind us CSX.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,020
But scroll to the bottom and create a new modifier rule no t margin.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,190
And then we can just say margin top zero.

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,470
So let's save this.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,050
And check out the browser.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,950
I think that looks a lot better.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,070
Next let's focus on fine tuning the typographic for these paragraphs.

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,830
So if we compare what we see here in the browser to our design file we see that there is quite a bit

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,020
of difference.

27
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,850
So let's go ahead and find these paragraphs in our H.T. IMO.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,000
Here they are and we need a way to target these elements with our CSX.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,430
Now so far in the course we've more or less been following the Bamm methodology and the best way of

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,580
doing things would be to create a new class and to add it to each of these three paragraphs.

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:13,300
However this is one instance where Personally I completely disagree with Ben when it comes to something

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,470
as generic and repeatable as a paragraph.

33
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,040
I don't want to have to apply a class to each and every one of them because it's really common on a

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Web site to have a block of text that might have five 10 20 or even 30 paragraphs.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,890
So in this specific instance let's forget about doing things the Benway and let's do this let's wrap

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:41,520
the heading in these three paragraphs in a new div so each two and these three paragraphs Let's cut

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:50,940
this into a clipboard and let's create a new div with a class of generic content container and then

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,270
within that new div go ahead and paste back in that content.

39
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,970
Now technically we could have added this class name to this existing column div but from a philosophical

40
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,450
standpoint in the future there might be some other type of content in this column content that we don't

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,590
want to be affected by our generic content container styles.

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:17,660
So by setting up a new div for this class we are keeping our column flexible and future proof.

43
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,600
All right but let's not split hairs.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,300
Our next bit of business is to create a new CSSA file for this new class name.

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
So within our modules CSSA folder.

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,850
Let's create a new file.

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,160
Let's name it underscore generic content container.

48
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:44,390
CSX was created rule generic content container.

49
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,770
Let's go ahead and save this file.

50
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:56,100
And before we forget let's go into our main styles does CSSA file and import this new file import modules

51
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,150
underscore generic content container.

52
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:08,220
And then let's jump back to that new CSSA file and let's create a rule that selects any paragraph elements

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,150
that are nested within this element.

54
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,600
All right.

55
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,060
And how do we want to style those paragraphs.

56
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,850
Well if we look at our design file this looks like a larger than normal line height meaning there's

57
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,300
more space in between each line.

58
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,140
So let's say line high.

59
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,070
One point six five line height is one of the few properties that doesn't require a unit of measurement.

60
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,860
So we don't need to say pixels or REM.

61
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,330
You can just include this number and hit save.

62
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,010
I think that looks a lot better.

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,620
Let's also give these paragraphs a slightly larger font size.

64
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,420
So currently they're using the browser default which is 16 pixels.

65
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,780
Why don't we go ahead and bump them up to 18 pixels.

66
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,310
But we want to specify that in terms of REM so we can just say 18 divided by 16 let's copy that to our

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:08,000
clipboard paste it in and then say REM looks good next.

68
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,280
I think we should increase the margin between the paragraphs.

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:20,380
So let's say margin let's bump up the vertical margin to 1.8 RAM and have the horizontal margins stay

70
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,190
at zero.

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,490
I think that extra bit of space looks good.

72
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,070
If we compare this with our design file the next thing that I see is that links within a paragraph should

73
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,100
be bold.

74
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,130
So for example this element.

75
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:45,290
So in our CSX we could nest a rule within this rule and select any link elements like this.

76
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,750
But personally I don't like to nest more than one layer deep in my CSX.

77
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,870
So instead I will do this I'll create a new rule and create a descendant selector like this.

78
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,190
So any links that live within a paragraph within this class should use a bold font weight.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,800
So let's go with the font weight of 700.

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,000
By the way a font weight of 400 is considered normal or standard.

81
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,750
So if I want something to be extra bold we can go with 700.

82
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,340
That looks better.

83
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,710
And we also saw in the design file that the link should be orange.

84
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,530
Now instead of defining that orange color within this rule I think we are safe to actually define it

85
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,540
globally as a fallback for all links on the page.

86
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,420
So within our CSSA base folder Let's go ahead and open up a global dossier.

87
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,630
Let's create a new rule that targets all links on the page and gives them a color of our main orange

88
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,580
variable.

89
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,010
All right so I'm not seeing that change take place.

90
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,170
I'm going to check the command line to see if something went wrong.

91
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,640
And it looks like we have an error message that main orange is undefined.

92
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,400
This is because in our main styles does CSSA file we are importing the global file before we've imported

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,740
the variables file.

94
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,640
And this is where the main orange value lives.

95
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,900
So to fix the error.

96
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,990
Let's just go ahead and cut the global line and move it after variables and mix in.

97
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,970
So pasted in here.

98
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,650
Go ahead and save that.

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,320
And we're back in business.

100
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:32,100
Now you might be curious as to why I chose to set up all links on the page globally to be orange.

101
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:38,650
But when it came to making this link bold we defined that only within our generic content container

102
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,320
rule.

103
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,640
Well my thought process behind that is that I know for a fact we are never ever ever going to want to

104
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,520
use the web browser default color of blue for any link on the page.

105
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,320
So setting a baseline link color of orange doesn't feel like it's hurting us in any way because that

106
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,730
default shade of blue was never going to be used anyways.

107
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,290
But when it comes to font weight there are plenty of links on the page that shouldn't be bold.

108
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,430
So we want to leave that browser default of links being not bold intact.

109
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:16,780
This will save us extra work later on we won't have to tell the links in the header to not be bold.

110
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,950
They just won't be bold because that's the browser default.

111
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,800
All right so I promise I will end this tangent soon.

112
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,510
But the point that I'm trying to drive home here is that I want you to be very selective over what makes

113
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,240
the cut into your global CSSA file.

114
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,760
We don't want to make the mistake of polluting our global CSSA scope which is really one of the big

115
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,300
ideas behind the big methodology.

116
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,620
So the reason that the Benway would have had us out of class to each individual one of these paragraphs

117
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,490
is because styling elements directly like that avoids descendant selectors or generic type selectors

118
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,180
which really just means we are trying to avoid the cascade from surprising us or drowning us in 12 layers

119
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,660
of inheritance and overrides and specificity wars.

120
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:10,510
So we did go against the philosophy of bit by setting up this generic content container and using descendant

121
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:18,370
type selectors but in our defense we did keep the style scoped to this class and we will only apply

122
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,870
this class to elements if we are OK with all of their descendants being styled a specific way.

123
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,950
My personal rule of thumb is that if a piece of content looks like it might have been copied and pasted

124
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,980
from a word doc or if down the road our Web site is powered by a content management system or a blog

125
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,090
platform.

126
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,020
We can't expect every element of the content to be output with a class on it.

127
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,500
So basically for unique parts of our page where we as the developer are writing the HMO.

128
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:48,980
Sure.

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's go ahead and add classes to each element.

130
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,520
The Benway but four sections where the content is a bit more generic and streamlined and might come

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,430
from automated sources.

132
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,260
I think it's OK to use a setup like we have here.

133
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,680
All right.

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,190
So tangent officially over.

135
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,030
Let's jump back to the browser.

136
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,590
We've completed our fine tuning of the typography for this section.

137
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,960
But before we bring this lesson to a close let's see what things look like on a small screen.

138
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,490
Let me scroll up a bit.

139
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,180
All right so the first thing that I see is that we should probably add a bit of vertical margin for

140
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,850
small screens between this image and this heading.

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,350
This is an interesting situation because on larger screens we definitely do not need to add bottom margin

142
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,950
to this image but because our two call them lay up stacks to single call them on smaller screens.

143
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,500
We do want to add a bit of bottom margin here.

144
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,440
So here's how I would handle that situation over in our HMO.

145
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,170
Let's find that first column where that image lives.

146
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,760
Here it is.

147
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,570
I would just add an extra class to this first column let's call it row underscore underscore B for bottom

148
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,660
margin until medium.

149
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,750
Let's say this.

150
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,570
And then within our modules CSSA folder.

151
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,490
Let's open up road of CSX right above this line that uses the media equerry mixin.

152
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,590
Let's create a new rule that targets our new class name.

153
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,790
So it was underscore underscore be Marjan until medium.

154
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,720
So my thinking with this class name is that when a screen is really small Let's give it bottom margin.

155
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,570
So margin bottom go with one rim until medium.

156
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,690
So at this margin until a screen is large enough to be considered medium.

157
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:45,610
So now within this media inquiry Mixon that is targeting medium sized screens we can just say this class

158
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,820
name that we just created.

159
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,780
Copy that paste it in margin bottom should be reset to zero.

160
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,550
So let's save this perfect.

161
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,930
So now we have a bit of vertical spacing on small screens and we didn't create any unnecessary spacing

162
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,690
on larger screens.

163
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,460
I think the only other thing that I would change for small screens is that the font size for our generic

164
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,240
content container paragraphs looks a little bit large.

165
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,440
So why don't we do this in our generic content container file.

166
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:28,050
Why don't we take this font size cut it to our clipboard and use a media or a mix in say mix in at small

167
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,420
once the screen is large enough to be considered small instead of tiny or microscopic.

168
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,980
Go ahead and use that size.

169
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,090
And our baseline style doesn't even need a font size at all because it will just default to one REM.

170
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,740
So let's save that.

171
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,510
And I think that looks a bit better on mobile.

172
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,970
All right so I think that concludes our fine tuning of this type holography on a random note.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,120
Behind the scenes I'm going to remove the dash I from all of these images just so things look a bit

174
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,700
better during these lessons.

175
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,900
I won't bore you by filming that but I encourage you to remove the dash eyes as well.

176
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:11,470
Or you can always just download the source code that is included in each lesson referencing those files

177
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,060
can be a great tool if you get a bit off track.

178
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,110
All right so I just took care of that.

179
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,910
One other thing that I want to point out is that in an earlier lesson for one of our images I forgot

180
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,790
to include a W after I specified how white it is.

181
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,590
So let's add that up.

182
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,790
You can find the specific image that I'm referring to by running a command F or control f and searching

183
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,390
for our star landscape.

184
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:44,140
And this was on the Heidy API copy and that will bring this lesson to a close in the next section of

185
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,810
our course.

186
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,890
We will take a good time out.

187
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,150
We're going to learn about one of the most powerful features of get and that is branches.

188
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,990
We will learn what get branches are and how to begin using them because we are going to leverage branches

189
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,040
as we begin to work on the next section of our site.

190
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,610
The our features section and don't worry styling This section will not be as tedious as it was to style

191
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,000
this section.

192
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm fully aware that the last several lessons where we've been styling this content probably weren't

193
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,880
the most exciting lessons in the world but the good news is that we made it through and in the process.

194
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:28,300
I feel like we've taken our CSSA organization skills to the next level and now you and I speak some

195
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,030
of the same language and think some of the same thoughts in terms of how CSSA should be structured.

196
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,130
So that means that when it comes time to style the remaining sections of the site I think things will

197
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,710
feel a bit easier a bit more natural.

198
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,500
Not to mention all of the reusable blocks we've created so far that we can continue to leverage again

199
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,360
and again.

200
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,010
So I'm excited to jump into the next section with you.

201
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,380
This is definitely one of the times in the course where I feel like we are shifting into a higher gear.

202
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:00,530
It's going to be a lot of fun let's keep rolling along and I will see you in the next lesson.
