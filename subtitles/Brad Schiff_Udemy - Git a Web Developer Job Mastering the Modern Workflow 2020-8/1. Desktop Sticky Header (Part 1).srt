00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,390
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,840
In this lesson we will make a few enhancements to our Web sites header for larger screens.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,700
But before we dive into that let's first take care of our get repository.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,290
So over in the command line we see that we currently have a branch named reveal on scroll checked out.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,520
And in our previous lesson we completed this branch's functionality.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,190
So let's go ahead and commit any recent changes and then merge this branch back into master.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,120
So let's run a get status to see what has changed recently.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,560
All of these changes look good.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,950
They all look related to the reveal on scroll functionality.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,810
So I'm going to add everything to my staging area get add dash a.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,340
All right.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,530
And now we can commit that staging area.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,120
So get commit.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's include a message.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:02,580
So dash am open up quotes completed the reveal on scroll behavior.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:02,930
All right.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,010
So we've saved and committed our changes.

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,580
Now we can switch back to our master branch get check out master.

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,070
And now we just want to merge the reveal on scroll branch back into the master branch.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,190
So we just say get merge reveal on scroll all right.

21
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,120
So at this point our master branch has our latest code.

22
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:33,250
So now we want to create a new branch off of it where we can work on the desktop sticky header features.

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,130
So to create a new branch let's say get check out dash B.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
And then the name of the branch.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,030
Let's call this new branch sticky header.

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,820
All right.

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,190
So we are now working within the new branch.

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,840
Let's get started.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,840
So in this lesson we want to make this top header sticky for larger screens.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,330
So that means that as we scroll down the page we want that header to stick to the top of the viewport.

31
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,750
So let's make that happen.

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:12,910
Let's write a bit of CSX so over in our text editor let's open up app assets styles modules and let's

33
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:21,020
jump into the site header CSX file so here we see that we already have a media query targeting screens

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,500
that are at least medium or larger.

35
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,510
So within this media query let's just say position fixed.

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,420
This will lock the element to the top of the screen even as we scroll.

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,880
So let's save this and test it out in the browser.

38
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,460
So now even as we scroll we see that our header stays locked to the top but I'm noticing a design problem.

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,300
So the semi transparent blue background of our header works well when it's positioned here overlapping

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,370
the top of this blue sky photo.

41
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,970
But once we scroll down a bit and it's overlapping a white background the header bar is just too transparent

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,310
it's too light and it's making these links really difficult to read.

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,750
So what I think we should do is let the header bar use that transparent light blue color when we are

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,140
scrolled to the very top of the page.

45
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,330
But once we've scrolled down a bit maybe this far let's transition and fade the headers background color

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,740
to use a much darker less transparent blue.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,780
Now in order to modify the page on the fly like that we are going to need to use javascript.

48
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:33,570
So let's jump over to our text editor and create a new javascript module file.

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:46,340
So within app assets scripts modules let's create a new file let's name this new file sticky header

50
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:57,270
dot J.S. let's begin with a class and let's name it sticky header and then down below this class we

51
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:04,140
know that we need to export this so we can use it in another file so let's say export default and then

52
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,910
the name of the class sticky header let's go ahead and save this file and before we forget let's include

53
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,200
it or import it within our main app J.S. file so within our scripts folder here is app J.S. let's go

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:28,080
ahead and import that new file so let's drop down to a new line and say import sticky header from so

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,800
dot slash to go into the modules folder and then grab the file named sticky header.

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,420
All right.

57
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,080
So we've imported the file.

58
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,750
Now we just need to create a new instance of that class.

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,380
So down here let's drop down to a new line.

60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,800
Let's create a new variable and name it sticky header.

61
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,030
This instance of the class or this variable this object will begin with a lowercase s and we will say

62
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,000
that it equals a new instance of the sticky header class.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,580
Let's save this file and then jump back into our new sticky header module so within our class we know

64
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,000
that we are going to need a constructor function.

65
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:16,840
So let's say constructor and let's stop for a second to think about what we actually need to do.

66
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,860
So back in the browser once we scroll down about this far we want to target the site header and give

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,600
it a modifier.

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,610
Class that makes it darker.

69
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,020
So why don't we begin by creating a property that points towards the site header DOM element.

70
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:40,120
So back in our constructor function let's say this dot and let's name the property site header and let's

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,840
set that to equal document dot query selector and it has a class.

72
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,980
So a dot of site dash header.

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,560
All right.

74
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,680
Now let's ask ourselves how are we going to add a modifier class to this element at precisely the right

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,580
moment.

76
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,000
Well we can just listen to the web browser scroll event and once the user has scrolled down let's say

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,810
about 60 pixels from the top.

78
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,310
Well at that point we can add the dark modifier class to the header and then if they ever scroll back

79
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,790
up so that they are less than 60 pixels scrolled from the top we can remove that dark modifier class.

80
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,800
Let me show you how we would do that.

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,510
So below our constructor but still within our class let's create a method named events and up in our

82
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,660
constructor let's be sure to call the events method right away.

83
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,980
So this dot events.

84
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,400
OK.

85
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:40,840
Now within our events method let's target the overall window browser object and we want to add an event

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,260
listener.

87
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:50,440
So dot add event listener type of event we want to listen for is a scroll event after the quotes we

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,210
include a comma and then this is a function that should run in response to this event.

89
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,100
But as we've learned we should care about performance or efficiency.

90
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:06,340
Remember that as we scroll the web browser is going to call the scroll event many many times.

91
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,220
So why don't we use the load Ash throttle tool here because we don't need to know the browser scroll

92
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,430
position every millisecond or after every single pixel that's scrolled.

93
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,410
We really only need to know its value maybe every 200 milliseconds so up at the very top of this file.

94
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:31,720
Let's import in the load Ash throttle feature so let's say import throttle from quotes and we want to

95
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,420
use the low dash package and then look inside it just for the throttle tool.

96
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,680
OK.

97
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,620
Now for the second argument here after this comma we can just say throttle parentheses inside those

98
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,320
parentheses first we give it a function let's actually give it an arrow function so that the this keyword

99
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,510
doesn't change.

100
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,570
So another set of parentheses after that an arrow symbol so equal saying greater than and then we haven't

101
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,690
created this method yet but let's imagine that we have a method named run on scroll so to call it you

102
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:12,840
would just say this dot run on scroll in parentheses to call that method.

103
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,170
OK.

104
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:20,470
Now after that most recent set of parentheses add a comma and then the second argument is how many milliseconds

105
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,040
we want to wait before this function can be called again.

106
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,350
I'm going to go with 200 milliseconds OK.

107
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,680
Now we'd better go ahead and create a method with this matching name so right below the events method

108
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:42,460
let's say run on scroll and let's just set up an if statement that checks to see if the user has scrolled

109
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,110
down 60 pixels or not so we can say if parentheses curly brackets right after the closing curly bracket

110
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,610
for the if let's also add in else block so else curly brackets OK.

111
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:05,430
And for the if condition we can just say if window dot scroll why this is a property that the browser

112
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,540
makes available to us.

113
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,450
It's how many pixels you've scrolled down from the very top so we can just say if that value is greater

114
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,570
than and I'm just choosing this number you can tweak this number a bit but I'm going to say 60 pixels

115
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,970
if that's the case.

116
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,640
If they've scroll down that far or farther than we would want to add the CSF modifier class that makes

117
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,590
this top bar a darker or less see through shade of blue.

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:40,180
So this dot site header dot class list dot ad and let's give it a modifier.

119
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,780
Class site header dash dash dark.

120
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:45,950
OK.

121
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,990
And then for the else block if the user has scrolled and the number is not larger than 60 we would want

122
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,410
to do the opposite of this.

123
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:53,640
Right.

124
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,760
We would want to remove the dark modifier class so to save some typing we can just copy this line into

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:09,090
our clipboard and then in the else block pasted in and just change add here to instead be remove.

126
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,070
Let's go ahead and save this file.

127
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,370
But before we jump to the browser I want to first hop into our CSX and create a new rule that targets

128
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,830
are dark modifier class.

129
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,450
So back within sight header CSX within this media query that targets medium screens and larger.

130
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,050
Let's create a new rule.

131
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,940
Let's use the ampersand symbol which will give us dot site header and then let's add dash dash.

132
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,570
Dark.

133
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,350
And from here it's as simple as adjusting the background color.

134
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,650
Let's use RGA.

135
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,360
So it's still a little bit transparent and instead of using our main blue color I'm actually going to

136
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,180
use a darker blue.

137
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,690
So let's try 23 for the Red 51 for the green seventy two for the blue and let's try.

138
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,940
Eighty five percent transparency.

139
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,660
Let's save this file and jump over to the browser and if we start scrolling down perfect we see that

140
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,110
the header transitions to the darker background.

141
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:17,520
But if we scroll back up the header reverts to its normal style.

142
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,820
Perfect.

143
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Now before we bring this lesson to a close there's one final detail that I want to work on.

144
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,040
I think it would look nice if when the dark header is being used if we also shrunk this top left logo

145
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,100
to be small enough so that it could fit within the header bar that way as we scroll down the page the

146
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,760
logo isn't using up any precious real estate.

147
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:46,790
Now all we need to do to make this happen is to jump back to our text editor and hop into our site header

148
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,160
CSX file and we are looking for the logo rule.

149
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:58,760
So if we scroll down a bit here is the logo rule and we already have a media query that's only targeting

150
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,620
screens that are medium or larger.

151
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,660
So within this media query let's create a new rule.

152
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:11,060
Let's target the site header class when it's using the dark modifier out of space to create a descendant

153
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,850
selector and then just use the ampersand symbol which will give us the selector for the logo element.

154
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,100
So this selector will target the logo only when the dark header is being used.

155
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,460
So let's open up curly brackets and let's shrink the element by using the transform property and then

156
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,520
using the scale function.

157
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,390
So if one is the elements natural size let's try.

158
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,220
Point five seven.

159
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,460
Let's go ahead and save this file and check out the browser.

160
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:46,220
So if I scroll down a bit cool you can see the logo shrinks but it's just a little bit too tall.

161
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,920
It would be nice if it vertically fit within the blue bar.

162
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,310
So let's reduce that a bit instead of point five seven let's try.

163
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,660
Point five six still doesn't fit perfectly.

164
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:04,830
Let's try reducing it down to point five five perfect for scroll back up to the very top.

165
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,240
It's back to its original styling but I think this could be even better if the logo animated or transitioned

166
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
did size change.

167
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,260
So back within our CSX within the baseline rule for the logo let's just add a transition property and

168
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,110
say that the transform value should transition smoothly over the course of about a third of a second.

169
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,580
And let's use the ease out transition style so let's save this.

170
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,060
And check out the browser.

171
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:40,790
And now when we scroll down we see that the logo size smoothly changes perfect and that's actually going

172
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,790
to bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson we will learn how to highlight links in the header

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,590
to correspond with the section of the page that we are currently viewing or that we've currently scrolled

174
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,020
to.

175
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,120
This feature should be a lot of fun to set up.

176
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,100
I think it has the potential to really improve the user experience of our site.

177
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,630
Let's keep rolling along and I will see you in the next lesson.
