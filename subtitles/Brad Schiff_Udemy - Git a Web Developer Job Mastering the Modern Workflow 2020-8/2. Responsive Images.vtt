Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.020
In this lesson we will learn about responsive images.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.730
We will begin by asking the question what is a responsive image and why do we need it.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.920
Next we will look at an example page that I set up and we will see that there are two unique situations

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.730
when we would want to use a responsive image in each of these situations calls for different code.

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.470
And finally by the end of the lesson we will apply what we've learned by beginning to add responsive

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.080
images to our travel Web site.

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.250
All right let's begin.

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.140
Up at the top.

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.870
Number one what is a responsive image and why do we need it a responsive image is very similar to a

11
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.370
traditional image.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.450
So for example here is a traditional image.

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.410
So right now we are looking at an example page that I set up for this lesson.

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.120
And here's what it looks like in the browser.

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
Now this image file is well suited for a desktop monitor or a large laptop.

16
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.270
But if we view this same page on a smartphone form factor I immediately see two big problems.

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.630
Number one is that we are forcing smartphone users to download way more data than is necessary for them

18
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.880
to see a crisp photo of the dog.

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.640
The smartphone users should not have to download an image that is almost two thousand pixels wide when

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.180
an image that is about 500 pixels would do just fine.

21
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.720
So currently this is needlessly burning through this smartphone users data plan.

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
The second big problem is simply the way that the image is cropped right.

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.750
So this image is very wide and not very tall.

24
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.500
Now this cropping and aspect ratio works wonderfully on a large wide screen but on a smaller screen

25
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.540
it just feels kind of scrunched up I think on smaller screens the image would look better if it was

26
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.130
closer to a square.

27
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.610
And if we could crop around the dog's face very tightly.

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.030
All right.

29
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.560
So clearly this page in its current form is not ideal.

30
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.970
And the problem is that this traditional image element is forcing us to send one single image file to

31
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970
every user and device under the sun.

32
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.380
Instead what we need is a way to send different image files to different screen sizes and that is exactly

33
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.510
what responsive images do.

34
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.930
So right now we are going to work through two unique examples of converting this traditional image into

35
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.610
a responsive image.

36
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.700
Now the reason I said two examples instead of just one is because there are two distinct reasons to

37
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.000
use a responsive image in the first place.

38
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.600
And depending on which reason or situation you're dealing with you need to write different code.

39
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.010
All right.

40
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.520
So the first situation when you would use a responsive image let's call it the art direction and cropping

41
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.480
situation.

42
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.600
And let's call the second situation the image resolution and file size situation.

43
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.800
So in our first example we will look at the art direction and cropping situation.

44
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.810
So I've prepared these three images small medium and large and in our second example we will look at

45
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.980
the image resolution and file size situation.

46
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.420
So for that example I've prepared these three images small medium and large.

47
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.360
Now in this example these three images are identical.

48
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.240
They are the exact same photograph.

49
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.390
They are cropped exactly the same.

50
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.970
The only difference is their size.

51
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.410
All right.

52
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.400
So let's work through both examples.

53
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.850
Let's begin with the first one.

54
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.930
The art direction and cropping situation.

55
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.510
Let's get started by jumping into our text editor and I'm going to delete this traditional image so

56
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.370
we can start with a clean slate.

57
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.490
So when you want to send different images to different users because of art direction or cropping reasons

58
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.380
you use the picture element.

59
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.260
Now within the picture element we want to begin with a traditional image element.

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.580
Right.

61
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.330
So image source and we want to begin with the smallest image.

62
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.270
So for this example page I have images folder and let's grab the smallest image.

63
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.940
So its name is Dog crop small.

64
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.470
Let's be sure to provide an altered value say puppy in the sand and close out this image element.

65
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.160
So if we save this and refresh the browser no surprises here.

66
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.820
So that image will be used for all devices.

67
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.090
But here's where things get interesting within this picture element we can create another element named

68
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.310
source.

69
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.400
And within this source element we can create a media query.

70
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.300
So let's create a media query that targets any screens that are 760 pixels or larger so we can just

71
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.730
say minimum width min width 760 pixels.

72
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.610
And what do we want to do for screens that are in this size or larger.

73
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.960
We no longer want to use these small image of the.

74
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.800
Instead when a screen is this size or larger we want to use the medium sized image of the dog.

75
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.760
So within the source element we can just use a new attribute named source set and point towards the

76
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.840
medium image.

77
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.770
So images dog crop medium dot J.

78
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.580
So if we save this file and refresh in the browser if I start to expand this window as soon as it reaches

79
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.570
a width of 760 pixels it switches from the small image to the medium image.

80
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.100
Let's go ahead and set up our large image to do that.

81
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.020
We can just create another source element.

82
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.280
So let's create a media query that selects any screens that are at least twelve hundred pixels or larger.

83
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.810
So if a screen meets this condition we want to use the large image.

84
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.810
So source set and then we just point towards the large image dog crop large dot j peg.

85
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:08.660
So if we save and refresh as I start to make this window larger once it hits twelve hundred pixels it

86
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.180
begins to use the large image.

87
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.120
So let's see all three sizes back to back really quickly.

88
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.930
So here's large here's medium and here's small.

89
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.800
So that brings example one to a close.

90
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:27.140
This is how you create a responsive image when you need to have fine grained control over how your images

91
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.880
are being cropped at different screen sizes.

92
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.330
All right.

93
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:37.140
So when you need to use a responsive image for Art Direction reasons you use the picture element.

94
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.540
Now let's move on to example number two.

95
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.150
Let's delete this code.

96
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.140
So we've covered the art direction and cropping situation.

97
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.900
Now let's talk about the image resolution and file size situation.

98
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.030
So in this example we are dealing with these three images small medium and large.

99
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.720
In this example we love the way that the image is cropped.

100
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.410
We want it to be cropped like this for every screen size.

101
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.380
However even though that's the case there's still no reason to make a smartphone user download this

102
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.550
large image that is intended for desktop monitors.

103
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.810
That would be a waste of their data plan and it would make the page load slower than if they could download

104
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.980
the small image instead.

105
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.130
In this case we do not need to use the picture element.

106
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:30.920
Instead we can begin with a traditional image element and all we need to do is create a smorgasbord

107
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.200
of image file options for the web browser and device to choose from.

108
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.000
So we use the source set attribute.

109
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.830
And within this one attribute we are going to list all of our images.

110
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:50.240
So let's start with the small image dog resolution small dot JPEG.

111
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:57.140
Then we just add a comma and list out our medium sized image comma.

112
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.850
Let's include the large image images dog resolution large dog JPEG.

113
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.760
So in this situation we are taking a very hands off approach.

114
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.810
We don't need to write a media query.

115
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.470
We don't have any opinion whatsoever about when the browser or device should use each one of these images.

116
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:22.010
The browser and the device can figure that out on their own right because devices are self-aware.

117
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.060
They know the size of their own screen and they also know the pixel density of their screen.

118
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.470
So browsers and devices are intelligent enough to choose the smallest image file that will still result

119
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.270
in a crisp picture.

120
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.820
However as a developer we do need to help the web browser out a little bit because web browsers can

121
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.340
figure out the size of an image but not until it's downloaded it and we don't want the web browser to

122
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.160
have to download all three images that would defeat the entire purpose of this responsive image.

123
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.860
So what we need to do is tell the browser the size of each image so it knows which one to use.

124
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:04.220
So for example after we list the small image before the comma we just include a space and then we say

125
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.710
five hundred and seventy W..

126
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.080
This is our way of saying hey web browser.

127
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.970
This image is 570 pixels wide.

128
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.390
All right.

129
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.100
And then we just want to do that for the medium image as well.

130
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.060
So after the file name a space and this image is twelve hundred pixels wide.

131
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:28.490
And after the large image file name includes space and this image is one thousand nine hundred and twenty

132
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.840
pixels wide.

133
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.250
Now before we save this and tested out in the browser let's add a quick alter value puppy in the sand.

134
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.580
Let's save the file and refresh in the browser.

135
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.340
So my web browser google chrome looked at the pixel density of my monitor and the current size of my

136
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.850
browser window and it determined that the small image was large enough to result in a crisp picture.

137
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.520
And if I start to make this window larger as soon as the small image would be too small and it would

138
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.620
begin to pixel late or blur Google Chrome knows to switch to the medium image and obviously if we make

139
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:12.820
the window even larger at some point it will need to switch to the large image in order to stay crisp.

140
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.130
Now different devices and different browsers have different ways of determining when they should use

141
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.300
which image.

142
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.320
So I want to point out and remind you that this is a very hands off approach.

143
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:29.740
We are not trying to micromanage when the browser should use which image we provide a smorgasbord of

144
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.510
options.

145
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.940
We take our hands off the keyboard and say this is out of our control.

146
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.840
It is up to the device to make the smartest image choice.

147
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.240
Now really quickly before we move on I want to show you an example of why you shouldn't stress over

148
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.460
which image the device is choosing.

149
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.720
So for example in Google Chrome if I refresh the page while the browser window is relatively large and

150
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.190
I start to shrink the screen you'll notice that it never uses the medium sized image.

151
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.740
And even at the smallest size that I can drag to it's not using the small image.

152
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:08.770
This is because Chrome is intelligent enough to know that if an image was sharp enough for a large window

153
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:15.370
it's obviously sharp enough for a small window and there's no sense in burning through extra data to

154
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.650
download those smaller images.

155
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.110
Now that is a great feature but it can be a bit frustrating when you're testing things out and developing

156
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.050
on your computer.

157
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.170
So you might ask yourself how can I make sure that my small image is set up correctly.

158
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:34.300
You can do a few things you can clear your browsers cache and not visit this page until you've already

159
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:41.500
made the browser window small or you can open up a new incognito window and visit the page and the larger

160
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.720
image will no longer be in the browser's cache so it will download the smartest image choice for this

161
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.060
window size which is obviously the small image.

162
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.560
All right.

163
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.650
So at this point we've worked through the two examples.

164
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.610
We now know the two different reasons to create a responsive image.

165
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.310
The first was centered around art direction and how we cropped the images a different screen sizes in

166
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.730
the second situation was more concerned with image resolution file size and making sure that the page

167
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.160
loads quickly.

168
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.720
Now we are ready to move on to the final part of this lesson and apply what we've learned so let's work

169
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.550
together to add responsive images to our travel agency Web site.

170
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.290
Let's get started.

171
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.750
If you need to pause this lesson for just a moment to get things set up that's OK.

172
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.360
But to get things rolling in the command line.

173
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.380
Just use NPM run Dev.

174
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:42.170
And then in your browser you can visit local host colon three thousand so let's give ourselves the task

175
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.340
of making the image in this large hero block responsive.

176
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:52.460
Currently if we make our browser window smaller we see that the way this image is cropped is problematic

177
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.640
for smaller screen sizes.

178
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.610
We know exactly how to fix this.

179
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.170
So let's get to work.

180
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:04.910
Go ahead and open up the travel site project folder in your favorite text editor and within the app

181
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.540
folder open up the index start each TMM file.

182
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.090
So let's look for that large hero section.

183
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.110
Here it is.

184
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.370
And here is the image element that we want to replace.

185
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.150
Before we delete this line of code though we see that the image file we are currently pointing towards

186
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.680
is named Hero large.

187
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.680
And if we look within the image folder for the project.

188
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:34.250
So travel site app assets images we see that here is that hero large file and you will notice that there

189
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:40.520
is another file named Hiro medium hero small and even hero smaller.

190
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.730
And all of these images are cropped differently.

191
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:50.180
So let's go ahead and delete this traditional image element and replace it with the picture element

192
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.920
that we learned about earlier.

193
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.440
So within the picture element we want to create a traditional image element and we always want to begin

194
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.680
with the smallest image first.

195
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:07.850
So image source and the name of the smallest image is hero dash dash smaller.

196
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:13.640
So we want to go into the assets folder and then the images folder and the name of the file as hero

197
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.240
dash dash smaller dot JPEG.

198
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:25.390
And while we are here let's be sure to include an old value let's say coastal view of ocean and mountains.

199
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.070
So if we save this and check our browser we see that that looks a lot better.

200
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.990
This image is cropped in a way so that it is tall enough and creates enough space for our content for

201
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.030
the section.

202
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:37.640
All right.

203
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.040
And four screens that are slightly larger.

204
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.110
Instead of using hero dash dash smaller we want to use hero dash dash.

205
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.010
Small.

206
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.330
So within this picture element we just create a new source element and let's set up a media query.

207
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.900
Let's say that if a screen is at least 640 pixels or larger.

208
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:04.030
Stop using the smaller image and begin using source set.

209
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:10.370
The next largest image which is in the assets folder in the images folder and its name is hero dash

210
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:20.360
dash small to if we save this and make our browser window just a tiny bit wider we see that it hits

211
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.050
the break point and swaps to the new image.

212
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.930
So now we want to do the same thing for the medium and large image.

213
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:34.670
So let's actually just copy and paste this line of code and let's duplicate it a few times.

214
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.010
So this line of code is good to go.

215
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.030
Let's edit this line of code.

216
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:46.520
So instead of small let's change this to medium and let's change the media query to use a min width

217
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.000
of nine hundred and ninety pixels.

218
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:56.960
And for this top source line let's change this to large and let's change its media query to one thousand

219
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.240
three hundred and eighty pixels.

220
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.450
So let's save this.

221
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.470
And check out the browser we start making the window larger.

222
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.050
This is now using the medium image.

223
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.680
And if we go even larger This is now using the large image.

224
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.420
Now you might think that our job here is done.

225
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:20.830
We encountered an art direction and cropping situation and we created a responsive image.

226
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:28.370
But what if I told you we can also combine the image resolution and file size situation into this responsive

227
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.140
image.

228
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:35.940
So for example when my browser window is quite large like this this image file is one thousand nine

229
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.010
hundred and twenty pixels wide.

230
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:43.270
Now that looks great on my monitor because the monitor I'm using right now does not have a very high

231
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.310
pixel density.

232
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.890
But what if I was using a four K monitor or even a five K monitor.

233
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.960
In that case we would want to send an even larger image that is using this exact same cropping ratio.

234
00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:01.420
And if you look in the project's image folder you will notice that that larger higher resolution copy

235
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.120
of each image already exists.

236
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.740
So for example here is hero dash dash large.

237
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.070
And here we see hero dash dash large high DP eye.

238
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.310
So these two files use the exact same cropping ratio but this one is double the size.

239
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:25.180
So within our code within the source element for the large image within the source set attribute we

240
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:33.010
can simply provide another image so we add a comma and a space and then we say assets images hero dash

241
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:41.140
dash large dash high dash DCI dot J peg and then remember we want to tell the browser the size of each

242
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.440
of these images so it knows which one to use.

243
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.110
So for this first file it has a width of one thousand nine hundred and twenty pixels.

244
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.570
And the high DP version is double that.

245
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.100
So it has a width of three thousand eight hundred and forty pixels.

246
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:04.150
Let's go ahead and add in the high DP versions for the medium small and smaller crops.

247
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:10.720
So that way if someone's laptop or tablet or smartphone is using a retina display or something similar

248
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.710
they will have an image large enough to result in a crisp picture.

249
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:25.750
So on this medium line let's add in a second image assets images hero dash dash medium high DP guy and

250
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.830
then we want to add in the width values for both of these images.

251
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:36.220
So the baseline medium file is one thousand three hundred and eighty pixels wide and the high DP version

252
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.420
is double that two thousand seven hundred sixty pixels wide.

253
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.090
Let's do the same thing for this small version.

254
00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:53.350
So we add a comma assets images hero dash dash small high DP by the baseline version of this image is

255
00:18:53.350 --> 00:19:00.190
nine hundred and ninety pixels wide the high DP version is one thousand nine hundred and eighty pixels

256
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.640
wide.

257
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:09.190
And finally for the smallest crop we want to change this attribute from source to source set and then

258
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.440
we just want to add in the second image.

259
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:18.630
So karma assets images hero dash dash smaller high DP.

260
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:28.050
So the baseline copy of this image is six hundred and forty pixels wide and the high DP version is 1280.

261
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.410
So let's save this file and check things out in the browser.

262
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:38.680
So now we have a responsive image that sends different crops to different screen sizes and at each unique

263
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:46.720
crop it can send a high CPI version if necessary that will bring this lesson to a close and in our next

264
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:53.420
lesson I will show you a few quick tips to help you test and experiment with your responsive images.

265
00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.390
I will see you in the next lesson.
