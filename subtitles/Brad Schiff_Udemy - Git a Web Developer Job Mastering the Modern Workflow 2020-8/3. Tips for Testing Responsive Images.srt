00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello everyone in this lesson I will show you a few quick tips that can help you when you are experimenting

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,580
with responsive images.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,410
Let's dive right in.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,300
So for the first tip let's use the large hero image as an example.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,820
Let's imagine you are resizing your browser window to test the responsive image and make sure it behaves

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,550
the way you expect it to.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,250
Now if you resize your browser window very slowly it's not too difficult to see when the image snaps

8
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,350
and switches to a new image but other times it's not so clear.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,520
And sometimes you want to remove all guesswork from the equation and you want to be able to identify

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,880
exactly which image file you are currently looking at.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,050
Well if you open the project folder for the travel site and go into the app folder and then the assets

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,030
folder in the images folder you will notice that for every image file for example hero dash dash large.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,060
There is a corresponding hero dash dash large dash.

14
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,310
So every image in this folder has a counterpart that ends in dash II.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,160
I chose I to stand for information but that's not important.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,200
I created these dash I copies of each image for you so you can clearly see when an image is being used.

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,740
So for example in our HMO within the source element for the large crop right before the end of the file

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,250
name before the dot JPA let's add a dash II.

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,680
So if I save this and check out the browser and expand the browser window to use the large crop we see

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,610
that the dash i version of the image file has a transparent black overlay and in white text we see the

21
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,460
dimensions of the image.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:02,680
So 19:20 wide by 6:54 tall and we could go ahead and add the dash II to the medium crop as well.

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,320
So now when we resize our browser we see those numbers change.

24
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:13,000
So it is abundantly clear when the two images are swapping back and forth.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,390
And this is not limited to the large block image I've created dash I versions of every image we are

26
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,370
going to use.

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,530
So that's the first quick tip throughout the rest of the course.

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,400
Feel free to use that dash version of images when you are experimenting and testing things out.

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,410
But for now let's move on to another tip.

30
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:39,310
The next tip that I will cover has to do with the topic of simulating and testing different pixel densities.

31
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:47,450
So for example we are currently seeing the large crop of this image which is included here in our HMO.

32
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,340
This image is about 2000 pixels wide but you will remember in our previous lesson we also included a

33
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,830
high speed version.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,560
There is almost 4000 pixels wide.

35
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,780
Now my web browser Google Chrome is intelligent enough to know that based on my monitor's pixel density

36
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,640
I don't need the Heidi API version.

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,230
The version that is almost 2000 pixels will result in a crisp photo on my monitor.

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,010
That's great.

39
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,710
But as a developer I want to be able to test all of the images I want to see.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,490
The Heidi API version in action to make sure that I didn't include a typo in its filename.

41
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,650
So the question becomes how can I test out the high DPMI version.

42
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,550
How can I see that image in my browser here.

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,650
If the actual monitor I'm using isn't Heidy API or your situation might be the opposite.

44
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,560
If your screen is Heidy API then you would want to be able to test this image to make sure that you

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,910
didn't include a typo in the file name.

46
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,630
Well luckily the Google Chrome web browser has a developer tool that can help us.

47
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,630
Now if you've been using a different browser that's OK.

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,180
Everyone is entitled to their own preference.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,330
There's no such thing as the quote best web browser but I do think it's fair to say that Google Chrome

50
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,420
has its fair share of amazing developer tools and if you're not already using Chrome I think it's worth

51
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,920
a try.

52
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,220
So check this out and Google Chrome anywhere on the page.

53
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:22,270
We can right click and choose inspect that will open a developer tools window and now I want you to

54
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,960
click this icon.

55
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,830
The icon that looks like a couple of devices.

56
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,440
Now if I click back to the main chrome window we see a few options towards the top of the screen.

57
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,560
So right now Chrome is emulating a Galaxy S 5.

58
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,440
We could set this to an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 6 you get the idea.

59
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,720
But in this situation what we want to do is set it to responsive.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,830
And now I can drag to simulate any size that I want let me drive this a bit further to full screen and

61
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,880
remember our goal was to simulate different pixel densities.

62
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,980
So to do that you might need to click these three dots in the top right corner and be sure to check

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,620
the show device pixel ratio option so once that option is checked we now see this option.

64
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,890
And before I change this value from one to two.

65
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:23,960
Let me jump to my HMO and make sure that both versions of this large crop are using the dash version

66
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,090
so we can easily distinguish between the two.

67
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,410
So let's say this.

68
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:29,930
All right.

69
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:37,260
So we are currently using a device pixel ratio of 1 which is what my monitor actually is and we see

70
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,950
the version of the image that is almost 2000 pixels.

71
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,090
Let's go ahead and simulate a device that has a higher pixel density.

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,110
So it's bumped this up to two.

73
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,620
And if I refresh the browser realizes that it now needs the version of the image that is almost 4000

74
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,730
pixels wide.

75
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,620
And more importantly the fact that this image is displaying it all means I can rest assured that I didn't

76
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,900
include a typo in this file name which was the entire point of this tip.

77
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,840
So just be aware that Chrome can help you when you are testing different characteristics of devices.

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,550
All right so now that we've tested these images and we know they are working correctly.

79
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,250
Let's go ahead and remove the dash.

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,690
I

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,580
perfect that will actually bring this lesson to a close.

82
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:31,170
I hope you now feel a bit more empowered in terms of experimenting with responsive images.

83
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:38,730
Now in our next lesson we are going to fine tune the mobile styles for this large here block and we

84
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,810
will also begin styling this intro section.

85
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,610
We now have all of the tools necessary to basically build out the entire design.

86
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,060
We are going to start making a lot of progress very quickly.

87
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,030
It's going to be a lot of fun and I will see you in the next lesson.
