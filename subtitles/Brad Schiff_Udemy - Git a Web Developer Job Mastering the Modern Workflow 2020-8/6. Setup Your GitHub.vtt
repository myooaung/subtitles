00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.270
Hello everyone in this lesson you will get started with get hub.

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.270
We have two main tasks in this lesson.

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.830
Number one you will create your own personal get her account and number two you will create a new repository

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.030
on your computer.

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.210
And this is the repot that you will be working in for the remainder of this course.

6
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.190
This is the repo in which we will build the mobile first web site together.

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.000
And by the end of this lesson this new repository will exist on both your computer and on get hub servers

8
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.340
tied to your own personal account so that you are able to push your progress to the server.

9
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.220
At the end of each lesson.

10
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.020
All right let's get started.

11
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.290
The first step is to create a good Hebb account.

12
00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.910
So open your web browser and go to get hub dot com from the get hub home page you can see there are

13
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.930
three fields here.

14
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.070
Pick a username your e-mail address and create a password.

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.620
Go ahead and fill those out.

16
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.200
Click sign up forget hub.

17
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.120
And if you are asked whether you want a free personal account or a premium account just know that we

18
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.530
are interested in the free account.

19
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.700
One of the main reasons that someone would be interested in the premium account is if you needed a private

20
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.970
repository in this course a public repository will do just fine.

21
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.340
And I do want to point out that a public repository doesn't mean that just anyone in the world can push

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.030
to your repo without your permission even though it is called a public Ribault only you will have permission

23
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.980
to push changes to it.

24
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.400
In this context the word public just means that everyone in the world can see your code.

25
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.480
So when you are working on a public Ribault you don't want to push any files that contain passwords.

26
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.510
Now this will not be a problem in this course because none of the files we create will contain passwords

27
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.420
but if you are working on a project in the future that does involve config files with passwords you

28
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.740
might consider a get a premium account.

29
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.440
Or you can use a free service named bitbucket and they do offer private repos for free.

30
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.210
OK with that public service announcement out of the way for this course a public Ribault will do just

31
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.050
fine which means a free account will do just fine.

32
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.550
So go ahead and complete the registration for your Get hub account.

33
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.150
Go ahead and pause this lesson while you create the account and once it's created come back and resume

34
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.010
the video.

35
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.130
Welcome back.

36
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.420
If you've made it this far in the lesson I will assume that you've created a get her account and that

37
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.490
you've signed in to that account and get her a dot com.

38
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.570
The next thing that we want to do is to create a brand new repo on get hub servers.

39
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.370
There are several places where we can create a new repo.

40
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.380
But let's try this one in the top right corner of the layout.

41
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
You'll see a plus symbol.

42
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.340
Go ahead and click that and then click new repository that will take you to the screen where we can

43
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.810
create new Ribault.

44
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.150
The first step is to choose a name.

45
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.180
Now you could name this anything you would like completely up to you.

46
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.390
The Web site that we are going to be building together in this course is for a fictional travel agency

47
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.680
so you could name this Ribault travel site.

48
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.990
Something along those lines.

49
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.250
Be sure to use dashes instead of spaces in your name but feel free to name the repo whatever you would

50
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.270
like.

51
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.080
We can leave the description blank for now.

52
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.900
Make sure that this is a public Ribault.

53
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.970
Next we see an option named initialize this repository with a read me.

54
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.060
This is often a very useful feature but in this specific instance we are going to leave it unchecked.

55
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.310
You can see the instructions say skip this step if you are importing an existing repository which is

56
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.920
exactly what we are doing today.

57
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.350
We just want an empty shell of a repo on get Hub's servers.

58
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.140
So leave this unchecked and then scroll down and click Create repository that will take you to the screen

59
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.530
which is the overview for the brand new repo.

60
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.690
And at this moment this repository is completely empty.

61
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.490
It's an empty shell of a repo.

62
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:24.790
On get hub servers and it is waiting it's just waiting for us to push something up to it.

63
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.080
This means that our next step is to create a new repository on our computers hard drive and then once

64
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.330
we've created it we can push it up to get hub.

65
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.270
So let's do that right now.

66
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.560
Let's create a new repo on our computer in our previous lesson.

67
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.740
I had to create a folder with a generic name like sites or projects and that contains the different

68
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.110
repots that we've been working on now instead of creating a new folder and running get in it and creating

69
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.900
things by hand I want to save you some time.

70
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.810
So I've created a repo that you can clone down to your computer and it will give you all of the starter

71
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.740
files for the site that we are going to be building together.

72
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.210
In this course.

73
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.560
So what I want you to do now is open your command line.

74
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.470
The first thing I want you to do in the command line is to navigate to that generic sites or project

75
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.830
folder or whatever you name wherever you're keeping it on your computer.

76
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.500
So in my case I would type CD space and then I'm just going to drag that folder onto my command line

77
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.440
and hit enter.

78
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.000
Now that we've navigated to that directory we can clone the repo that will give us the starter files

79
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:45.650
so to do that type in this command good space and then clone space and then type in this address HTP

80
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:58.670
ass colon forward slash forward slash get a dot com forward slash learn web code forward slash travel

81
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.680
dash sight dash phials dot get and then hit enter

82
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.500
that command might take a moment to complete but when it does if you check the generic sites or projects

83
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.820
folder you will notice a new folder named travel site files which I want you to immediately rename this

84
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.390
folder to whatever you named the get hub Ribault you created just a moment ago.

85
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.340
So for example the empty Get have repo we just created.

86
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.440
I named mine travel site.

87
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.000
You might have named it something else but whatever you named it aren't you go ahead and make this new

88
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.040
folder match that in name.

89
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.220
I'll change mine to just travel site OK.

90
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.720
And you might be wondering what's in this new folder.

91
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.770
Well it contains starter files for the website that we are going to be building together.

92
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.660
So here's an HMO file this code is currently not even importing any CSSA or javascript.

93
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.930
It's just bare bones HTL now that we can work on together.

94
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.960
You can see that most elements don't even have classes yet there are zero styling.

95
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.660
The whole point of this file is just so you don't have to type in dummy lordship some text and so that

96
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.090
we are working with a common base so that you and I are starting on the same page and we can move forward

97
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.860
together.

98
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.020
The repo that you just cloned also contains an assets folder inside that folder is a folder named images

99
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.030
and these are all of the image files that we will be using on the Web site.

100
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.240
Excellent.

101
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.360
Now we only have one remaining task in this lesson and that is we want to take this new repo on our

102
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.730
computer named travel site that contains the starter files and we want to push it up to get hub servers.

103
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.160
We want to push it into the empty shell of a repo that we created earlier in this lesson and to do that

104
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.430
we need to hop over to our command line let's navigate to the new repo on our computer so I'll type

105
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.580
CD space and then I'll drag this fall there.

106
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.090
But again you might have named it something different but the people that we just created on our computer

107
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.640
go ahead and drag it on top of your command line and hit enter.

108
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.730
OK.

109
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:16.630
Now we want to push this report up to the get hub servers but because we cloned this Ribault from an

110
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.790
existing Ribault get would try to push it to its original destination.

111
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:32.410
So for example if you type get remote and then a space dash V and then hit enter and get we'll show

112
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.630
you the server address of where it thinks you want to push too.

113
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:42.700
So this is the location for the starter file Ribault that I personally created but that's not where

114
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.960
you want to push.

115
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.960
You want to push to your personal empty shell of a repo that you created at the very beginning of this

116
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.780
lesson.

117
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.270
So we want to update this address to match your get hub dot com repo address which is very simple.

118
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:05.160
So on the overview page for the empty shell of a Ribault that you created you'll see this address here.

119
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.950
Go ahead and copy it to your clipboard

120
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.770
your address will not match this one.

121
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.180
Yours will include your username instead right here and it will include the name of the people that

122
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.210
you chose here.

123
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.870
But once you've copied that to your clipboard head back over to the command line and type this command

124
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:36.530
get remote set Dasch you RL origin and then paste in that you are all that you just copied on Windows

125
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.750
sometimes it can be tricky to paste into the command line.

126
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.020
If that's the case the address isn't that tricky it's just HVD.

127
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:50.510
Get hub dot com your username slash and then the name of the Ribault dog get go ahead and hit enter.

128
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.430
And let's make sure that that command went through successfully.

129
00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:03.270
So to double check we can get remote Dasch we what we want to see is your username here and then the

130
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.140
name of the Repa that you chose here.

131
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.820
If that's the case we are in business.

132
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:15.280
So now whenever we get to push to the origin it knows that the origin is your get her up com repo.

133
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.340
So here's the fun part.

134
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.570
Here's what we've been waiting for.

135
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.490
Now I want you to run this command get push.

136
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.970
We are ready to push.

137
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:30.810
Type in origin origin just stands for the address of your Ribault and then type in Master because we

138
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.490
are on the master branch we will learn about branches later on.

139
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.390
But go ahead and hit enter.

140
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:41.010
At this point your command line will likely ask for your Get her username and password.

141
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.380
Go ahead and enter those when prompted.

142
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.880
Rest assured that you will not need to enter these.

143
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.270
Every single time you push.

144
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.920
This is a one time event for this very first push.

145
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.850
This might take a moment because it is indeed uploading many different image files.

146
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:05.000
But once the command completes go ahead and refresh the good have dot com page for your repo and now

147
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.960
the people that we set up in the beginning of this lesson is no longer empty.

148
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:14.000
It contains the starter files that we will be using to build the Web site in this course.

149
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.570
Now really quickly let's practice making a super basic change to the HTL file.

150
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.910
So on your computer navigate to the generic sites or projects folder navigate to the new repo that we've

151
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:32.810
created in this lesson drill down into the app folder and then open this index thart h DML file in your

152
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.630
text editor of choice.

153
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:40.310
You can use the file open functionality of the text editor or in a lot of editors you can just drag

154
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.560
this file on top of the text editor.

155
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.560
Let's make a super trivial change just to practice pushing a change up to get hub.

156
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.920
So for example let's add a few new keywords in the Med ahead section of the Web site.

157
00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:01.520
So I find this line of code in your HMO file and at the end add a comma and type of fordable travel

158
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:10.010
save your change hop over to your command line type get and then a space and status.

159
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.960
This looks correct.

160
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.480
The only file that we modified was the index on each TMLC file.

161
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:23.160
So I want to stage all of the changes so I will type get add dash and then uppercase a.

162
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:29.930
If we type get status again you can see that that file has been staged which means it's ready to be

163
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:30.560
committed.

164
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:43.060
So now I can just type get commit dash and type a message added new Met key words.

165
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.860
All right so now we have committed that change into the local copy of the repository on our computer.

166
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.130
Now we want to push our Ribault up to get Hub's servers.

167
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.730
So just type get push or gin master hit enter

168
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.910
back in your browser open up the get have dot com overview page for your Ribault refresh the page and

169
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:13.700
here you should see your username and if you have an avatar it would be here because you are the one

170
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.980
that has made the most recent commit.

171
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.930
You can click on comments here.

172
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:25.050
And your change will show up you can even click on it and get Hubble will highlight in green the text

173
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.100
that you just added.

174
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.210
And that will bring this lesson to a close.

175
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.170
Let's review what we took care of.

176
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.610
We started out by creating a good hub account then we created a new empty Ribault and get Hub's server.

177
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:45.090
And finally we pushed the starter files for our Web site from our computer up to get hub server.

178
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.760
And now when we worked through future lessons we can push our progress up to that Ribault at the end

179
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760
of every lesson.

180
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.260
So even if our computer blows up our files will be safe on the server.

181
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.680
Excellent.

182
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.490
In our next lesson we will be changing gears.

183
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:07.260
This marks the end of the intro to get section of the course in the next section.

184
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.750
We will begin to learn about other technologies and tools that we will leverage as we build out the

185
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.930
fictional travel agency Web site together.

186
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:21.690
The first tool that we will learn about is named Noad and we will learn what node is and what it's used

187
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.550
for in the next lesson.

188
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.480
It's going to be a lot of fun and I'll see you then.
