00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,260
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,500
In this lesson we will create our own modal or overlay.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,860
This feature is also sometimes referred to as a light box just so you and I are on the same page.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,200
Here's a bit of preview footage of the finished product.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:20,630
All right.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,610
So now we know what we need to build.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,040
Let's get started and make it happen.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,180
Here's a quick overview or roadmap for the lesson.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,050
First we will take care of our get branches.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,340
Next we will set up the h t AML and C Ss for the overlay.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,100
We won't worry about hiding it yet.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,140
We will just let it always display during this phase.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,260
And finally we will use javascript to hide the overlay initially and only reveal it if an appropriate

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,680
button is clicked.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230
All right let's start up at the top.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,230
Number one and take care of our get branches.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,080
So over in the command line we can see that we currently have the sticky header branch checked out and

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,930
in our previous lesson we completed the sticky header behavior.

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,690
So now let's go ahead and merge this branch back in the master.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,260
And then once we've done that we can create a new branch for our modal or overlay.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,630
Let's begin by running get status to see what files have changed recently.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,350
All of these changes look good to me so I'm going to add everything to my staging area.

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,210
So get add dash uppercase a for all.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,000
And then we just want to commit everything that's in the staging area.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,530
So get commit.

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,610
Let's include dash M so we can include a message.

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,030
And let's say completed sticky header functionality.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,770
All right.

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,280
So now that we've made a commit we've saved those changes into gets history.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,690
So this means we can safely switch back over to the master branch so we can say get check out master

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,960
and now that we've checked out the master branch we just want to merge the sticky header branch into

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,890
it.

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,310
So let's say get merge sticky header All right.

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,940
So now our master branch is up to date at this point.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,170
Let's create a new branch for this lesson's modal or overlay.

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,320
So get check out dash be for branch and then the name of the new branch that we want to create.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,340
Let's call it create modal.

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,740
All right.

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,700
So at this point we've got our new branch.

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,970
Let's get to work.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:38,470
Let's jump over to our text editor and within our app folder let's open up index thought H TMM.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,110
If we scroll down to the very bottom of this file right above the closing body tag and our script tag

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,760
we see commented out each TMM All right.

44
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,180
Here's the closing comment.

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,970
This is the end of the modal reference HDMI and if you scroll up a few lines you'll see the opening

46
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,590
comment it reads.

47
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,520
Leave this comment it out HDMI here until you need it for an upcoming modal lesson.

48
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,120
So this is that lesson.

49
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,350
So go ahead and get rid of this top comment line.

50
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,690
So just select this entire line.

51
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,480
Get rid of that and then go ahead and get rid of this bottom comment line.

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,730
This entire line.

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,550
Okay.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,450
And if we save this back in the browser down at the very bottom of the page we see get in touch and

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,970
we will have an online order system in place soon.

56
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,500
So on and so forth.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,010
Now clearly this does not look like a full screen modal.

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,900
Right now it's just the raw each demo.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,240
So now let's write the CSA s to make this area look visually or stylistically like a modal.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,800
Once we have the design or styling taken care of then we can set things up so it's hidden by default.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,300
And then when you click on the get in touch button it reveals this full screen area.

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:08,850
So let's set up a new CSX file to style the model so in our text editor in app assets styles let's create

63
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:19,400
a new file in the modules folder let's name the new file underscore modal dot see ISIS before we forget

64
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:26,870
let's jump into our main style sheet and import in this new model file so open up your main styles dot

65
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,270
CSX down at the very bottom.

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:38,430
Let's just say X symbol import modules and grab the file named underscore modal semicolon.

67
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,350
Let's give that a save and then jump back into our new modal CSX file.

68
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,330
Let's create our baseline selector.

69
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:56,000
So dot modal OK now let's begin by making this modal area take up the entire screen and be a bit transparent.

70
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,890
So let's say position fixed.

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,800
So this way even if you scroll the modal still takes up your entire screen.

72
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,010
Since we're using fixed positioning to make the model take up the entire screen we can just set its

73
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:22,040
top bottom left and right values all to zero right the extreme edges so top zero bottom 0 left 0 right.

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,710
0.

75
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay let's give it a slightly transparent white background color so background color RGA to create white

76
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,590
you max out the red green and blues 255 255 255 and let's set its opacity to ninety four percent right.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,930
So it's 6 percent see through.

78
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,420
So my colon.

79
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,330
Let's also set its z index to 5.

80
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,570
So it sits on top of all the other content on our page.

81
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:53,900
Okay.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,120
Let's save this and see what it looks like so far cool.

83
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,560
So notice as we scroll.

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,340
It doesn't matter.

85
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,130
This section still takes up the entire screen.

86
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,260
It is layered on top of everything.

87
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,730
It's looking good.

88
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,240
Next.

89
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,390
Let's set things up so that this content is centered vertically within the height of the browser viewport

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,020
involve we're at it we can also set this X. It's a bit small right now but you can see this X that you

91
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,610
would click on to close the modal let's position it so it sits in the very top right corner so back

92
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,180
in our CSX within our baseline rule here.

93
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,830
I want to set it to use flex box to display flex.

94
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,650
You'll see why we're setting this up in just a moment.

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,760
Now within this rule let's dropdown and let's target the inner wrapper div so ampersand which will give

96
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,660
us dot modal and then we want to add on underscore underscore inner curly brackets.

97
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,260
Let's set this to use all the available space.

98
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,330
So flex one semicolon and then if we say margin auto.

99
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,690
Well this in combination with Flex box will center it.

100
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,130
Okay.

101
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,200
After this inner rule let's dropdown and target that close or that x button that you would click on.

102
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,970
So use our baseline selector underscore underscore.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,090
Close curly brackets and let's just position it to be in the top right corner so position absolute.

104
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,180
Let's have it come down from the very top 15 pixels.

105
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,660
Let's also have it come in from the right 15 pixels right.

106
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,260
15 pics.

107
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,380
Let's go ahead and save and see what this looks like.

108
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,780
Cool.

109
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,440
So the actual content is now centered vertically.

110
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,200
The X icon is positioned where it should be next.

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,720
Let's adjust the text or font styling of this message here.

112
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,330
So back in our CSX it doesn't matter where but maybe right after the inner rule we can create a new

113
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:02,000
rule Ampersand underscore underscore description and let's center it horizontally.

114
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:11,250
So text align center let's increase the font size a bit font size maybe one point three ram let's make

115
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,500
sure the font isn't too thick so font weight three hundred and let's bump up the line height a bit so.

116
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
Line height.

117
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,250
One point six five.

118
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,370
Let's see what that looks like.

119
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,970
Go ahead and save.

120
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,470
Okay.

121
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,950
This text styling looks good but the spacing looks off.

122
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:36,150
So first of all there's too much vertical space between the headline and this text and then also I wouldn't

123
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,600
want this text to be able to use up this much width.

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,440
I think it should be constrained to the center portion of the screen like this.

125
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,330
Now to make these changes let's actually jump into our each PML instead of our CSA s at first towards

126
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,160
the bottom of our HDL file.

127
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:00,240
I want you to find the modal div now a few lines into the modal code you'll see a heading Level 2 that

128
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,980
is reusing our section title.

129
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,930
But notice it has a modifier class of section title dash dash less margin.

130
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,900
Also we have this extra wrapper div id it has a modifier of dash dash narrow.

131
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,820
So I've already written this HDMI for us but if we go add these modifier classes for wrapper and section

132
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,650
title that will take care of these issues that I was just describing.

133
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,460
Let's start with the section title Let me show you what I mean within our CSA as modules folder jump

134
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,600
into our section titled dot CSX file.

135
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,630
So down around line 14 we have a blue rule maybe right below the blue rule.

136
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:56,250
Let's create a less margin modifier class so Ampersand dash dash less margin curly brackets and let's

137
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:04,930
just set margin bottom to only be one point three ram and let's set margin top to zero.

138
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,880
Let's give that to save.

139
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,590
Cool.

140
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,950
So now there's a bit less spacing in between these two elements.

141
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,400
Next up let's work on the narrow wrapper.

142
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,620
So within your CSF modules jump into the file named underscore wrapper dot CSX.

143
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,500
We already have a modifier rule four dash dash medium so maybe right below that.

144
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,850
Let's just say Ampersand dash dash narrow.

145
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,140
Instead it's Max with two maybe four hundred and seventy pixels.

146
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,030
Let's give that to save cool.

147
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,130
I think this text looks a lot better when it's constrained to the middle portion of the screen like

148
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,040
this.

149
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,590
Next let's fine tune the styling of the X close icon right.

150
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,830
It should be a bit larger or easier to see.

151
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,550
So back in our modal dot CSX file if we scroll down a bit.

152
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:05,220
We already have a rule for the clothes icon so within that rule we can just increase the font size to

153
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,710
to ram let's also make it blue color.

154
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:17,240
And we can use our variable dollar sign main blue give that save cool.

155
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,470
Now I think it would look even better if it was stretched a bit.

156
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,430
So it was wider and not as tall.

157
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:23,880
Right.

158
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,470
So that it actually looked like a close X and not just the letter X from the alphabet.

159
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,230
Right if we squished it it was a bit wider to do that.

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:43,340
We can just say trans form and use the scale X function within these parentheses a value of one will

161
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,480
keep it the exact same size but if we say one point two well we are stretching it on its x access to

162
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,640
be a bit larger.

163
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,550
Sure include a semicolon here.

164
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,170
Now before I save this I do want to point out that I want to increase the width from the top right corner

165
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,500
as its pivot point because I want to maintain the perfectly spaced out 15 pixels of margin from the

166
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,630
top right corner.

167
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,700
So I want the element to grow in this direction right starting here and moving out like this.

168
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:23,570
So to do that we just want to set the transform origin point to 100 percent to mean the far right corner

169
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,680
and then zero to mean the top upper corner.

170
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,540
So my colon.

171
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,480
And while we're at it let's also set the cursor to be a pointer so that it looks like a link or something

172
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,020
you're supposed to click on when you hover over it.

173
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,870
Give that save.

174
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,390
Cool.

175
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,600
That looks a lot better and if you hover over it it looks like something you should be able to click

176
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,730
on.

177
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,270
If we wanted to we could even set up a hover rule so when you hover it it turns orange as well.

178
00:12:50,960 --> 00:13:01,310
So right after this color line we can say Ampersand colon hover and just set the color to main orange

179
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,700
perfect.

180
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,450
Okay.

181
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,530
At this point we just need to style these social media icons that should sit right about here.

182
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,350
Now they already exist in the HDMI L.

183
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,440
We just can't see them because they are white icons sitting on a mostly white background.

184
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,730
So we have Facebook Twitter Instagram and YouTube links here.

185
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,670
Now instead of writing all the styling for those links within our modal file let's create an entirely

186
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,690
separate file just for the social icons.

187
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:41,760
So within our CSF modules folder let's create a brand new file and let's name it underscore social icons

188
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,630
dot CSX.

189
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,490
And before we forget let's include this file within our main style sheet.

190
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:58,500
So at the bottom of styles dot CSX say import modules underscore social icons semicolon.

191
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,460
Let's give that a save.

192
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,530
OK now back and social icons.

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,080
Let's create our baseline selector.

194
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,740
So dot social icons.

195
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,250
Let's begin by centering everything so text align center.

196
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,770
OK.

197
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,200
And then each of the four icons write the Facebook Instagram the YouTube and the Twitter.

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,190
Each one of those has a selector of underscore underscore icon right or social icons underscore underscore

199
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,640
icon.

200
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,380
So let's say Ampersand underscore underscore icon.

201
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,710
Let's begin by giving them a background color so we can actually see them.

202
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,550
So they're not a white icon on a white background.

203
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,240
So background color.

204
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,160
Let's go a dollar sign.

205
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,100
Main orange.

206
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's set their display to be inline block.

207
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:54,110
Let's set their width to be 72 pixels their height to be 72 pixels.

208
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,280
Let's give them a bit of margin around each one.

209
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,750
So zero top margin five pixels to the right five pixels to the bottom and five pixels to the left.

210
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,490
OK.

211
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,960
And still inside this same rule or selector lets just drop down and with a descendant selector let's

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,630
select the image inside each one of these.

213
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:21,510
So just I AMG let's tell it to be a block and let's position it so it's centered within the orange background

214
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,800
area so position absolute.

215
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,300
If we're setting this to be position absolute we should set the parent to be relative.

216
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:36,920
So position relative and then back in this new rule come down from the top halfway.

217
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:44,130
50 percent come in from the left 50 percent and then we want to pull it back up into the left half of

218
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,120
its own size.

219
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,910
So transform translate negative 50 percent comma negative 50 percent.

220
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,950
So both vertically and horizontally.

221
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,130
Let's give this a save and see what it looks like.

222
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:00,930
Cool.

223
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:07,020
So for larger screens this looks great but for smaller screens I think we should adjust things so that

224
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,740
exactly two icons fit Perot.

225
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:17,700
So let me show you how I would do that back in our social icons file within our icon rule maybe right

226
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,700
after position relative I would use our Mixon named at small.

227
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,690
So super tiny screens will receive the baseline styles while screens that are at least small or larger

228
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,510
will receive these styles.

229
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:41,070
So in here we can say with 72 pixels but within our tiny baseline styles let's change the width so that

230
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,830
it's no longer 72 pixels and instead is 33 percent.

231
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,520
Let's give that a save cool.

232
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:56,300
So now for mobile or tiny screens we get exactly to Perot but for larger screens we still have the four

233
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:03,590
wide grid and that's going to bring this video but not this lesson to a close in our next video we will

234
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:10,070
begin writing javascript to interact with our CSX so that when you first come to the page this full

235
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:16,580
screen modal is hidden and then only once you click the get in touch button this will gradually fade

236
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,040
or zoom into view.

237
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,470
Right.

238
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,330
And we'll also set things up so that when you click on the X icon the model goes away.

239
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,630
There should be a lot of fun.

240
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,610
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next video.
