00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] The next step is to set up

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.008
the database connection code and the database script.

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:06.008
As we spoke earlier,

4
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.002
we are going to use the in-memory H2 database.

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.001
For that we need one class

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.005
that'll get us that connection to the database

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.008
and also load the database script file

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.002
to create tables and insert data into them.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:22.003
To save some time,

10
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.001
I've already got this database connection code class

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.002
ready with me,

12
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.007
and it will be available to you

13
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:31.007
under your resources folder of chapter three.

14
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:36.005
So I'm going to just copy this class,

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.007
go back to the IDE

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.006
and first create a package under the Java folder.

17
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:47.007
Let's call it com.shopping.db

18
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:53.001
and let's base that class under it.

19
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.006
In addition to that, we also need the database script file

20
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.004
that is also provided under the resources folder.

21
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.008
So let's copy that

22
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:12.003
and paste it under the resources folder of your project.

23
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.007
Just to be clear, the H2 database connection class code

24
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.005
and the initialized.sql script

25
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.009
everything contained under this will change

26
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.005
if you wish to work with an alternate database.

27
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:31.009
Let's now walk through the H2 database collection class

28
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.002
to see what it does for us.

29
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:36.000
So there are two parts in this,

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.003
one is to create a connection first,

31
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:42.002
second, is to load the script file

32
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:46.003
and run the database and make it fully functional for us.

33
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.005
So there is a method which is on line 34,

34
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.006
getConnectionToDatabase.

35
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.001
This is the one that we'll start getting us a connection

36
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.004
to the in-memory database.

37
00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.004
That in memory database connection

38
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.007
will be provided with three parameters,

39
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.003
the URL of the database, the username, and the password.

40
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:09.002
So it has to first load the driver class on line number 37

41
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.003
and subsequently get us a connection on line number 38

42
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:16.003
by using that URL user and password combination.

43
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:20.007
This is a simple JDBC code to access the database.

44
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.008
In case you do not wish to use JDBC,

45
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:26.003
you can use any other API of your choice.

46
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:28.009
So that's the method that'll get us the connection.

47
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:33.005
The second part of this file is to load the database script

48
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.005
and run it on that database.

49
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:40.001
That is done by a method called initializeDatabase

50
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.007
written on line 67

51
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.002
that takes a connection as a parameter

52
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.000
and it'll load the script file,

53
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.007
which is initialize.sql from the class but of your project,

54
00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:55.005
it will read it and it'll execute that script

55
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:58.006
as stated on line number 69.

56
00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:02.000
Now both these paths, that is getting a connection

57
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.001
and initializing the database

58
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.003
will get executed when the H2 database connection class

59
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.006
gets loaded in the memory.

60
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:15.001
There is a static initializer block from lines 22 to 30,

61
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.005
which will do this entire job for us.

62
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.004
That is all.

63
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.005
So this is what we have

64
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:24.000
in the H2O database connection class for us.

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.004
The other part is the SQL script.

66
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:31.006
So this will have the create statement for the user table

67
00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:35.000
and the insert statements for the user table.

68
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.005
And then we have the create statement for the oddest table,

69
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.008
and the insert statement for the same.

70
00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.005
So there are two tables that we're going to use

71
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.001
as a part of this project.

72
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.001
One, is the user table and the other is the orders table.

73
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:49.006
So this is all that you have to do

74
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:53.002
in order to get this basic database connection code set up

75
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:57.007
along with the database getting entirely ready for you.

76
00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:01.001
Additionally, inside the H2 database connection class,

77
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:03.008
there are a couple of methods that I have incorporated

78
00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:07.006
which is on line 52, a start database method

79
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:11.006
and on line 60 a stop database method.

80
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:13.009
These are the methods that you can use

81
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.007
in case you want to access the H2 database

82
00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:19.008
by a client outside this project.

83
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.004
We will not use these methods,

84
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:23.006
but this is just a set of utility methods

85
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:27.000
that I have incorporated in case you want to use them.
