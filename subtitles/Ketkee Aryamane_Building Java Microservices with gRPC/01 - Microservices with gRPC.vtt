00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Ketkee] GRPC is a framework which works

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.005
over the HTTP/2 protocol.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.008
It helps developers build scalable microservices

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.007
with a low latency and a higher throughput.

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.000
In this course, we will learn the fundamentals

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.006
of gRPC and its features.

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.001
We will work with protocol buffers.

8
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.002
We will set up a gRPC project

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.005
and build a couple of microservices

10
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.004
that interact with each other.

11
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:28.005
And we'll build all of this from scratch.

12
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.003
Hi, I am Ketkee.

13
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.003
I have worked as a Java developer,

14
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.003
a technical trainer, and a writer.

15
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.007
Join me in the journey

16
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:39.000
of building gRPC microservices in Java.
