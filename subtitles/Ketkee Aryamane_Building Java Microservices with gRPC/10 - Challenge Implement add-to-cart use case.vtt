(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.003
- [Lecturer] Let us take a look at the challenge

3
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.000
that you will implement as a part of this course.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.003
You can build a pair of shopping cart services.

5
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.008
The first step will be to create a product service,

6
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.001
which will help you get all the product details.

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.004
So you have a product service,

8
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.006
which takes in input as the ID of the product

9
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.000
and the output will be the product details

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.009
like the ID, name, quantity.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.009
You can also add other fields

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.006
like for example the name of the seller

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.001
who sells that product,

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.001
the country from where it is shipped, et cetera.

15
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.000
Once the service is in place,

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.004
the next step will be to create an add to cart service.

17
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.006
This service will check if the selected product exists

18
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.002
and then adds the product to the cart.

19
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.007
So what are the semantics of this?

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.004
There is an add to cart service,

21
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.001
which takes two inputs,

22
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.007
an ID of the product and the quantity of the product.

23
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.001
With this input,

24
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.002
the add to cart service will internally make a call

25
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.005
to the product service to find out

26
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:10.001
if the product with that given ID and the quantity exists.

27
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.009
If the answer is yes,

28
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.003
then the service should be able

29
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:16.009
to add that product to a cart.

30
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.003
If the answer is no,

31
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.008
then your service can just return

32
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.009
to the client with an appropriate response stating

33
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.003
that the product probably does not exist

34
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.007
or maybe the quantity of the product is no longer available.

35
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.000
So this is what you can do as a part of the challenge.
