00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] GRPC framework is an

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.006
open source RPC framework

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:09.001
that was designed and released by Google in 2015.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.007
This is being widely adopted to build microservices.

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:16.007
It provides strong foundations so that you can build faster,

6
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:20.003
more efficient, and robust services.

7
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.007
The biggest advantage that gRPC framework comes with

8
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.008
is that it works with HTTP/2 protocol.

9
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.007
HTTP/2 is used for interservice communication

10
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.003
in the gRPC framework,

11
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:35.000
which makes it a high performance framework.
