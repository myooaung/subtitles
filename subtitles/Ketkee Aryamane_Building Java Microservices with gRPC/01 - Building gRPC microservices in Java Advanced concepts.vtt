00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Ketkee] Now that we have learned

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.002
the fundamental building blocks

3
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.002
of the gRPC framework,

4
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.007
here are a few things that you could explore next.

5
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.006
You can try implementing asynchronous streaming calls

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.008
instead of the blocking Unity RPC calls

7
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.006
that we implemented in this course.

8
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.002
You can also try to explore at once features

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.007
like authentication and error handling

10
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.006
that come enpackaged with the gRPC framework.

11
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.000
Additionally, when we created a channel,

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.007
we did it using the plain text,

13
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.007
which means it was not a secure channel.

14
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.005
You can explore, or you can learn

15
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.000
how to create a secure channel for your services.
