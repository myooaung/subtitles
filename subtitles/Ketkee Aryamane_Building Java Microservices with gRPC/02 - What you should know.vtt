00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] In order to make the most out of this course,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.009
here are a few things that you should know.

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.006
A fluency with the Java 1.8 language will be needed

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.003
because this course focuses on building microservices

5
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.004
with the Java programming language.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.001
Secondly, you need to be very comfortable

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.003
with the microservices architecture

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.003
and all of its related concepts.

9
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.000
It would be good to have a strong foundation

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.001
of RESTful microservices

11
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.000
because gRPC is the next logical step

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.002
in the evolution of microservices development.

13
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:37.000
Also, a solid foundation of databases will be appreciated

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.004
because this course focuses more on the gRPC concepts

15
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:43.000
rather than the database concepts.
