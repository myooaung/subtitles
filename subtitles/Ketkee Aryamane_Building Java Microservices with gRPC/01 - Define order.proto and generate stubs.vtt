00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] The last module is going to focus

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.008
on building the order service in Java using gRPC.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.003
Let's go ahead and execute the steps

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.009
to implement the order service.

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.009
The steps have been listed on your screen,

6
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.008
let's go through them one by one.

7
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:18.000
As I said earlier, the flow will be pretty much the same

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that we've done in the user service.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.005
There are a couple of steps which are a little different,

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.006
but we will see when we get there.

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.009
So the first step will be to write the order proto file

12
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.007
and generate the steps.

13
00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:34.000
So let's go back to the IDE and under the proto folder,

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.009
I will add a new file.

15
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's name this order.proto.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.003
So this will start with defining the syntax of proto

17
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:45.002
that we want to use,

18
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.001
that will be proto3.

19
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:54.004
The next one will be the java_package.

20
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.009
So in order to make sure that we are consistent,

21
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.006
if you open the user.proto,

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.007
this is what we did for the user.

23
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:10.008
So for the order, we'll say "com.shopping.stubs.orders."

24
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.001
The next one will be to specify

25
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:19.004
the java_multiple_files Boolean value.

26
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:24.001
There's a typo that we have, let me delete that, yeah.

27
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.003
So that's what you have.

28
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.008
Up next, will be to define the service.

29
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:32.003
So we'll say service OrderService

30
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:33.005
and what will this have?

31
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.004
This is going to have a method

32
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:41.005
which will say getOrdersForUser,

33
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.009
which will take in an OrderRequest

34
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.005
and return an OrderResponse.

35
00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.006
The next step will be to define the messages

36
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:56.007
which are the OrderRequest and the OrderResponse.

37
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:02.000
So I'm going to say message OrderRequest

38
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.008
that will contain just one field which is our user_id.

39
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:15.008
And let's also define the OrderResponse.

40
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:18.002
Now, when we talk about the OrderResponse,

41
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.009
this will be a list of orders.

42
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:25.000
So we will use this feature of proto

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.001
where we say it repeated Order.

44
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.003
So basically this will end up

45
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.003
giving us a collection in the generated steps,

46
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.008
which is basically an iterable.

47
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:41.006
So let's also define that Order message.

48
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.000
So on line 15,

49
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.002
I am going to first correct the error that we're getting,

50
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.006
we need to also tag this fee.

51
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:52.001
So this will be assigned the number one.

52
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.006
And on this line, we are basically trying to say,

53
00:02:55.006 --> 00:03:00.001
that you want a collection of the order message types

54
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:03.003
inside the OrderResponse messaged type.

55
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:05.004
But this order is a custom message type

56
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.006
that I'm now defining from lines 18.

57
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.008
So let's go ahead and define that.

58
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:16.008
So this will contain the user_id

59
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.009
for whom we are retrieving the order.

60
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:23.006
It will also contain the order_id,

61
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.002
I'm going to start that too.

62
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:29.007
The order will also contain the number of items

63
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:33.006
that were included as a part of the order.

64
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:37.002
Then it can also have the amount.

65
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:46.001
So that will go as a double, total_amount of the order.

66
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.006
Please note that we have used a double type on line 22

67
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.006
in order to specify the total amount.

68
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.008
We used in 32 that will give us an integer type.

69
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.000
If you use int 64, that will give you a long

70
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.003
and double and float can give you the respective types.

71
00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.009
Lastly, we need one more field in this order response

72
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.006
which is the order date.

73
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:09.001
Now there is no implicit type

74
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.004
that you can define quickly for the date,

75
00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.001
but we have an option,

76
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.006
we can import a proto file from the Google proto

77
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:19.007
for this project for timestamps.

78
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.009
And this is how it looks like.

79
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.005
So if you want to import a proto file, you say import

80
00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:28.004
and then you give the path of that proto file.

81
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:29.008
So I'm going to do that.

82
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:36.002
So that is google/protobuf/timestamp.proto.

83
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:38.009
This is how it looks like.

84
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.003
This'll get us hold of the timestamp type that we can use

85
00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:46.005
to designate the order date.

86
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:49.000
So now let's come down and let's add that field.

87
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.008
So I'm going to say,

88
00:04:50.008 --> 00:05:01.003
the type will be google.protobuf.timestamp

89
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:06.000
and the field name is the orderdate

90
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and that will be the field number five

91
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.001
in the binary message.

92
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.009
So there we go.

93
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.002
We have imported the timestamp proto utility

94
00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:22.008
from the Google proto office project on line two

95
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:26.005
and we have used the corresponding type on line 24

96
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:28.006
to define the order date.

97
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:30.003
So we have an order proto already,

98
00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:33.004
the next step will be to generate the steps.

99
00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:36.002
So I'm going to go to the Maven tab on my right-hand side,

100
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:40.009
and execute both of these goals, clean and install.

101
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.008
So once this field is completed,

102
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.008
we should be able to see all the stubs for the order service

103
00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:48.009
generated inside the docket.

104
00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:54.004
So now let's examine the target folder

105
00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:57.002
and if you go under stubs,

106
00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:59.004
now you also have the order folder

107
00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:02.005
and all the respective classes that you wanted

108
00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:04.008
for the order service.

109
00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.001
So we have the proto in place

110
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:07.008
and we have the stubs in place,

111
00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:10.000
time to go to the next video.
