00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Narrator] gRPC framework is built

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.009
on a couple of strong foundations,

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.001
which we need to understand

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.000
before we move further in this course.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.008
Firstly, HTTP/2 protocol.

6
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.001
We've already discussed before

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.004
that the framework works on this protocol.

8
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.004
So it would be nice to get an understanding

9
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.002
of the working mechanism of this protocol.

10
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:25.002
Secondly, protocol buffers or they're commonly known

11
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.008
as protobuffs.

12
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:32.000
These are used as the interface definition language, IDL,

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.003
in gRPC.

14
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:37.001
IDL is the way to define your service contract.

15
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.003
That contract will contain the methods

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.003
and the messages that you will pass

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.000
when you call the methods.

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.003
Protocol buffers is not the only way to do IDL in gRPC,

19
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.004
but Google promotes this as a standard

20
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.000
when you try to build services with this framework.
