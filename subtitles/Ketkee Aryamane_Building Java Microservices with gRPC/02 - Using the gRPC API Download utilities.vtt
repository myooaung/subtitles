00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] Let us do a quick demo

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.009
to use the protoc compiler.

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.006
The first step for this demo

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.000
will be to download a list of utilities

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.009
to run the protoc compiler.

6
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.002
Please note that I am working

7
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.004
with the Windows Operating System.

8
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.006
If you're working with Linux or Mac,

9
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.008
then you need to download these utilities

10
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.008
that are compatible with your OS.

11
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.001
The first utility to download

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.009
is the actual protoc compiler package.

13
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.004
There's a link that has been provided on the screen

14
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:30.003
which will drive you

15
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.002
to the GitHub project of protocol buffers.

16
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:37.001
Let's click and see where we can download the package from.

17
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.006
So if you scroll right down,

18
00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.002
we see that we have the protoc compiler package

19
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.009
for each of the operating systems.

20
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.005
I am going to download the one for Windows OS.

21
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.002
I have already downloaded this package, unzipped it,

22
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.005
and I have placed it on my E drive

23
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.007
in a folder called protoc.

24
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.001
This is the package that we want.

25
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.000
The next step will be to download

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.003
the protoc-gen-grpc-java plugin.

27
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.006
Why do we need this?

28
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.002
The protoc compiler package that we downloaded just now

29
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.007
is going to help you auto-generate your objects

30
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:14.008
corresponding to the message types

31
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.002
that you defined in your service file.

32
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:21.000
However, if you also want to auto-generate the service class

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.009
then you need to use an additional plugin

34
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.009
that is called protoc-gen-grpc-java plugin.

35
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.001
There's a link that's provided on the screen

36
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.008
that will drive you to the Maven Repository

37
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.002
where you can download the plugin from.

38
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.007
So if you go there, you can click on the latest version

39
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.006
and view the files.

40
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:45.008
There are executables that are available here for every OS.

41
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.002
You can download the one that suits you.

42
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:49.006
I have already done that

43
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.000
and it's available in the same folder,

44
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.004
that's protoc under my E drive.

45
00:01:55.004 --> 00:02:00.002
The last step of the setup is the protoc compiler setting

46
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.007
in the PATH environment variable.

47
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.003
We need to set the path of the protoc executable

48
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.009
in the environment variable

49
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.008
so that we can access it from any folder on our machine.

50
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.005
Let us do that.

51
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.008
Let's go to E://protoc

52
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:18.002
and let's go to the bin folder.

53
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.003
That's where you should be able to see

54
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.001
the protoc executable.

55
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.005
I'm going to copy the spot

56
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.005
and then go to my Windows environment variables.

57
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:32.006
Let's click on edit system environment variables,

58
00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.009
click on environment variables,

59
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.003
and then under system variables down there,

60
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:40.000
you can click on path,

61
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.004
edit this, and then you can add an entry

62
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:49.001
for the protoc compiler executable.

63
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.002
Click OK and then exit that set up.

64
00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:53.001
That's all.

65
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.004
So now we are ready with the basic setup

66
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.009
so that we can start using the protoc compiler.

67
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.000
We look at the next steps in the next video.
