00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] The next step will be

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.005
to write the OrderSeviceImpl class,

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.000
that's the server stub implementation.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.008
And that is going to take the data from the database

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.009
and convert it into proto objects.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.001
So let's go back to the IDE, and I will add a new class

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.006
in the service package,

8
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:26.002
which is the OrderSeviceImpl.

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:31.000
And this as usual, we'll extend the OrderServiceGrpcs

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.004
in a class, which is the ImplBase.

11
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.001
And on line seven, I will just type in the name

12
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.009
of the method that I have to implement.

13
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.003
That is getOrdersForUser.

14
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.004
The arguments are the same that we saw

15
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.007
when we were trying to implement the user service.

16
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.004
So there's order request, and there's a stream observer

17
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.003
for the order response.

18
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:52.009
Let's eliminate line number 12,

19
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.007
we don't need the super call.

20
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:55.009
So what we're going to do,

21
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.006
we are going to call this database method,

22
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.006
get the list of orders

23
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.001
and convert that list of domain object orders

24
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.009
from a list of proto object orders.

25
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.000
So let's do that.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.006
For that, on line nine, I will first create an instance

27
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:17.001
of the OrderDao, so that it is created at the class level

28
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.003
instead of creating it inside the method.

29
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.004
Because if you do it inside the method,

30
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.007
will end up creating a new instance every time

31
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.006
for every request.

32
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.008
We don't want that.

33
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.008
Okay, and then let's come on line 14

34
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:42.008
and say List of Order that is the com.shopping.db Order.

35
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:47.004
Let's give this variable a name and let's grab

36
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:52.006
that orderDao object and call the getOrders method.

37
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.007
The parameter to this method will be the userId

38
00:01:55.007 --> 00:02:01.001
that we can get from the request object like that.

39
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.005
So what we essentially did is we call the getOrders method

40
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.000
and the return value of this method

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.002
is a list of the domain order objects.

42
00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.009
So we collected that in a list of orders variable.

43
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.004
The next big step here will be to transform

44
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:19.002
the order domain object into the order proto object.

45
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.002
But there's an additional step because this is a list.

46
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:26.008
So what we do is we use a streaming API in Java.

47
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:30.003
We'll take every order domain object from the list

48
00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:35.000
on line 17, transform it into an order proto object,

49
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.008
and then we'll finally make a list of those proto objects.

50
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.001
That is what we will do.

51
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:40.009
So let's do that.

52
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:46.007
Let's say orders.stream.map.

53
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:49.008
And for every order, what we're going to do,

54
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:54.002
we're going to take the order proto object this time

55
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:58.003
which is this one, com.shopping.stubs.order.

56
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.005
Let's call the builder on it

57
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.001
because that's what proto objects are to be used with,

58
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.003
the builder pattern as we saw earlier.

59
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:09.003
And what do we do, we set each of the fields.

60
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.006
So let's start with userId.

61
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.002
How are we going to get the userId?

62
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:17.000
Which is order.getUserId.

63
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.005
The next one will be orderId, let's say orderId.

64
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:26.003
And that will, of course, come again

65
00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:31.000
from the order domain object.

66
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.004
Next one will be set number of items.

67
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.005
Let's grab that too.

68
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:47.001
The next one will be the amount, let's set that.

69
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.003
And then we have the order date.

70
00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:52.007
Now this order date is going to be the timestamp type

71
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:54.005
that we defined in the proto file

72
00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:58.001
but the order date type in the domain object is

73
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.006
the java.util.Date.

74
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:01.005
So we'll have to do that transformation.

75
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.000
It is very simple to do that.

76
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.009
We can use one of the utility classes

77
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:09.006
from the protobuf foo package, that is called Timestamps.

78
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.000
So we're going to use that

79
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.005
and we're going to transform this.

80
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:16.002
So I'll say Timestamps, which is this class,

81
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:20.000
dot fromMillis, that's the method that we want to use.

82
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.006
And to this, we'll feed the order domain object date

83
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.001
in milliseconds.

84
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:29.006
So we get the order date

85
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:33.002
and getTime will give us the Timestamp.

86
00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.005
So that will be converted

87
00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:38.008
to the Timestamp type in the proto object.

88
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:41.001
Let's build this.

89
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:44.003
And additionally, let's also collect this set

90
00:04:44.003 --> 00:04:46.008
of orders into a list.

91
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:50.008
So I'm going to say Collectors.toList.

92
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:51.009
There we go.

93
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.001
Let's also extract this

94
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.008
into the variable of the correct type.

95
00:04:55.008 --> 00:05:05.001
So I go on line 21, and here I'll say list of this time,

96
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:10.002
this will be the shopping stubs order.

97
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:11.005
There's an error here.

98
00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:15.008
Sorry, this will be com.shopping.order class.

99
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:18.002
Yeah, that is the one we want.

100
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:22.005
So, basically we streamed the database orders,

101
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:26.005
map each order object into the order proto object

102
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:29.003
and then finally made a list of those proto objects.

103
00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:31.002
That is what we did here.

104
00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:33.007
The next step will be to bundle this list

105
00:05:33.007 --> 00:05:35.006
in the order response object,

106
00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:38.009
and then we can send that through the response observer.

107
00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.003
So let's do that.

108
00:05:40.003 --> 00:05:43.001
Let's take orderResponse.

109
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:47.002
Let's call the builder for this, newBuilder,

110
00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:49.006
and there will be a method available

111
00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:52.000
which will say addAllOrder.

112
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.005
So that method will help you add the entire list in one go.

113
00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:59.007
So I'm going to that ordersForUser list that we created

114
00:05:59.007 --> 00:06:06.008
on line 21, feed it to the addAllOrder method,

115
00:06:06.008 --> 00:06:09.007
and, of course, we need to build this object as well.

116
00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:11.005
So we do that.

117
00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:14.009
Once done, let's grab the responseObserver

118
00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:21.006
and call the onNext method and send out the orderResponse.

119
00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.002
And then to complete the Grpc call

120
00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:28.004
we need to call the onCompleted method.

121
00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:29.003
So that is what we did.

122
00:06:29.003 --> 00:06:30.006
In the service implementation,

123
00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:32.005
we basically ended up just transforming

124
00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:35.002
the domain object data to the proto objects,

125
00:06:35.002 --> 00:06:36.001
but please understand

126
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:38.003
that this is a service implementation class.

127
00:06:38.003 --> 00:06:40.003
So in your real time project

128
00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:43.000
you may have a lot of other business logic

129
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and that will also sit in the same class.
