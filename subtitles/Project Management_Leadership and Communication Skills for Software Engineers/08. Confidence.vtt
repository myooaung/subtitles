00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.356
Speaking in front of a group and audience can definitely be daunting.

2
00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:13.356
The best weapon you have to counter your concerns and doubt is, yes, confidence.

3
00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:17.356
Now there are several definitions and I like this one the best.

4
00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:21.856
A feeling of self-assurance arising from one's

5
00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:26.356
appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.

6
00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:31.356
Displaying confidence while delivering your presentation is extremely powerful.

7
00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:35.023
Your audience will sense the lack of confidence in yourself and

8
00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:37.656
therefore the lack of confidence in your material.

9
00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:40.656
Yes, it may not make sense, but that's what happens,

10
00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:44.741
even if you have the best material on the planet and it

11
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.356
is the greatest business idea ever, it usually doesn't matter.

12
00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.912
The reverse is true.

13
00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:52.467
If you are confident,

14
00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.967
your audience will transfer that confidence into the material

15
00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:58.356
and content you are presenting as well.

16
00:00:58.356 --> 00:01:06.356
Now, do not be egotistical or a smarty or arrogant or anything like that, ever!

17
00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:09.570
What I'm suggesting is that for you to be

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.356
self-confident in a professional manner.

19
00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:14.689
Believe in yourself and trust yourself.

20
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.356
Here's a tip.

21
00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:22.356
People like to respect and trust others who are self-confident.

22
00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.415
Alright, now that you're feeling some confidence,

23
00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:27.800
let's see how I would like you to deliver your presentation.

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.356
As we've mentioned, you are not just talking,

25
00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:36.023
you are delivering a message and this slide is about how

26
00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.356
I want you to deliver your messages.

27
00:01:38.356 --> 00:01:39.856
Know your audience.

28
00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:43.356
Who are you about to talk to?

29
00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:47.356
Maybe who you thought would be there is not and maybe others have shown up.

30
00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:49.023
Always be prepared to adapt.

31
00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:52.356
As long as the core message is in your presentation,

32
00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:56.629
you can use your words to evolve or adapt or to

33
00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.356
re-engineer your message if need be.

34
00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:01.023
Always maintain good eye contact.

35
00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:02.356
Don't stare, of course,

36
00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:06.619
but give people the sense that you are talking directly to them.

37
00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.830
This makes them feel included and if they feel included,

38
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.956
they are more likely to listen and interact.

39
00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:16.056
Use your eyes to scan the room.

40
00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:20.856
This technique will help keep eye contact with as many people as you can,

41
00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:23.356
and always engage your audience.

42
00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:26.901
Some useful ways to do that are sharing a funny yet tasteful story,

43
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.481
or pose a question to see how much they know about the

44
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.356
subject you're about to discuss.

45
00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.856
So, eye contact helps a lot to engage, as we mentioned,

46
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:38.856
and maybe moving from one side to the other of the room if possible,

47
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:43.356
creating some very simple motion adds to your presence.

48
00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:45.827
Also, noticing when someone has a question,

49
00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:48.297
either overtly like they're raising their hand,

50
00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:51.023
or subtlety like maybe with their body language.

51
00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:55.356
So speaking of body language, use it to gauge how people are listening.

52
00:02:55.356 --> 00:03:00.356
This might cue you to repeat an important point or topic.

53
00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:02.415
Speak clearly and with confidence.

54
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.650
As we discussed,

55
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.256
confidence is an enormous boost to ensuring the outcome of your message.

56
00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:11.256
Speak in a loud and clear voice to get your

57
00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:16.356
presentation through to the audience, even the ones sitting maybe farther away.

58
00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:17.093
Manage stress.

59
00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.567
This is your stress.

60
00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:24.231
It's common to be a little stressed before a presentation; I know I have been.

61
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:28.169
You may feel slightly uncomfortable to all the way

62
00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.356
to being maybe highly stressed.

63
00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:34.510
Never let them see or feel this if possible.

64
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.356
It's a presentation killer.

65
00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:39.704
I manage my stress by feeling confident in what I know,

66
00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:41.530
in what I will be presenting,

67
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.156
and in what I hope will be the outcome of the presentation.

68
00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:50.356
This reinforces my confidence by pushing aside my stress.

69
00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:55.356
Another technique is to try picturing yourself impressing the audience.

70
00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:56.619
Trust me, you will.

71
00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.777
Also it's important to relax before the presentation and think

72
00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:04.356
about nothing but how to make the most out of it.

73
00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:06.356
Build confidence in yourself.

74
00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:10.474
And vary the strength, tone or pitch of your voice,

75
00:04:10.474 --> 00:04:15.756
especially when you've done a presentation before; it can be easy to fall

76
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.356
into a drone-on with minimal changes to your inflections.

77
00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:22.198
Always speak as if you're speaking to a friend,

78
00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:25.356
not as if you are reading off some bullet points.

79
00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:30.356
Practice run-throughs as we discussed and this will help with this problem.

80
00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:31.423
Look presentable.

81
00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:34.089
Yes, what you wear matters.

82
00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.731
Appearance says a lot about someone's personality and confidence.

83
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:40.606
Now, what should you wear?

84
00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:43.606
Make sure you are entirely comfortable, of course,

85
00:04:43.606 --> 00:04:49.356
and feel confident in what you're wearing because all eyes will be on you.

86
00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.532
You may be wearing normal attire for your company.

87
00:04:52.532 --> 00:04:55.356
Maybe you are presenting to a new client.

88
00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:59.356
Then dress equal or maybe slightly better than your clients' attire.

89
00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:01.578
Don't know what they're wearing?

90
00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:03.356
Call and find out.

91
00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:05.023
Okay, here's a tip.

92
00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:08.356
Remember, you're the focus when you are presenting.

93
00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:11.885
The slides on the screen are only part of the

94
00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:14.356
presentation and not the main part really.

95
00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:18.356
Give some thought to your own presentation manner and style.

96
00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:20.356
You know, how do you hold yourself?

97
00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:22.356
How do you move around the room?

98
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.689
You are the focus when you are presenting no matter

99
00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.356
how interesting your slides are.

100
00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:33.356
Alright, now let's check out some delivery guidelines I'd like you to consider.

101
00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:36.213
Here are some guideline I'd like you to follow then

102
00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.356
you're delivering your presentation.

103
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:40.356
Always show what you're talking about and be sure that the slide

104
00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:42.856
you are on reflects what you are talking about.

105
00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:48.356
In fact, if possible, the actual line item you're talking about.

106
00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:49.546
Do not read the slide.

107
00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:52.404
When you read the slide, you are not looking at the audience,

108
00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:55.023
they see your back, and you've lost eye contact,

109
00:05:55.023 --> 00:05:57.356
and besides, anyone can read a slide.

110
00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:01.023
You want to embellish and provide the passion and animation which

111
00:06:01.023 --> 00:06:03.971
adds color and interest to what you're saying.

112
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:05.818
Ask for feedback.

113
00:06:05.818 --> 00:06:11.356
At times, stop and ask, is that point clear?

114
00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:15.356
Are there any questions on the final budget numbers, and things like that.

115
00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:20.356
Also, look out for body language that suggests questions or confusion.

116
00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:26.356
When you see it, stop, pause, and ask for feedback.

117
00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:26.737
Q&A.

118
00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:29.023
What time is the right time?

119
00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:32.832
Prepare for your Q&A at the end of the presentation,

120
00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:35.356
but be prepared to handle interruptions,

121
00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:38.356
questions, and objections during the presentation.

122
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:42.356
You might answer or address something quickly to help continue the tempo,

123
00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:45.499
but beware of attendees that are interested in

124
00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.356
slowing or derailing the presentation.

125
00:06:48.356 --> 00:06:50.198
In large crowds, they will be there,

126
00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.356
so answer questions at the end of the presentation in those cases.

127
00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:56.650
Make sure you listen to the questions carefully,

128
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.709
ask for clarifications if needed,

129
00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:03.499
and repeat the question to the rest of the audience to give you more time

130
00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:06.356
to think about the answer; it's a cool little trick.

131
00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:08.401
If you don't know the answer for a question,

132
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:12.356
be honest and say that you'll look into it since you don't know the answer.

133
00:07:12.356 --> 00:07:13.356
Ask questions.

134
00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:15.856
Questions arouse interest, peak curiosity,

135
00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:20.023
and engage audiences, so ask a lot of them,

136
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.356
given you have the time, of course.

137
00:07:22.356 --> 00:07:26.040
Build tension by posing a question and let your audience think for a moment

138
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.856
before moving to the next question or the next slide.

139
00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:32.156
Quiz their knowledge and then show them how little they know,

140
00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:34.023
in a good way, of course.

141
00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:38.023
If appropriate, engage in a little question and answer with your audience,

142
00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:41.499
with you asking the questions instead of the audience.

143
00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:45.356
Do not hand out the presentation until the end.

144
00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:49.944
What happens is, if you hand out the presentation prior to the presentation,

145
00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:52.156
typically attendees will leaf through it,

146
00:07:52.156 --> 00:07:57.356
be distracted, or look on the last slide to see the budget numbers.

147
00:07:57.356 --> 00:07:58.265
If at all possible,

148
00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:01.447
do not even show them the stack of handouts; have them hidden on a

149
00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:04.023
chair or have an associate bring them in later.

150
00:08:04.023 --> 00:08:07.689
You want them to be focused on you and your message,

151
00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:10.689
not on the piece of paper that it's on.

152
00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:11.689
Learn from experience.

153
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:15.356
Ask your team or professional mentors for their feedback to be

154
00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:20.023
able to identify your strengths and weaknesses and help you

155
00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:22.356
improve for your next presentation.

156
00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:25.856
Learn from other presenters and go listen to other

157
00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:29.356
people's presentations and take the time to benefit from

158
00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:39.000
their skills or their techniques. Okay, now let's check out what I don't want you to do when you're presenting.
