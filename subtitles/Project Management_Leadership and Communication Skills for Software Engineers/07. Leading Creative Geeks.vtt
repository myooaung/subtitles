00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.330
Just because you think you are a leader in an organization

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.480
does not mean anyone is following you, does it?

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.480
So every once in a while, maybe twice a year or quarterly, do a sanity check.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.813
"If you think are leading and turn around to see no one following,

5
00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:19.147
then you are just taking a walk.

6
00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:21.298
" I really like this quote.

7
00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:23.480
We need to do some feedback.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.480
So what I might suggest to you is have one-on-ones with your team.

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.099
So after you've been leading your new team for a while,

10
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.480
maybe the first three or three weeks have gone by,

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.623
ask them how they feel about your leadership and what they

12
00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.480
would like to see more of or maybe less of.

13
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.730
Get additional feedback from your manager.

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.730
Seek continuous feedback in order to calibrate and

15
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.539
modify your leadership behaviors, and if possible,

16
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.245
you should have one-on-ones with each team member about

17
00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.788
maybe once a month and maybe at the longest,

18
00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:56.480
once a quarter, to get their feedback.

19
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.730
Also, sit down with your key customers or stakeholders,

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.766
not just your team members, to see how well you are performing for them.

21
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:07.480
Remember, leadership does not have a boundary of just your team.

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.680
You are leading your customers to improve business processes,

23
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.480
make systems better, and support them.

24
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.147
So what do they think of your leadership?

25
00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:20.813
They will be quite impressed by your sincerity to come to

26
00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:25.480
them for their feedback and guidance.

27
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.707
Alright, let's get geeky for a minute.

28
00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:32.480
Maybe your new assignment is to lead a team of geeks and to be clear,

29
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.480
I use the term geek in a very complimentary way.

30
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.326
What I mean by creative geek is someone with a

31
00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:45.480
so-called independent self-concept.

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.147
Those who really don't need the group or the team to

33
00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:50.480
feel whole and self-confident.

34
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.813
So for individuals with an independent self-concept,

35
00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:56.147
it may be a real challenge to integrate them into

36
00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.424
your team and keep them motivated.

37
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:00.758
So how do you lead strong,

38
00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:05.326
creative individuals who operate outside of the group while making sure

39
00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:09.480
that they don't feel totally rejected or left out?

40
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.080
How do you make sure independent outsiders don't become

41
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.480
renegades or go off the rails or are hard to manage?

42
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.980
Well, here are three helpful tips.

43
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.480
The first tip, incorporate their creativity.

44
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.788
Consciously reinforce the idea that creative geeks fit

45
00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.480
into a larger collective effort.

46
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.954
Make it as clear as possible that their ideas are important

47
00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.480
in moving the agenda of the gorup forward.

48
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.909
This brings creative geeks in while enhancing their

49
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.480
self-worth and celebrating their great creativity.

50
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.563
Also, engage them through dialogue.

51
00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:48.480
Ask creative geeks what they are doing.

52
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.362
As how you can be of assistance.

53
00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:55.480
Coach them and partner with them as much as possible.

54
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.691
But you will need to set boundaries.

55
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.730
Within your company you need to set boundaries for your most creative people.

56
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.980
Though you may want to give them enough space outside of the group,

57
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.480
you will also need to monitor them to make sure that their

58
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.813
agenda does not spin out of control,

59
00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:14.025
putting the interest of the larger team in jeopardy.

60
00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:14.571
Okay.

61
00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:19.480
You are now settling in as the team leader.

62
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.330
How about leading a team of leaders?

63
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:30.480
What if everyone on your team was a leader in their own right?

64
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.249
So hey, are you the only leader in town?

65
00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:34.480
We talked about delegation.

66
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.662
What if you could delegate leadership?

67
00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:38.480
Now wouldn't that be cool?

68
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480
So what if you could have a team of leaders?

69
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.480
How powerful could that be?

70
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.796
So how do you create a team of leaders?

71
00:03:47.796 --> 00:03:50.743
It's by empowering every member to take ownership,

72
00:03:50.743 --> 00:03:54.337
to take initiative, and to deliver results,

73
00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:55.480
but how?

74
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.480
You might get the reaction, hey--not my problem--I'm not the boss.

75
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.480
So to enable ownership, delegate responsibility, let go.

76
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.480
Taking initiative typically ties to motivation and excitement, so foster it.

77
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.147
To deliver results, if you delegate responsibility and foster motivation,

78
00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:17.480
the results will naturally follow.

79
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.322
Yes, one plus one is three.

80
00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:20.796
Okay,

81
00:04:20.796 --> 00:04:30.000
now let's turn our attention to some practical management practices in the next session.
