00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.458
Aligning team goals to business goals.

2
00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:08.464
Your company may or may not have articulated and written business goals.

3
00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:11.964
Your company may do things via chitchat,

4
00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.964
just talking about things, verbal instructions.

5
00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:17.873
Your company may have well-written and structured goals.

6
00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:18.964
I love those!

7
00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:22.264
So whatever your company has, one or the other or both,

8
00:00:22.264 --> 00:00:25.364
here is what I recommend in determining your team's goals.

9
00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:25.764
First,

10
00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:30.964
work with your manager to understand the broader business goals of the company.

11
00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.864
Business, not IT.

12
00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.764
This will give your team the bigger picture of where the company is

13
00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:39.964
going and what the company wants to accomplish.

14
00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:40.258
Next,

15
00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.199
work with your manager to understand how you'll work in

16
00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.964
project aligned with the business goals.

17
00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:48.964
This will give you and your team a sense of value and purpose.

18
00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:52.964
Key elements to support inspiration and motivation.

19
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:53.297
Next,

20
00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:57.964
identify who your customers that would benefit from the work that you do are.

21
00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:00.317
This will give you an understanding of your project's stakeholder,

22
00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:03.297
a deeper understanding of what they really want and need.

23
00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:03.742
Remember,

24
00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:07.297
stakeholders are those people that have a vested

25
00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:10.353
interest in the success of your project.

26
00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:13.464
Usually they are recipients of the project's outcomes,

27
00:01:13.464 --> 00:01:17.520
but may also be, say for example, the IT infrastructure team.

28
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.686
Maybe it's the financial team who will want to know the budgets or cost savings,

29
00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:22.514
for example.

30
00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:24.714
Maybe it's the CEO.

31
00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:32.964
Okay, but let's check out an example of how you would go about doing this.

32
00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.964
Here's an example of aligning your IT projects to the business.

33
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.214
So first you've had your discussions with your manager and here are the

34
00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:43.600
three key business goals that he has described to you.

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.964
Increase revenue, avoid costs, and improve customer service.

36
00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:49.964
Of course, these are just examples.

37
00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:55.364
Then you'd work together as a team and come up with one of those IT goals

38
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:58.964
that would map into and support the business goals.

39
00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:01.589
The first one, say for example,

40
00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:05.964
enhance the ecommerce portal to support PayPal and multi-tendered payments.

41
00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:09.964
That's something that's very important that would drive an increase in revenue.

42
00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.035
Next, avoid costs.

43
00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:14.964
What would be something that could be done to avoid costs?

44
00:02:14.964 --> 00:02:18.297
Well, it turns out in talking to your stakeholders and your manager,

45
00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:22.535
we need to integrate more third-party shippers into the shipping cost algorithm.

46
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:25.964
This would give the company better shipping rates.

47
00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:27.742
And lastly, customer service.

48
00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:29.964
How might we improve that?

49
00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:34.839
Maybe we can update the call center app to support real-time customer service,

50
00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:35.964
the chat feature.

51
00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:39.964
Alright, so those could be our three IT goals.

52
00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:40.631
For example,

53
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.964
now what would be the work or projects that would

54
00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.964
align to support those IT goals?

55
00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:50.464
Well, first I would come up with my IT projects.

56
00:02:50.464 --> 00:02:54.964
I'm going to call it IT project IR/1 and IR/2.

57
00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:58.814
Those might be two projects I would define to support the

58
00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:03.328
IT goal and maybe under avoiding costs, I might have three projects.

59
00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:06.964
I'm going to call it AC/1 through AC/3.

60
00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:09.964
And lastly, improve customer service.

61
00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:12.964
I have one project, ICS/1.

62
00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:17.670
So my portfolio now consists of six projects to support

63
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.964
my IT goals and the business goals.

64
00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:23.535
It's clear what our team will be working on,

65
00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:25.250
it's clear on how they're aligned,

66
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.964
and it's easier to share with my manager or stakeholders.

67
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:35.964
Now that I have the project identified,

68
00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.964
it's very important to prioritize those projects.

69
00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:41.082
Not all projects are created equal.

70
00:03:41.082 --> 00:03:44.964
So I'm going to set up some categories for my priorities.

71
00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:47.596
I'm going to have a category for priority 1 projects,

72
00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:50.853
priority 2 projects, and kind of like everything that's left over,

73
00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:53.964
I'm going to call that my backlog.

74
00:03:53.964 --> 00:03:58.464
Now I also want to know what the priorities are for the company over all,

75
00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:00.806
the customers and stakeholders and right now,

76
00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:05.859
the company leaders are saying, sales are very important--that's run by Mr.

77
00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.964
Jones and the CEO also has some very important business priorities.

78
00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:12.648
Priority 2 is finance.

79
00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:13.490
That's Ms.

80
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.911
Smith.

81
00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:18.964
She's the focus for priorities in that area and I'd like to

82
00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:20.328
identify these also with people's names.

83
00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:23.964
I want this to be real and be able to go to that person and say,

84
00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:27.464
hey, help me with understanding your priorities,

85
00:04:27.464 --> 00:04:27.964
etc.

86
00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:29.502
And lastly, just backlog.

87
00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.964
Important things to do nonetheless, but they're considered backlogged.

88
00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:35.297
So I have customer service under Ms.

89
00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:38.964
Hughes and I have just true end users that really need

90
00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:41.055
some things in our systems as well.

91
00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:41.328
Okay,

92
00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:45.146
so I take those six IT projects that I have and I'm going to

93
00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:47.014
align them according to the priorities.

94
00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:49.814
Priority 1 was IR/1 and AC/2 and again,

95
00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:53.339
I figured out these priorities by talking to my manager,

96
00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.089
and talking to my customers and stakeholders and through those

97
00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:00.964
discussions and conversations I am able to determine what

98
00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:04.964
projects would be the most important, priority 1.

99
00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:09.964
The next would be priority 2 and the next would be priority 3.

100
00:05:09.964 --> 00:05:13.964
Now remember, your priorities are business driven, not IT driven.

101
00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:17.846
This slide and the previous slide are easy to write and

102
00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:19.964
very easy to share with management.

103
00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:23.964
At a glance, they can see how you are aligned and what you are working on.

104
00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:27.964
It makes it real easy for management to adjust your priorities as well.

105
00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:31.075
What is also so powerful about the management,

106
00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:32.242
adjusting your priorities,

107
00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:36.435
is that you've delegated up part of the responsibility of your priorities

108
00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:46.000
and now your management has to get in the game as well. This makes for a more cohesive engagement moving forward.
