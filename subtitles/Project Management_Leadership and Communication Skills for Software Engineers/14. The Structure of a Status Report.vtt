00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.762
So here is the structure of a status report that I

2
00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:07.909
recommend; I also call it my 3 P's as well.

3
00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.242
Whenever you're writing a status report,

4
00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:14.909
always answer at least one key question: where is the project now?

5
00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.009
People want to know what's going on.

6
00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
To answer that, we must look at both the past,

7
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.909
present, and future,

8
00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.909
because any status report is built with the following three categories.

9
00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:26.353
Progress.

10
00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:28.131
That's really the past.

11
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:33.909
What has been achieved since the last time I wrote this status report?

12
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.623
The next would be the plans.

13
00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:36.480
What's the future?

14
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.242
What are our goals and objectives that are coming up in the future,

15
00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.909
typically in the next period?

16
00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.242
So if I'm writing weekly status reports,

17
00:00:44.242 --> 00:00:48.678
the progress was from the last week and the plans will

18
00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:51.909
be for this next week coming up.

19
00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.273
And also, problems.

20
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:56.909
We always want to highlight issues and problems.

21
00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.380
I know that sounds counter-intuitive.

22
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.909
We don't want to hide anything; we want to open and ethical.

23
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.909
So what challenges have we encountered?

24
00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.909
And these are items that might be stuck or can't be finished.

25
00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.409
Problems often need help from someone else,

26
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.909
not just the employees as your teammates.

27
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.909
So you're going to maybe want to reach out in the status report.

28
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:16.225
Hey,

29
00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:19.383
here are some issues; I'm reaching back out to the

30
00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:21.909
infrastructure group; I'm reaching back out to the

31
00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.909
IT/security group to kind of get over some hurdles.

32
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.242
So that's really it.

33
00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:28.576
I just call it the 3 P's.

34
00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:31.909
That's the basis for the simplest and most common status

35
00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.909
report on which all variations are based on.

36
00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.909
Okay, so we can kind of give these little nicknames as well.

37
00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.773
So the first on progress is what's been done?

38
00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:46.371
What do we have to do that's coming up in the next reporting period?

39
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.601
And lastly, what are the open issues?

40
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.909
It's still the same thing.

41
00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.850
Now you can always add more categories to the three

42
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.909
here; no problem at all with that.

43
00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.014
In software development for example, you could list,

44
00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:02.172
well here are some proposed features that came out of a scrum.

45
00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:05.330
Here's an additional backlog of items that I need people's input on,

46
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.309
or maybe there is some customer feedback.

47
00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.709
Again,

48
00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.109
feel free to get creative so you can put the best

49
00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.109
status report you can together,

50
00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.615
but I would still recommend that you have at least these

51
00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:21.909
three core items and then add to those.

52
00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:28.063
Okay, now let's see how we'd actually put one together.

53
00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:29.909
Here's an example.

54
00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.909
Here are some basic mechanics of writing your status reports.

55
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.909
The preferred length for a status report is about 5 to 7 items per category.

56
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.085
Those categories are what we just talked about: progress,

57
00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:46.909
plan, issues, and if you add others categories.

58
00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.909
We just don't want that status report too long.

59
00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.509
If it's too long, it won't be read, but again, be flexible and be creative.

60
00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.909
If you need to put 9, you put 9 and if you put 3, you put 3.

61
00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.159
Okay, next.

62
00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.909
When adding items, keep something mind.

63
00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.284
Write everything thinking of how others,

64
00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:11.909
the readers, may understand it; you're not writing for yourself.

65
00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
Next, use sentences that follow the 5 C's, of course.

66
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.438
Don't use just one or two words here and there.

67
00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:20.909
Use longer sentences, provide commentary and background.

68
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.909
You're trying to provide good, timely, informative information.

69
00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.096
Also, make sure it's easy to understand.

70
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:31.659
Always think, if your customer,

71
00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.000
manager or coworkers will understand and learn

72
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.909
something from what you've written, then that's great.

73
00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.509
That's what you want.

74
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:40.909
You want information to be conveyed.

75
00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.909
So good wording is a key to successful status reporting.

76
00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.020
Of course, you'll want to send regularly.

77
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.909
Regularity is a good status reporting practice and always on time.

78
00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.909
If it's Monday morning to your manager, it's Monday morning.

79
00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.262
If it's Wednesday afternoon to a certain customer,

80
00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:02.242
it's always Wednesday afternoon, so they can expect to receive it.

81
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:06.909
Next, decide what is that regular cycle?

82
00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.909
You know, we'd all go crazy if we had to write, you know, daily status reports?

83
00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:11.242
Quarterly?

84
00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:13.909
Well, maybe that's a little too long, too.

85
00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.109
So, in general, I like weekly or monthly.

86
00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.909
That seems to be the best paradigm.

87
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:20.766
But again,

88
00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:25.909
be creative and determine what your customer or the recipient would like.

89
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.330
So don't just guess at what you think the timeliness or regularity may be,

90
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.909
actually call up the customer.

91
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.909
Hey, I'm thinking of giving you a status report once a week.

92
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.209
Great!

93
00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.609
They might say once a month is plenty.

94
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:40.909
So find out from your customers or your manager what the

95
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.909
timeliness of that status report should be.

96
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.435
And always keep a copy for your records.

97
00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:49.909
This could come in very handy when looking back over time,

98
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.909
wondering well, what did my team do over the last six months?

99
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.576
The status reports have a wealth of information that you can draw

100
00:04:57.576 --> 00:05:01.172
from for performance reviews or reminding your manager or your

101
00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:03.698
customers of all the work that you've done.

102
00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:05.909
It's a great way to document that.

103
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.052
Okay, well, here's a tip.

104
00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:14.909
I'd like you never to use bullets and I want you always to use numbered lists,

105
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.242
also known as ordered lists, in each of your categories such as progress,

106
00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:22.225
plan and problems or other categories and here is why.

107
00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:25.909
Someone calls you on the phone and says, hey, thanks for the status report.

108
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.909
I've got a question about the progress area and it's,

109
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.009
oh, well wait a minute--one, two, three,

110
00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.242
I think it's the fourth bullet down.

111
00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:35.909
That's a waste of time and that's silly.

112
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.039
So I always want you to use numbered lists so it's 1,

113
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.909
2, 3, 4, 5 and maybe under 2 it's 2b, etc.

114
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.242
That way, someone can call or reply to your email and say hey,

115
00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:48.909
I've got a question about your future plans,

116
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.020
it's item 3c and here's my question.

117
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.909
So it's very clear, it's very concise, and it's very understandable.

118
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:57.465
Alright, great.

119
00:05:57.465 --> 00:06:00.520
Now let's move on and I'll actually show you an example

120
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.659
of creating a real-live status report.

121
00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.909
Now here is a very simple example.

122
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:14.159
We're going to start with the status report title: Status

123
00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.909
Report--POLAR Phase 5 Activity for 9/28/2015.

124
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.576
So that's the title of our status report.

125
00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:22.909
Now I've added a new first section.

126
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:24.409
I like one called Logistics.

127
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.109
For example, Michael will be out of the office,

128
00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:29.742
John will be acting as the meeting leader,

129
00:06:29.742 --> 00:06:33.909
and he can be reached at phone number and email.

130
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.380
So sometimes logistics is great.

131
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.733
It might talk about holidays coming up, vacations,

132
00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:40.576
new people coming onto projects, etc.

133
00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:43.909
It's just basic housekeeping.

134
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.380
Now I get into the 3 P's.

135
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.085
So progress.

136
00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:48.144
Progress for when?

137
00:06:48.144 --> 00:06:49.909
I put the date range.

138
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.909
We identified and resolved the file upload issue.

139
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.004
I don't go into all the details on how it got fixed; I

140
00:06:56.004 --> 00:06:57.909
just want to say that it's been resolved.

141
00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.052
If someone has a question, they can reply and say hey,

142
00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:04.766
item 2a, I have a question, how did you actually resolve that?

143
00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:06.909
That might be of interest.

144
00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.465
The next progress item,

145
00:07:08.465 --> 00:07:12.353
completed 50% of the LDAP integration to enable users to

146
00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:14.798
sign in using Active Directory accounts.

147
00:07:14.798 --> 00:07:19.242
So that's another item that we have had progress on,

148
00:07:19.242 --> 00:07:21.909
but obviously, it's still in work.

149
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:29.909
Alright, now let me go to the next page here and continue this simple example.

150
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.909
We are now continuing a simple example of a status report.

151
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:35.818
Okay, the next piece would be plans.

152
00:07:35.818 --> 00:07:38.818
So for plans, I put the date range in the future,

153
00:07:38.818 --> 00:07:39.364
of course,

154
00:07:39.364 --> 00:07:42.909
and here are the things that our team is planning to do for the polar project.

155
00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.909
We're going to complete the LDAP/AD integration and we're

156
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.409
going to perform an end-to-end test cycle for the file

157
00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.909
upload issue that we solved.

158
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:53.968
We solved it in the last cycle,

159
00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:56.909
but we did not actually do the full end-to-end test.

160
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.909
And lastly, I'm going to list my problems.

161
00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:03.123
Discovered an issue with the audit log tracking database

162
00:08:03.123 --> 00:08:04.909
permissions in the production environment.

163
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:07.909
I've got an action here, assigned to John for analysis.

164
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:11.659
I don't even know how this problem might be resolved,

165
00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:13.909
but I've identified the problem, etc.

166
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:15.409
You will list your problems here,

167
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:18.909
maybe more in the plans and more in the progress that we did before,

168
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:21.909
but again, this is just a very simple status report.

169
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:22.147
Alright,

170
00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:25.004
now let's move on to the next piece in which I'm just

171
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.909
going to show you some really simple, good,

172
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:34.909
general practices for status reporting.

173
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:40.909
Let me summarize some general rules of thumb for writing status reports.

174
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.576
Keep it short and simple.

175
00:08:42.576 --> 00:08:46.909
Managers are busy people who don't have a lot of time to read.

176
00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:48.576
If your managers wants the details,

177
00:08:48.576 --> 00:08:51.076
they will ask; if your customer wants the details,

178
00:08:51.076 --> 00:08:51.909
they will ask.

179
00:08:51.909 --> 00:08:57.067
If you have many of the same sorts of things to track: bug lists,

180
00:08:57.067 --> 00:08:58.541
change orders, work orders,

181
00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:01.290
etc., a spreadsheet or database might be an easier way to

182
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.195
keep tabs on all that kind of work,

183
00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:06.052
but those details should only be referenced with a

184
00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:08.909
document name or a URL or an attachment.

185
00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:12.755
Don't dump a lot of details into a status report.

186
00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:13.909
Keep it clean.

187
00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.063
Also, be specific.

188
00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:18.909
Keep copies of your status reports for your own reference.

189
00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:21.909
If you are using email to send them out,

190
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:25.909
of course, email systems can keep your sent file so that's great.

191
00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:29.330
Your archive of status reports could help you write a resume or list

192
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.321
accomplishments when it comes time for an employee review.

193
00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:38.909
Either for you or if you're having your team members write them for you.

194
00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:40.338
Write and send regularly.

195
00:09:40.338 --> 00:09:43.909
We mentioned this, but I will again; it's that important.

196
00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:46.120
If you plan to write status reports,

197
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.909
write the regularly or at least keep a running list of accomplishments,

198
00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:53.909
so you don't spend hours tracking down what you have done.

199
00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:56.576
Keep the report positive, if possible.

200
00:09:56.576 --> 00:10:01.909
This is not a place to complain or editorialize or make excuses.

201
00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:05.170
One good way to do this is to suggest a solution or at least a

202
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.576
direction to explore if you have a problem to report.

203
00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:09.909
That will show that you have initiative.

204
00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.120
If you do have serious issues,

205
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.909
just go in and talk to your boss or your customer in person.

206
00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:19.818
Now I'm not suggesting sugar-coating your status report.

207
00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:20.909
Not at all.

208
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:24.034
Always and I mean always be open and honest and

209
00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:25.909
bring any important issues to light.

210
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:29.909
Just don't be a complainer or a blamer.

211
00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:30.909
Be professional.

212
00:10:30.909 --> 00:10:32.909
Follow the 5 C's.

213
00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:35.120
And give credit where credit is due.

214
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.383
Thank a coworker, customer,

215
00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:41.091
or external vendor for all the help maybe with a difficult task.

216
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:44.909
If you've helped somebody else, say so.

217
00:10:44.909 --> 00:10:45.909
That's really good.

218
00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:54.000
Give credit where credit is due. Now let's move on to the next section on writing creative emails.
