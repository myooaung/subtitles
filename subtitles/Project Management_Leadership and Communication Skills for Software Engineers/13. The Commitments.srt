1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,130
Now you will need to use your verbal and leadership skills to ensure

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,076
proper actions or determine the right persons are assigned and are

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,234
committed to the completion of the task and of course,

4
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,497
by a certain date.

5
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,497
It all gets written down during the meeting,

6
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:19,952
published in the meeting notes, and tracked by you as a meeting leader.

7
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:23,133
Okay, okay, time for a pop quiz.

8
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,497
Are you ready?

9
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:25,122
Alright.

10
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:29,497
Five frogs are sitting on a log.

11
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,719
Four decide to jump off.

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,497
How many are left?

13
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:35,997
Well, what do you think?

14
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:36,497
One?

15
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:40,497
That's what I thought, too, but it's five.

16
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:45,497
Because deciding is different than doing.

17
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:49,097
So the moral of the story: decisions are worthless

18
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:51,497
unless you turn them into commitments.

19
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:55,497
So, what's a commitment?

20
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:59,497
Let's break one down.

21
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:02,697
A commitment is made up of three parts.

22
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:07,497
The first is who owns the commitment, also known as the owner.

23
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:09,556
Next, what the commitment is.

24
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:14,497
That is, what task they will do, also known as the deliverable.

25
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:16,164
And lastly, by when?

26
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,414
The due date.

27
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:22,830
And what I like to add to the due date is just how,

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,497
that is what context will the delivery of the test take place?

29
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:27,042
For example,

30
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:30,588
will the owner send an email with the results or maybe be on

31
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:34,997
the agenda for the next time with the answer,

32
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,497
or what?

33
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,444
Now let's go through a detailed example.

34
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:45,497
I think we need to back up the database nightly, says Joe.

35
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:51,497
That sounds reasonable; anyone have any other suggestions, says the leader?

36
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:54,497
Silence, so I guess not.

37
00:01:54,497 --> 00:02:01,497
Okay, so Joe, can you perform the backups nightly, says the leader?

38
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,830
That's the what.

39
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,497
That's the deliverable that's being asked.

40
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:06,861
Yes, says Joe.

41
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,497
Okay, now we know who the owner is.

42
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,420
Okay, great.

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,497
Joe what date will have that in place, says the leader?

44
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:20,497
November 20, and add me to the agenda, says Joe.

45
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:22,845
So now we have the when and the delivery.

46
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:23,627
In other words,

47
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:27,732
it will be delivered in the next meeting by way of an agenda item.

48
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,203
And of course, thank you, Joe.

49
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:33,497
I will note your action in the notes.

50
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:39,392
Okay, so that was a simple example of how you get the what--the deliverable,

51
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:43,497
the who--the owner, and when and how that will be delivered.

52
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:51,497
Alright, now let's discuss meeting commitment guidelines.

53
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,392
Here are some simple guidelines to help you with getting the

54
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,847
commitments you need to be successful in your meetings.

55
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,997
At the end of each topic in a meeting,

56
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:03,497
pause to agree on the next steps and establish specific

57
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:04,909
commitments with clear deadlines.

58
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:09,497
Let people know they can negotiate at the time they make the commitments,

59
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,392
especially with regard to due dates.

60
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,918
They may have other things on their plate,

61
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:17,708
other things going on and so it's a good time to talk,

62
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,497
decide hey, this will be the good time when I can deliver.

63
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:24,497
And don't use automatic by the next meeting as the due date.

64
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:29,497
Be thoughtful about what timing makes the most sense.

65
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:33,941
Make clear that you expect each commitment will be fulfilled

66
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:37,497
as agreed upon and if something comes up,

67
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,497
you expect they'll reach out to discuss the change.

68
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:43,497
So how I do it in my meetings is,

69
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:46,497
absolutely with no exception we will fulfill the commitment.

70
00:03:46,497 --> 00:03:47,918
But of course!

71
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:48,865
Life happens!

72
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:55,497
Call or email with any changes so we can make notes and move forward.

73
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:56,164
And lastly,

74
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:59,497
assign someone to check in at appropriate intervals to ensure

75
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:03,497
the commitments will be kept as promised or reevaluated if

76
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,497
something unexpectedly comes up.

77
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:07,897
Now if the commitment dates are pretty short,

78
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:11,497
you may not need this, but if commitment dates are pretty long,

79
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:13,164
two, three, four weeks or even longer,

80
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:23,000
you're going to need to keep track of each of those and see how they're doing. Okay, now let's drill in on ownership and what that means.
