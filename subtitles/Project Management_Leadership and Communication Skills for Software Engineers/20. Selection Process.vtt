00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.022
Now let's select the candidate.

2
00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:03.367
Okay,

3
00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:07.878
we want to first review our requirements and make sure we fully understand

4
00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:11.660
our requirements as we listed them earlier in the process.

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.160
We want to double check to make sure all the

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.660
questions that were asked are scored.

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.660
They either got it right or wrong or maybe even a partial score is fine as well.

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.660
Then we want to calculate their complete scores based on the weights.

9
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.307
Remember we weighted things.

10
00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:30.660
Maybe some things were worth 15% or 20% or 5%, things like that.

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.660
So we want to apply the weightings and then we want to rank the candidates.

12
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.716
Those with the highest scores are on top and those with

13
00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:40.660
the lower scores are on the bottom.

14
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.660
Now we basically want to select the top person who scored the most.

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.765
That's the likely candidate we're going to pick.

16
00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.660
This way it's a little more objective, but before we do,

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.607
we certainly want to get the team together.

18
00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:57.660
We want to discuss, come to an agreement, and then select.

19
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.160
Maybe there is some odd reason why the person ranked

20
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.660
the highest isn't the best candidate.

21
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.327
I suppose that's possible, maybe based on timing.

22
00:01:04.327 --> 00:01:09.535
Maybe that person can't start for another two months or something like that.

23
00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.660
Discuss, agree, and then select.

24
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.089
And what I'd also like you to do is document the reason

25
00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:19.060
why you selected the particular candidate or why you did

26
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.660
not select certain candidates.

27
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.660
This can be very important.

28
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.891
In large corporations with HR organizations,

29
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:29.660
occasionally there are complaints or lawsuits filed.

30
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.803
You want to have all your paperwork in place.

31
00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:35.660
You want to have all your scores and weightings in place so you can

32
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.160
show objectively that you treated everyone equally,

33
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.660
as you should.

34
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.993
Okay,

35
00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:44.327
now that you have someone selected and you've discussed and

36
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:46.660
agreed who the best candidate would be,

37
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.993
you want to complete whatever HR or company paperwork is required to move

38
00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:54.910
the processing forward for the particular new hire.

39
00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.660
Okay, now let's move on to the remaining paperwork.

40
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.607
Okay, now on to the final paperwork.

41
00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:08.818
Of course, you always want to follow any company process,

42
00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:09.993
especially HR processes.

43
00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:12.660
Make sure you understand those and follow those,

44
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660
but typically what will happen next is an offer letter will go out.

45
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.410
The person will receive that, read that,

46
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.115
maybe there are even a couple questions you can chat about.

47
00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:28.660
Next is the acceptance, or possibly the rejection, okay?

48
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.360
So if they accept, great, you can move on.

49
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.660
If they reject, you'll want to know, who is on deck?

50
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.760
You want to assemble the team again,

51
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.760
look at who the second person was that was ranked,

52
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.660
discuss that person,

53
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.660
and start the process over in terms of another offer letter for that person.

54
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.660
And then lastly, of course, is final acceptance.

55
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.601
Once that person has actually accepted and typically there is

56
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.660
usually the signing of an acceptance letter,

57
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.344
then you can inform the other candidates they were not

58
00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.660
accepted and you're going to keep them on file.

59
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.660
Okay, now let's move on with a great closing quote.

60
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.660
"I am convinced that nothing we do is more important

61
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.660
than hiring and developing people.

62
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.231
At the end of the day you bet on people, not on strategies.

63
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.778
" And I believe that, too, wholeheartedly.

64
00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:30.000
Good luck in your search for the best and the brightest. Now let's summarize this module.
