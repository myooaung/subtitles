A final word.

2
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:04,819
Thank you very much for taking my course.

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:06,319
I, like you,

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,319
confronted my fears of migrating from technical roles

5
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:12,819
to leadership and management roles.

6
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:16,819
My metamorphosis was even a struggle at times and actually took a few years.

7
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,274
As I look back, I am glad and very rewarded by my career choices,

8
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:24,924
so I want to give you encouragement and confidence as well.

9
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,608
So if you have the opportunity for a leadership role,

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:33,290
go forward knowing you have my course as a guide to navigate the

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,819
challenges of leadership and I'm here to help as well.

12
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:46,000
