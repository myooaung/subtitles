00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,667
Hello.

2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,206
I will be presenting the module, Let's Talk in the course,

4
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:12,100
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,500
Okay, let's get started with this very insightful quote.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,567
Here's a quote from John Baldoni: "The words a leader speaks are important,

7
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:24,500
of course.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,045
But how they are delivered can make all the difference.

9
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,500
" So what we're saying is, the words that leaders speak are important.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,800
That is, the content, that is what you say is important,

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,029
but how they are delivered can make all the difference.

12
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:41,676
Don't forget about the how.

13
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:47,500
The what and the how are wrapped together in your message.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,929
So improving verbal communication skills is typically more

15
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,500
challenging than improving your written skills.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,500
With written skills, you may have a little more time to think and plan.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
So as much as possible, also apply that approach to the verbal side of things.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,786
Think and plan before you speak.

19
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:11,500
For an upcoming presentation, you may have a week or two to think and plan,

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
the what and the how you will say something.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,024
In an impromptu meeting,

22
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:19,833
you have maybe 3 seconds to think and plan about

23
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,500
how and what you're going to say.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Okay, we're going to help you in both of those categories.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Now let's check out the overview of this module.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,900
So the bottom line of this module is how you can improve your verbal skills and

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,500
speak with impact and influence in your business settings.

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Okay, now let's see the key topics we will cover.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
First, some general effective communication tips in the verbal arena.

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Next, the 5 C's and how they apply to the verbal concepts.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,409
Then five key areas that are essential to your new leadership role: The first

32
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,500
being presentations because you'll be giving a lot those.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Meetings, you'll probably be having more meetings as well.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Stand-ups, that's the impromptu get-together with your team.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,375
Walk-arounds, that's the casual walking around,

36
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,188
getting to know people and talking to them and

37
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:18,500
understanding them from a more impromptu approach.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,056
Interviews, hiring new people.

39
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,722
All these are critical and essential and the core elements that I

40
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:28,500
think are important for your new role as a leader.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,000
So this module will focus on the verbal communications,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,429
hence "Let's Talk, " but also the interpersonal aspect of verbal communication.

43
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:44,500
Such things as body language, class, style, finesse, personality, humor even.

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
So this module will be the touchy-feely module.

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,269
So certainly the emphasis will be verbal communication skills,

46
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,500
but let's face it.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,289
If you only spoke in monotone and never smiled,

48
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:59,500
had poor manners, and was not available to your team,

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,500
do you think anyone would listen to any message that you spoke?

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Uh, no!

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,167
These will all be described and presented following

52
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,500
the theme of the software engineer, you,

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
in your new role as delegated from your manager to lead and build a team.

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,167
I will first describe the topic or concept and then may also show specific

55
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,100
poor (things not to do) and good (things to do) examples,

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,500
so you can see the differences.

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,342
Another important thing I want to emphasize is that

58
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:36,026
when you are being verbal (talking), there is also the visual side of it as well.

59
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:39,395
That is, people are observing and watching you,

60
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:42,912
whether it is conscious or subconscious in the observers.

61
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,088
Therefore I will also be addressing the visual aspects

62
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:52,000
of you speaking or talking as well. Alright, let's get started.
