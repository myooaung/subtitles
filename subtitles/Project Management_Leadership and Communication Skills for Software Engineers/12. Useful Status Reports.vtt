00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.156
Yes, status reports can be useful and why do we do them?

2
00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:11.156
We want to enable clarity and accountability to the actions

3
00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.156
that your team has just accomplished.

4
00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:18.006
Whether or not your boss asks you for a status report,

5
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.156
writing one can be a good opportunity to effectively

6
00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.215
communicate your accomplishments.

7
00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:27.611
A good status report would not only keep your boss and customers up to speed,

8
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:32.156
but also help keep you on track with your assignments.

9
00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:35.156
It actually is very helpful to keep you on track.

10
00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:38.013
Here are the fundamentals of writing a reader

11
00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:40.156
friendly status report in this section.

12
00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:44.156
Also, we always want to keep in mind our 5 C's that we learned before.

13
00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:50.156
Okay, let's get started.

14
00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:55.156
Here is probably what most people think about writing status reports.

15
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:58.925
Management wants weekly status reports, of course,

16
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.156
but no one reads those anyway.

17
00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:03.489
Oh, what's the point?

18
00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.156
When I ask someone for a status report, usually their eyes just gloss over.

19
00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.243
They just don't get it.

20
00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:11.852
I'm here to tell you that you are now the leader and

21
00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:13.593
you will need to lead your team,

22
00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:17.531
which means make sure they understand the clear and

23
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:20.156
important essentials of writing status reports.

24
00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:22.243
So as the new leader of your team,

25
00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.634
you will probably not relish the fact that you will now need to

26
00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:28.383
write not one but maybe a couple per week.

27
00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:31.565
I'm here to tell you that this is truly important,

28
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:35.878
truly can be used to not only inform the recipients (your customers,

29
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:37.045
your managers, etc.

30
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:37.434
),

31
00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:41.156
but provide a platform to display and promote your

32
00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.156
team's activities and accomplishments.

33
00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:50.156
Status reports are not career killers but career enablers if done right.

34
00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:50.429
Okay,

35
00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.156
now let's explore why they are important and I know

36
00:01:53.156 --> 00:02:02.000
you didn't want to hear that, but you are a leader now and you will need to begin acting like one.
