1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,333
Here are some simple rules of thumb to think about

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,000
prior to doing your walk-arounds.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,713
Make walking around just part of your normal routine.

4
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:13,570
Dropping in on employees' work spaces for an informal chat is most

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,125
effective if you don't do it on some sort of fixed schedule since

6
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:21,007
you'll realize the greatest returns by seeing what's going on when

7
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,570
people aren't prepared for you.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,856
But do plan for a bit of walking around on your own calendar every day,

9
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,900
if you can possibly do that for maybe, you know,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,713
a few minutes here and a few minutes there.

11
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,713
The more often you do it, the more benefits you'll realize.

12
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,986
Certainly, don't bring a committee.

13
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:40,713
This is just about you personally.

14
00:00:40,713 --> 00:00:45,088
Walking around works best as a continual stream of one-on-one

15
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,772
conversations with individual employees over a series of time.

16
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:52,654
Bringing aides or assistants with you would probably just inhibit the

17
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:54,856
discussion by making people feel more self-conscious,

18
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,713
or worse, make them feel your ganging up on them.

19
00:00:57,713 --> 00:01:01,713
If you really do need a meeting with several people, then go call a meeting.

20
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:02,654
Include everybody.

21
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:07,360
We have talked a lot about inclusion and that notion

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,088
that makes great leaders even greater.

23
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:13,838
So in all aspects of leadership and here is just

24
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:15,713
another example of using inclusion.

25
00:01:15,713 --> 00:01:19,397
As anyone might guess who is familiar with how office rumor mills get spinning,

26
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:22,559
dropping in on some folks more often than others is likely

27
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,713
to create the wrong kind of impression.

28
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:27,168
Try to spend roughly the same amount of time,

29
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:29,895
not necessarily all the same day or the same week,

30
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:34,713
but over the long run with each person who reports to you.

31
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,213
And follow up with answers.

32
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,713
You may get some questions.

33
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,213
So if you can't answer an employee's question off the top of your head,

34
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:41,713
that's fine.

35
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:45,427
Don't forget to get back to him or her with the answer later;

36
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,713
it's just common courtesy and it builds trust,

37
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:51,142
and it also shows you listen and care and if the question

38
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:53,142
and the answer were of great importance,

39
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:55,349
you might even send out an email saying,

40
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,440
oh by the way.

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,168
Mary had this great question and I answered it and

42
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,588
thought I should share that with everyone.

43
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,713
It shows you another level of inclusion of that person's question.

44
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:06,772
Next, don't criticize.

45
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:07,831
Don't be critical.

46
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:12,269
Remember, you're kind of on a fact-finding mission to get a pulse,

47
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:16,713
so with the secondary purpose of building rapport.

48
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,292
So to avoid undermining those names,

49
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:21,713
if you find that an employee isn't performing his or her job correctly,

50
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:24,168
don't attempt to change the behavior on the spot.

51
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:28,098
Just make a note of it and address the problem at a later time.

52
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:32,713
Maybe if you have one-on-one meetings or in a private setting, okay?

53
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,313
Next, don't overdo it.

54
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:38,713
Don't leave people feeling that you're always looking over their shoulders.

55
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:42,427
Wander around often enough to get a good feel for what's going on,

56
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:45,077
but not too often or it becomes a distraction.

57
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:47,258
You'll get the feel for it.

58
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:48,713
You'll figure it out.

59
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:49,713
Here's a tip.

60
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:52,380
The higher up you are in the organization,

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,142
the more flattered you will feel when you poke your head in and say hi.

62
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:57,713
So again,

63
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:02,031
in our scenario you're basically the team leader and there is just one level up,

64
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:05,849
but you can imagine that if the CEO of your company popped

65
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,713
his or head into your office and said, hey,

66
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:11,175
you got a second to talk about something?

67
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,713
You'd say, wow, who me?

68
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:16,831
So you feel really good about that when people come to you and say,

69
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:17,713
hey, let's talk.

70
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:18,213
So again,

71
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:21,963
that org chart and later in your career when you're higher up the org chart,

72
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:23,613
don't forget this technique.

73
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:31,713
It makes people feel good and included and special.

74
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:35,046
Now here are some rules of thumb related to the

75
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,713
actual execution of walking around.

76
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,846
First of course, relax.

77
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:42,580
People will sense your genuineness and casualness

78
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,713
and they'll respond accordingly.

79
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:48,405
Stiff or formal conversation will probably lead to

80
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,713
equally rigid and stiff responses.

81
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,595
Listen and observe more than you talk.

82
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:57,713
Use more of an active listening approach with your team.

83
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:00,046
When people feel you are hearing them,

84
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,713
they'll probably seem to be more sincere and tell you more.

85
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:07,713
Ask for feedback and suggestions and recognize good ideas.

86
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:10,654
Ask each employee for his or her thoughts about how

87
00:04:10,654 --> 00:04:12,419
to improve products or processes, sales,

88
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,134
service, whatever.

89
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:16,924
Then if someone's idea leads to a positive result,

90
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,046
make it known whose suggestion it was and show you're

91
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,713
ready to give credit where credit is due.

92
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,570
Let everyone know that you want ideas to make things

93
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,142
better and as a leader in your new role,

94
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:32,239
people may think that your opinions and ideas are right,

95
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,713
so hold back from saying what you think all the time.

96
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,713
The goal is to see what others think and what others have to say.

97
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,713
Use the time for spontaneous or just-in-time recognition.

98
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:46,066
If you see something good, compliment the person.

99
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,713
This is a perfect way to show your gratitude.

100
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:53,134
So maybe the walk-around is simply poking your head in the office and saying,

101
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:56,935
hey, Joe, thanks for fixing that stored proc that didn't work the other day; boy,

102
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,713
that really saved us a lot of time.

103
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:01,863
Hey, have a good day, and you move on.

104
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:05,363
20 seconds of your time and that person feels good,

105
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,046
recognized, included, and motivated.

106
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,713
This is not for serious issues.

107
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:12,113
Don't use this time to judge or critique.

108
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:15,951
This may make people nervous when you're around and you don't want that.

109
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:19,284
If you see something that concerns you, talk to the person later in private,

110
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:23,713
maybe one on one in your office or a conference room.

111
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,292
Answer questions openly and honestly,

112
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:29,081
but you won't have all the answers and if you don't know,

113
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,713
no worry.

114
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:33,713
Find out and then follow up and if you can't share something, say so.

115
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:35,555
Hey, that's a little private right now,

116
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:38,187
corporate is still deciding it; I'm unable to share that,

117
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:41,537
but when I know, I will tell you.

118
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:46,713
So telling half-truths can break down trust, so don't do that.

119
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,026
Communicate.

120
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,901
Share company goals or philosophies, values,

121
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:52,784
or vision or whatever you need to share when you're walking around.

122
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:55,999
You have many opportunities to mutually share information that

123
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:00,713
helps everyone understand and do their jobs better.

124
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,380
Chat.

125
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,713
Effective organizations aren't all about work, work, work.

126
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,102
They're also about building relationships.

127
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:11,157
Maybe you want to learn the names of your staff's kids,

128
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:14,713
find out what they love to do or where they're going on vacation.

129
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:17,660
Maybe even joke or laugh or have fun.

130
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,713
I really like joking, laughing, and having fun with my teammates.

131
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:25,427
You may be surprised at how great it feels to relate on a

132
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,713
personal level with the people in your office.

133
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,269
Now here's a tip.

134
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,157
This make take some practice, but give it a try.

135
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,713
It is so worthwhile.

136
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:41,000
Alright, now let's move on to the next section on the verbal skills of interviewing.
