00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.703
Now that you are the team lead,

2
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.793
you will be responsible to set up and lead your staff meetings,

3
00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:09.051
working meetings, meetings with customers,

4
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:12.051
and mainly meetings with your management.

5
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.651
Most people, when they hear the dreaded word meeting,

6
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:22.551
either panic or run, maybe even both and both of those may be the right move.

7
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.051
Here is an appropriate quote.

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:30.698
"A meeting is an event at which the minutes are kept and the hours are lost.

9
00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:34.551
" But what if I told you that if you could set up and run

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.551
meetings in a way I will be describing,

11
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:41.718
people will show up and things will get done?

12
00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:45.718
Okay, tell me more, you say?

13
00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:47.051
Let's see.

14
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:51.051
Now here are the steps for a successful meeting.

15
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.522
Now contrary to popular belief,

16
00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:56.051
you don't just show up and expect the meeting to be productive.

17
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:57.384
Don't get me wrong.

18
00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:00.384
I'm all for stand-ups and quick meetings as needed,

19
00:01:00.384 --> 00:01:01.718
but for important, productive,

20
00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:06.451
and critical meetings with key members of your company or your customers,

21
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.051
I recommend the following.

22
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:15.051
Plan, prepare, lead, and the follow-ups.

23
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:18.718
Now the first two relate to writing of the meeting materials

24
00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:21.384
and we covered those in Know Your ABC's,

25
00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:22.908
and the next two,

26
00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:28.051
the leading and the follow-up are related to verbal and interpersonal skills.

27
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.718
Okay, so in this module, let's talk.

28
00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:31.384
We will focus on the last two,

29
00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:41.000
leading and follow-ups and how they will improve your leadership skills necessary for effective and productive meetings.
