1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,773
If you don't think about what you need in a new employee ahead of time,

2
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:10,411
you will have a much harder time knowing when you find him or her,

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:14,199
so here is a simple, basic process to get you started.

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:16,699
Follow company HR standards and policy.

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:19,199
Always follow company policy and standards.

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,146
So the process and approach I am recommending,

7
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:26,926
must be used in context and are in conjunction with your company standards.

8
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,199
Alright, so in general, here are the following steps.

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,122
Step 1.

10
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:36,199
Document your requirements and then post them online and social media.

11
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:39,199
I'm going to go into each of these in detail in the following slides.

12
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,799
Step 2.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,199
Phone call interview.

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,399
Step 3.

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,199
An in-person interview.

16
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:47,342
Step 4.

17
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:50,199
Possibly a follow-on in-person interview.

18
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,032
Step 5.

19
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:52,282
The selection process.

20
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:55,199
You know, getting down to one person.

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,677
Step 6, of course is the HR paperwork.

22
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:02,590
Now the focus of this section are steps 2,

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,460
3, 4,

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,999
and 5 because those are the ones where your verbal and

25
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:11,199
interpersonal skills are critical and the most important.

26
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:11,846
Okay,

27
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:17,670
for completeness we will still cover each step but

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,199
drill deeper into steps 2 through 5.

29
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,199
Document your requirements.

30
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:27,199
Just like when you build software, you need to know the requirements.

31
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,199
So, why are you hiring?

32
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,199
Did someone leave the group?

33
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,866
Did management approve another person?

34
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,199
Is the workload overwhelming?

35
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:40,199
As a backdrop to the hiring process, first understand why and document it.

36
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:44,199
Next, document the business requirements required by this person.

37
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:47,199
Let's put the technical aspects aside just for a moment.

38
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:50,199
We want to understand and identify the business requirements.

39
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:50,949
For example,

40
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:55,074
competition to your company is driving the need to expand their

41
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,699
internet e-commerce presence and in particular,

42
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:00,199
multi-tendered point of sale transactions.

43
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:03,532
Maybe you need to find someone that may have that

44
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,199
experience in the business domain.

45
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:09,199
Next, document the technical requirements for this person.

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,140
Now identify what I call the alphabet soup of requirements such as.

47
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,199
NET, C#, SQL, Bootstrap, etc.

48
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,017
Those are the tools, platforms, operating systems,

49
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:22,199
project management skills, etc.

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,699
You may also need to identify process oriented skills like code promotion

51
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,699
using software configuration and build release tools.

52
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,199
This skill is sometimes known as DevOps.

53
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,045
Communication and leadership requirements.

54
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:39,199
Well, you know I wouldn't leave this one out.

55
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,977
Based on all the discussions we have had so far,

56
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,199
you could list the attributes you would like.

57
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,905
In fact,

58
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:48,434
you could use the other modules to determine your checklist

59
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,199
of characteristics of communication and leadership you need

60
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,199
for the new person in the group, so that will make it easier for you.

61
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,590
Next is team input.

62
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,112
I think it is best for you as the leader to make the

63
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,661
first pass and gather the business, technical,

64
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,276
communication, and leadership requirements and then get your team together,

65
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:13,324
present the requirements, and get their inputs,

66
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,199
feedback, and validation.

67
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,949
To be sure that you have all the requirements collected and documented,

68
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,199
I recommend this approach.

69
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,056
Next, document.

70
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:26,199
Write up the requirements that you will use throughout the interviewing process.

71
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,649
Also, HR may need these as well.

72
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,149
Now post or advertise your new job opening using any

73
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,199
number of websites like LinkedIn or Indeed.

74
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,199
com or what your HR department may recommend.

75
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,137
Okay, now that we have our requirements,

76
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:48,199
we move to the next step, the phone interview.

77
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,023
Step 2.

78
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:50,258
The phone interview.

79
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:55,199
The job posting is starting to yield results and you're getting responses.

80
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,143
You may get a ton.

81
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:02,199
Read each one and use your judgment which ones you want to call.

82
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,567
Again,

83
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,988
the goal of the phone interview is this: Do they meet your

84
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:09,549
threshold of requirements for an in-person interview?

85
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:10,599
In other words,

86
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,199
what are the minimum things you need to know in either end the call and say,

87
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,949
thanks, or to move them to the next step,

88
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,199
the in-person interview.

89
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Have a list of deal-breaker questions.

90
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,866
Don't waste your time or the time of the respondent with

91
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,977
random questions or playing chitchat.

92
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,199
Get right down to it.

93
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,199
So now for the interview and taking notes.

94
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,199
So start calling, begin with pleasantries and be upbeat in your demeanor.

95
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,846
Begin with, may I ask you a few questions,

96
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:44,199
and then move on with your deal-breaker questions.

97
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,824
If enough are answered to your liking,

98
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:50,199
they will become a candidate for an in-person interview.

99
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,866
If not, well, they're out.

100
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:55,199
Now you'll want to review the results with your team.

101
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,899
Always be inclusive with your team, share your findings,

102
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,199
and that you now have a list of say, five candidates for in-person interviews.

103
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,199
You want to review your results with your team.

104
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
Always be inclusive be with your team and share your findings.

105
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
Now you're down to say, five candidates for in-person interviews.

106
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,532
Lastly, keep all documentation and notes.

107
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,199
You never know.

108
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,199
In today's corporate and litigious world,

109
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,199
you may need your notes so please keep them.

110
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,799
Now that we have our phone interviews complete or most of them,

111
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:36,000
and we have our short list of in-person interview candidates, we move on to the next step, which is the in-person interview.
