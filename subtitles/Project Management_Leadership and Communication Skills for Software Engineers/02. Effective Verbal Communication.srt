00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:03,254
To lead off this course,

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:06,554
I'd like to start with this section that contains basic and

3
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:10,254
helpful tips on verbal communication that you can begin using with

4
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,754
your team and your projects right away.

5
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:19,754
Okay, let's see what they are.

6
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,204
You may think that content is king,

7
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:25,704
but your audiences need more than content and by audience,

8
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:29,225
I mean anyone you are speaking with or to.

9
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:33,754
A single person, group, your team, and even a whole auditorium.

10
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:36,810
You may believe that the content of your speeches and presentations,

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,554
what you think of as your message, creates the influence you are aiming for,

12
00:00:41,554 --> 00:00:44,754
but I have a different point of view.

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:50,754
But I believe you are the one who's creating the influence, not the content.

14
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,421
And the reason is simple.

15
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:53,754
You are the message.

16
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,845
Okay, here is what I want you not to do.

17
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:03,379
For example, read the whole memo, word by word, and then say, any questions?

18
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,941
That just does not work.

19
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,754
Here is what I would like you to do.

20
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:11,691
Be clear and concise, summarize and crystallize the message,

21
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:14,754
and present it with passion and confidence.

22
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,310
So here's a tip.

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,032
Your audiences usually cannot separate the message

24
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:22,390
or content from the messenger, hence the messenger,

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,481
that is you, must be on point, professional,

26
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,754
and prepared.

27
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:34,754
Now let's make the complex simple.

28
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:38,754
Always make the complex simple.

29
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:42,872
Your employees and customers are being bombarded 24/7 by information,

30
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:46,421
making it hard for them to hear, listen,

31
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,754
and retain information from you.

32
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:53,021
In the busy and hectic world today,

33
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:56,754
simplicity has never been more powerful or necessary.

34
00:01:56,754 --> 00:02:01,040
Now effective leaders distill complex thoughts and strategies into simple,

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,754
memorable terms that colleagues and customers can grasp and act upon.

36
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,930
If you're having trouble distilling something to its essence,

37
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,754
it may be that you don't understand it.

38
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:16,754
So dig deeper, understand it, simplify.

39
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:20,754
Also, look out for technical jargon and business speak.

40
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:24,543
These add complexity to your message and make it harder for others

41
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,379
to really understand what you're trying to say.

42
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,754
Okay, here is what not to do.

43
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,912
"We will soon have the user-defined functions and other stored

44
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,438
procedures ready by the end of the week.

45
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:40,897
" Even though that's true and even thought that's the real details,

46
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:44,354
that's not what I really want you to say to your customers.

47
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:46,754
Here is what I'd like you to do.

48
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:53,118
"The customer will have the month-end report on Thursday, 12/10.

49
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:59,912
" So we went from 17 to 11 words, we used the customer's terminology,

50
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:02,754
and made the message very clear.

51
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,600
Okay, here's a tip.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,754
Say you mean in as few words as possible.

53
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:12,928
After you write a memo or a status report or a presentation,

54
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:23,000
take a look at it and actually think, can I make this a little shorter and a little more simple?
