00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.800
Step 5, selection.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.000
In this step, you will be leading a meeting with your team.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.249
You will be using your leadership and communication skills to

4
00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.524
draw out all of the necessary information,

5
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:16.160
comments, and feedback you can from your team.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.524
Remember, be inclusive.

7
00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:21.524
Okay, so the goal again of this step is to make your final selection,

8
00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:26.797
do your team review, so assemble your team and review the interview notes,

9
00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.524
foster open and honest dialogue.

10
00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.945
Discuss all the pros and cons because there will always be pros and

11
00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.899
cons and discuss and weight them appropriately,

12
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.524
and then maybe do a pretend hire.

13
00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:40.191
Discuss how this person would augment the team,

14
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:42.524
what assignments you might give them first.

15
00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:47.524
Sometimes this helps bring out additional questions to discuss with your team.

16
00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:48.577
Take an informal vote.

17
00:00:48.577 --> 00:00:52.524
If it comes out that it's a consensus, well, then that's the person to hire.

18
00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:56.069
Now if it wasn't your specific choice that the team may have chosen,

19
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.832
you might want to bring that up and say hey,

20
00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:02.524
here is who I picked and here is why and solicit feedback.

21
00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:05.381
Maybe during that feedback session they will convince

22
00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.524
you or you might convince them.

23
00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:11.176
No I think as a leader you might have the final say,

24
00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:14.524
but it would be best if the entire team could choose,

25
00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:16.678
so try to come to a consensus.

26
00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:18.524
Try to come to a win-win.

27
00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:25.524
Alright, now for the fun part, the paperwork.

28
00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:28.366
The final step in the process is the paperwork.

29
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:28.682
So,

30
00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:31.524
follow your company's process and every process might be

31
00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.381
a little different for every company, so figure out what it is,

32
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:34.857
follow it,

33
00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:39.524
follow it along too so you can make sure it gets done in a timely manner.

34
00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:42.524
And typically what happens is an offer letter will go out.

35
00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:44.746
In our company, I write the offer letters.

36
00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:47.524
Maybe in other companies, HR will write the offer letters.

37
00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.674
There's the acceptance, you know, by the new hire,

38
00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:53.824
to say, hey, it sounds great; I will start,

39
00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.447
or possibly it's the rejection.

40
00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.524
Now if there is a rejection, who is on deck?

41
00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:00.624
Again, you did the final selection process,

42
00:02:00.624 --> 00:02:03.624
you put everyone in a particular order and maybe you'll

43
00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:05.913
go to the second person on the list.

44
00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:08.968
So revisit the requirements because maybe some time has gone by

45
00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:10.953
and maybe requirements have changed slightly,

46
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:14.524
and go to the second person and start that process.

47
00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:16.103
Of course, then the final acceptance.

48
00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.941
Either it was the first person you picked or a subsequent person and now

49
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:23.691
you finally have the candidate to join your company,

50
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:24.524
so congratulations.

51
00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:31.524
Alright, now let's go over some tips.

52
00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:34.524
Here are some basic tips for your interviewing process.

53
00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:38.678
The interviewer should be an active listener and he

54
00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:40.524
should not interrupt unnecessarily.

55
00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:42.774
The interviewer should be considerate enough.

56
00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:46.524
Even if the interviewer does not agree with the interviewee,

57
00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:48.524
he must respect their feelings, of course.

58
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:52.524
The interviewer should be friendly and understanding.

59
00:02:52.524 --> 00:02:55.274
He should begin the interview in a friendly manner and try

60
00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:58.191
to make the interviewee just feel a little more relaxed and

61
00:02:58.191 --> 00:02:59.524
a little more comfortable.

62
00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:02.024
The interviewer should keep to the time allotted.

63
00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:05.591
He shouldn't indulge in arguments unnecessarily or debates and things like that.

64
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.524
Don't discuss certain technologies and what might be right or wrong.

65
00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:11.524
Just listen to the answers and move forward.

66
00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.337
And the interviewer must be thoroughly prepared for the

67
00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:16.524
questions that are likely to be asked.

68
00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:20.899
He should be a good planner as well, as we've talked about that; plan,

69
00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:21.524
plan, plan.

70
00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.524
The interviewer must focus attention on the interviewee.

71
00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:28.524
He should positive gestures when conducting the interview.

72
00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:31.524
Also encourage and invite questions from the interviewee.

73
00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:35.524
Ensure that the interviewee clarifies the question he has and when selected,

74
00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:39.797
a candidate should not feel he is not told about a certain aspect of the job,

75
00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:42.069
so you'll want to make sure that you tell him

76
00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.524
everything there is about the job as well.

77
00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:48.191
And avoid any distractions in the interview area.

78
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.191
Ensure that there is no or minimal distraction where

79
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.577
the interview is being conducted.

80
00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:53.103
You know,

81
00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:56.524
a phone ringing all the time in the background can distract both the

82
00:03:56.524 --> 00:04:00.124
interviewer and the interviewee so turn off your cell phone and have

83
00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.979
your office phone maybe be on do not disturb.

84
00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.524
So try to be in a quiet, nice, comfortable area.

85
00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:10.953
And one more tip of course is if you're not good at

86
00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:13.524
this or you haven't done it before, practice it.

87
00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:17.437
Get with a coworker or colleague and give it a try and go through some

88
00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:20.595
of your questions and maybe have it be kind of fun,

89
00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:20.953
actually.

90
00:04:20.953 --> 00:04:24.524
Alright, you may have heard of the phrase, got mail?

91
00:04:24.524 --> 00:04:32.524
Well, I have one called, got AMA?

92
00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:36.524
Now let's talk for a moment about new-hire requirements.

93
00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:40.524
Most people focus on the resume or what I call the alphabet soup.

94
00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:46.524
You know, HTML, SQL, C#, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.

95
00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:48.857
These are certainly important, but for me,

96
00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:53.524
I only give that about 33% or a third weight on whether I will

97
00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:58.857
hire and let's see what else is important to me and what I think

98
00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:01.524
should be important for you as well.

99
00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:03.774
So, first of course is aptitude.

100
00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:07.524
That relates back to, you know, the alphabet soup items.

101
00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:10.524
This is where someone would have a natural ability to do something.

102
00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:12.774
Some people are just plain smart.

103
00:05:12.774 --> 00:05:13.524
Einstein smart.

104
00:05:13.524 --> 00:05:18.399
I love that, but if they are only smart and they know only,

105
00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.274
say, SQL inside and out,

106
00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:25.524
they may not make a good team member without motivation and attitude.

107
00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:29.024
So I really like a great attitude.

108
00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:30.524
It's that simple.

109
00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:34.524
Do they have a good, positive attitude?

110
00:05:34.524 --> 00:05:37.191
Granted, these are a bit harder to determine.

111
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:40.524
That is why you need to get them to talk.

112
00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:43.524
While they are talking and telling about themselves

113
00:05:43.524 --> 00:05:48.524
and sharing their experiences, you are looking for examples of their attitude.

114
00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:51.524
Things like their viewpoints, their outlook,

115
00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:54.774
their perspectives, maybe a standpoint, position,

116
00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:58.524
an inclination, a temper, orientation, approach.

117
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:05.524
Just words like that that kind of encapsulate or capture what attitude means.

118
00:06:05.524 --> 00:06:07.103
The last one is motivation.

119
00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:10.892
Do you think they have the general desire or willingness to do

120
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:15.524
pretty much anything you need done on their own?

121
00:06:15.524 --> 00:06:21.149
So other words that are kind of like motivation,

122
00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:24.899
synonyms would be enthusiasm, drive, ambition,

123
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:26.433
initiative, and determination.

124
00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:30.524
I love all those words in a new hire.

125
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.953
That's why I say, got AMA?

126
00:06:33.953 --> 00:06:38.524
So, do you have attitude, motivation, and aptitude?

127
00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:44.877
Alright, so our typical focus of job interviews is typically around aptitude,

128
00:06:44.877 --> 00:06:48.583
the resume and the alphabet soup of technology.

129
00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:52.465
So when you're putting together your requirements for a new hire,

130
00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:55.433
don't forget about attitude and motivation.

131
00:06:55.433 --> 00:07:05.000
Tehse in my opinion are really more important. Okay, now let's summarize this module.
