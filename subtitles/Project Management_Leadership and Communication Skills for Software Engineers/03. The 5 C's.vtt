00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.270
Here are Michael's 5 C's.

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.270
Your checklist to effective communications.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.984
Here is a simple checklist of items I would like you to use

4
00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:13.270
every day because you'll be writing every day,

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.501
to better ensure your communications are effective

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.270
and to get your messages across.

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.326
This applies to the written and verbal communications by the way,

8
00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:25.906
but primarily written since you have time to think

9
00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:29.179
and plan those communications.

10
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.270
Okay, let's check them out.

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.638
For all forms of communication you may do,

12
00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:40.849
I would like you to think and plan your communications,

13
00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:41.270
okay?

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.452
Think and plan ahead of time.

15
00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:47.088
So before you click the send, save, or print button,

16
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:52.333
I want you to make sure that what you are writing is clear,

17
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:56.270
that it's transparent and able to be easily comprehended.

18
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.211
Also, concise.

19
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:02.858
Use as few words as possible to give the necessary information or

20
00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:05.954
compressed information in order to be brief.

21
00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:07.638
And of course, courteous.

22
00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:14.145
Always be polite in a way that shows consideration of others and good manners.

23
00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.270
Consistency is very important, too.

24
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.326
This is to be able to maintain the particular standard or repeat a

25
00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:25.270
particular activity or artifact with minimal variation.

26
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.270
We're going to talk about more of standardized agenda, standardized emails, etc.

27
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.270
It's very important for consistent communication.

28
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.603
And lastly, compelling.

29
00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:42.381
We want your readers or listeners to your message be attracted to your

30
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.088
message and encourage strong interest and attention.

31
00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.270
They want to read your email.

32
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.270
They may want to read your document because it's compelling.

33
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.270
Clear, concise, courteous, consistent, and compelling; Michael's 5 C's.

34
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.270
Every communiquÃ© you produce follows the five C's and you will be successful.

35
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.492
You want your stakeholders and customers to think,

36
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.270
hey, I just received an email from my project manager,

37
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.000
my team leader; I can't wait to open it. Okay, now let's see some examples about what I mean.
