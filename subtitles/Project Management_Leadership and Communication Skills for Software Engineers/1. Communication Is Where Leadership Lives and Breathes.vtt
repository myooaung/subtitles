Hello.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
I will be presenting the module,

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.000
The Interconnection of Leadership and Communication in the course,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, now let's first start with this very insightful quote.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Communication is where leadership lives and breathes.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.529
Those simple words encapsulate not only the essence of this module,

9
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.000
but in fact, this entire course.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That is why I want to make a point that leadership and

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
communication are interconnected, intertwined,

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.438
interwoven,

13
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:45.688
and that your potential as a leader will be dependent upon your

14
00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:48.909
ability to effectively communicate with others.

15
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.000
Now let's review the objectives of this module.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here are the module objectives.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.941
This module will cover the fundamentals of why leadership and

18
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:03.333
communication skills are so critical to your professional growth,

19
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:08.000
to your employer, and to your customer.

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.353
Also,

21
00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:12.235
we're going to dig deeper into the linkage between leadership and

22
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:16.222
communication and that you cannot have one without the other.

23
00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:20.667
This module will emphasize the importance of improving both of

24
00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.412
these skills to improve your career opportunities,

25
00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:28.579
to improve your personal growth, and your ability to mentor and grow your team.

26
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.053
So, how can you organize, inspire,

27
00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:37.842
or guide others if you don't communicate in a clear,

28
00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:41.000
credible and authentic way?

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, you just can't. Now let's look at some data that supports this point.
