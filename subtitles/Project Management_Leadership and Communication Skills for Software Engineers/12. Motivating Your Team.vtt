00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.973
Motivating your team can be very challenging and tough.

2
00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:06.673
Everyone is different and everyone has their own incentives,

3
00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:10.723
so get to know everyone and see what you can do to motivate

4
00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:12.973
each person by their motivation factors.

5
00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:16.149
For example, early in my career, money was king.

6
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.914
Now, well, it's time off.

7
00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:18.973
We're all different.

8
00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:20.878
Now check out this chart.

9
00:00:20.878 --> 00:00:25.830
Appreciation is a very big motivator and it can range from a raise,

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.773
time off, an atta-boy or atta-girl, a $100 gift card,

11
00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:30.973
you name it.

12
00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:36.473
It's not so much the token of appreciation as the sincerity,

13
00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:41.447
so just an eye-to-eye, heartfelt thank-you is really great to do.

14
00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:46.973
Okay, so here are some factors you may want to consider in motivating your team.

15
00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:48.385
First, the minimum factors.

16
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.914
These are necessary things to provide to your team to

17
00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:53.973
ensure employees don't become dissatisfied,

18
00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:58.973
but they typically don't contribute to greater levels of motivation.

19
00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:03.973
For example, a reasonable work space and good computer is just plain expected.

20
00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:05.084
On the other hand,

21
00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:07.862
there are some motivation factors and we want to create

22
00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:10.791
motivation and greater job satisfaction by fulfilling a

23
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.973
person's need for meaning and personal growth.

24
00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.830
An example would be maybe a new technology that would really help

25
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.973
the business; I might want to work on that.

26
00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:20.529
and maybe a bonus.

27
00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:21.695
Having excellent management.

28
00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:25.973
Well for me, that is in fact a key motivating factor.

29
00:01:25.973 --> 00:01:27.657
Is it for you?

30
00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:29.341
Also, learning new things.

31
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:33.131
If you follow my approach to building team skills,

32
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:35.084
this will certainly support this topic.

33
00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:39.973
Even if you can't always apply those skills, your team will know you are trying.

34
00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:41.973
That's important.

35
00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:46.973
Exercising creativity and solving the right kind of problems.

36
00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.306
Okay, people get motivated by doing that.

37
00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.306
People are motivated by creativity and solving the right

38
00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.306
kind of problems that support the business.

39
00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:59.973
So through thoughtful delegation of broader and less detailed tasks,

40
00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:05.973
you will enable creativity to take root and to grow for each person.

41
00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:08.195
Now people also want to have a voice.

42
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.695
By including your team in the activities of project

43
00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:13.195
prioritization that we talked about earlier,

44
00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:18.973
and aligning those daily tasks and building team skills together as a team,

45
00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:22.973
you will provide the forum for your team to have a voice

46
00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:24.973
and opinion in the team's activities.

47
00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:26.723
Being recognized for hard work.

48
00:02:26.723 --> 00:02:30.573
Whether or not the work results in a success or not,

49
00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:33.373
my philosophy is to still recognize hard work.

50
00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:35.823
It may be a nice hand-written card,

51
00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:39.973
it may be a dinner out; it's just that simple.

52
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.973
Sincere, heartfelt thank you!

53
00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:45.640
Building something that matters.

54
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.973
It matters because it ties to the business.

55
00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:52.973
No one wants busy work or work products that just get thrown away.

56
00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:57.147
That is why it is important as a leader to ensure all work is tied to

57
00:02:57.147 --> 00:03:01.373
the business and is prioritized by you and the team.

58
00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:06.973
Now let's explore the need for governance.

59
00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:10.973
So how will you and your new team conduct business?

60
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:11.200
Well,

61
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.837
I recommend that you do this as a team and you act as the facilitator and

62
00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:17.385
discuss and decide how you want to conduct business.

63
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:21.267
Sometimes the term governance refers to how you want to conduct

64
00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.742
business and refers to all the processes of governing,

65
00:03:25.742 --> 00:03:28.973
managing, and conducting your team's activities.

66
00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.973
Okay, so what are the things that you think you might need?

67
00:03:30.973 --> 00:03:32.552
Well, here's a short list.

68
00:03:32.552 --> 00:03:32.868
First,

69
00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:37.473
what standards will you use and follow to help the team produce quality results?

70
00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:41.973
Maybe there are programming standards, how we use C#.

71
00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:45.973
Maybe there is policy regarding security and things like that.

72
00:03:45.973 --> 00:03:49.973
Next, there could be some company and organizational standards and policies.

73
00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:53.973
For example, beyond your control that you must follow.

74
00:03:53.973 --> 00:03:57.911
Maybe it has to do with user ID management,

75
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:00.973
application security, infrastructure, and things like that.

76
00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:01.679
Next, tools.

77
00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.444
What are your standard tools?

78
00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:05.914
Maybe you're going to use Visual Studio,

79
00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:08.573
SQL Server, Bootstrap, C#, Team Foundation Server,

80
00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:08.973
etc.

81
00:04:08.973 --> 00:04:14.973
In other words, these are the tools you will use to get the job done.

82
00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:18.973
My philosophy and a very important point here on tools: use the

83
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:21.973
fewest number of tools to get the job done.

84
00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:24.326
I don't like a million tools and everyone is doing

85
00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:25.973
their own thing; it doesn't work right.

86
00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:27.116
Next, architecture.

87
00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:29.973
You'll want a standard architecture.

88
00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:32.341
This is more about how you apply the tools.

89
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:34.973
For example, here is how you're going to do APIs.

90
00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:38.973
Here is how you're going to maybe use stored procedures and things like that.

91
00:04:38.973 --> 00:04:39.882
Next, processes.

92
00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:43.973
What are the standard processes you're going to use?

93
00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:45.609
How will you develop your software?

94
00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:46.973
How will you make builds?

95
00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:48.723
How will you make releases?

96
00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:59.000
How will you put together your test cases and test plans and things like that? Okay, now let's summarize this module.
