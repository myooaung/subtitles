00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.282
You have always heard of structured programming and what I am

2
00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.000
proposing to you is structured emailing.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.925
All of your emails should follow a set high-level structure.

4
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.396
As well as keeping your emails short,

5
00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:19.325
following a standard structure also helps you write quality emails fast,

6
00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:20.125
but first,

7
00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:24.125
let's look at the metadata of an email before we

8
00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.925
jump into the body of the email.

9
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:32.749
In an email, the To portion is for the intended audience,

10
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:35.925
the people who must read it.

11
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:37.504
Do not put every Tom,

12
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.925
Dick and Harry here; only the people that must absolutely need to read it.

13
00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:46.925
Think carefully and thoughtfully on who needs to receive this email.

14
00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:51.125
It will typically be those who must know what's in your email and must

15
00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:55.925
take action based on the information in your email.

16
00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.380
Next is the cc, or a.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.789
k.

18
00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:59.198
a.

19
00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:00.016
carbon copy.

20
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:03.289
It is for the optional audience and remember,

21
00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.984
don't expect this list to actually read your email.

22
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:11.925
You are sending it more like an FYI or out of courtesy.

23
00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:16.425
Also there is the bcc, a blind carbon copy.

24
00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:19.925
It is for a very limited audience.

25
00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:21.925
I don't recommend using bcc.

26
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:25.925
Basically here is what it means to send a bcc.

27
00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:31.925
You want no one in the To or the cc to know that this person or

28
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.925
persons in the bcc also received the email.

29
00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:37.496
If that is the case, what are you hiding?

30
00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:41.219
I believe in open and honest communication so I don't use this one,

31
00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.925
but I wanted to share it with you anyway and to tell you where I stand.

32
00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:47.463
Next is the subject.

33
00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:50.925
Most people haven't a clue what to put here.

34
00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:55.662
Of three of my five C's, I strongly recommend compelling,

35
00:01:55.662 --> 00:02:00.300
which will entice them to read your email and clear,

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.925
so it is easy to understand just what the email is all about and concise.

37
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:10.160
Keep it as short as possible; not too long and not too

38
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.925
short; no fuzzy subjects please.

39
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.525
And lastly, the body.

40
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:19.125
After you write your email, quickly glance over to your post-it note and say,

41
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.354
is it clear?

42
00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:21.639
Is it concise?

43
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.925
Is it courteous?

44
00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:24.211
Is it consistent?

45
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:25.925
And is it compelling?

46
00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:29.925
And you will improve the impact of your emails immediately.

47
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:30.481
Okay,

48
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:39.925
now let's take a deeper look at the body of an email and the structure for that.

49
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.925
Over time you'll develop a structure that works for you.

50
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:46.925
Here is a simple structure for the body of your emails to get you started.

51
00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:50.258
I recommend always following this template for your general email,

52
00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:54.925
but of course, feel free to be creative so your template fits your needs.

53
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:57.592
Okay, the first is the greeting.

54
00:02:57.592 --> 00:03:02.925
It is an acknowledgement of another's arrival or departure such as hello,

55
00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:04.869
how are you, good morning.

56
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:09.925
You need to always start with something like that, very short and concise.

57
00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.113
Next, a compliment or pleasantry.

58
00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:16.925
Typically I make it just one sentence and one short sentence.

59
00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:19.880
Maybe you know they just got back from vacation so you might say,

60
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.496
I hope you had a nice vacation when you were out,

61
00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.925
or it might be, hey I hope you had a nice weekend.

62
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.233
Something very short, very personal.

63
00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.925
It's very nice to see and read that.

64
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:34.425
Next, the reason for the email.

65
00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:36.925
Why are you writing this email?

66
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:40.354
It might be something like hey, as requested,

67
00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:42.925
please see the attached status report.

68
00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.848
Also, a call to action.

69
00:03:44.848 --> 00:03:47.925
Do you want or need something from them?

70
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:51.525
Like, please read and provide me with some feedback.

71
00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:53.925
Some sort of action for them.

72
00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:55.561
Then some sort of closing message.

73
00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:59.652
It could be as simple as thank you, I'll see you at the next meeting,

74
00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.125
or something like that.

75
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.925
And lastly of course, a signature block.

76
00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:07.714
Not just Michael, but it's Michael, it's my title,

77
00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:11.083
it's my URL, my email address, phone number,

78
00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:14.617
or whatever else that's important to be in there.

79
00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:16.925
You want to be easily reachable.

80
00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:21.043
Someone might forward your email and if it just says Michael at the bottom,

81
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:21.925
who is Michael?

82
00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:24.592
How do I get a hold of them?

83
00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:29.925
I see so many times where there is either no signature or just a first name.

84
00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:32.325
That doesn't work for business emails.

85
00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:33.925
Do a good signature.

86
00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:37.925
Okay, now after you write your email, quickly glance over it.

87
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:41.139
Remember, you have your post-it to the side; clear,

88
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.925
concise, courteous, consistent, and compelling.

89
00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:45.425
Yes, it looks really good!

90
00:04:45.425 --> 00:04:45.925
Alrighty!

91
00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:46.925
Click send.

92
00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.925
Now to make your life more simple, come up with templates that you can use.

93
00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:54.925
So maybe you lay out an email for a customer A and

94
00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:56.925
maybe another email for customer B.

95
00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:57.687
It follows this template,

96
00:04:57.687 --> 00:05:00.163
but maybe you have a few more words and things in there that

97
00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:01.814
make sense for that particular customer.

98
00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:03.592
Okay, remember with emails,

99
00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:10.425
you are in the room with them reading it or helping them read it,

100
00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.675
so communicate well.

101
00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:17.925
Okay, now let's see an actual example.

102
00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.241
Okay, here is an example.

103
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:22.925
The first, of course, in the upper area is the To and the cc.

104
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:28.925
So the To is going to Terry and the cc is going to my boss and my team lead.

105
00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:32.925
Next will be the subject, clear and concise, POLAR status report and the date.

106
00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.639
Next comes the body.

107
00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.925
Now in the body I have the greeting, Hello, Terry.

108
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:40.800
I have a compliment or pleasantry.

109
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.925
Hey, I hope you had a nice vacation last week.

110
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:45.425
Then comes the reason.

111
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:49.925
As you requested, please see my attached status report on project POLAR.

112
00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:51.703
Now you may have several reasons, of course,

113
00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:53.925
but this is just a simple example following the template.

114
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:59.925
The action I have for Terri is please read and provide me with any feedback.

115
00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:00.834
Next comes the thank-you.

116
00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:04.698
Hey, thank you and I will see you at our next meeting on Friday at 10 a.

117
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:04.925
m.

118
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:07.925
So it's a thank-you and a reminder of what's coming up.

119
00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:15.925
And lastly is a complete sig block, the whole package completely.

120
00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.258
This is a great quote: "If I had more time,

121
00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:21.592
I would have written a shorter letter.

122
00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:22.237
" Well,

123
00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:25.050
we've come full circle when we discussed the quote

124
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.925
at the beginning of this section.

125
00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:31.925
Write your email, delete most of it, and then click send.

126
00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:35.639
Writing emails that are short and to the point will reduce the time

127
00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.188
you spend on email and make you more productive.

128
00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:39.504
By keeping your email short,

129
00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:43.325
you'll likely spend less time on the email and more time on other work.

130
00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.925
Of course, that said, writing clearly is a skill.

131
00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:49.925
Like all skills, you're going to have to work at it.

132
00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:50.675
To begin with,

133
00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:54.425
it may take you just as long to write a short email as it took

134
00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:56.396
you to write those long emails; however,

135
00:06:56.396 --> 00:07:01.101
even if this is the case, you'll help your coworkers,

136
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:01.572
clients,

137
00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:05.504
or employees be more productive because you'll be adding less

138
00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:09.609
clutter to their inboxes and making it easier for them to read and

139
00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:14.300
understand your emails and therefore they'll be able to better and

140
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:22.000
more quickly respond to your emails. Okay, now let's move on to the interview.
