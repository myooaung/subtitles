1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,604
Email is the communication tool of choice for most of us today,

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,136
but here are a few problems I see in the business world.

3
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:12,414
Email is easy to use and has easy access from PCs,

4
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:14,691
tablets, and phones, just from everywhere.

5
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,691
Emails are great because you don't have to be available at the

6
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,858
time as your conversation partner is to communicate and it

7
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,858
allows us to keep projects moving when our coworkers are

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:29,858
unavailable or out of the office, but that's one of the downsides,

9
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:30,358
too.

10
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:35,358
It's just so easy to use, in the appropriate way.

11
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:36,512
Also, there is another problem.

12
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,358
Most of us are just drowning in emails.

13
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:41,832
The average person using email for business receives and sends probably

14
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:46,097
over 100 per day and I don't doubt it; my inbox is loaded.

15
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:50,967
I get almost 200 per day and the more projects I have going on,

16
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:56,558
the more full it gets and on top of all that,

17
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,358
emails are all too easily misunderstood or misinterpreted.

18
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:05,558
A recent study by Send Mail found that 64% of people have

19
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:09,108
sent or received an email that caused unintended anger or

20
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,733
confusion and we have all done it.

21
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,358
I'll bet you it's closer to 100.

22
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:17,832
Because of the volume of emails we send and receive and

23
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,411
because emails are often misinterpreted,

24
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,674
it is so important to write emails clearly and concisely; that is,

25
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,621
following my 5 C's, of course, and also,

26
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:33,829
my simple approach in this section that I will send with you.

27
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,358
Now let's see some concrete, succinct examples.

28
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:41,358
Okay, let's get down to business.

29
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:42,417
Write BUSINESS emails.

30
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:47,358
At work we are not writing an email to your buddy or your family.

31
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,204
In your new role,

32
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:53,358
a leader needs to write business-oriented and professional emails.

33
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:57,025
That is now part of your job description and of course,

34
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,358
follow the 5 C's to the letter.

35
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:01,884
As we mentioned, people are drowning in emails.

36
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:05,358
Hence, we need to have ours stand out from the crowd.

37
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:09,558
You want them to be easily understood and noticeable so that your

38
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:13,358
customer or manager will click on them in their inbox.

39
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:17,358
And of course, you want them easily understood.

40
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:18,558
How you ask?

41
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,358
Well, follow my approach in this section.

42
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,558
By writing clearly,

43
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:27,358
you'll become known as someone who knows what he or she wants

44
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:32,435
and who gets things done and both of these are good for you

45
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,358
and your team's career prospects.

46
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:44,000
So, what does it take to write clear, concise, and professional emails? Let's dive into a very detailed example and see just how.
