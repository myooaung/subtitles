00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.556
Now if you build a wall around yourself,

2
00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:07.070
your team may not gain from your experience and this can

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.390
undermine problem solving and decision making.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.390
Being connected can be a major factor for your success.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.057
The more connected you are,

6
00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:18.723
the better you can understand what motivates members of your team

7
00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.919
and analyze what's really going on and find solutions that meet the

8
00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.390
needs of your people and your company.

9
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.765
With the walking around technique you can increase the

10
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:31.390
following attributes and capabilities of your team.

11
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.740
The first, approachability.

12
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.590
When your staff sees you as a person and not just a boss,

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.590
they'll be more likely to tell you things about what's going on and you'll get

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.973
the chance to learn about issues before they become problems.

15
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:45.557
Trust.

16
00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:49.057
We've talked about that several times.

17
00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.390
Trust is so important.

18
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.390
As your team gets to know you better, they'll trust you more.

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.140
You'll be naturally inclined to share more information and that

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.390
will break down barriers to communication.

21
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.978
Business knowledge.

22
00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:07.096
Getting out and learning what's happening on a daily basis can give you a

23
00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:13.390
better understanding of the functions and processes around you.

24
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.743
Accountability.

25
00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.214
When you interact daily with your team,

26
00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:20.653
agreements you make with each other are much more likely to be completed.

27
00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:23.495
Everyone is more motivated to follow through because you

28
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.515
are seeing each other on a regular basis.

29
00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:27.077
Morale.

30
00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:32.702
People often feel better about their jobs and their organization

31
00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:39.057
when they have opportunities to be heard and the walking around

32
00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.390
makes these opportunities available.

33
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.738
Now they may be heard at a certain level,

34
00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:47.779
maybe in a presentation form or in a meeting form or in a stand-up form,

35
00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:51.668
but this approach gives a little more of a personal

36
00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:54.390
side and a private side to things.

37
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.723
Lastly, productivity.

38
00:01:55.723 --> 00:02:00.390
Many creative ideas come from casual exchanges.

39
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.723
Walking around promotes casual discussions so people may be more free to

40
00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.449
discuss things that come to their mind and exchange new ideas.

41
00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:12.390
Now this activity will not only support your team's connection with you,

42
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.452
but also your connections to your team.

43
00:02:15.452 --> 00:02:19.390
It's a two-way street and a very rewarding feeling.

44
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.390
All healthy humans need to connect with others.

45
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.390
Alright, let's talk a little bit about the process.

46
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.159
Now here is a suggested process.

47
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.390
Okay, walk-arounds create great opportunities for communication.

48
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.390
You and the team will benefit by you literally walking around.

49
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.723
Alright, again, your casual and impromptu visits,

50
00:02:42.723 --> 00:02:47.621
you know maybe just 3 minutes on the way to lunch or to a break,

51
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:50.390
you know just seek if you can catch someone in their office.

52
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.572
Now if you can, visit or talk with each team member maybe every day if you can,

53
00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:58.961
with each customer maybe once a week.

54
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:02.390
A little impromptu with a customer works great as well; get their

55
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.127
feedback on what's going on in a casual setting.

56
00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:09.548
Maybe a key stakeholder, maybe twice a month and with your manager,

57
00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:11.935
of course, if you can, each day.

58
00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:16.572
Now that's a lot of walking around so you'll want to manage it the best you can,

59
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:21.390
but also, if someone is remote, the drop-in can be a casual phone call.

60
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.313
Hey, how are you doing?

61
00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:24.082
What's up?

62
00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:26.390
Real quick, 2 or 3 minutes.

63
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.390
Alright, the walk-around again is to be spontaneous,

64
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.819
adhoc and flexible in creating a new communication platform for you to use,

65
00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.819
but it isn't to say you couldn't just drop into someone's office and say,

66
00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:38.104
hey,

67
00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:41.022
let's grab a quick lunch in the cafeteria and let's talk

68
00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.845
more about your ideas on e-commerce, or something like that.

69
00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:45.663
Alright, here's a tip.

70
00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:48.390
Be careful not to be disruptive.

71
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.026
Now you want to temper that.

72
00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:53.845
How many times do you do it, you know if they're deep in thought,

73
00:03:53.845 --> 00:03:56.299
maybe keep passing and go to the next cube,

74
00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.390
and things like that.

75
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.390
So you know, you don't just go down the aisle one after another either.

76
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.155
It should be random, impromptu,

77
00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:06.331
almost like just a natural behavior you're going to

78
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:09.319
incorporate into your daily leadership processes.

79
00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.390
Alright, now let's see a literal example of what I mean.

80
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.057
Here is a simple example.

81
00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.390
Here is a scenario.

82
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.533
One of your team members is under the weather,

83
00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:24.390
maybe not feeling that great, so I might make a mental note,

84
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.340
hey I want to make a point to do a walk-around and try

85
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.390
to include her on my next visit.

86
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.640
Here is my action then, on the way back from the kitchen to get coffee,

87
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.390
I pop into her cubicle.

88
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.590
Hey, how are you?

89
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.390
Are you feeling better, I say?

90
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.390
Oh hi, yes, a little better, thanks, Harper says.

91
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.390
What's on your plate today?

92
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.390
Well, I'm a little behind since I left work early yesterday and ummm.

93
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.117
No worries.

94
00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:53.390
If you need any help, please come see me.

95
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.557
Thanks, I will.

96
00:04:54.557 --> 00:05:00.390
Now this took about 2 minutes, maybe not even that and what are the benefits?

97
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.390
Did you see them?

98
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.390
Let's recap the benefits.

99
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.390
Alright, since I stopped, I showed interest.

100
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.390
I showed I cared about her wellbeing.

101
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.390
I showed that I was interested in her work for the day.

102
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.390
And lastly, I showed that I'm here to help.

103
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.601
All these things are great benefits.

104
00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:28.022
Look at all the great benefits from that simple walk-in and how

105
00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:37.000
that person would now feel after that short visit. Now let's take a look at some rules of thumb for the walk-arounds.
