00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.707
Let's set the stage for the activities that are conducted

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.672
prior to the real guts of the meeting.

3
00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:10.339
Begin on time, no matter what.

4
00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.672
Set the precedence.

5
00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:17.116
If you start late, they will learn that that is okay and come late,

6
00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.672
so never start late.

7
00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:19.529
Welcome everyone.

8
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.672
People want and need to feel good and included in the process.

9
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:27.122
Like with presentations, as the meeting leader,

10
00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:31.672
all eyes are on you; you are the focus or even center of

11
00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.005
attention when you are leading the meeting.

12
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.731
No matter how interesting you think your agenda is, they will be watching you.

13
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:42.613
Maintain good eye contact just when you are making presentations and

14
00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:45.228
this creates a connection with your attendees.

15
00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:46.783
Hand out the agenda,

16
00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:51.243
quickly walk through it so the attendees get the big picture,

17
00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:54.672
and they know what to expect.

18
00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:55.143
You know,

19
00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:58.672
maybe you missed something that might come up so you'll want to add that in.

20
00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:01.554
Ensure they understand why they are there.

21
00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.848
The expected outcome of the meeting, the purpose,

22
00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:07.894
is very important and here's a tip.

23
00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:11.450
Maintain good eye contact, look for visual cues,

24
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.854
you know, body language, from attendees on their understanding,

25
00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:19.672
interest, and if they have any questions.

26
00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:23.672
Okay, now let's get down to work.

27
00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:27.672
Okay, the meeting has started and let's get down to work.

28
00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:28.815
Actually, it's quite easy.

29
00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:31.672
Just step your way through the agenda, item by item.

30
00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:36.613
Take notes as we discussed in Know Your ABC's and take very good notes,

31
00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:37.672
by the way.

32
00:01:37.672 --> 00:01:39.422
Be sure you can read them afterwards.

33
00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.172
Now if you're going to be pretty busy during the meeting,

34
00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:45.672
maybe you'll want to have an associate take the notes for you.

35
00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.984
Promote active discussions.

36
00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:52.672
Many times people, well, just sit there hoping not to get an assignment.

37
00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:54.005
Now that isn't good.

38
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.339
You need their input.

39
00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:59.496
You need their ideas and there buy-in, so promote active discussions like,

40
00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:01.554
what do you think, Lauren?

41
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.672
Didn't you do something like that on the last project?

42
00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.472
What might be our next steps?

43
00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:08.672
And things like that.

44
00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:10.386
So be inclusive of all attendees.

45
00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:13.815
Make sure they all have a chance to ask questions or feel

46
00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:15.907
okay with the decisions and commitments.

47
00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:20.848
Engage your audience as we've talked, all the way around the room,

48
00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:25.308
good eye contact, good exchange of information,

49
00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:28.217
and end on time.

50
00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:29.672
Plan accordingly.

51
00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:30.988
Lastly will be the recap.

52
00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:33.619
You'll want to walk through verbally all the next steps,

53
00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.945
all the actions and commitments,

54
00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.672
and what you're going to do with the meeting notes.

55
00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:42.672
I will send them out later today and when the next meeting might be, etc.

56
00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:44.672
And here's a tip.

57
00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:46.672
Thank everyone for attending.

58
00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:48.472
They feel real good about that.

59
00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.872
Like, hey, thank you very much for coming,

60
00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:54.422
this was so helpful; I have learned so much on this new project.

61
00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:56.672
This is really going to help promote the project.

62
00:02:56.672 --> 00:02:59.672
This will really get the project going forward even faster.

63
00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:08.000
They will feel good, they will feel like they contributed, and they'll feel like they'll come to the next one which is good.
