00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.837
Ownership is a very important attribute of the person

2
00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:07.822
you have just made an assignment to.

3
00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:11.506
When assigning tasks in a meeting, or for that matter,

4
00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:14.085
whenever I assign tasks in any situation,

5
00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.955
I assign only to one person.

6
00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:22.289
Here is a quote by the world-famous business genius, Mr.

7
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:22.822
Deming.

8
00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.197
"Divide responsibility and nobody and is responsible.

9
00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:31.640
" So if you give an assignment to two people or my gosh,

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.231
three, you have a greater chance of it not getting done.

11
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:40.958
No one knows who is in charge, so I only assign to one person,

12
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.053
but I will still have additional people on the team helping

13
00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.822
that person get the job done if need be.

14
00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:50.393
So they're not going to do it all alone.

15
00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:51.822
They're responsible for the delivery.

16
00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.536
They may in turn delegate some of their tasks and manage those tasks,

17
00:00:55.536 --> 00:01:00.222
but they own it and they must complete it on time and deliver it.

18
00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:03.822
Alright, sometimes getting to solid commitments can be challenging.

19
00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:10.822
Let's see how you can get to win-win.

20
00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:14.822
A meeting setting is sometimes the best chance to get to win-win.

21
00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:18.735
You're all in a room, you have time to talk and share points of view,

22
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:20.039
you are face to face,

23
00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.822
and you can observe positive and maybe even negative body language.

24
00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:27.822
So here is what I mean by win-win.

25
00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:30.004
That's when you seek mutual benefit with others,

26
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:34.655
so try and see if there is a way for a mutual benefit for all

27
00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:38.822
participants for decisions and commitments.

28
00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:40.922
All parties feel good about the decision.

29
00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:42.422
After a decision is made,

30
00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:45.122
go around the room and inquire with each person

31
00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.922
about that part of the commitment.

32
00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:51.437
Now it's always a feel-good, but you want to try and strive for that.

33
00:01:51.437 --> 00:01:58.822
Lastly, it's not your way or my way, it's a better way.

34
00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:03.057
Deciding and moving forward as a team or group is the best,

35
00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:04.822
so always strive for that.

36
00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:12.000
Now let's move on to stand-ups. A great informal leadership tool.
