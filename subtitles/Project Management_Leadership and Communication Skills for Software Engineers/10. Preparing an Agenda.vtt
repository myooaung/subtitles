00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.252
Now let's prepare an agenda.

2
00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:05.433
No agenda?

3
00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.614
No meeting!

4
00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:09.567
No kidding, and no exception,

5
00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:14.005
otherwise you are wasting everyone's time including your own,

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.671
so create an agenda and remember,

7
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:22.713
an agenda is a very powerful tool to guide the meeting and its expected outcome.

8
00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:25.338
It is the tool for your success.

9
00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:26.538
Know your expected outcome.

10
00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:31.038
This will really help you keep in mind and keep you focused on all the

11
00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:35.338
elements you must collect for a successful meeting.

12
00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:36.588
Let's develop the agenda.

13
00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:40.338
Use your preliminary agenda we talked about earlier as a starting point.

14
00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:45.338
Identify the items of discussion and lay out a sequence for the meeting.

15
00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:47.970
Plan time for a brief introduction to provide context and

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.338
for a discussion of next steps at the end.

17
00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:56.338
Decide how much time to devote to each item and what order makes sense.

18
00:00:56.338 --> 00:01:00.022
The longer your meeting, the harder it will be for people to remain focused,

19
00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:02.938
so it's wise to underestimate how much your group

20
00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:05.338
can cover in the allotted time.

21
00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:05.782
Therefore,

22
00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:12.005
list items to discuss to ensure your outcome is realized and for each item,

23
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.338
identify the person who will be the primary person to lead off that

24
00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:19.038
topic and how about how much time is allotted,

25
00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:19.338
too.

26
00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:23.022
Now that the agenda is complete and looking pretty good,

27
00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:26.338
let's send out the agenda prior to the meeting.

28
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:28.481
You might still label it preliminary, if you want,

29
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.386
since you still may want to modify it,

30
00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:33.793
but it is important to have attendees see the agenda and to see

31
00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:37.338
if they are on the hook for discussing a topic and to just

32
00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:40.338
basically prepare for the meeting.

33
00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:44.338
Contact key attendees prior to the meeting.

34
00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.974
Now this is interesting, I think.

35
00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:46.520
You know,

36
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.065
you want to be sure the key contacts are coming and be sure

37
00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:51.796
they are prepared to talk on the topic,

38
00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:54.505
so you might want to give them a call on the phone and

39
00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:56.463
maybe have a type of a pre-meeting.

40
00:01:56.463 --> 00:02:01.338
This can be a very important technique to ensure the outcome is achieved.

41
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:01.576
Again,

42
00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.909
you might invite 10 people but maybe two or three are the real key

43
00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.894
players; maybe a couple are the CFO and the CEO.

44
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.005
Make sure they're coming, make sure they're prepared,

45
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.338
and the meeting will be successful.

46
00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:15.560
Lastly, document the meeting.

47
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.338
You must document the meeting.

48
00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.150
Document actions and outcomes while the meeting is being

49
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.338
conducted and clean up your notes afterward.

50
00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:27.338
Maybe even bring a support person with you if you need to, to capture the notes.

51
00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:30.220
Stay on track and manage wasted chitchat.

52
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.706
That chitchat is just unneeded and unwarranted talk during a meeting.

53
00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:35.443
Control that.

54
00:02:35.443 --> 00:02:38.391
You also want to capture other meeting notes,

55
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.782
such as who attended and who did not attend.

56
00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:44.449
Also, any agreements that were made.

57
00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:51.611
Also, any actions and for each action, who owns that action and when it is due.

58
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:55.247
And also lastly, next meeting date and time,

59
00:02:55.247 --> 00:02:59.338
if there is going to be a next meeting.

60
00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:00.538
Now here's a tip.

61
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:02.338
Always focus on your expected outcome.

62
00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:05.838
In other words, what you want out of this meeting,

63
00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:07.938
because that really is your requirements,

64
00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:12.938
so based on your requirements you can better write the

65
00:03:12.938 --> 00:03:18.338
agenda and decide who is the best to come.

66
00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:19.860
Now here is a meeting agenda content.

67
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.121
This can just be a template in Word if you like and it's going to

68
00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.985
be real simple so you can pull it out quickly,

69
00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.338
fill in the blanks, and away you go.

70
00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:29.088
Meeting name?

71
00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:32.463
We talked about meeting names before and they need

72
00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:34.338
to be significant and meaningful.

73
00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:35.227
Location date and time.

74
00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:35.671
You know,

75
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:38.805
watch out for time zones and double check the availability of the location.

76
00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:40.671
Attendees, required or optional.

77
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:46.338
Include email addresses and phone numbers so people can easily reach out and

78
00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:49.338
share information with each other prior to the meeting.

79
00:03:49.338 --> 00:03:52.088
You're going to write down the purpose and the expected outcomes,

80
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:56.338
why you are there, what is the purpose, and what you want out of the meeting.

81
00:03:56.338 --> 00:04:00.052
Then you're going to list all the agenda items and for each item,

82
00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:03.538
again the preliminary person to speak to that particular

83
00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:06.338
topic and the allotted time in minutes.

84
00:04:06.338 --> 00:04:07.738
Recap of the assignments and action items.

85
00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:07.938
Again,

86
00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:11.588
this will just be a reminder to do the recap because you don't know the

87
00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:15.338
assignments and action items prior to the meeting typically.

88
00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.103
This really is just a reminder,

89
00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:20.338
to go around a room and confirm assignments and action items.

90
00:04:20.338 --> 00:04:26.338
Now I'll have much more on this in the verbal communication module on meetings.

91
00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:27.474
And then the next meeting.

92
00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.520
You know, when are you going to have it,

93
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.970
where you're going to have it, and who will come.

94
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.759
Certainly feel free to embellish your agenda to meet your specific needs,

95
00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.520
but I would suggest you do not remove any of these items,

96
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.338
but maybe add more.

97
00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:43.671
And also a tip.

98
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:45.338
Don't forget the 5 C's.

99
00:04:45.338 --> 00:04:49.005
In everything you have written you have got to be clear,

100
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.429
concise, courteous, consistent and compelling.

101
00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:52.338
I'm going to keep pounding that in.

102
00:04:52.338 --> 00:04:55.938
That's very, very important.

103
00:04:55.938 --> 00:05:01.338
Okay, now let's see an example.

104
00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:03.864
Here is an example of a meeting agenda.

105
00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:07.938
First there is the meeting name, Project Polar Weekly Technical Team Meeting.

106
00:05:07.938 --> 00:05:10.338
Very clear and concise.

107
00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:12.156
Next, the location and date.

108
00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:16.520
It's going to be in Irvine, December 1st, 10 to 11 a.

109
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.883
m.

110
00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.338
Pacific Time, so the time zones can be important as well.

111
00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:20.727
Attendees.

112
00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:23.060
We have Michael, Paul, and Cindy,

113
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.195
and I've also included phone numbers and emails so that way people can get

114
00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:31.338
a hold of each other prior to the meeting if necessary.

115
00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.044
Next, purpose.

116
00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:35.220
To complete the data model design for project Polar;

117
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.338
that's the purpose of the meeting.

118
00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:39.205
What's the expected outcome?

119
00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:44.338
A SQL Server data model schematic to provide to the developers.

120
00:05:44.338 --> 00:05:47.894
So I have the purpose of the meeting and what I want out of the meeting.

121
00:05:47.894 --> 00:05:48.338
Very clear.

122
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:50.970
We're not going to be talking about C# or programming,

123
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.338
we're going to be talking about the data model.

124
00:05:53.338 --> 00:05:56.338
So I'm going to list my agenda items and who's responsible and

125
00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:58.338
about how much floor time they will have.

126
00:05:58.338 --> 00:06:02.338
So validate primary keys is Paul for 15 minutes.

127
00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:05.338
Validate foreign keys is Paul for 15 minutes.

128
00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:08.338
Validate normalization is Cindy for 10.

129
00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:11.338
And convert to PDF is Michael for 10 minutes.

130
00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:15.295
Now that adds up to 50 minutes which leaves us 10 minutes of

131
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.729
kind of extra time to do other things,

132
00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.838
such as recap of assignments and action items and to talk about

133
00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:25.338
maybe the next meeting in terms of when and where.

134
00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:30.338
So I've already proposed it in the agenda, the following week, same time.

135
00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:32.338
Are we done with our meeting?

136
00:06:32.338 --> 00:06:40.000
Well, not yet. We still have one more task so let's check out this great quote.
