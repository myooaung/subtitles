00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.705
As a new leader, a weekly status report is one of the few possibilities,

2
00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.635
besides meeting attendance I guess,

3
00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:13.635
to demonstrate team contributions to management or customers.

4
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.691
So the intent and reason for status reports is to inform your customer,

5
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.135
stakeholder, your new manager, new teammates,

6
00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:25.135
on the progress of a project or activities.

7
00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:25.635
Okay.

8
00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.635
So what do we want to do in that status report?

9
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.135
Are we doing the right things?

10
00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:31.135
The right things meaning,

11
00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.135
are we doing the things within the scope of our responsibility?

12
00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.635
Are we doing things right?

13
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:41.635
In other words, is there quality to what we do?

14
00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:42.468
Timeliness?

15
00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:43.302
Schedule?

16
00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:46.635
Are we meeting milestones?

17
00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:50.206
And also a little more fuzzy here is, are we showing dedication to the project,

18
00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.003
to the customer and to the company?

19
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.214
Are we really behind the project?

20
00:00:54.214 --> 00:00:59.413
Are we showing there's a sense of urgency and dedication to what we're doing?

21
00:00:59.413 --> 00:00:59.802
Also,

22
00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:03.302
by constantly developing his or her knowledge and skills

23
00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:08.635
that the business needs to be successful as well as to your

24
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.635
own long-term career prospects.

25
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.235
Another thing we like to show in the status report is that,

26
00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:16.335
are we developing our knowledge and skills,

27
00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:21.635
that is our team, that the business needs to be successful?

28
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.857
In other words, are the things we're doing,

29
00:01:23.857 --> 00:01:26.635
not just the work-related things but we're also learning and

30
00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:29.811
exploring other things that would contribute to those projects

31
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:34.510
and contribute to the company as well as contribute to your

32
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.635
long-term career prospects as well.

33
00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:38.921
Here's a tip.

34
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:40.635
Management loves status reports.

35
00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:41.047
Remember,

36
00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:44.753
management is not in the trenches and needs timely

37
00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:47.635
information to make informed decisions and also,

38
00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:52.635
in my opinion, in business no news is in fact bad news.

39
00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:55.746
Management wants to know that you are doing

40
00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.079
something and without a status report,

41
00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.968
sometimes they may have doubts just about what's going on.

42
00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:05.079
So it's critical to provide those timely status

43
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:12.635
reports of your team's activities.

44
00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:16.424
To whom do you send your status reports?

45
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:21.635
For me, there are three main types of status report recipients.

46
00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:24.635
The first is the customers.

47
00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:27.635
You're doing work for customers.

48
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.214
The second is your management.

49
00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:31.109
It might be your direct report,

50
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.635
it might be some other management up the chain or across the chain.

51
00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:40.635
And the third for me is the team, the team itself.

52
00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:44.635
You're going to want to inform your team as well.

53
00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.579
Okay, back to the first.

54
00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:46.968
Customers.

55
00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:51.635
The lack of a project status report is usually interpreted as either

56
00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:54.635
something is wrong or you don't know what is going on.

57
00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:58.109
You do not want that impression of you or your team.

58
00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:58.740
In fact,

59
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.327
you're consistent status reports following the 5 C's will support a positive,

60
00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:08.635
perceptional perception of you by your customers.

61
00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:13.635
So constantly status your customers; never miss a one.

62
00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:17.635
You want to be professional and consistent per project.

63
00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.282
You're on three projects?

64
00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.576
You will have three different status reports going

65
00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:25.468
to each of those three customers.

66
00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:27.135
Next, management.

67
00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:29.635
Status your management.

68
00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:31.302
You want to be consistent.

69
00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:34.302
I also suggest copying your management on all status

70
00:03:34.302 --> 00:03:36.685
reports going to your customers as well.

71
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:41.235
He or she will also see the progress and quality of your work,

72
00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:44.635
so to your management, it's still very professional,

73
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:48.635
it's consistent, but it will be project summaries.

74
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:53.135
So if each week you send out three status reports to your three key customers,

75
00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:56.477
your status report to your manager will have the summary of those,

76
00:03:56.477 --> 00:04:00.052
but also when you send out your weekly status reports to your customers,

77
00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:04.635
I would also suggest that you cc or copy your manager.

78
00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.635
The third, this is your team.

79
00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:08.635
You need to status your team.

80
00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:13.435
Now I look at this as a little more of informal statuses,

81
00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:16.635
maybe a little more casual and company focused.

82
00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:19.582
They're already on the projects; they may know exactly what's going on in the

83
00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:22.579
projects because you may have asked them for their input,

84
00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:26.857
but you may want to keep them informed about broader activities,

85
00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.968
maybe something new out of HR,

86
00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:33.635
maybe a new policy coming up on raises and promotions and things like that.

87
00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:37.191
So I see these as more informal, casual,

88
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:41.635
company focused; weekly, bi-weekly, however you choose to do it.

89
00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:46.635
Maybe you'll use a stand-up form for this as well.

90
00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:50.164
And of course, in all the communiquÃ© that you're going to do,

91
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:58.000
always follow the 5 C's. Now let's actually look at the structure of a status report.
