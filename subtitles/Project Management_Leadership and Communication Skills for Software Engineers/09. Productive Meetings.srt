1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,707
Believe or not, meetings are a wealth of potential productivity.

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,707
I mean, why is that people don't want to go to meetings?

3
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:13,434
Are they long, boring, even stupid?

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:15,707
Nothing seems to get done?

5
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:20,957
Well, yes, those are all true at times, but if you follow my simple process,

6
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:23,640
you will have productive and effective meetings,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,440
maximizing the progress of your projects,

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,307
improving your team's morale,

9
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:33,001
and having your customers feeling that their time was well spent,

10
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,295
and maybe even have your attendees actually looking

11
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:42,421
forward to attending your next meeting.

12
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,707
Imagine that!

13
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,207
Contrary to popular belief,

14
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:50,707
you don't just show up and expect a meeting to be productive.

15
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,485
Don't get me wrong.

16
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:56,485
I'm all for stand-ups and quick meetings as needed,

17
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,263
but for important, productive,

18
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:04,207
and critical meetings with key members of your company or your customer,

19
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,707
I recommend the following steps.

20
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:12,707
Plan, prepare, lead, and the follow-up.

21
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:16,307
Now the first two relate to writing and that's,

22
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:20,707
of course, as part of this module for know your ABC's.

23
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:24,374
The next two, they have to do with leading your meeting,

24
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:28,707
the lead part and the follow and those will be covered in

25
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:32,707
the communication module coming next, the verbal communication.

26
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,007
Okay,

27
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:37,507
so in this section we will focus on the planning and preparing for your meeting,

28
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,602
since they have an emphasis of course, on writing skills,

29
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:44,075
and in the Let's Talk module we will focus on your

30
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:47,399
leadership skills necessary for the leading of the meeting

31
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,707
and the followup of the meeting.

32
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:56,707
Okay, now let's plan our first meeting as a leader.

33
00:01:56,707 --> 00:02:01,707
Now here are your actions as a leader for planning a meeting.

34
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,651
What is the purpose of your meeting?

35
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:06,707
Be sure you really need the meeting in the first place.

36
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:11,707
Could I solve this problem with a phone call, a standup or a casual drop-in?

37
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,374
What do you want out of the meeting?

38
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:15,707
Know your expected outcome.

39
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:19,307
Make sure your agenda reflects exactly what you want out of the

40
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:22,075
meeting and we'll have more on the agenda later.

41
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,286
So what do you want accomplished?

42
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,128
So develop a preliminary agenda,

43
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:30,707
jot down the topics you feel need to be covered and we'll talk

44
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,707
more on the agenda in the next few slides.

45
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,207
Who should attend?

46
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:40,707
Determine who needs to be there and how they would contribute.

47
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:44,707
Don't leave out key subject matter experts or stakeholders that you will need.

48
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:49,707
Also, think about what are the roles you need as opposed to the person?

49
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:54,707
Sometimes thinking of the roles you need will help identify the people.

50
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:58,707
For example, I need some architectural inputs regarding our application stack.

51
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:03,496
I think I might need to invite Harper since she is a key

52
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:05,707
architect with the experience I need.

53
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,707
What is the best date and time for the best attendance?

54
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:13,907
There is usually one or two really key people that need to

55
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,707
attend so be sure their calendars are free.

56
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,942
Use your calendar system or make a call to them or

57
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,707
their admin to double check beforehand.

58
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:25,707
How far in advance will you send the meeting request?

59
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:29,707
Also maybe, send out a preliminary agenda with the meeting invite.

60
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:31,485
Note I said preliminary.

61
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:33,263
You may certainly add,

62
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:38,092
change or delete agenda items or attendees since business is dynamic.

63
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,707
You may also inform the attendees what they need to prepare for.

64
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,957
Maybe some additional reading material or additional handouts that

65
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,407
you may have attached to the meeting request.

66
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:53,707
Who is required to attend and who is optional?

67
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:57,942
Not everyone you want to invite may be required and if your

68
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,707
calendar system enables optional attendees,

69
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:04,707
please use it and where is the best location for the meeting?

70
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:07,832
Be sure to confirm your location, that is reserve it,

71
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,707
prior to sending out the invite.

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,974
Be sure to secure any additional equipment,

73
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:16,707
computers, overhead, whiteboards, etc., prior to the meeting.

74
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:21,707
And will the meeting be virtual or be part in-person and part virtual?

75
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:22,023
Again,

76
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:25,496
some meetings are totally virtual and some are part physical and

77
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,654
maybe you have some remote sites that will call in.

78
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,496
I suggest you first set up a web conference,

79
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,707
get all the relevant information, phone number,

80
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:38,850
URL links, etc., and then when you send out the meeting request,

81
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,707
include those.

82
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,343
You may also do them separately,

83
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,889
but what happens is that you have two meetings on the same time,

84
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,832
one for the normal meeting invite,

85
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:51,707
maybe through your email system and the other for the web conference invite.

86
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:55,236
I don't two at one time; it may be confusing to the

87
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:56,707
attendees and maybe even yourself.

88
00:04:56,707 --> 00:05:01,496
So discover how all that works and I suggest only one meeting invite

89
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:04,757
with all the relevant information and here's a tip.

90
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:10,007
The more people you have in the meeting that are not critical to its success,

91
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:14,207
the greater likelihood that you would not achieve your

92
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:17,707
purpose or you may require another meeting,

93
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:26,000
so don't over invite. Okay, now let's take a look at the importance of an agenda.
