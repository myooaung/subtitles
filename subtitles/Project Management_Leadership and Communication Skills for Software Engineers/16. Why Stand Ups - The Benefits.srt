1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,209
Here are the benefits of stand-ups and why I love to use them.

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,209
To get real-time feedback on project activities, it's great.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:14,209
Everyone gets together, it's informal, what's going on.

4
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,503
Also, to avoid issues or problems early.

5
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:22,209
It's a very, very good method for early problem detection.

6
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:24,309
To get a pulse of the team.

7
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,409
So while they're talking about their projects,

8
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,909
you're getting a feel for how they feel.

9
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:32,759
What's going on with them and you get a good pulse,

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,363
a good feeling of, is everyone good, is everyone happy,

11
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:37,517
are there issues?

12
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:40,209
Other dynamics other than the projects themselves.

13
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:46,209
It also can create synergy and team work and what I call magic.

14
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,209
Next, to start the day well.

15
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:51,209
Everyone is kind of welcomed, included, what's going on,

16
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:54,671
maybe even some excitement to the day and how we're going

17
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,209
to accomplish these important tasks.

18
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:57,542
Also, to support improvement.

19
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:01,542
Different ideas may come up which improve not only the project itself,

20
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:07,209
but the processes that you use to actually write software.

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,209
Next, to reinforce focus on the right things.

22
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,066
Maybe the day before you got a phone call from a customer

23
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,495
and it's going to change priorities,

24
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:17,209
or you found out something from somebody else that's going to

25
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:19,209
change the way you're going to do things.

26
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,385
So you can make quick, reactive,

27
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:28,209
and planned changes in the team's activities; I really like that.

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:31,209
And lastly of course, to reinforce the sense of a team.

29
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,153
In other words, you're all there together,

30
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:35,376
you're all focused together on the work activities,

31
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,824
and it really does build teamwork.

32
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:40,517
I like that a lot.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,209
Stand-ups greatly improve team communications.

34
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,876
So here's a tip.

35
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:49,209
Stand-ups greatly improve team communications.

36
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,834
People feel more comfortable with each other,

37
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,084
people share information, work gets done,

38
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,542
and problems are corrected early.

39
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:59,209
I really like stand-ups.

40
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:05,209
Now let's see how I like to structure a stand-up.

41
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,709
Here's how I like to structure my stand-ups.

42
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,209
I like to follow my status report guidelines.

43
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:17,209
In other words, from that template we had progress, plans, and problems.

44
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,262
So first, a person is going to talk about what they did since we last met,

45
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,209
reporting their progress.

46
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:23,621
Next,

47
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,738
they're going to talk about what work they're going to

48
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:30,209
do today; that reports their plans.

49
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:31,876
And lastly, issues and problems.

50
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:35,876
So I'd like them to talk about the issues and obstacles they've

51
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:38,209
encountered and how they're going to maybe solve those.

52
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,209
Now while those discussions are going on, magic can happen.

53
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,262
Someone could say, oh,

54
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:48,209
I have a problem with the stored procedure; I can't seem to figure it out.

55
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,276
Someone else might say,

56
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,209
well I actually changed that yesterday and I changed the parameter.

57
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,209
Oh, well great, let's talk after the meeting.

58
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,709
So all sorts of little things can be discovered that

59
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,709
might take days or weeks to be uncovered,

60
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,209
maybe way downstream in the testing process.

61
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,209
I just really enjoy them.

62
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,828
Okay, so now you have a feel for the general process,

63
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:15,209
let's actually see a real example in practice in the next slide.

64
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,209
Here is a working example of stand-up.

65
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,209
I might begin with, okay, Lauren why don't you start.

66
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:29,276
I worked on the filter criteria user control on the accounts receivable screen,

67
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,209
Lauren says.

68
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,209
How did that go?

69
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,209
Fine, but I had a problem with the stored procedure GetAccounts.

70
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:44,209
Oh, I changed that yesterday (oops) and I will fix it for you, says Danielle.

71
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,132
Thanks Danielle.

72
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:46,517
Anything else Lauren?

73
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,363
What's on your plate?

74
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,209
That would be plans.

75
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,209
No, I'm good; I'll be moving on to the invoice screen.

76
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,027
Thank you, Lauren.

77
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,209
Then I just keep going around the room.

78
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,209
Now a person might just start off with a problem,

79
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,909
that's fine, as long as we cover plans, progress,

80
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,304
and problems, they don't have to be in the exact order of those three,

81
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:09,664
I typically like that but it doesn't have to be.

82
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:10,800
If someone has a problem,

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,209
I might want to hear that first and then you just go around the room.

84
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:14,915
It's informal,

85
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:19,150
but you're trying to make sure you understand what was done yesterday,

86
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,998
what they're thinking of doing today,

87
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:23,630
and are there any barriers for them to succeed in

88
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,209
what they're going to do today?

89
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:25,959
That's real important.

90
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,209
As a leader, you want to remove the barriers.

91
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,638
They could be technical, it could be something wrong with their office,

92
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,209
who knows?

93
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,209
So it's good to get that pulse of the team.

94
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:42,209
Alright, now let's look at the logistics of a stand-up.

95
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:46,209
Here are some logistics and guidelines on how to run and manage stand-ups.

96
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:50,209
The first is frequency; how often should you have them?

97
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:54,209
Well, it's a simple answer, as needed and what makes sense.

98
00:04:54,209 --> 00:05:00,209
Now in our scenario and in your new leadership role, I would do one each day.

99
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:02,562
It can be a welcoming and nurturing activity.

100
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,621
People can feel more connected and supported,

101
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:08,209
especially if they get stuck on an issue or have questions.

102
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,209
Remember, people tend not to reach out for help,

103
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,876
but instead want to solve their own problems,

104
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:14,577
especially engineers.

105
00:05:14,577 --> 00:05:15,683
That is noble,

106
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:20,104
but not always the most productive way to do things and the

107
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:22,042
stand-ups will bring out more communication.

108
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:24,820
Now on larger teams and I've had quite large teams,

109
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,098
I might have stand-ups per project, maybe two or three per week,

110
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,209
per project.

111
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,042
So it depends.

112
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:36,209
I might have a stand-up of just my project managers or just my senior managers.

113
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,584
So there are different slices of the organization that

114
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:42,209
you may wish to have stand-ups across.

115
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:42,959
Alright, duration.

116
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,459
Relatively quickly of course.

117
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,334
If necessary after the stand-up,

118
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:50,084
people can break off and drill into deeper sub teams.

119
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:54,209
You want it to be, you know, 5, 10, 15 minutes.

120
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,209
Typically 10 or 15 is about normal and location.

121
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,487
You know, you want to find a place where others are not disturbed.

122
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,265
I like to avoid conference rooms if possible because they're

123
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:06,509
full of chairs and people will sit down.

124
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,109
So there's a white board somewhere or a corner of an office,

125
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,709
sofa area, those are great little areas for stand-ups.

126
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,459
So if there is an white board area where people can

127
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,476
easily stand and do a stand-up, that's great,

128
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:21,209
a little bit out of the way, you don't want to disturb other people.

129
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,440
And who goes first?

130
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,209
Now, I think it should be a bit random.

131
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:28,923
Maybe it's round robin by last name or whatever you like to do,

132
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:31,426
but don't always start with the same person every

133
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,166
time and just kind of mix it up.

134
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,339
In fact, if there are five people in a row,

135
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:36,399
maybe do the first person,

136
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,066
then the third and then the fifth so people aren't really sure who you're

137
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:45,209
going to call on next and that's always kind of fun,

138
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,000
too. Alright, now let's move on to the next session on walk-arounds.
