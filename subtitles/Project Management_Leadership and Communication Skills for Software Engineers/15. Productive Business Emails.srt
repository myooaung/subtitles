"Here's how to write a good email: Write your email,

10
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,228
delete most of it, and then send.

11
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:37,617
" I think that is right on.

12
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,950
To me, people just write too much and it's unstructured,

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,933
hard to figure out the purpose.

14
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,091
I can't tell if it's important to me, the reader,

15
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,617
or whether I need to take any action.

16
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:58,000
So it's very important that we write really good, productive business emails. So this section will help us do just that.
