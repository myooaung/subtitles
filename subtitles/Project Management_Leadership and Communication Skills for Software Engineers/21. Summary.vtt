00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.298
Okay, let's do a summary wrap-up of this module.

2
00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:12.298
Now let's recap the Know Your ABC's module.

3
00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:16.533
We opened this module with emphasizing the critical importance

4
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.827
for leaders to have good writing skills,

5
00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:22.548
since no one really wants to read a document; they

6
00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:24.298
just want to know what it says.

7
00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:30.298
It raises the bar on what we leaders must aspire to with our writing skills.

8
00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:34.798
Next, we saw how the 5 C's--clear, concise,

9
00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:39.298
courteous, consistent, and compelling permeate the entire module.

10
00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.571
Then we jumped into the core of this module and we covered

11
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.298
five of the most important areas that you need to grow and

12
00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.298
improve your writing skills.

13
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:52.576
The first was presentations and now that you're standing up in

14
00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:55.736
front of your peers or customers or management,

15
00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:58.361
they will be listening, watching, measuring,

16
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:02.698
gauging and critiquing you from the second you stand up,

17
00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:06.298
so plan and prepare and you will be successful.

18
00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:07.965
Next, meetings.

19
00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:09.631
No agenda?

20
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:11.298
No meeting!

21
00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:13.548
And when you prepare your agenda,

22
00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:17.298
you want to have your expected outcome always in mind.

23
00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:18.934
And don't forget!

24
00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:23.298
Take good notes and deliver follow-up emails quickly.

25
00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:24.529
Status reports.

26
00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:28.221
They help you communicate progress, plans,

27
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.298
and problems regularly and consistently.

28
00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:34.298
And keep them short and simple as much as possible.

29
00:01:34.298 --> 00:01:40.298
Be specific and write and send them regularly and keep it positive, certainly.

30
00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:40.698
Emails.

31
00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:41.898
Like structured programming,

32
00:01:41.898 --> 00:01:45.498
if you follow my simple guidelines for structured emailing,

33
00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:50.298
you will produce professional emails easily and quickly.

34
00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:51.173
Lastly, interviews.

35
00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:54.235
By following the simple interview selection process,

36
00:01:54.235 --> 00:02:00.298
you will better find the best and the brightest to join your team.

37
00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.760
Thank you for joining me in this module.

38
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.375
But wait!

39
00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.298
There is more!

40
00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:06.877
The next module is even more important.

41
00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:10.930
We will cover how to improve your verbal and interpersonal skills

42
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.000
to help you be the best team leader you can be. See you soon!
