1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,663
Now let's see how we can align the team skills to the

2
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:07,397
projects and the business goals.

3
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:09,730
Well, first of course, we need requirements.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,397
So what do the team members actually need?

5
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:16,397
You'll want to ask them, what do you think you need to get your job done?

6
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:19,397
Next, we want to look a little closer at the projects themselves.

7
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:22,338
The projects may show to us certain technologies and skills

8
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,397
we may need to accomplish that project.

9
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:27,397
And third, we want to take a broader, longer-term look.

10
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:28,897
Where is the industry going?

11
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:33,397
Maybe we have some long-term skills that we're going to need to keep up on.

12
00:00:33,397 --> 00:00:36,397
Okay, so the skill needs for what the members need.

13
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:41,397
So interview team members as to what they think they need to learn.

14
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,897
We want to review the entire list with the team.

15
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:46,397
You know, maybe some examples of things like Visual Studio,

16
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:47,797
SQL Server, HTML5, etc.

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,297
What are all the skills or tools the team thinks

18
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,397
they need to accomplish the goals?

19
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:55,162
They've already sat with the team,

20
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:57,809
they understand the tasks and they understand the projects

21
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,397
and the alignment to the business as well.

22
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:03,397
Now what do we think the projects might need?

23
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:03,664
Okay,

24
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,064
we want to determine what technical skills will be

25
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:07,397
needed for the priority projects.

26
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:13,522
For example, maybe a certain project is really going to need Bootstrap and HTML5,

27
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,397
MVC, etc.

28
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:16,730
Maybe we even need some presentation skills.

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,397
You know, so we put those skill lists together as well.

30
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,670
And lastly, we want to look at the longer term.

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,397
We want to stay abreast as to where the industry is moving

32
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,868
and what new technologies look promising.

33
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,397
Maybe there are some new IDEs for developing native mobile apps.

34
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,341
Maybe Oracle, maybe other things like that.

35
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:38,730
Those would be longer term, less priority, but we still want them on our radar.

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,730
Okay, so now that we have the team skills requirements that we think we need,

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:50,397
let's see how we can make that happen.

38
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:51,897
Now that we know the requirements,

39
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,397
we want to go about actually building those team skills.

40
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:58,397
Okay, so we want to review the project based skills list.

41
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,397
We want to review the team members skills list,

42
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:06,320
and we also want to review the longer term skills that we might need downstream.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,397
We will want to integrate those lists, put them together.

44
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:12,397
There may be some overlap, there may be some gaps.

45
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,647
We want to prioritize those skills.

46
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:18,797
Typically they're going to be prioritized based on the priority projects.

47
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:22,397
We may want to develop a training plan, okay?

48
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:25,397
What are the training tasks we need to do?

49
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,397
What's the schedule?

50
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,397
We want to look at the budget, and of course,

51
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:32,397
we want Pluralsight as part of your plan; of course!

52
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:35,397
Maybe we want to implement the plan, just work the plan!

53
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:35,953
And repeat.

54
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:39,286
Maybe you want to repeat this process of looking at the skills

55
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,397
and readjusting your training plan quarterly,

56
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:45,397
or what makes best sense for your organization.

57
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:48,105
Now it may only take about an hour or two of a meeting

58
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,564
with your team to update your plan,

59
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:53,344
so once your plan is in place and you've gathered the skills,

60
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:57,029
the ongoing maintenance of this is really not very much

61
00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:00,022
and besides the training benefits, of course,

62
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,397
you are showing your team that you care about them.

63
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:12,000
You're showing you want the best for the team, and this results in inspiring motivation.
