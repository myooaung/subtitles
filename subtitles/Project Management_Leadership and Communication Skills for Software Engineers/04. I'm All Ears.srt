1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,957
You have heard term, "I am all ears, " but that's easier said than done.

2
00:00:05,957 --> 00:00:11,528
It seems we humans like to talk a lot so we need to

3
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,957
think and plan in order to listen more.

4
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:18,230
Listen with your eyes as well as your ears.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,957
The ears is the easy part, but when you listen with your eyes,

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:25,757
you are listening, or should I say watching,

7
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:27,857
for visual cues--that is body language,

8
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:33,957
to get a read on how they are feeling and/or reacting to your conversation.

9
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:35,557
Stop, look, and listen.

10
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,957
Take a pause for a minute.

11
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:42,075
It is almost like you want to be a bystander,

12
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,957
watching and listening to your own conversation.

13
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:48,957
Think about what is being said and how it is being said.

14
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:50,290
This takes some practice,

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,957
but also gives you a lot of insight into the conversation and the message.

16
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,957
Remember that effective communication is two-way.

17
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,290
Good leaders know how to ask good questions and then

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,957
listen with both their eyes and their ears.

19
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:07,767
It's easy to be focused on getting your message out,

20
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:13,062
or persuading others, that you don't tune in to what you see and hear.

21
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:15,641
Because you're in a position of authority,

22
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:20,220
the stakes are even higher because you won't always get direct feedback.

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,957
You need to read between the lines, listen and hear what is coming back to you.

24
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,207
Here is what I'd like you not to do.

25
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:32,957
Of course, do all the talking and I see people do this all the time.

26
00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:33,957
It's a turnoff.

27
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:38,290
What I would like you to do is initiate dialog and then just

28
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,457
sit back and listen; you'll learn a lot.

29
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:43,457
Okay, here's a tip.

30
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,957
Look for the nonverbal cues.

31
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:52,957
Sometimes a person's body language may tell you everything you need to know.

32
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:55,957
Your voice counts and I don't mean politically.

33
00:01:55,957 --> 00:02:01,957
There are several things that can literally affect your voice quality.

34
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:05,957
So to improve your voice, you have to minimize the tension in your body.

35
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:10,378
The first thing you need to realize is that fear or nervousness

36
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,957
of speaking can really affect your voice.

37
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:16,157
So maybe before an important talk or presentation,

38
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,957
do something that for you is relaxing.

39
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:24,957
Maybe a short walk, meditation, or something like that.

40
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:26,957
Start with your posture.

41
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:31,957
Undesirable posture habits shorten, narrow and twist your sound box.

42
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,557
Be sure you are distributing your weight between your left and your right

43
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:37,839
foot and balancing from heel to the ball of your foot.

44
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:43,486
Have a nice, comfortable stance with good posture and you'll breathe better,

45
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:47,957
which supports the voice and how it will carry.

46
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:48,957
Your breathing,

47
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:54,957
and you should stand upright so that your lungs can expand freely.

48
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,184
This might sound silly, but it's not.

49
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,093
As I walk to my presentations,

50
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:04,290
I stop and I stretch my arms way over my head and I stretch my body.

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,957
It not only feels good, but I feel a little taller, so to speak.

52
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:09,624
It's interesting.

53
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,957
I feel better and I think my lungs work better.

54
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:16,157
Here's what I'd like you not to do.

55
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,957
Be stressed, tired or have slumped shoulders.

56
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:24,957
Visually it doesn't look good and it also will affect the quality of your voice.

57
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:28,957
Here is what I'd like you to do.

58
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:33,957
Look tall, look straight, have good posture, and breathe easy.

59
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,957
Okay, here's a tip.

60
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:39,957
Be rested and relaxed before a big presentation.

61
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:42,483
Maybe get a little more sleep, you know,

62
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,694
maybe have some fluids, just get relaxed,

63
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:49,457
do some meditation and your voice will be better and

64
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:52,957
therefore your presentation will be better.

65
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,957
There is great power in your voice and speech.

66
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:01,157
If you get up in front of others with the aim of delivering information,

67
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,483
you could fail, not realizing the power of your voice and speech.

68
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,852
If, however, in addition to your great content,

69
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:12,016
you focus on using your voice, body language,

70
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,486
and other tools of performance we discussed,

71
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:18,342
this will get listeners on your wave length concerning your

72
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:22,957
content and you'll be well on your way to success.

73
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:26,386
As ideas and the urgency of your message emerge and you paint

74
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,957
what you're saying with a broad or fine stroke,

75
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:34,957
your vocal skills will give you both power and subtlety.

76
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:41,957
Speech is the vital external expression of what you think, know, and intend.

77
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:45,957
Use your voice and your passion to convince others to

78
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:50,457
enrich your connection with them and you'll be well on your

79
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:58,000
way to a successful presentation. Alright, now let's check out Michael's 5 C's.
