1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,608
Now let's talk about why interviewing is such an important

2
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:09,485
skill and likely a new skill that you need.

3
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:14,385
You have been tasked to build or grow your team and only with your

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,639
personal involvement can you really build a better team.

5
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:21,485
Do not rely on HR to do it for you.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:23,818
You need to be part of the process.

7
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:28,485
The last thing you want is for your HR or boss to force someone on you.

8
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,212
Yes, that may happen, but if you have a process,

9
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,485
you are more likely to be in control or be prepared to

10
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:40,485
participate as much as possible in other processes.

11
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,485
You want to be sure the new person meets your requirements.

12
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:47,485
There is no point in hiring someone who does not meet your requirements.

13
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:51,485
That just means more work and more headaches.

14
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,110
You want to build your interviewing skills.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,360
The better your skills at interviewing,

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,544
the better quality people you will be hiring.

17
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:04,485
Better for you, your team, and your company and the new hire.

18
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:07,432
It's also a career builder as well.

19
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:12,485
The better interviewing skills you have may help you downstream when you

20
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:16,485
are being interviewed yourself for the next new job.

21
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:25,485
Okay, now let's cover a simple interviewing process to get you started.

22
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,576
If you don't think about what you need in a new employee ahead of time,

23
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:34,402
you will have a much harder time knowing when you find him or her,

24
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,485
so follow this simple process.

25
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:39,485
In preparation for the interviewing process,

26
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:43,485
you must follow company HR standards and policy.

27
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:47,385
I'm never going to suggest that you work around those or ignore those,

28
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:51,758
so check with your manager and/or your HR department and be sure

29
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:54,485
you understand your company's process first.

30
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:57,011
Maybe HR is responsible for posting open positions.

31
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:01,408
Maybe they want to hire from within first and then from the outside.

32
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:06,485
All that is good and you must follow your company's process.

33
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:10,746
Just be sure at some point you are part of the interview process and

34
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:15,303
many times HR will ask you for the new- hire skill requirements and

35
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,485
we're going to talk about that later.

36
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:21,064
Okay, so step 1, document and post.

37
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:25,485
So document and post your new-hire skill requirements and we will go

38
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,254
through an example of documenting on the next slide,

39
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:29,485
so hold on there.

40
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:33,603
Then post your requirements either through existing company practices or

41
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:38,485
say on Indeed or LinkedIn or other social or business portals that your

42
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:41,485
company has approved or that you can go use.

43
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,169
Next, screen and phone.

44
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,853
Okay, in this step,

45
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:49,801
your responses are starting to come in from where you posted them.

46
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,380
Rank them against your requirements.

47
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,011
Believe me,

48
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:55,902
you may get some that aren't even close to what you need

49
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:58,818
and you may get dozens or hundreds.

50
00:02:58,818 --> 00:02:59,652
No worries.

51
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:00,485
That's expected.

52
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,885
Now when you find candidates that come close,

53
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,785
remember, no one walks on water, so don't look for the perfect response.

54
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,685
Then you're going to put them in the pile for the phone interview,

55
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,485
which will be the next step.

56
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,985
Some people jump right to face to face and I think

57
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:19,167
that's basically a waste of time, not only for you,

58
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,639
but to the candidate as well.

59
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,485
And what do you ask on the phone?

60
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:25,485
Well, that's coming up on the next couple slides as well.

61
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,285
Step 3.

62
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,885
In-person interview and test.

63
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:30,285
If they satisfy your phone interview,

64
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:34,985
then set up a time for them to come into your office

65
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,485
for the face-to-face interview.

66
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,590
You might need to coordinate schedules with not

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,906
only yourself and the interviewee,

68
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:44,285
but also with one or more of your team members if you want

69
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:47,485
them involved as well and I suggest that.

70
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:51,485
For the in-person interview, we provide a written test at our company.

71
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:56,485
This allows us to have an objective score based on their answers.

72
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:01,191
We also score on soft skills such as team work,

73
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,485
personality, attitude, motivation, and things like that.

74
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,985
This is certainly subjective, but in my opinion,

75
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:14,485
actually more important than the objective attributes that we test on.

76
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,758
The next step, follow-on interviews.

77
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,485
Usually one interview is not enough.

78
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:22,801
After you have interviewed your first round of candidates,

79
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:26,485
I suggest you narrow that down to two or three,

80
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,485
and then high a second interview with each.

81
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:34,929
Now the candidate is more relaxed usually and you can discuss job duties and

82
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:40,014
expectations in more detail and/or drill in on some of their answers from the

83
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,485
first interview to better understand the candidate.

84
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,152
Next comes selection.

85
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:47,485
Okay, you need to pick one.

86
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,485
Now you could rank each person with the scores,

87
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,485
technical scores and soft skills scores.

88
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:56,235
I suggest though that you pull your team together and

89
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:58,485
delegate the selection to the team.

90
00:04:58,485 --> 00:04:59,675
Remember, we talked about delegation?

91
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,073
Now that takes some guts here on your part, but give it a try if you can.

92
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:08,779
Step 6 is what I call just paperwork.

93
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,485
HR or company paperwork that must get done.

94
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:16,380
So you need that to actually probably make this happen in

95
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,485
terms of really getting that person hired in.

96
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:23,485
Also, you need to have an offer letter extended to the number 1 candidate.

97
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:24,576
After they reply with "I accept,

98
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,121
" then you can inform the other candidates that they did not make it,

99
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:32,485
but you will keep them on file since they did so great.

100
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,064
Now if the person turns you down,

101
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:39,485
then pull the team together again and pick the next best candidate.

102
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,073
Now we're going to go into some of these steps in

103
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,485
more detail in the following slides.

104
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:49,485
So now let's prepare for our first interview.

105
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:53,485
Now let's drill into the document and post step.

106
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,580
So first, we're going to come up with all of our new-hire requirements,

107
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,318
what are all the things we need this person to fulfill.

108
00:05:59,318 --> 00:05:59,596
Next,

109
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,374
we're going to come up with our list of interview

110
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:03,842
questions for the phone conversation.

111
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:06,342
This won't be a very long list.

112
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,485
You're just trying to vet them.

113
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:12,199
You have their resume and you're just trying to vet them to see

114
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,485
if you want them for the in-person interview.

115
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:14,797
Next,

116
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:17,922
you're going to come up with another list of interview

117
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,485
questions for the in-person interview.

118
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:23,485
Then you're going to come up with a list of test questions that you're

119
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:26,152
going to ask them to actually test their skills,

120
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,485
and next you're going to come up with, what is your selection rationale?

121
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:34,342
Your team should get together and discuss how will

122
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,485
you select the best candidate?

123
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:37,985
Okay, are you ready?

124
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:42,485
Alright, then let's post it online with the requirements we've put together.

125
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,885
We might use Indeed and things like that,

126
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:48,818
and we might even use some head-hunter companies to find the best candidates.

127
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:52,485
Now it's out there posted and we're anxious and ready to

128
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:59,485
receive any inquiries for the job position.

129
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,485
Here's an example and an approach to documenting your requirements.

130
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:07,485
First, get your team together and list your soft and hard skills.

131
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:10,914
Soft skills would be things like team work,

132
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:13,056
communication, people orientation, writing skills,

133
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:13,485
etc.

134
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:16,177
Hard skills maybe things like.

135
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:20,485
NET, SQL, C#, Bootstrap, jQuery, things like that.

136
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:23,596
You may have other requirements such as driving,

137
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:27,485
travel, relocation, so you'll want to itemize those as well.

138
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:32,297
Then for each item, give it a weight of importance (5,

139
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:34,485
10, 15, things like that).

140
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:38,763
All weights should total to 100 and what these weights are,

141
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:42,222
are weights of importance because when you actually provide,

142
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:45,169
or so when you actually select a candidate,

143
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,947
you will likely select them on the most points received.

144
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:54,485
It keeps it a little more objective and a little more fair.

145
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:57,056
Alright, once you've done this for each new hire,

146
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:00,485
you simply need to pull out your Word or Excel template and

147
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,485
quickly update it and away you'll go.

148
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:07,355
So once you lay out a whole list of soft skills and a whole list of

149
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:10,056
hard skills the first time and provide the weights,

150
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,628
when the time comes for the next new hire,

151
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:16,735
you've already done all the work involved and you can quickly update the

152
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:20,485
template and be ready for the next new-hire process.

153
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:27,485
Okay, let's move on to the phone interview questions.

154
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:31,485
So here's an approach to your phone interview questions.

155
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:34,485
Okay, prior to actually calling someone on the phone and interviewing them,

156
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:35,485
you've received several resumes.

157
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,056
You've gone through those and you've picked a few

158
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,485
that look like great candidates.

159
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,047
So for the phone interview,

160
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:44,485
you want to ask questions that allow you to pre-qualify them.

161
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:44,838
Again,

162
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:48,720
you don't want them to come into the office if they

163
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,485
don't meet some basic requirements.

164
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,485
So you need to determine then, what are the got-to-have requirements?

165
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:56,485
That's going to be a subset of your full requirements.

166
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,152
So we've already listed the full requirement set.

167
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:02,929
Now we're going to mark certain questions on there that you

168
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,041
think are appropriate for the phone interview,

169
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:06,485
okay?

170
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:10,639
So you'll want to ask questions that specifically tie

171
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,485
to the got-to-have requirements.

172
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,367
As an example,

173
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,309
I might be looking for the requirement that they're enthusiastic

174
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,914
and passionate; maybe the weighting is 15%.

175
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:25,580
I might look for a requirement of 5+_years of C# and I might say,

176
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,485
hey that's worth 10%.

177
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:31,085
And maybe I need a 4-year degree in a

178
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,485
computer-related topic; maybe that's another 5%.

179
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,935
So your short list, if you will,

180
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:40,485
your got-to-have requirements are going to be what you want to focus on,

181
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:43,402
on the phone and again, no detailed.

182
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:45,485
NET questions or technical questions.

183
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:49,385
You're just trying to pre-qualify them to see if they meet enough of

184
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:54,177
the soft skills and enough of the hard skills so they can come into

185
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,485
the office for a face-to-face interview.

186
00:09:56,485 --> 00:10:03,485
Okay, now let's move on to the in-person interview.

187
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,615
If they are now right in front of you, in your office,

188
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:09,914
you have found that they are going to be worth your time.

189
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:15,485
And again, I do not recommend face to face without a phone interview.

190
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:18,959
Now the exceptions would be people you already know or you

191
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,870
have worked with or there's a phenomenal referral from

192
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,793
someone else in your company.

193
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:26,485
Then, go ahead and do that, certainly.

194
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:29,485
Okay, in-person interview questions.

195
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:33,685
For each requirement, you may have two or three questions and again,

196
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:37,110
you may not ask all the questions to each candidate.

197
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,297
Depending on their answers, depending on time,

198
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,985
and depending on the quality of their answers.

199
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:46,985
So have a full superset list of questions of which

200
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:50,485
maybe a subset will be actually asked.

201
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,023
And document your rating, okay?

202
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:54,485
Document what you think how well they did.

203
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,685
Is it right?

204
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,885
Is it wrong?

205
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:58,485
Partially right, partially wrong?

206
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,985
But try not to be too clinical.

207
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,485
It doesn't have to be exactly perfect.

208
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:06,485
We're looking for order of magnitude like yes,

209
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:09,485
they are pretty good in this area, etc.

210
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,132
I prefer one-on-one first.

211
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:16,485
In other words, you as the leader are interviewing them one-on-one and again,

212
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:17,959
it's a vetting process.

213
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:23,485
If you don't think they're worthy, the interview may be over and off they go.

214
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:25,199
If you think they are worthy,

215
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,485
then it's time to pass them then maybe to the team or other team members.

216
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:33,818
I wouldn't waste the time of yourself and the full team in the

217
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,152
interview only to find out after 10 minutes the person did

218
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:40,485
maybe great on the phone interview, but not so great in the face to face.

219
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,254
Then it just wastes more time.

220
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:46,485
I'm always a believer in conserving time.

221
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:48,956
Next, team member versus full team.

222
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:49,779
For example,

223
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,758
they've passed your face-to-face with you as the leader; now

224
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,212
you're going to pass them on to the team.

225
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:58,667
Should it be the entire team, the full team,

226
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:02,485
or maybe a particular member, or one member at a time?

227
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,030
That will be up to you to decide.

228
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,885
Again, I like to conserve time and I don't want to waste everyone else's time.

229
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:13,885
But sometimes an interviewee may feel uncomfortable or unsure because

230
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:17,568
they're staring across the table of five other people.

231
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:26,000
So, be careful about that as well. Okay, now let's look at the selection criteria.
