00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.544
As the new leader of your group,

2
00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:07.542
you will likely have to interview candidates to join your team.

3
00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:11.963
They may come from other departments in your company or outside of your company,

4
00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:14.465
so continuing with our theme of this course,

5
00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:17.542
you are now responsible to maintain and build your team.

6
00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:18.633
Let's face it.

7
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.542
Knowing how to interview can be a challenge.

8
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.917
Conducting an interview isn't always fun and it doesn't

9
00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:27.542
come all that naturally to many people.

10
00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:28.009
Why?

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.475
Well,

12
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:33.142
most interviewers are unprepared with the appropriate interview questions or

13
00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:37.842
find it challenging to fill the void that often results when two people just

14
00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:40.542
sit together in a room for the first time.

15
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:45.542
In fact, many team leaders feel uncomfortable interviewing and hiring, period.

16
00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:45.892
Nonetheless,

17
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:50.792
you will need to build your skills so you can build a quality team

18
00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.542
and further your own and your team's success.

19
00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:57.542
It is very important to get the right people for the job,

20
00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:02.399
so let's see how you can improve your interviewing process,

21
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.542
which will result in building a better and stronger team.

22
00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:13.248
The interview is a conversation or conversations between a

23
00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:16.986
job applicant and a representative of the employee and

24
00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:20.542
organization and in this case, well, it's you.

25
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:24.542
A job interview is only a part of the employment screening process.

26
00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:30.437
Now, that process is how you filter down from many candidates to just one,

27
00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.542
which becomes the new hire.

28
00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:36.275
Interviews are the most popularly used methods for

29
00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:38.609
employee selection and of course,

30
00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.013
interviews primarily are verbal and interpersonal discussions.

31
00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:45.328
So that's why it's so important that you need to refine those skills.

32
00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:55.542
Now, let's check out the benefits of having you involved in this process.

33
00:01:55.542 --> 00:02:00.542
So what are the benefits of learning and improving your interviewing skills?

34
00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:02.465
Well, let's check them out.

35
00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:05.542
You have been tasked to build your team.

36
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.963
How can you build a great team if you don't have a process

37
00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:10.542
and approach for interviewing or hiring.

38
00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.399
You need to be part of the process as well.

39
00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.542
Who else really knows who you really need for the job?

40
00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:16.892
HR?

41
00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:17.942
I doubt it.

42
00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.742
They may have some basic or general criteria,

43
00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:23.542
like a candidate must have a 4-year degree,

44
00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:28.875
for example, but they will likely not know that you need Angular,

45
00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.542
JavaScript, and Bootstrap skills as well.

46
00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:34.777
You want to really be sure the new person meets your

47
00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:36.542
requirements and what are your requirements?

48
00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:40.542
Well, I will help you articulate them on the following slides.

49
00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:42.292
You want to build your interviewing skills.

50
00:02:42.292 --> 00:02:47.080
If you are not good at interviewing, you will not be good at hiring and in fact,

51
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.542
may hire the wrong people more often than not.

52
00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:54.178
That's why it's so important to your success.

53
00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.542
Here's a tip.

54
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:56.971
The more you perform interviews,

55
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:59.542
the better you will be at being interviewed yourself.

56
00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:12.000
Hey, someday you may be on the other side of the interviewing process. Alright, now let's look at the process step by step on the following slides.
