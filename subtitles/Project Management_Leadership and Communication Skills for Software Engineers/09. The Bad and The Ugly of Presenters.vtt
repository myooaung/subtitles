00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.278
Now here is the bad and the ugly.

2
00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:05.751
These are the things I don't want you to do.

3
00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:10.597
Don't talk too fast and don't talk too slow.

4
00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:12.751
Get the right tempo.

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:13.513
Don't be monotone, either.

6
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.799
Have your voice go up and have it go down and move

7
00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.751
around so it sounds more interesting.

8
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:23.751
No hands in pockets; that's unprofessional.

9
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:26.213
Don't look at the floor or the ceiling.

10
00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:27.751
Always look at your audience.

11
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.551
Try to control being tense or rigid.

12
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:35.751
People pick up on that and right away might feel uncomfortable or less

13
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:38.751
interested in the presentation or less interested in you.

14
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.593
Keep your posture nice and straight, that usually helps,

15
00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:44.751
also with being a little bit less tense or rigid,

16
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.751
and don't lean on the podium or other sort of artifacts in the room.

17
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.751
Have good posture, good eye contact.

18
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.751
Alright, I just wanted to recap the bad and the ugly.

19
00:00:54.751 --> 00:01:01.296
So, how long should a good presentation be?

20
00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.751
Well, let's see.

21
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.951
So how long should a good presentation be?

22
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:13.251
Well, I say the shorter the better, as long as it accomplishes what you require.

23
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.751
Now let's see what Winston Churchill thinks.

24
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:17.513
He said,

25
00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:21.703
"I'm going to make a long speech because I've not had

26
00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:24.370
the time to prepare a short one.

27
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.751
" What he is saying is that if you don't plan and prepare,

28
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:31.084
you will likely make longer, less focused,

29
00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:32.828
and less interesting presentations.

30
00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:38.751
It takes planning and preparation to make good presentations and good

31
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:44.751
presentations are clear and concise and therefore on the shorter side.

32
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:45.084
Okay,

33
00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:55.000
now let's move to the next session where we will discuss the verbal interpersonal aspects of leading effective meetings.
