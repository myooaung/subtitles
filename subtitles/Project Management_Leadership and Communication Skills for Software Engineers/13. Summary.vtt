00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.774
Now let's summarize.

2
00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:05.748
What does leadership mean to you now?

3
00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:09.319
So you have learned that it is not just leading people to a common goal,

4
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.203
which is important and great, of course,

5
00:00:11.203 --> 00:00:15.748
but more importantly it is how you are leading them.

6
00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:19.637
Do they feel like they accomplish something and feel empowered,

7
00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:22.748
and if so, you've done your job well.

8
00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:24.248
Connect, change, motivate.

9
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:28.248
We discussed first what you thought leadership meant,

10
00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:31.695
then we reviewed two quotes from great leaders,

11
00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.485
and analyzed the words and discovered that the key action words or

12
00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:39.148
phrases boiled down to connecting with people,

13
00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:44.748
being change agents, and inspiring long-lasting motivation.

14
00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:46.594
That is a great cheat sheet for you.

15
00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:47.748
Keep that by your side.

16
00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.748
When you drive to work tomorrow, ask yourself, are you connecting with others?

17
00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:57.748
Are you enabling change and do you inspire motivation?

18
00:00:57.748 --> 00:00:58.873
Follow the leader.

19
00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:00.748
It's not a game anymore.

20
00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:03.748
We discussed several key attributes of a leader.

21
00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:05.160
Trust, compassion, stability,

22
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.395
and hope were all essential elements to encourage your

23
00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:14.748
team to follow you and that trust, in my humble opinion,

24
00:01:14.748 --> 00:01:16.748
is the most important.

25
00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:17.548
Leadership qualities.

26
00:01:17.548 --> 00:01:21.148
In addition to the qualities we've just already mentioned,

27
00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:24.304
you will need credibility, negotiating skills,

28
00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:29.748
planning, management skills, and strong communication skills.

29
00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:31.936
I'm going to really emphasize those communication

30
00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.811
skills in the next couple modules,

31
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.748
for verbal communication skills and writing communication skills.

32
00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:40.327
On a leap of faith,

33
00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:43.801
we discuss that you transition from software engineer to leader requires

34
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.637
you to realize that your success is all about growing others and one

35
00:01:48.637 --> 00:01:51.359
method of doing this is through delegation,

36
00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.498
because through delegation you are instilling trust and giving your team

37
00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:58.623
a greater sense of responsibility and empowerment.

38
00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:04.748
These are more complex, long-lasting motivation factors.

39
00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:06.462
Align to the business.

40
00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:10.748
Understand the broader business goals of your company or organization.

41
00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:14.748
Determine how your work and projects align to the business goals.

42
00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:17.748
That's a motivating factor for people.

43
00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:20.748
Knowing they're contributing to the business.

44
00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:24.748
And you also want to identify who your customers are and how they would benefit.

45
00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:28.748
This is your first step in setting the direction of your team.

46
00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:32.748
Then there are your daily work tasks and you'll want them aligned as well.

47
00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:37.415
So for each project, list the features or tasks required to fulfill the project,

48
00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:39.581
include your priorities and estimated hours.

49
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:43.748
This is performed at a reasonably high level of granularity.

50
00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:48.748
This allows your team to feel more empowered and gives them room to be creative.

51
00:02:48.748 --> 00:02:49.498
Motivating your team.

52
00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:51.248
Lots of things may motivate your team,

53
00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:54.081
some of which may be they like to learn new things,

54
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.748
they want to be creative, they want to have a voice,

55
00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:03.148
they want to be recognized for their hard work and they want to build something,

56
00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:04.748
do something that matters.

57
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:06.548
And lastly, you.

58
00:03:06.548 --> 00:03:10.748
They want you to be their leader.

59
00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.116
Okay, now let's move on to the next module,

60
00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:16.581
Let's Talk, which is all about improving your verbal and interpersonal skills.

61
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm excited to share that one with you as well. See you on the other side.
