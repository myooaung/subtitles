00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.115
Hello.

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.050
Hey guys, welcome to Cloud Learning Channel.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.985
So I hope you all are doing great.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:15.254
In this video today, I'm going to teach you like how you can use the Spot instances.

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:18.120
Maybe you heard of all lot of sport and stances,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.900
but there will be one question like how you can use this part of the answer.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.175
And we used to see like sport as dances in compared to on-demand.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.755
They used to give them a lot of benefit rate,

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:33.520
likely guarding the price benefits of sport and stances.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.970
I told you many times,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.930
like it is used for short-term period, right?

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.630
If you need some couple of days, so you can,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.910
you can place a bid and you can watch is according to their sport instance.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.335
Right? Now I'm going to show up practically how you can use that.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:54.230
And we will launch on the sport is 1000 this video and

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.605
we'll see how we can work with that, okay?

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:04.730
So Spot instances first feature is that it is bid price.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:13.805
Price, okay? And basically Spot instances is compared to on-demand.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:15.650
It is cheaper, right?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.240
It is cheaper, approximately up to 70 percent easily, right?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.785
Up to 70 percent cheaper compared to on the one.

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:35.780
Right? So let's see practically how we can do that.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.435
So while launching your seller, okay?

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:43.625
And you're not your server whatsoever you want to use.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:48.665
Suppose I say Windows Server, okay?

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:54.320
And then you're going to like witches dancing,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.290
want to choose like if I Tuesday, okay,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.400
which will come with a memory edge UV lamp to CPU.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.790
So it will be competitively OK instance, okay.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.345
Then next, here, while configuring,

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:11.825
your server, settings are same,

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:14.345
but only at one place.

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:19.625
You will find the option to request a sport instance.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.240
And it will show you like ONE.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.310
What is the current price going on?

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.885
What is the current bit rate?

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.760
Okay? So Spot instances,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.820
as we know that it is like AWS use lee f

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.695
some resources which is not in use rate on the sources are not on the team.

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.825
So from debt unused,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.825
compute power, they used to give you the resources.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:47.450
So they're giving me one option like it is our labor like to a to B to C,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.660
current price route is going on, you know,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.490
$0.0558 per bottle per hour, right?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.050
So this is the current cost.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.360
So it is approximately leg if it is 0.045.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.720
So you can see like Â¢4.5, but are right.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.265
So it is approximately,

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:13.250
I can say around $0.06, right?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.770
The current rate for Windows machine is going on or is for disaster.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.920
So let me check this is the bit rate, okay?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.790
What I'll do to prove my point,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.145
what I do, I say 0.05.

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:33.890
Okay? This is the lesser price.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.665
What is the current price going on? Okay.

00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:41.705
And I don't use persistent store requests because if I check this,

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:46.190
this means that this request

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.630
will be continuously going on even if my if I terminate the server,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.185
again, whenever the new silver will be available, it will use it.

00:03:54.185 --> 00:04:03.335
Okay? So so, so you can do that, right?

00:04:03.335 --> 00:04:07.970
And what I say, 500,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.405
current price is lower than the maximum price is lower than the current price.

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:18.720
Okay? So what I'll do,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.375
I put it right now on the lower side.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.430
Okay. What's a search request?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.050
I stopped because I don't want that.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.880
It goes continuously.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.665
Then it is fine.

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:35.010
And I go here.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.445
Next. Now I go with the other options,

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:45.215
like which is by default, right?

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:52.415
So I just place my current price that I am ready to pay, $0.05.

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:56.900
Okay? Or the current bidding price is going higher than that.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.655
Okay, so let's see how it works.

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:04.220
So I say support Windows 7.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.315
And launching this steps are seen much indifference.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:13.910
Choose Windows Security Group double 38,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.425
nine, I can find it.

00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:19.505
And I can check naughty too loud is getting launched.

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:21.470
Security group is fine.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.120
Fine. I launch it.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.700
I have this key so there is no issue with the TA will

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.850
be able to launch right now it is getting launched,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.870
but if you see the price for what it is coming,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.010
0.05 is lower than the minimum suggested place, right?

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.960
So therefore it is not launching.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.660
I go to review screen again,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.750
and I change my price here,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.150
and I'm ready to pay on the higher side.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.820
Now I should be fine.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.520
Right now I can click on Review and Launch.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.164
And I can try to launch missile.

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:13.310
And this time you can see that it successfully launch my server.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.400
Instances.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.680
Can see myself what is getting launched.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.890
And if I see now in the sport request,

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.320
there are two requests got fulfilled.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.785
One was a field previously around 6000 before,

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:32.480
and another is just now.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.845
Was, it was Windows Server,

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:37.795
earlier it was Linux server,

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.730
and now it is Windows 7.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.340
Okay. So if I go here,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:54.440
the stance is my satellite has been not okay to do right now initializing the status.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.300
And this is the previous server,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.135
okay, if you see the IDH B6,

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:05.225
so even check the status of your request on the left panel itself.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:10.475
And here I can see so 600 before a tooth.

00:07:10.475 --> 00:07:19.100
It is, I am paying 300 dollar for that server.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.020
And it is active.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.775
Interruption behavior would be termination like somebody,

00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:28.450
the price goes high,

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.010
so it will terminate my server.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.375
And if I go further discussion All clear,

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.670
now if I go to saving somebody okay.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.280
When I have the option,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.800
like I can cancel that request if I want.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.290
But I need this right now.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.740
It is. Right. So current prices for Lenox,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.150
it is knocking Anyway, CCD money.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.400
So I got 19 dollar.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:15.305
Okay. So basically, if I compare it with the on-demand might charge would be 0.5. Okay?

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:18.065
So it is comparatively quite less.

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:27.455
And I'm able to see my 67 percent money if I'm seeing seeing the active cost, okay?

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.600
And you can see that it is right now.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.010
I am launching tools for instances.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm using sport as dances at this time.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.190
One is fit 70 percent saving,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.290
and one is Windows Server,

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.870
which is 50 percent.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.805
Okay. So I'm getting more sitting actually.

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:56.600
Okay. Cpu hours and average cost,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:04.460
which is coming for my memorial discovered that the daily information late,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.380
which I am getting, what it short,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.595
I can say that I'm able to save 67% of money.

00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:14.135
And a high level summary of your saving across.

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:16.085
Okay, so this is fine.

00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:18.710
No, Stan's got terminated till now.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.465
It is looking fine.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:23.585
And if I want,

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.315
I can connect my server as them.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:31.520
So this is for Windows one and my price is $0.060.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.415
So this is also fine and this is no issue with that.

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:45.320
Let's go to Einstein says, okay, that's bad.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.230
And hopefully no server should be running.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.740
Running Windows Server.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.705
Let me just try to connect it.

00:09:53.705 --> 00:09:56.160
So I connect it.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.830
Start run by MSDS C,

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.900
which is for baking remote.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:13.430
I put the DNS name or you can put up here that says the public IP address.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.890
Let me just try to connect it.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.930
So it is getting connected.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.090
It is asking username and password.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:25.715
So you need to click on More and then you need to give us an administrator.

00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:29.285
And while connecting, you need.

00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:33.695
So you can see here there is an image that administrator and you can get the password.

00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:36.950
I have the key file C 11, Oregon,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.940
and I can use that to

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:50.340
check the password. Copy it.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.990
We will

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.780
see it is fast.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.380
So I used to give online training as well.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.215
If you want, you can get it.

00:11:42.215 --> 00:11:45.480
Training medium could be in

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.580
some settings like this,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.800
doing to my browser and nothing.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:13.160
Okay? Now if you see already this is IP address and this is,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.190
this is the array.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.145
Or you can go to Task Manager.

00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:22.925
And there you can see like right now, autumn ADB,

00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:27.515
memory and processes as well.

00:12:27.515 --> 00:12:30.485
So there was two processor,

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:32.825
virtual processor to right,

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:43.100
and which is going to use right now 1.5 dB or blogs, news like this.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.850
We can find out the service.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.090
And I hope you can see that you are

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.440
taking advantage of this quarter instances and you're saving your money.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.740
Again, and it's shown you,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.410
you can take the status.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.470
Okay, So thank you for watching this video.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:13.130
I hope you like this video rate and you should be able to save some money by using this.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.140
Right now I don't need the server,

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.090
so I'm canceling this request.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.555
Okay.

00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:22.790
So I just cancel this request.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.970
And I said, well, nor should it be deleted in some time.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.690
Okay, so now you can see my serverless TO stopping flow.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.425
Okay?

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:35.790
I hope you like this video.
