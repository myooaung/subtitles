00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Hello,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.590
friends.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.080
So welcome to this video.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.380
This video is going to be very important because in this video we're going to learn that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.350
how we can choose the best issue tune stance.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.590
So you know that the pricing is best.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.870
Pricing is basically very important part.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.720
If you are working on cloud or in aid of Louis,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.270
we need to ensure that we are choosing the best solution.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.620
Ah,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.650
so that we can keep our resources on low prices.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.150
So this is the reason why this video is going to be very important.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.420
This is a short video.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.750
It would not take much time,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.790
but it will help you to The best is iTunes stands for your present,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.510
so let us start.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.320
And if you know that there are three types,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.060
often stances,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.510
basically first,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.940
it's on the mining stance.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.680
Second is deserving stance.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.060
30 exporters tons and forth is dedicated and stance,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.150
which you can choose when choosing Instance type.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.570
So whenever you create any easy to instance,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.450
you get the option that you can clear,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.900
shared instance or dedicated.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.090
It stands so I included it here to make it clear that why,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.520
what is the difference between them so dedicated and stances on some higher side because

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.480
the resources will not be shared for dedicated instances with other clients.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.460
Howard,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.770
which he has stance it Ah,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.680
resources like CPU and RAM,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.410
which can be shared with other clients.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.030
It gets shared with other clients.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.290
So this is the basically middle difference between shared and dedicated and stance.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.570
And if you talk about performance performances off,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.550
dedicated and senses better that shared installs So this is a point and new.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.530
We have different,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.340
kind off instances for different kinds of solutions.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.650
So we need to to scare Feli to keep our product prices low between It starts this type.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.080
So let me go with this.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.360
The first instance type is on the minor stances.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.790
And so first is only one in stances on this instance is basically of when whenever you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.500
launch and in stars we normally used on the monastery.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.660
So if you are launching any stance,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.450
it will be basically on the one of stunts.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.560
I will show you in the practical Andi,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.150
you can check that were house and believe we can create on the moon and stars.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.930
So whenever you board the option,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.760
launch understand.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.350
So basically,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.460
you are launching and undermining stance.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.040
What is the benefit?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.740
There is no time commitment and there is no advance payment like you don't paid normally

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.820
for this instance you just beef or the monthly bill.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.900
Whatever the issue used for that and starts,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.270
you have to pay for that.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.910
And due to this reason,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.060
this is the costliest.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.150
Is you doing stance,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.390
which you good.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.070
Who on the price said it is highest placement And the benefit is that if you are choosing

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.150
it for short time like if you need a server for food days,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.650
one month or short period,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.960
you can choose on the one instances,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.390
right?

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.620
There is no time coming when you don't on need to use it like for a particular period and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.780
you don't have to pay any advance payment.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.900
Also right.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.050
The arts which you use,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.550
you have to pay for that only.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.880
So I will tell you that when you can use on demining stances that situations the second

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.270
case is off reserve in stances.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.720
So if there is some time coming from like you know that the product is going to be run for

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.770
the longer time off period when you us I certainly know that what will be the time period

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.550
approximately.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.140
You can choose deserving stance and and why you can't do Because it will give you the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.700
benefit off 30 to 70% discount over the only mining stances.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.350
Right.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.690
So if you are certainly knows if you are no letter,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:15.610
a product is going to run for on our or on yellow for six months like this you can use when

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.950
you can go for the seven stances right,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.600
there is a commitment in more Win this.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.140
You are insuring that you will use three or six months that in stars or one year or three

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.690
years and you pay for that,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.130
right?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.300
So there are multiple options like you can do no payment option,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.670
but you're just deserving that will be on higher price were inside.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.200
If you want,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.040
you can do partial a friend,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.430
so you be the partial amount and the rest amount You will pay in months,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.510
so you will get more discount and you can pay all a friend amount in it.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.870
Waas that yearly kos,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.480
I can say.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.590
And if you do ah,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.250
payment do payment in advance,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.450
you will get a very big discount.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.330
Like as I said,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.570
30 to 70%.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.880
So it can we go to 50 to 70% how to purchase this.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.180
So the seven stance is very easy to purchase.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.950
Just you decided which in stance type you want launch at the same kind of stance and go toe

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.620
the seven stances.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.950
Just purchase it there.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.980
It will get automatically applied on your normal instance.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.670
But you need to ensure that you are using the same configuration which you purchasing these

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.280
Evanston's.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.190
So I will show you that in level.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.250
So just in a few seconds we are going over there,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.450
Then the third corps part could be sporting stances.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.370
It is very good solution for the chief instances.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.660
If you want,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.550
your high capacities are us like we're CPU.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.960
Performance is too much.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.450
I and,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.850
uh,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.240
high performers service.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.540
You can go for a sport instances,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.650
but there is a limit.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.900
Very.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.330
You had to use it because there is a big press.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.390
You put a bid for the institute stance,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.320
and if you're amount is coming into bid,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.080
then you will get that issue to instance right.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.370
If your bid price goes high.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.770
If the universe is sitting stance bid price goes high.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.850
AWS will automatically pulled and stands from you.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.680
Okay,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.690
so I am the duration which you get.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.720
It is approximately for few US took and can go toe for few days.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.640
But it is not no longer supported.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.550
Like for a long time products it is not a good option.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.800
But if you need step a city,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.470
you can go for export instances,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:48.140
it will provide you with a very high capacity service which normally used to get very high

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.720
charge.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.780
You will get in a spot instances on the low cost and what you can do.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.400
The one solution could be that you can export your letter to as three as to leave rockets.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.830
And you can use this.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.260
There were four capacity only so many companies are used for data analysis for a still in

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:11.960
stances so many companies are using for data analysis and there or like where they have to

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.410
do lords off calculations.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:20.860
They use this service for 13 peered and the data get process into as Terry buckets.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:29.050
So this is something where exported stances are using by a companies these days and

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.110
dedicated the senses as we're discussing this.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.000
Ah,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.990
starting that it is whenever you launch a star said There are two types of instances shared

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.380
and starts are relegated.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.620
You can choose share in shared instances.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.330
You will.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.080
The CPU and memory will be shared by other clients and if it is dedicated to you,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.530
it will not be shared of it.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.110
Other clients and all the CPUs and memory,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.920
which is a lot of a located to you.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.690
It will remain with you,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.150
which means you will get better performance.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:05.180
So let's quickly go to the console and I assure you how you can proceed for the buying off

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.390
these service.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:12.140
So I'm into mice console and if you go there,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.860
you can too.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.210
Easy to stances.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.210
And if you want to go for on demand,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:25.530
assassins on the mind and senses are useful were you are uncertain about the time Peter,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.900
like you don't know that how many days you required and like,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.710
you know that if say,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:38.740
like use need force there waas in a year completely but due in sometime,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.850
like for few days,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.140
yours mutilation goes high and you need some additional service.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.340
So for the additional service you can use on the mind and for the longer period you know

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.860
that force that was required?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.790
No,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.580
permanently.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.200
You can use the seventh chances and say you need to serve us.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.950
Additionally,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.500
for a couple of days in a month,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.750
you can use on the minor stances.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:08.750
So this could be a scenario where you can use on the minus answers if you know that the U.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.360
S.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.800
So what is going to use for a long time?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.010
You should use it is seven stances and for detailed analysis,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:22.330
part things you can go for the sport instances to guard their stances,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.130
you simply to stance.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.620
Goto is Ito and go to a stance.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.350
If you choose any settler hair,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.110
why and stand step,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.370
you will get on the minus terms.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.870
Okay,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.190
so this will be your on demand the stars.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:47.950
So here you can choose any server and you can launch any stance.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:54.040
So suppose you choose 22 dot x large right and you lost the server.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.150
So this will be on demon.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.430
It starts.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.210
But suppose you are Lord,

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.930
you have learned this server and this is running you still have the option to use the

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.980
servant stances.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.030
What you need to do.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.850
You have to go to the seven Stance.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.500
Then you need to click on purchasers of stance,

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.150
and then you can choose your server.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.170
Like if you have used Land X,

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.760
then you can simply to the land.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.920
It's their your trip to the same carrots capacity,

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.990
like if you choose landings with squares over,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.580
then here to choose landings with the square.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.680
If your toes window simple,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.190
you should choose windows should windows with the schools are also you have to choose that

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.570
option.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.930
So whatever the only one in stance is going on,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.790
you need to to same platform.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.600
Then here.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.700
Do you need to choose the instance types.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.050
So I have use.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.460
Do you do that last?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.920
So I have to use to talk about lies only.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.530
Did you not excellent?

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.340
If I use on on the mind,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.450
I have to do this one.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.280
Only then I can,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.420
too,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.020
with my payment option.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.790
Like if I want to pay all up front on,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:08.390
you can choose your tenancy so default or dedicated and you can choose your terms.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.160
Also played for 12 months and you can send blue search.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.420
So here you can see that what will be your total cost the ice Choose all of friends So I

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.510
have to pay in advance all different place.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:30.440
So it will be basically on cheaper site if I compare with on D minus stances place And if I

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.380
use if I purchased this So my period really start from now onwards whenever I purchased

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.300
this and if I have running any on the minor starts off same category or same platform,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.960
it will automatically get applied on my own Dumanis starts.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:52.260
So I hope now you go to the point that this are nor the separate point.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.040
This is just a building which get applied over on the mining stances you're doing.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.870
Got any separate there for the seven stances?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.590
You know,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.420
departures,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.670
but the sport request.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.290
You can do it by this sport.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:14.030
Request in stand straight and here you can simply choose requests.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.150
Porter stances.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:22.290
You can check the price history from here and you can get some options like the quest.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.320
If you want to reserve for particular duration like 1 to 6 us,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.540
you can choose that.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.460
So some other options you can get.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.220
You simply have to to the stance Kevin sitting on,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.140
but often stands.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.010
Then you have to to the platform.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:45.090
Then you have to to the server type and other days like your bidding price and on the

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.390
things you can simply poor there on.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.010
After that,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:55.990
you can simply like here you can put your pricing so whatever the place you want to see if

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.450
you want to check the pricing still,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.760
you can compare it with this and you can simply launch.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.210
You're exporting chances.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.270
So,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:03.550
guys,

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.690
I hope you understood now that how you can launch just us sport result and on the minor

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.970
stance if you oneto launcher dedicated,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.350
dedicated a stance.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.550
You can also do that.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.460
Why are when At the time of choosing that stance,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.700
you can choose here.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.410
I assure you that option if you want to choose dedicated in stance,

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.420
so here at the time off launching urine stance.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.300
You can choose your dedicated in stance here.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.730
If you go next here,

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.280
you can choose your tendency.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.650
It could be shared or it could be a dedicated.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:48.940
So I hope now you get that clarity that what stands type you can use in which case is if

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.660
you're going for longer term useful.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.430
These other times,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.160
if you are using for short term Ah,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.450
very were uncertain about the period.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.200
Go for undermining stances.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:05.190
And if you just need for big Kepa 30 servers for relative price go for sported stances

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.610
which are cheapest cutting.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.650
So I hope this video will remain useful for you.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.650
If you have any questions,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.950
