00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.720
Hello is so welcome to this video.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.500
In this video we will going to learn how we can back up and silver.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.910
So till now we have none.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.800
How we can create an EC2 servers,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.170
how we can create virtual servers in AWS.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.655
But it is also important to take backup of your servers and do the backup.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.410
And these two are for us,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.085
our debt is a town which is called a snapshot.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:33.020
So every time remember that whenever we speak about earned at a,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.675
we need to take backup in AWS.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.150
That means we need to create a snapshot.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.235
And we are talking about snapshots.

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:43.685
This is very important to know that Tom of snapshots,

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.440
every value will find,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.200
like if you are creating RDS database data

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.800
also you will find that we need to create snapshots.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.890
Wherever you go in the backup lumps,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.585
we will use a snapshot.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.350
So there are two ways basically.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.940
Create backup.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.975
One is via creating backups of volumes.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:10.235
So as we know that all AWS servers have their stories,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.320
are tasked with it and store it.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.815
This got attach with types of volumes.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:21.695
And we can create a snapshot of that volume.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:25.040
So whenever we create a snapshot of that volume,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.115
it gets stored in the section of snapshots.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:35.345
Remember, it is important to note that all snapshots get stored in S3.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.855
So all snapshotting which you create, it will be,

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:47.360
it will get stored in S3 and the backup will be implemented by environmental policy.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.970
They will use incremental policy to backup.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.940
So whatever the new changes happening in your volumes,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.310
they will get back it up.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.755
Ys snapshots.

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.340
So one way is you can create backups of your volumes.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.145
You can choose which volume we want to back up,

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:07.340
and then you can manage them in snapshots.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.600
And then what mattered is that you can create an AMI of cyber,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.740
an image of ourselves,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.180
of what it ultimately in this behind the scenes it will do,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.865
it will create a snapshot for you.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:25.760
So whatever the sidebar you are choosing for creating EMC EMI,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.455
once you create am I,

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:30.020
it will create a template for you,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.760
customize template for you.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.495
And in that backup in the back-end, it will create.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:42.125
It's an app stores for you and for the ones which are in that data set.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:46.800
So let's see it particularly how it will happen.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.840
Once you login into your console.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
Just go to EC2 section.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.570
Go to your running instance.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.010
Had a point. I need to note that the server is one.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.275
And this is the volume,

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:20.195
which is our test to it.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.520
So let's see what is in the volume.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.270
So what I can see here that there is one volume created

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.755
and this is attached to web server due to one.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.070
So that's how I can figure it out.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.300
Net.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.180
Which volume is related to itself.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.730
Now, if I want to take backup of the several,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.700
what I need to do, what do actions.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.765
And involved in action,

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:57.020
you can find multiple options related to volumes.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.320
Like if you want to modify your volume size, you can do that.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.150
If you want to modify your size 2,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.790
suppose higher size, you can do that.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.560
You can definitely go for decrementing size,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.585
but you can go for an agreement in size.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:12.800
So here is the option.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.765
You can increase your size.

00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:17.750
You want to do tasks this volume, you can do that.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.090
If it is not getting detach easily,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.685
you can force detach and head is the option.

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:26.180
Create a snapshot. And in tags

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.215
you can put the important for mission-related bu, this volume.

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:33.480
So if I go to create a snapshot,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:44.060
it will ask me the name of my backup copy.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.610
I'll put web server backup to the date that is 4 fifth,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:03.510
November 5th, LeBron 17. Like this.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.170
In this course.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.345
But it will start that process in the snapshots.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:27.930
Here you can see that it will start setting up the snapshot.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.180
And here you can see you have sort of a backup duties.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.225
One is getting greater roots snap for this.

00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:43.490
And right now it is in pending status is right now it is 3%.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.020
So it will take some time,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.980
approximately two to three minutes because it's just a new server and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.165
don't have much data. Is there.

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:56.210
So it will soon.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.200
Right now is 3%.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.690
But I think after total immunity should be ready.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:12.770
So let me fast forward it and I will be back once it the volume that ready. So I'm back.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.845
Took much time. It takes only one minute and now it's ready.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:22.100
So head you can see that you have to somehow get backed up.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.260
And in case now you have this volume,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.555
this production volume goes cut up.

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:30.245
You'll have another backup option.

00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:33.560
You can use your backup.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.295
So let's see some with some example so that we can check how we can these two.

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:44.135
So this is the part like how we can backup of a seven.

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:46.730
Now, if you want to restore this hour,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.770
what the action you need to do.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.880
So let's see.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.930
Let's try to figure it out.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.100
And I'll say this,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.650
this volume somehow goes corrupt.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:05.730
And what I will do, I name there.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.740
Our debt is very less downtime in AWS.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.600
Normally your volume will remain intact.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.070
But somehow you say that this volume and how now I can these two

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.735
are from the store or my phone, my snapshots.

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:31.490
So I say this is corrupted.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.600
What I need to do,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.820
I just need to detach this volume.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.475
Now it will say that because it is attached to root volume,

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:43.025
it will not allow me to detach.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:52.860
So what I do, but let me just put out my settlers and their shutdown status.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.430
And I scoured myself.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.115
And till the time you get a stop.

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:07.060
Let me create another volume from my snapshot. Now working fine.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.079
So I have one working back in Luckin Coffee here in the snapshots.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:13.645
And what I need to do that my backup,

00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:15.160
my volume got caught up,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.620
so I want to replace it with my working one.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.600
So I need to go on create volume option.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.620
Here I will choose,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:40.925
I will choose my volume type.

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:44.225
And 1 here we need to remember that we need to ensure that

00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:49.760
our liberty don't seem as of our EC2 server.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.190
So I need to check my availability join here for my current server.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.540
This is, this is in one.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.865
So I'll choose 1 eighth.

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:06.290
And now, while taking great volume,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.195
calculating the volume of this,

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:09.470
I know two twos.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.750
I believe we didn't want a and that's it.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.940
I just need to compute the volume.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.780
What did we do? Know that we start getting another one.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.460
So this was my corrupted one limb.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.800
I know my, another new volume has been created with the help of snapshot.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.760
I'll put it

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.990
said website.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.830
We're going to put her desk to

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.720
know I should be able to do it because I stopped our server.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.890
Hey, we need to wind down the device number 1.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.890
So here you can see that my boot volumes are available.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.685
Now, what I don't want to use corrupted or distort volume,

00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:26.390
and I'll,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.940
and I'll

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.760
put my device ID and magic.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:47.885
Here you can see this one with or against nash shots.

00:10:47.885 --> 00:10:53.250
Let me try to start the several known what your tab.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.875
You can see that the sun will go to earn starting now and then New Orleans.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.170
Working with this amazing point,

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.930
you need to focus that the availability George would be the same of the distort volume.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.200
And you should test it with the root chain would be

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.530
ways which it was attached with earlier.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.860
So I need to put it as deafness as D1.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.085
Once it got attached properly,

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:33.775
do is go to starting this ball working again.

00:11:33.775 --> 00:11:36.370
And here you can see if I go to volumes.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.905
Now my corrupted what stood out my gut up to a limb I am using maybe stood on.

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:43.285
Okay.

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.045
So this is the matter number one, pretty simple.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:49.720
Just in Polish steps you need to follow and you can make

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.700
your service backup copies and you can restore it whenever required.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.410
Now, there is another one,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.570
method Mode which might be used.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.595
You can see that it is not like sometimes you can use it as a backup,

00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:10.490
but the proper solution of picking up on his side,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.050
what is the volume method you

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.940
should create a snapshot so field volumes to take backup of your.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.840
So it was.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.850
But another method could it be that you can create an image for a server?

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.515
What does that worry you are running?

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:31.880
You can create an obese for them. It is very simple.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.915
We have seen in previous section also that how we can create an AMI,

00:12:35.915 --> 00:12:37.790
you just need to select your Savoir,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.670
go to Actions and click on amaze and click Create Image.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.350
You can use it.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.570
And what it will do basically,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.430
it will create an AMI for you.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.455
And in the back-end,

00:12:57.455 --> 00:13:02.060
it will create another snapshot for this volume.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.815
Once I do that,

00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:06.240
let's see how it's worth.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.395
Here you can see it is my old BMI,

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:16.925
It is the Northern New Moon.

00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:18.559
But if you go to the snapshots,

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:28.640
you can see that the snapshot is started to create and it is creating via AMI.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:36.200
Here you can see that I am a reference to and this will get created 01:00 AM.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.500
I will start creating here.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.450
So I know there's only one.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.895
Let's just wait for one or two minutes.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:48.530
And it will show you how to start included.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.630
So basically in the back-end,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.455
what is an actual art on what am I do?

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:59.219
It, it actually create a backup of your gut and volumes.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:08.550
We can see now this volume snapshot about graded and no EMI process should be started.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:23.075
When it is. You can see that my AMI also got creator now and it says web server backup.

00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:25.190
The AMA which we have created.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.780
The benefit of this,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.910
whenever you want to list all your sidebar,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.345
you just need to use this.

00:14:32.345 --> 00:14:34.920
Am I launch it?

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.970
And you just need to select the configuration of your server.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.440
And by default, we'll pick the volumes which is stored in

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.320
your backup snapshots and all the data which was I believe well in that cell,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.670
what at that point of time,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.725
when am I going to create it?

00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:57.995
It will get copied with this new cell.

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.595
So again, this is another pretty simple method,

00:15:01.595 --> 00:15:06.035
backup and we stood during virtual servers.

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:09.980
I hope you enjoyed this session and other couple of things.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.780
You know that if you want,

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.550
you can create this,

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.795
copy this AMI, do some other, another reason.

00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:20.720
So if you want to copy your this,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.670
am I to another destination.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.815
Another reason you can do that.

00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:29.660
However, there are other the otherwise there was no matter how much

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:35.315
am I gave us the capability to copy your data to another listen to.

00:15:35.315 --> 00:15:39.200
And similarly, if you go to volumes Also,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.015
you can copy or volumes.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:43.530
There is option to copy.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.395
There is no option, so there is no option for copying these volumes to another reason.

00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:54.380
But via AMI, you can create your,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.735
you can copy your data to another reason too.

00:15:56.735 --> 00:15:57.980
So this is the major difference.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.230
Basically, EMI only provide you the capability to copy your data to another reason.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.750
Otherwise there is no method to do that.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.510
How it, if you go two snapshots.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:15.870
Snapshots also date is when matter that the snapshot you go to Action and then copy.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.500
Let's simulate option, you will rotate.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.519
So BMIs and snapshots,

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:29.105
there are two methods from which you can copy your data to another reason,

00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:32.510
same, you can't do while loops.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.230
So I hope guys know This is clear that how you can

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.755
take backup and restore in for your service,

00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:41.735
for your EC2 servers.

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:44.045
And I hope you enjoyed this session.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.305
If you have any questions you can write to me in feedback section or in comment section.

00:16:48.305 --> 00:16:51.350
I will try to answer those questions quickly.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.475
So thanks.
