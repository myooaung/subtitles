00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.420
say that it works.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.130
That means that a part of absolute gold successfully stalled And there are some other

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.350
information also available in this.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.550

you need to put it into this fool.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.090
So you need to goto a stable folder than put the complete foot that side folder And why are

What does he in function?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.690
So if a copy,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.100
you can see what is out and again it is seen.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.870
Now let's go back to server here.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.410
You're going to see the Taiwanese.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.050
I can use this command really special space slash,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.980
forward slash and I can come in to do that.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.950
Lets you know what it means.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.350
So there is complete the folder architecture coming now,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.650
and I can see that there is where folder Which I seen there.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.190

I need to use the command v A.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.240
So he is their leader,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.680
which is which you can use to create a new fight.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.310
And I didn't.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.550
And distinct violence is if you look and if you use via action movie I did.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.830
We ate and finally file is already and this it will lead the current file listing fight.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:40.050
Okay,
