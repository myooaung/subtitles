00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.495
Hey guys, So welcome to this video.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:08.340
In this video I'm going to talk about too, is an AppSource.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.640
Aws is national so many times and you might heard about a snapshot towns in AWS

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.250
and we will learn how we can use the snapshots in multiple things and how to use in EC2.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.050
Ec2 console.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.390
If you go there is a section EBS,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.110
Elastic NACA stories and you normally uses snapshots, right?

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.475
So this is, this is something which is called a snapshot.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:40.550
Okay?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.160
So what I'm going to do now,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.080
let's come to the practical part.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.980
This is an instance.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.620
And this one is, this is my server going on.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.350
And this is volume, right?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.840
So this stance has one disk. This one.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.870
And you know that this is attached to one limb.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.480
Correct? So if I go there,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.540
this ID is 1, 0, 4.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.400
If I go into volume,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.250
if I check 1 vw for and this volume is attest to this instance.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.795
Now what happens if my surrogate remove got corrupted?

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.810
So definitely I will loss my data.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.280
So we need a backup technology in AWS.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.150
So here this towns is snapshot come into

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.109
the picture and this is why we need the snapshots.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.624
So whenever we talk about backup and backup and AWS,

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.430
you can refer it is a snapshot.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.720
Same is with RDS also like if you are using RDS service in AWS,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.675
you will create a snapshot there too.

00:01:56.675 --> 00:02:03.020
So most of the times you will find that the snapshot is used in AWS for backup only.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.170
And with most of the services, right?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.320
It is not like that. It is used only in snap PC2.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.439
It is also using other services like RDS,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.410
elastic cache, and lot of others.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.960
So what is the difference between volume

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.885
and it's snapshots or what things you need to take care.

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:27.005
So volume is your Savoir disc,

00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.075
which is attached to current volume,

00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:31.130
and a snapshot is your backup.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.530
So suppose at this point of time I want to take backup of my current server.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.170
So what I can do that I can take I can create a snapshot from this volume.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.415
So my this disk backup will be created.

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:49.415
So what I have to do, I simply need to select this.

00:02:49.415 --> 00:02:52.740
And I have to click on Create Snapshot.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.275
And these snapshots can be used for these Tuition also.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:03:01.070
So let's see how to do it like backup.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.335
Thence. My website, CAL website. What is date?

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:12.725
0992019.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:18.470
You can add tag there at

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.445
tag name and whatever name you want to give, you can give there.

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:27.110
Okay.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.960
So where it is and my current beca will get ready.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.905
Okay?

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:36.725
So suppose my server got y1,

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.050
remove if it got corrupted,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.585
whatever it happens, I have no issue.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:44.720
I can take p stores from this server.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.720
How to do that? That is also very simple.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.379
So I will show you in a while What more thing I can do with this snapshot.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.175
So a snapshot is used for multiple things.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.050
So here, like it says,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.880
you can backup of your data of Amazon EBS volume to the Amazon S3.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.960
So these snapshot are used to store in S3 service, right?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.700
So Snapshot got used to store in S3 and S3 is an a and backup.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.980
You know that our three stories is quite cheap.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.175
So a snapshot backup will not be costly.

00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:24.830
Ebs volume, EBS storage is costly.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.900
But if you compare these,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.435
a snapshot will be keep in S3 stories.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.180
And S3 storage is quite cheap compared to EBS,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.895
so pricing is very low for snapshot.

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:38.090
One more thing like a snapshot site incremental backups.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.910
So it is not like that every time you take the full work-up,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.500
whatever the changes happen,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.710
it takes only those changes, right?

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.665
So this is a snapshot can be copied to another reason.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:54.320
So this is another good function of is an absolute.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.370
So you can copy what a snapshot two and the reason and you can create

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.080
volume from a snapshot and you can attach it to the server.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.090
That means you can ready a server from a snapshot to another reason, right?

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.350
Volumes you can't copy,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.615
but it's now force can be copied to other reason.

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:13.535
Same case with a MIT.

00:05:13.535 --> 00:05:18.470
Then you can copy and you can share a snapshot to interruption is also supported.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.880
You can create Amazon EBS snapshot. That is fine.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.180
You can delete, you can copy. That is fine.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.245
Ebs snapshot information out to view.

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:33.830
I will show you and sharing an Amazon EBS snapshot.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.465
You can share it with others.

00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:41.195
And you can also automate EBS snapshot via lifecycle policies.

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:50.855
So where in the lifecycle policies, here it is.

00:05:50.855 --> 00:05:53.930
So here is Lifecycle Manager where you can create

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.600
a snapshot backup policy and you can specify the lifecycle settings, right?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.550
So there is a separate video for this.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.575
You can go for this and you can check the snapshot policy.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:09.365
So my backup is ready now.

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:12.260
And if I want to restore, it is simple.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.680
I need to create another volume from this.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.270
Ok. And keep in mind that the volume should,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.265
whatever the volume I'm creating,

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:26.015
it should be in the same availability zone where your server is hosted.

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:28.910
Because I believe it is own datacenter.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.190
So if you put it in different data center,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.555
then definitely you will not be able to attach the greatest volume.

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:38.105
So keep the availability zone,

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:41.630
which is your EC2 instance level, right?

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.470
So let's see.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.145
So here is my instance and I can check my stance.

00:06:58.145 --> 00:06:59.705
It is in one beat.

00:06:59.705 --> 00:07:02.705
So if I'm current volume goes corrupt,

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:06.005
what I have to do, if I am restoring,

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:07.520
I have to put it into one.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.630
Be okay.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.775
If you want, you can encrypt us.

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:13.865
For that there is a default master key available,

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:15.290
so you can use that.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.480
Otherwise you can customize

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.745
your import keywords in different years and simply create volume.

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:25.160
Okay, I missed that if you want,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.520
you can give the name also.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.280
That is to restore volumes.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.995
So I say these total volume, right?

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:39.785
So what do you need to do it is you are corrupted volume like

00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:43.190
original one got corrupted so you just detach it.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.200
It is, if it is if it is root volume,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.810
you need to stop the server and then detach it

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.290
and then replace it with the newer know how to replace.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.980
Just attach it and choose your server with which you want to attach and attach it.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.105
You can also check with which partition it is allowed US,

00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:07.745
it is an asset, so it has dev slash x we deviate.

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.680
So attach it with symbol.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.000
Okay, so that will go this way.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.400
Snapshot you can use for these tuition purpose.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.725
That is awesome, right?

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:23.555
If you don't want to take everytime manual backup, use Lifecycle Manager.

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:26.430
So that will be also very easy.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.970
If you don't know or if you want to know more about life-cycle, Amanda,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.550
check the video in my playlist and you will,

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.140
or in course and you will find the details about it.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.335
Now.

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:44.570
If you want to share it,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.805
you can share it with other account.

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:51.335
So you can make it either public or you can share it with any particular account.

00:08:51.335 --> 00:08:54.230
And you can add the permissions accordingly.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:00.275
So you can find the account details and you can add a tax is simple.

00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:02.270
And you can, as I said,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.090
that snapshot, can we copy to another reason?

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.625
So you can easily copy to another reason.

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:12.245
If you want to copy the snapshot to some other reason, you can do that.

00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:15.650
And you can also encrypt that volume.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.149
What else? If you restore from a snapshot?

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:25.160
So the volume size will be the of the given size or even can be on the higher side,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.750
but can't be lower, right?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:32.089
So if I'm if I'm creating a volume,

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:36.050
so minimum size will be like if because it was off ten GeV,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.495
so it will be minimum ten dB if I reduce,

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.950
it is not possible.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.405
If I want to increase,

00:09:41.405 --> 00:09:43.530
ESI can do that.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.870
Okay, So I hope you get some good idea about snapshots.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.240
If you have any questions, please let me know.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.310
I will be happy to assist you.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.000
And if you don't have any questions,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.860
please feel free to move to next video.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.460
Thank you.
