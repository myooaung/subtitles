00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Hey,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.650
so hello,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.450
real lenders.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.880
You don't know.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.530
We have known.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.050
Like what?

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.860
Our legions.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.410
Water of Liberty Jones and water is locations in AWS.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.650
Now,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.560
today we are going to learn how we can launch our first word.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700
Your server in Nablus.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.260
So to live,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.430
we will learn like how we can launch our first planets over.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.610
There are multiple options available in in eight of Louis.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.120
Like you can use AWS.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.960
So do pseudo server.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960
I don't want to several aws redhead.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.650
That defense Lee was You can so you can use.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.460
So to do this first we need to log on into our console.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.710
So if you could consign the console,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.780
it will ask your user name and password.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.360
Just feel that use any passer and you will be on this screen.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.200
No,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.510
Just remember that if you want to launch your server,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.760
you need to go to conclude section.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.750
There will be one service easy toe that we need to use before that.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.850
We need to choose the one nearest reason or the reason in which you want to set up your

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.190
server.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.930
So I collected my nearest listen.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.450
It is a Shia Pacific movement and I would like to greet myself in this reason.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.940
Now let's get gone.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.990
Easy to Okay,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.740
So once you click on issue two,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.650
you will get this kind of screen.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:46.010
Now we will go to all this things hair you found in this console one way one.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.420
But in the start,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.790
just let's be family.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.500
Like how you can launch our server.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.240
And after that,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.780
in the next session,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.150
we will discuss about the other things which are labeled in this council.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.490
So click on launches stance that there are multiple options.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.110
Just make sure that you have selected your nearest reason.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.150
Then we need to click on Notre stunts.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.650
Once you click on this nonsense stance,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.830
you can see there are different servers Are templates available like this is provided by

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.040
Iran?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.950
Lose itself on here.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.700
You can see that in the Quaker start,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
you can find my deeper service provided by AWS,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.150
and you can choose any one of the service.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.410
Apart from this,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.630
there is my AM eyes.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.950
If you do todo any customize ever,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.550
you can use my am eyes.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.590
There is one option eight of this marketplace.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.550
So if you want to purchase some issue to in stance.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.050
What a particular service.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.060
So ah,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.380
number of developers are there in the market,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.730
and they have provided their customised template.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.070
You need toe paid just for that instance,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.350
or whatever the service you are using.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.130
Ah,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.460
for parable basis.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.340
So marketplace is a very good place if you are looking for some customers application and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.630
this is community and my eyes were Community have provides deals customized the customers

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.980
developed families.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.200
So let's start.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.490
Let's go to a quick start,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.240
and this is the first very good place to use your you create yourself,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.330
set up your 1st 7 So here you can see that you can find Amazing Landing's A missile.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.930
Aris's a wonderfully am I because it contains already AWS Command line does fight on we

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.860
Paul and Jiao languages.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.340
There are other repositories.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.590
Also,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.190
every label that is Dakar PH.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.400
With my sequel posted.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.560
These so you don't need to install doom on those repositories are those soft US men Apart

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.080
from this,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.800
all the other flavors which are available in the market with the latest version are really

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.550
well in this pamphlets.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.060
Who have you considered it is Red line next 7.4 wasn't is available so that Sybil is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.540
available.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.590
So this is about 12 hours and is available.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.150
Want to let this sweater 16 is available?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.110
It also has Microsoft serve us right now.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.490
Microsoft Windows Server 2016 going on.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.880
So it has that too.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.040
And in 2016 also,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.690
there are different type of flavors.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.800
Like if you want to go with minimum configuration,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.340
you can choose No,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.540
no.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.830
In addition,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.850
if you want a school,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.040
several express with you,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.920
you can go for the schools that work express wagon.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.680
If you want escorts,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.600
have a repetition.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.500
You can go with this If you want escorts ever standard you come to this witness sense.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.750
So Aniston's who as per your requirements,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.690
you can choose and there are a number off leaves.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.670
So in this instance,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.480
we can use for testing purpose.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.680
We can see that we just notice one thing also,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.610
that if you're using and free dirt just you does and stances which are available in their

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.110
free time.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.250
So here we can see that the yeast this one to survive this every level under fleeter.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.780
So I'll do this one.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.580
Then there are different kinds of confusion of a level.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.210
So we were discussing in detail in next sessions.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.040
But right now for just over you and four to make the Sufi family,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.160
I will describe what what are this tapes?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.000
So I know you do is basically general purpose and that purpose machines come into T two and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.820
for these categories are basically for general purpose to studio and,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.550
um for our two generation and they provide different capacity Like if you go 42 micro,

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.290
it will provide you one CPU once,

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.600
ever and hard.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.760
This will be devious.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.050
We will discuss a bs also in accessions.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.390
Then you can choose your configuration according to your requirement and they will be

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.040
chargeable as Aziz.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.350
Their confusion goes high.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.770
That sizable amount We were so close.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.880
So I know you can see that you can to studio boto x large.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.860
It contains X abuse and 32 TV them and obviously then there are in fort particularly in

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.640
this you confound much has capacity.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.660
Oh,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.910
who collect this one?

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.500
You can use this im four capacity and here you can see that it can go up to 64 processor

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.710
and do 50 60 billion.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.980
So it provide you much our capacity.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.590
And it also provided 25 gigabyte network and the maximum and you can two different

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.630
confusion Aspirin.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.990
Apart from this,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.960
if you are looking for computer optimized Ah,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.840
your computing compute optimize servers only.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.530
So you can too.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.740
This one c $4 uh,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.870
computer up to my C four section and then see for donation.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.090
Who found are there will be processor much me at the hiring and Granville were lower so

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.800
that processing power off this service will be very high.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.580
So here you you can see that you can find 36 abuse in an hour and 60 here you go to 16 JB

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.570
and there is 30 started with them there.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.420
Apart from this,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.800
there are memory optimized.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.770
Where you find higher memory are there and on.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.960
There will be stories optimized where schools will be at the higher end and you will get

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.870
the better quality off stories which can take higher input.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.210
I know.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:42.440
So I to stick to the micro,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.650
right?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.010
No,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.850
I like lickle nest.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.380
Here.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.330
You define a few simple option like Hominy stance.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.770
You want to come here so I am happy with right now Understands But you can launch Esper

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.110
your requirement multiple instances to with the same configuration.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:07.850
Then I long we leave the costs Post stances Azaz unchecked because I want simply on divine

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.480
stances.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.370
Then there is network submit or to assign eyepiece a network.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.520
Right now AWS provides by default our network to us.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.460
So we will use the AWS providing network on in future living in the future.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.550
Next sessions we will learn about BBC and there we will create your own network image.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.790
Right now,

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.080
in this network,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.460
there are two sub nurse available.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:45.030
I'll choose one beat for this point off time and I can see that there are 4090.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.350
Vince,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:51.750
I pair This is available so I can use or I conclude right now 4091 service in this range

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:57.670
order signed public I p because I want to configure it the server from Internet.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:06.470
So I will like to use auto sign public eye beef food enabled then by before there is no I

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.700
am will need to define So I'm happy with none.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.660
Shut down behavior what it will do Money will shut down when the pelican shut down,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.030
it stopped or terminate.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.510
So I'm happy with the stop option.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.650
If you could contaminate,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.070
it will terminate your machine.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.890
Or basically,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.850
it will destroy your machine completely.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:32.020
And you're all data will be lost and a neighbor termination protection.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.620
It is also important thing,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.230
like if you want to enable your damnation protection,

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.150
you can do that.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.310
Definition production means that if you really contaminate,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.000
it will not allow you to turn it until or unless human really.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:55.160
And I'm happy with the monitor and the four monitoring so it is for them over possible.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.680
I'm happy with the four monitoring.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.260
Then there are two delancy options.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.700
One is called Shared,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.760
one is called Dedicated.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.110
Shared is whenever you're sort of a run from our shared heart of instances.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.490
This is competitively priced will be cheaper for this instance,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.990
and if you will use delegated,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.110
the price will be at the higher If you are using.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:23.850
Shared instances are your CPU and RAM basically can be shared with other clients,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:31.800
so it didn't last year more than if the the pool is having Fortius abuse and flew processor

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.800
.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.960
It can be used with some other commands as well In the dedicated Whatever the capacity is

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.010
allocated to you,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.130
it is only dedicated to you.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.730
However,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.940
if it is not I 1,000,000 use a still day is provided.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.360
But that is not in the case Off sheer.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.000
Then you will go with the default.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.330
Other options If you want to add another I p you can add another I p from network

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.740
interfaces on.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:05.220
We are good to go to next option Here.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.690
You can find that if you want toe add stories.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.380
So this is your disk and head.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.200
It is very simple toe adverse stories.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.950
Whatever the disk you want to,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.270
Eddie,

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.470
you just simply need new volume.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:25.750
So suppose right now with a little you will get a TV off stories and if you want,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.650
you can add another volume and you can define your size.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:35.550
Somebody want toe change your current size also so you can change the size.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.990
Right now,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.450
there are three beautiful volume disk available in it of Louis.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:48.060
It is normally known a general possess city.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.660
It is used for normal production.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.260
If you are,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.380
if you need higher input and output,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.680
you can use province and I Oh,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.850
Piers And you can define your eye opus if you require.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:04.220
And third is magnetic where the input and output capacity is quite low and we will not

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.110
support it on We will not services to use this.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.890
So I'll go with right now general,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.860
populous city And we're good to go with the next option.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.020
I choose by default a TV we just sufficient for me at this point of time.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.530
Then there is the option off checks.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.320
So if you want to enable or if you want to give some information for your servers,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.670
you should use texts.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.540
There is very one common Ted,

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.150
If you want to give your server and name,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.350
you can do it.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.750
This one.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.210
So here you can feed and give your important information.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:52.570
Like I say that 1st 1 to server and I give another tag like my company S O.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.430
I give some company name and whatever the complaint,

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.950
if you want to give for example,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.810
you can do oneto location,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.550
whatever that tax you want to give.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.550
Their tax will be useful like when there will be number off servers.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:11.250
It will provide you the required information and it is got quite healthy.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:20.370
So I to this information and I click on this here the another interesting option comes

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.470
which is called Security.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.690
So here you can see that a security group is a set off firewall rules that control the

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.980
traffic off here in stunts.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:32.360
So security really sure that what traffics can come to your in stones by default,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.780
all the involved pores are blocked and security,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.040
this is important question.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.070
For example,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.100
if you are so many times,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.130
you can come to know that too a white afford,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.340
uh,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.120
which you know which port is allowed.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.010
Insecurity girl.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:53.740
And the answer is that bite afford All the ports are locked in for inbound traffic

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.040
insecurity on the space.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.290
You can add rules to allow specific traffic toe reach you on stars.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.950
For example,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.110
if you want to set up a Web server and around on a traffic to reach you and stars add ruled

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.150
that allow underscored access to Esther depend on us to do people.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.280
So what?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.360
I mean that you need to create your own rules if you want.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.650
Oh,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.750
hello.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:22.770
Any service or any traffic which can reach able to your server so I know what I do that I

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.470
give it.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.450
I'm very even named like Want to sever rules?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.180
I use.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.690
Give some description.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:37.310
I think this description is fine for me to So I You seem Andi,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.480
I can mention there that pulls one.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.330
Will it be an asset for connecting?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:52.320
I'll use these fours as such by the four port and it is available on 22 and I click on add

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.660
Rule.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:59.900
And then other reports are label Whatever the popular pours you need normally is available

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.650
in deception.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:06.000
If you want STD before dusk It appears I'm whatever the poor squatter,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.600
the common pools they had available in this section.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.890
Or if you want to customize your old you can choose custom,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.370
PCP or custom repeal.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.640
So I choose here Custom TCP rule If you want a world traffic,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.350
you can't use old recipe If you want to allow old UDP,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.010
you can do that.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.850
I choose custom A stick to be pulled here.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.250
Andi,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.300
This one this simple.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.000
This says that the distance,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.840
the report and its port number 30 on what is my source?

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.880
I So this is important.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.950
Four saipi Right now,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.970
we choose custom,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.060
and I put Gerard erode our dinner Giorgio's last year,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.520
which means that from any source,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.200
this server can be connected.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.350
Why destitute people?

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.720
I same is applied for a success port in this case.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.370
What If you want to define your any particular network names like your office network or

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.890
your company or collection network,

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.860
you can get to that one.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.360
Then you choose anywhere.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.900
Anywhere is the same thing anywhere.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.530
In this case,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.940
there toe any from many sources can approach here.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.660
If you want to,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.560
is to pacify your customers network.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.540
You can choose custom,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.250
and if we want to give you a source,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.040
I p that is my I p.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.050
You control this one,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.490
but the problem is that my dynamic address is normally used to get changed.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:31.500
So I would like would not like to prefer to use my But if you're having any source,

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.740
if you have any server which has a static I p,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:41.440
you can definitely trust my Then after giving this valuable information,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.290
you just need to click on review and this review,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.820
you know,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.880
information that it is required like the several confusion chooses right,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:55.220
That's a good reporting to this right on stories option are enough for you.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.830
If you want you the stories,

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.270
we want to modify it.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.760
You can change it right now at this point of time.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.350
And here is your tests.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.030
So we're good to launch our first planets over there.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.620
This 1st 1 to worsen and I quicken loans.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.020
And here the another interesting option.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.350
Come here.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.020
I choose Good it in.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.760
You keep here so deep.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.220
It is what a keeper consist off a publicly that AWS is stored and the private key for that

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.370
usedto so public it will be stored in eight of Lewis and private key file will be with you

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.610
whether they allow you to connect to your stance securely.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:40.820
And for we lose a my private key is required to obtain the password usedto loving into

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.850
stunts.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.670
So if you are having window summer,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:50.660
you can this big ship your passport phone this keep cheerful or line except my private key

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.770
allow you to securely s ascension to you the stance so they could see in coming.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.290
Ah,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:03.130
few minutes how we will connect ourselves with issues with lowered with land.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.660
It's busy.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.700
I'll give it to some name eso I say it is my first.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.000
We're goingto server.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.210
You going down?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.630
It was this file at some safe place.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.700
I'll put it in dark.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.070
Stop.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:29.370
I need to connect it with good windows machine So we would require toe pool also to connect

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:29.370
.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:37.770
This one is called Booty and another is called repeating 12 stars in the area.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.450
Good to go.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.510
We can check over instances.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.800
Okay,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.060
guys,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.860
you can see that my first name is their first woman to serve.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.280
What it say's my stance.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.780
I'd instances the unique one on my son's type is too to does micro.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.470
My region is one B on my status doesn't spending right now.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.640
It is not yet created.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.850
So it will take some time and definitely it will get ready.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.430
This?

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.930
Yes,

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:13.880
I can also You can go this options and you can see that you can find out You are viewing

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.500
more rules so you can check whatever the pores you open stance The student data are running

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:26.670
your estan Saudi on And you are a my which am I in the back?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:33.140
And it used you Keep your name All such relevant information you can find here.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.420
What is your root device?

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.690
And what is your brother device?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:42.320
Even find out you're publicly in his name on your public I p this I p you can use to

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.550
connect it by Internet because right now it is in tow.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.600
It is the north into the fourth somewhere.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.080
And we have assignment public i p So definitely we can convert the servant.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.180
And this is your private.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:04.340
The innocent private ap you can connect on the other side was with help off every day,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:04.850
please.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.740
So I know my services in the running status on ST us.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.720
Check is initializing right now,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.640
there are two students.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640
Check basically which say's systems for district on a Sanskrit.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.520
If those statistical failure you are good to collect,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.040
you settle.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.520
So what is systems to district?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.050
Let's have a look here.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:33.260
These checks monitor that AWS system required to youth and stance and ensure they are

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.190
functioning properly.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.030
So what?

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:40.940
This basically monitor the AWS system that it only system is for working fine,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:47.170
which is required to use this instance So it checked basically that whatever the aid of the

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.110
system is required,

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.250
tocar running the server to run the server are fucking friend.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.080
So if this tech is fine,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.830
we are good to go then another is these checks monitor your software and network

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.550
configuration for this instance.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.900
In instances,

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.450
straight attacked.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.940
Basically,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:10.780
we used to monitor that your software and network configuration at Papa and the average

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:10.990
even.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.120
So,

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.410
let's wait for this on.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:15.940
Meanwhile,

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.040
we can look into it wanting section A modern exception is quite interesting.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.960
I know you can see that you can check last two weeks of street from this obsession.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:34.600
So if you have launch any so I didn't want it in section you will find some investing

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.400
sections here like you could check your CPU regulation.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.880
How your servers running up to from last are to last two weeks.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:53.540
You can want it as a performance where you can check like CPU relation.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.850
Discreet disagreed.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.210
Operation What?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.530
That's true.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.350
This is going on.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.900
Describe this network in there are more people.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.380
My text you can use to monitor yourself that is quite healthy options.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:20.530
And there is there text which you have you so no,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:20.940
no,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.440
You can see that in within 5 to 10 minutes.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.610
Yourself got ready.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.260
And we are good to collect this because I'm using a window machine.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.320
So I used this public.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.230
I appeared as our public DNS name,

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.140
and I need Putih to connect the self.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.390
So let's see how we can connect it with windows on in next session.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.990
Or we can see that how we connect the server to from Linus Systems.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.050
Just copy this.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:23:04.000
So let's copy the settlers and try to connect this one.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.490
There are two tool I need for this.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.150
What a and put region.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:14.690
So put the Janey's air tool you can find out well,

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.340
would be section putting.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.880
