X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Well,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.460
guys,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.500
welcome to this video.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.470
So we have now located our food at account,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.220
and we should usually be able to log into there to come like so once in logging into debt.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.750
A cone,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.220
nothing.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.910
Come That how we should start to work and how we can pass the services offered with which

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.270
there which Lewis is providing.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.250
So,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.200
like they're on a few things we can do like we can start.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.650
Ah,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.430
we can launch a certain what we can concert up about you also what we can check ah stories

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.010
house to results outward,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.850
sign their disk and also stinks.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.780
You can create every dose of what you conclude airline acceptable or even you can host of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.180
upside also which really learn in the next sections,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.600
the coming sections.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.010
But point is,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.030
before that we shouldn't need to know a few things which are very important to actually

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.720
work and it always consult.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.900
So once you're logging into this,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.320
you will find first off,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.550
all in the right side,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.690
top corner regions and these are the reasons.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.270
Basically,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.090
this is called aws regions and by leaders Me,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.820
I what?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.010
I mean that the areas were eight of us is providing their services where they have hosted

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.120
their data centers.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.440
What actually have done like,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.750
if we are talking about infra part off a tub?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.130
Lewis,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.040
what they have done,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.890
they have set up their data centers in different regions.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.380
Like in the US There are approximately five reasons you can see on,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.210
but there is one South America,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.200
sixth reason.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.460
Six citizen,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.370
basically total in the U.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.490
S and Canada side.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.170
You can find out till reasons are e in you and five reasons are in issue specific issue

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.920
specific ideas.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.490
So what happened there?

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.820
Suppose you're living in the U.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.150
S.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.340
So you shouldn't usually try to select to your reason which is near to you nearest to you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.010
because you will get the less latency due to death.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.120
Little by little NC.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.530
I mean that to when we connect over server,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.760
how much time it will take.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.560
So I suppose it's taking to second or 30 seconds.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.940
If you his own very far remote location,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.370
it might take some more time,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.670
so we should try to select our nearest reason after that,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.640
in every reason what they have done,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.740
they have set up one of the few available the doors and you can consider everybody.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.090
Jones is equal to one data centre,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.050
so every available the dual is a separate.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.950
Logical data centers were all the things like Power Network.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280
All things are isolated from each other.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.270
So if we are hosting 171 of Liberty June,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.980
it is total is distinguished from other heavily with the Joan.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.470
And basically we can say that if we have my people available,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.270
the Jones we are hosting over services and my people data centers.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.470
I have great Evan presentation.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.230
Ah,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.590
small.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.240
It is a very small presentation toe.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.050
Just clarify what could with things,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.500
and I already shown you like how it will appear in AWS console.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.350
So let's have a look on this presentation toe.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.540
So there is a darkness reasons and then points to reduce their dollars latency in your

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.090
application,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.550
Mortimer's and rep service,

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.380
or for a reasonable and point to make your request.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.370
So for every request,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.790
like if you are creating a server,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.930
if you are setting up a service,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.850
you will find some you are,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.470
which is called an point you are,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.780
and it is a entry point for a Web service.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.810
So every time when you log in or when you have to connect so that subways you need to use

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.590
this endpoint.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.330
It could be idea server.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.880
It could be a server.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.940
It could be a lasting wind Stock service,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.900
and some like this some services such as I am,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.070
but after brutally,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.080
they don't support below reasons they are basically,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.250
whatever you do there,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.730
same for all listeners on there.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.870
Those things will be available in all regions,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.650
whatever the service you are creating,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.770
like suppose you are hosting or don't win in about 2 to 3 service.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.140
Also,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.650
because you have created when I can't,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.550
that will be available on all reasons.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.950
But if you are setting up a server,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.150
that is the reason with service.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.020
So if you are creating a server in North Virginia,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.220
then that several will be available only in North Religion on North Virginia.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.300
Reason Northern.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.830
Other reason.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:12.230
So we have check way have already have a good look on region and by reasons as I said you

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.610
that we can understand that where does AWS has set up their AWS architectures or their data

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.200
centers,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.870
right?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.250
No,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.810
in every reason what they have done.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.370
They have set up different of liberty jewels and one everybody.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.110
Jones is it called one data centers and what they have done that in every reason they have

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.400
set up at least two data centers or two of individuals.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.020
The benefit will be like If you want toe,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:49.690
use your services with the Are that data olic the adjusted for disaster recovery purpose?

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.450
You should use multiple Evelyn regions.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.690
So if you're one ever lived,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.500
the June or one data centre goes down us.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.720
And this will not be impacted,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.390
and it will get run from other available the job or other data centers.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.110
At least there are two everybody doing at each season,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.610
and there could be more than two of Liberty Jones.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.090
Also,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.550
in few reasons,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.290
like in the U.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.560
S.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.070
There's providing number off regions like three or four or five lesions in different

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.590
regions.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.650
They're providing different availability,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.550
does multiple level,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.060
it really does.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.300
They're providing in the reason through,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.750
if you see there are total on 44 WD Don's were 16 geographical reason,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.090
and they have to ah,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.460
they have planning like 4 17 more level of religions and six more leases in near future.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.330
So maybe these things you know,

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.020
that God time.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.250
But I got change,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.790
and maybe when you are reading this course,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.120
they might be added food.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.350
More reasons that all color,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.450
cloud and fry is built around reasons and everybody does.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.040
As I said,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.090
a reason is a physical location in the world.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.290
Well,

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.730
we have multiple level regions.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.580
Every regions consist of one or more discrete data centers,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.810
each with rendering power,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.450
networking and connectivity,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.620
house and separate facilities.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:20.210
These up of Liberty Jones offer you that offer the ability to operate production of

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.680
application and databases,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:30.270
which are more highly available and $4 apart from this,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.470
you can see here like if you are setting up a reason.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.500
If you select any of these and there could be multiple availability zones like this and

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.570
whatever the service you are using,

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.100
like if you are launching a several,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.300
you have to launch that.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:54.450
So in one available the job a server could be apart off one of individual and similar case

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.720
with other services like RTs or dynamodb.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.730
Whatever you are doing,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:05.160
you we have to select one of liberty to third.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.000
There is one Another important part.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.420
Come which is called at location and it is basically for website service.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.770
Ah,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.670
as you know,

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.920
that AWS is also providing AWS website hosting.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.520
And there could be one case like you can understand.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.390
I have one example there like supposed it is us and suppose it is Australia.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:32.950
And if Australia if there is one of that site who stood in US reason and there is a user

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:40.060
which need toe access that website from Australia location So if you can check the route

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.300
could be very Landy.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:48.610
It has to go like this on a if you are supposed this is South America.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.860
And if somebody is connecting from South America to that reason,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:00.900
they will definitely surely will connect faster than from the user compared to Australia.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.040
So that comes basically the latency part.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.550
And to reduce this problem that every user get to should be ableto connect.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.210
There were side with fast response what they have preferred.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.020
They have set up one education,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.380
multiple edge locations within different regions.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.250
So what is the benefit like if you are hosting outside your website,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.370
data will get cash in tow as locations.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.920
So what happened?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:38.350
Actually that whatever that date eyes hosted in West site whenever any user make a request

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.350
.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.230
Any reason to any website?

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.390
If that that Web site is hosted in Cloudfront Cloudfront is the self service,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:54.310
which is AWS is providing to its user and which take that one days off edge locations and

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.150
used in website hosting.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.400
So if you are a website is hosting on a cloudfront service,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:07.480
it will take and wonders off as locations and you're users will get benefit from educations

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.090
and well,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:15.610
they will be able to connect their website very fast quickly and with very low latency.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:25.550
The reason because what it will do that it will replicate it will whenever any request,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.770
suppose when user make a request from this west side which is hosted in us.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.740
Whatever the faucet question,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.270
who goes?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.950
The data will come and will get copied toe This education will get cash it.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.440
We'll get cast in tow this education and next time,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.850
whenever they use a request,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:51.410
the similar data it will again not goto that us Lucas and rather than it will goto their

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.360
nearest education on because that data is already cash.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.620
The user will get lower latency so it could with a problem with the first time.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:09.230
Like if they copy the data of the castor data first time they the user can experience Ah,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.210
high latency.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.160
But whenever the second request come,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.250
user will get very little evidence.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.040
So we will see these things,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.870
how it works.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:25.740
And in Cloudfront devil and there we considered how it actually works give you a fair idea

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.920
about education.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.210
Wiviott using this is a purpose.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.960
Office locations and AWS have set up a number of years locations right now,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.600
approximately 57 as locations are set up in different reason by AWS.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.490
Okay,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:50.270
so I think that these things available the Don's and point lesions and as locations is a

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.960
must low before you are logging into it of this consoling starting using these services.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.450
So just had a good idea about this and proceed for the next sections.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.090
Very well.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.890
Learn how we can set up here for supper in parabolas.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.230
Thank you guys.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.240
Thank you for watching this video.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.230
If you have any query,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.740
please let me know otherwise.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.510
Feel free to proceed to the next section.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.250
Thank you
