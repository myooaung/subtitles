WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
Let's now build together,

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:06.130
find user by criteria, specific business logic.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.970
So let's go on.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.520
There are constants class.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:21.460
Let's navigate to it and define a new value here.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.600
Or are silvered side API invocation.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.080
So public static, fine by great data of type string.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.995
And this should be computed from the constants.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:43.850
Users source plus search question mark.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.315
Criteria are equal.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:54.229
And we'll build this as part of the user service class.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.700
But for you to know,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.050
we need to add the criteria and also those search item.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.290
So let's move on.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.260
There are service class.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.560
And over here, we need to define

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.480
a new method, find by criteria.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.540
And this would receive both the right data and also the sorts tried them.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:44.325
Both of type any and return on absorber wall of any.

00:01:44.325 --> 00:01:46.415
None of this method.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:49.655
We just need to invoke the return.

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:59.195
This http.get constants fine by criteria

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:07.920
and will concatenate the criteria percent

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.360
searcher item equal and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.510
also the search item that we receive as pedometer.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:32.700
So in this way will actually invoke this brainbow fine by criteria API using this format.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.470
Now let's go on the Reserve Component type script file and define

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.880
some variables that we'll use as part of the fine by grade Data API business logic.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.140
The fourth one will be the view child element,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.790
so that we'll be able to interact with the modal dialog from

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.110
our HTML component inside our type script file.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.810
For the modal dialog will be called fine vibrate Data Model of type model directive.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.029
Let's also define informative message.

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:43.660
Fine by criterion for message of type string variable called criteria

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:54.040
and those so on called search item for the correct area array.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:03.285
So this will be composed of two values that we go compute our criteria based on.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.215
So this will contain the username,

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:10.940
firstName, lastName agent country.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.110
So please recall that springboard server side requires one of these values.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.570
To compute our criteria based on on the clear data.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.130
We clear this criteria and for message.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.300
And let's do the same thing for the criteria and the search item elements.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.640
Now we are ready to create the new method.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.080
And let's call it fine by criteria of type void.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:17.230
And we'll need to add the criteria element from

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:26.335
the HTML or site to the criteria value from the type script file.

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:33.470
So for this, since we will have a list in the HTML element,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.490
we need to use the HTML select element document that getElementByID,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.680
great area, that value.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.270
You will see later on the HTML side why we need to use this approach.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.829
Retrieved the criteria.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:08.900
Now we check if the user actually set up values for the criteria and for the search item.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.680
And if not, we need to inform it by setting the Find By Criteria in

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.200
for message with the already known mandatory fields error,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:27.020
message error and return.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:46.525
Now we need to set in place a special case for the criteria being set to age.

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:51.710
So if the criteria was

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.120
Set two H for the,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.640
for the invoking this method.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.870
And we don't have a number set for the search item.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.300
Well informed the user also that

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.795
he did not set the number for the age of valued value.

00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:17.795
And if everything worked well,

00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:21.560
will involve the user surface fine by great area.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.350
Using both a great data and search item.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:35.630
Do the Subscribe and

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:43.190
were received by US also field that we can iterate on.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.510
So the first thing is to clear the user, sorry.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.705
If you recall, the table in the UI.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:55.145
Iter is the username and clear it.

00:07:55.145 --> 00:07:57.770
And now we need to iterate over

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:04.880
all the possible multiple users that we might receive by invoking the fine,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.830
by grade their API and add each one of them under the user,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.960
sorry, using the push method.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.790
And of course we have filtered data now.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.410
And let's set the filter in place to true.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.400
In case of any errors.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:38.810
Will first check if error status is 404.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.290
And if so defined by great Dalian for message,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:59.300
let's set up a specific value for it under the constants class.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.530
So public start Digg.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.190
User not found four criteria

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.925
of type string.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:24.310
And no data found based on criteria should be the message.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.225
So going back to the script file,

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:31.675
will use this new value.

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.930
User not found four criteria or message.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:47.240
And if not, we'll just set the error.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.680
Now under the user component HTML as compute

00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:02.720
this dialogue for searching for users by criteria.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.070
So find users by grade

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:17.500
Thalia div,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.440
MDB model hashtag.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.110
Find by great Delia model needs to match.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.290
High speed variable that we set up in the viewer child element.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.270
For this dialogue.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.255
Tab, index minus one.

00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:48.860
Not all should be dialogue style overflow minus i

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:56.600
or outdoor area labeled

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.960
by Find by criteria

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:08.595
model area hidden, true.

00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:13.040
And on the o pond event.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:20.570
We will of course clear the data and existing data in the UI.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:31.789
Now div class modal dialog role document.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.280
Live less modal content.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.420
We're creating now the header.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.540
Let's make some space.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.154
For the header we need to set in place a button.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:05.755
Such as whenever we click on it.

00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:11.630
The Find By Criteria model will be closed.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.749
Area labeled clothes.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.420
And for the click event.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:32.140
Of course fine by criteria model that

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:41.855
hide span,

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:45.390
area hidden, true.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:53.190
And when the x sine x symbol

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.760
h four plus four, the modal title.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.310
Let's set something specific to this dialog.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.080
So find by all criteria,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.119
NIF glass or the modal body,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:39.320
will lead to expose any alert message that might arise.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:47.470
Only if we have some data set on

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:53.990
the Find By Criteria for message.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.120
They've class called the Twelve.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.980
Fine by criteria and for message.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.160
And now let's start building our row.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:36.310
Div class row Nicholas col,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:45.955
md for h5,

00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:48.469
MDB badge,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.950
default shrew.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.740
And let's add the criteria.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:27.190
Now for the second part of the row class, call an eighth.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:32.304
And we will now go with a specific element.

00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:36.370
So go with select less browser default columns,

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.315
tom select name criteria,

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:44.090
ID should be criteria.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.569
And for the option,

00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:55.780
we need to iterate on the type script element called

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.170
the criteria are a

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.190
and the value should be opt.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.665
So the user will be able to select

00:16:15.665 --> 00:16:20.840
only data from the criteria array that we set in place.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:26.640
If you recall from the Reserve Component type script file.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.950
And now you see why we use

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:41.880
this specific statement to identify the criteria option that the user has selected.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.380
Now div class row,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.410
the first part of the row col md for.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:09.540
And they'd be badge default true.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.359
And now for the search item,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.600
second part of the row div class called m d eight,

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:35.460
and will go the normal input type.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:47.435
For the 2-way binding will binding this to the search item class form control,

00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:53.430
and the value should be tried them.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:05.280
Now we need to create the footer of our Feinberg greater dialogue.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:17.280
Bottom button and the button color Brian Murray.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:27.740
Less waves like a real label.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.550
Find.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.540
And for the click event.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.785
When this button will be Click.

00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:44.990
If we have any.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:50.360
Andrew under Find By criterion for message where we're law.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.770
Clearly salt and also invoke the fine by criteria

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.880
method that we wrote in the test script file.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.610
You see the metal here

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.140
and give a wave

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.340
so effect

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.610
and the fire and statement.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.020
And let's implement also council bottom.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.365
Secondary for the color less,

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:52.910
whereas light area labeled counsel.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.085
On the click event,

00:19:57.085 --> 00:20:02.930
we'll just hide this fine by criteria model.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:16.400
And the beer waves affect and affordable texts world go with council.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:34.415
Now we need to implemental way to actually open this dialog.

00:20:34.415 --> 00:20:42.170
So this Lalla will be open when we click on the Find user by criteria card.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:50.940
So for the click event of the Open button will just show the fine by period Thalia model.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.415
Everything should be in place now.

00:20:58.415 --> 00:21:00.740
So I click on the Find By criteria,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.830
you see that grey area as USA,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.835
Maine, firstName, lastName, agent country fields.

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:11.370
So let's go with age.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.055
And we have for the sub-type them 24.

00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:24.360
And you see that we were able to extract to users that have the H sit 24.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:37.625
Another scenario, fine by criteria, contrary.

00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:41.030
And the search item MRC.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.805
And if we click on Find,

00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:47.880
we see that we are able to extract the user.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:54.274
And if we go with the age 50,

00:21:54.274 --> 00:22:00.810
actually H AAA, the error message is shown.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:11.160
And if we insert the correct age and user is retrieved.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:20.310
You can play, of course, with this functionality.
