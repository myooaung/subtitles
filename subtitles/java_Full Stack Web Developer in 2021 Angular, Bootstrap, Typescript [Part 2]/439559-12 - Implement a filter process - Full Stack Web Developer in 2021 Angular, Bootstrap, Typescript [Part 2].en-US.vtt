00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.980
I would like to add specific business logic now in terms of filtering data.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.160
So let's navigate to user component ds.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.290
So our type script file.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.910
And we should set up a specific variable.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.349
Let's call it the filter in place of type Boolean.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.560
And by default, it will be set to false.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.735
Now under Users table headers will add

00:00:55.735 --> 00:01:02.245
a new entry with a blank string.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:04.615
You will see at a later point,

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:10.970
y added this basically for visual effects.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.725
So under find user by the,

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:18.940
since we have filtered the data by d,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.060
will update the filtering plays variable and set it to true.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.940
Now, we should also add in place method that will basically reset the filter.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.970
So reset filter of type void will update the filter in place to false.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.260
And when this reset filter method is

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.245
involved will also involved behind the scenes though,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:10.730
find all users API to update the existing table in the UI.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.250
Now, under user component HTML,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.775
you should take into the consideration this filtering option.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:28.330
And next to all the headers in the users table headers.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.860
We will use the filter in place variable,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.180
such as if this filter in place is set to true.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.495
We will add the class FA,

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:48.410
FA sink, FA LG.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.250
So this a specific goal, font awesome,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.950
that we imported when we configure the angular structure of our application,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.695
the style will be coarser pointer and the color should be white.

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:14.974
And when we click on this item,

00:03:14.974 --> 00:03:22.380
will invoke the reset filter method what that we previously created.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.305
If the filter in place is not set to true.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:33.690
So if this is false,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.160
we should also handle this case also.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.695
So scope core.

00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:48.530
And we basically don't do anything in this case.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.950
So let's see this filtering in place.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.400
We click on Find user by the dialogue.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.805
You see that currently we don't have any icon over there for filtering.

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:18.780
So find user via the dialogue and find the user with the ID five.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.035
And you see here that we have this option to reset the filter now.

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:27.515
And once we reset the filter,

00:04:27.515 --> 00:04:31.985
we are able to see all the data back in the table.

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:36.149
So the UI is updated properly.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.800
Same thing if we test with four and so on.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.500
The filtering operation works properly.
