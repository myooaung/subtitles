00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.935
Hello guys, and welcome to the second part of the class series,

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:07.635
where we will be together a complete,

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.970
full stack based API, web-based application.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.790
While in the first class of this series,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.130
will focus on building the backend side of

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.940
our system using technologies such as Java Spring,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.240
Boot, spring Security, and many more.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.280
As part of this class,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.370
we will move our attention on building

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.215
together the front-end part of our full-stack system.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:38.340
This will involve working with Angular ten,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.934
MD Bootstrap, UI framework,

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.765
type script, awesome, and many more.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:46.610
Are you also excited?

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.910
If so, let's get started and built a frontend part of our full-stack system together.
