00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.510
Under this video, we'll set up the main UI cards that will be used into our application.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.710
But first, let's, let's also use

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:27.430
this informative message that we want to expose in the UI since currently is not exposed.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.165
So we'll create the div class alert,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:39.460
alert info or all will be alert.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.245
We will also use the main message as an ng-if.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:55.710
So, we'll expose this def only if we have any data present in the main message.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.150
We are compiling the code now.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.160
Added fresh page.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.100
So currently we don't have any main message that we want to expose.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.290
So let's simulate this.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.224
On the final users API will set domain message as user retrieved.

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:24.844
So you'll see now that the user retrieve,

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:30.935
users retrieve messages shown just as a demo.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.420
Let's remove this.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:47.280
Okay? So that informative message works also.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.290
So lets go under User component HTML and set up

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.670
some initial cards in place that will work with as part of this course.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.295
So div class card deck.

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:08.050
Since this card deck is

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.725
a specific MD bootstrap class that we will use with three different cards.

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:19.760
So MDB guard, MDB card body.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.920
And for the NDP card title,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.150
let's use something like find user by

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:36.115
the for the MDB card text

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:40.840
on your formative descriptive message about this operation.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.840
So this will retrieve the user based on the corresponding ID.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.275
And let's set in place of button that at a later point.

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:59.185
We'll click over it and do,

00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:03.880
do some operations that were extract data from the server side.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.740
So bottom dive button and the button color primary.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.920
And for the button text will be open.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.910
So you see the first card when set in place.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.380
Let's add descriptive comment.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.490
Find user by ID, specific card.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.195
Now let's move to the second guard.

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:38.930
Find user by criteria.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.540
So if you recall,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.650
on the server side,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.630
we had implemented an API that will find specific users based on criteria.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.430
And we will also want to use this in the UI.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.930
Science seti got the structure for this card also,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.910
find user by criteria similar to the first card,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:16.250
of course, MDB card texts.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.000
We'll use something like we retrieve user based on specific criteria.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.850
And let's set in place so similar button as we use for the first card.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.720
The color primary and the same text message or one.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.665
So the second card is in place.

00:04:56.665 --> 00:05:00.980
And now we should go on the third carp.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.830
This will add a new user.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.500
So MDB card, MDB card body will need a title.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.580
So this will be add new user.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.305
For the NDP card,

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:38.120
texts will lose, add new users to the list.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.460
And in a similar fashion,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.320
we'll setup a button,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.365
color, primary, and the open texts.

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:58.610
So now we should have free cards in place in the UI.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.600
So all three are in place,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.720
but we need to do something in our UI.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.870
Let's do BR tag to have some space between the cards and they were.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.670
Now it looks much better.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:30.740
And the next step will be to implement the business logic for all three cards.
