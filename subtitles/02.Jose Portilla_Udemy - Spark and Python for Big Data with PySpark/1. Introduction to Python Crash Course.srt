00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,600
Welcome to the Python crash course section will now have a quick crash course in Python and the Jupiter

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,960
note book system.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,530
Before we continue let's discuss a few things to keep in mind.

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,940
If you already know enough pythons create functions for example maybe you've already taken one to make

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,280
courses on Python.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,300
You can probably just skip this section you're already good to go.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,190
If you need to review however stick around and go through these lectures.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,520
If you're not sure if you know enough python that's no problem.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,510
Just move forward through the curriculum and attempt the python crash course exercises that you can

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,660
find towards the end of this section if you can solve them.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,240
Then you probably already know enough python to continue.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,040
Now keep in mind this is meant to be a quick review.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,260
Preferably you should already know how to program before enrolling in this course and hopefully you've

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,130
encountered some python in the past will only cover concepts to the level you need to know to use Python

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,090
with Sparke including Paice park.

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,960
Well so we won't cover every single concept in Python just enough that you can use Python with SPARC.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,200
We'll use the Jupiter note book for this course so we're also going to be starting with a very quick

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
review of it.

19
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,610
Remember you don't have to use the Jupiter notebook if you prefer another ID or text editor.

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,920
The same code works for any environment.

21
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,950
So if Jupiter notebooks aren't your thing no problem.

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,890
Use any ID or text editor.

23
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,350
You prefer OK.

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,450
Let's get started.

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,470
I'll see you at the next lecture.
