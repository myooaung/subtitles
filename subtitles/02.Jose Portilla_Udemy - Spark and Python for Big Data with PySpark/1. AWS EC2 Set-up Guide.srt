Hello everyone and welcome to the section on installing spark and Python on an AWOS E.S. to.

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,690
So this lecture and the following lectures in this section will walk you through how to set up Python

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,600
spark in a Jupiter notebook system on an Amazon Web Services easy to instance.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,260
However before we begin I want to discuss a few things to keep in mind.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,780
This is by far the most tedious setup option out of the four.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,280
It's the one of the most steps and you have to make sure you get everything right.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,530
Also while everything we show is within the free one year tier for Amazon Web Services you still need

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,230
a credit card to set up an account and follow through with everything we show.

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,040
So if you create an easy to instance using different parameters than what is shown here you may also

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,330
be liable for charges.

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,720
So keep that in mind.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,230
Everything we show in this video lecture series is going to fall under the free tier if you're signing

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,990
up for Amazon be less to give you a one year free tier of services for these little micro instances

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,380
if you choose more powerful parameters more memory more storage etc. then you may be liable for charges.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,450
So keep that in mind.

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,980
Also you're going to have to make sure to follow the direction shown in this video exactly.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,780
Otherwise you'll probably have to repeat the process all over again.

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,830
So leave yourself plenty of time to go through this process.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,110
If you ever feel uncomfortable with any of this you can just go straight to the virtual box installation

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,660
lectures.

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,000
There's a whole section on that.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,540
Those are local they're simpler and they're for sure 100 percent free OK.

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,250
Over on that trying to dissuade you.

24
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,450
I just want you to know the CC to process isn't too bad.

25
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,590
But again keep in mind if you get an error during this process it's because you made a mistake somewhere

26
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,520
not following along with the video lectures and it's going to be hard for me to help you out in the

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,670
Q&amp;A forums debugging because really there's only a few commands that you have to follow along.

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,590
So you'll probably have to just go back and start over.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,810
All right let's get started walking through the process of setting all of this up.

30
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,270
So the very first thing you have to do is set up an Amazon Web Services account.

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:11,140
So go to HTP s AWOS the Amazon Dot com slash free or you can just go to amazon.com or just google search

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,970
AWOS then what you're going to do is click on Create a free account.

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,630
You'll sign up with an email address and then fill out the profile information.

34
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,000
Basically just follow along with the prompts.

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,750
Once you've done that the profile information will require your contact information billing information

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,680
ID verification and then you're going to choose the free support plan in the next lecture.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,330
We're going to do explore it ws and create an easy to instance.

38
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,440
So right now your assignment.

39
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,830
Just create that AWOS profile and choose all the free settings.

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,020
I'll see you in the next lecture where we actually begin to walk through using AWOS and Creedon that

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,070
easy to instance.
