00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,700
Welcome to the logistic regression consulting project you did such a great job in the previous consulting

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,530
project that we're starting to spread about your abilities.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,940
You've been contacted by a top marketing agency to help them out with customer churn.

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:25,640
They flew you out to New York City or some of the best marketing agencies in the world are located what

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,580
they need you to do is help them out with predicting customer churn.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,550
So this marketing agency has many customers that use their particular service that produces advertisements

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,610
for the clients or customer Web sites and they notice they have quite a bit of churn in clients and

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,130
they currently randomly assigned account managers for each client.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,010
However they want you to create a machine learning model that will help predict which customers will

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,480
churn.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,530
That is thought by their service so that they can correctly assign the customers most at risk to churn

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,750
an account manager.

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,750
Luckily they have some historical data and they want to know if you can help them out.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,680
The basic idea is to create a classification algorithm that will help classify whether or not a customer

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,370
turned then the company can test this against incoming data for future customers to predict which customers

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,660
will turn and assign them an account manager.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,660
The data is under customer underscore turned out C S V.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,020
So let's quickly go over that data and what your main task is.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,460
So this is what the customer churn data looks like and these are the various columns lets go over them.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,050
You have the name column which is just the name of the person who is the latest contact at this client

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,860
company.

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,730
You have the age column which is the number of years the customer has been in business.

23
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,160
Then you have the total purchase which is the amount of the total adds purchased and then you have the

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,830
account manager column which has a binary column where 0 means they have no manager and one means they

25
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,620
have an account manager assigned to them.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,570
So remember right now in this customer churn CXXVI training set you have this particular account manager

27
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,220
call them being randomly assigned.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,150
And thats something they want to fix later on.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,800
Then you have the years column which is the total years as a customer for this marketing agency.

30
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,160
You have the name sites column which is the number of Web sites that use this particular marketing agency's

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,470
service you have the onboard date which is a date that the name of the latest contact was on boarded

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,150
the location which is the client headquarter address.

33
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,340
And then the company name so the name of the client company and then you have the label column.

34
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,400
So the label column is this chern column 0 or 1 indicating whether the customer has turned.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,010
So your goal is to create a model that can predict whether a customer will turn zero or one based off

36
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,030
the various features.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,510
Now keep in mind a lot of those features were strings.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,160
Some of them will be useful some of them won't be useful at all.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,130
Hopefully you can use your intuition to decide which ones are useful and which ones are not.

40
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,680
Remember that the account manager is currently randomly assigned so it's likely that in that training

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,390
set of customer underscore terms that see CSP file the account manager column isn't going to be very

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,290
helpful because it's just a randomly assigned value.

43
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,660
As always you can treat this consulting project as a loosely guided exercise or skip ahead and treat

44
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,360
it as a code along project.

45
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,280
Best of luck.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,890
All the information you need is in the notebook and there's also a solution book for this consulting

47
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,750
project.

48
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,610
We'll see if the next lecture where we walk through an example solution.
