1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello everyone don't walk into the course overview the lecture.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,370
I would like to welcome you to the course.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,840
And in this lecture we're going to quickly cover some frequently asked questions and what you can expect

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,670
during the course even if you've taken other courses by me in the past.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,760
Please don't skip this lecture it's really going to help you understand what the Course is about and

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,110
how to get help during the course.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,310
And topics such as that.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,390
So we're going to discuss a few things or really help you give the best possible course experience lectures

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,120
like this one these video lectures can be sped up to your liking.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,430
Up to 2 x speed I usually talk at a pretty slow and deliberate pace.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
So I would personally if I was watching this video lecture probably speeded up a bit too.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,440
So feel free to do that whenever you want.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,480
And they can also be viewed at higher quality.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,940
Sometimes some browsers or some internet connections auto to a lower quality if you're having trouble

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,470
with that.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,050
You can always just click on the settings icon it looks like a little gear at the bottom of the video

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,840
and change it to a higher quality.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,170
All right.

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's discuss some coarse basics.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,550
Who is this course for and what does it cover.

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,750
So this course is really designed for someone with some sort of experience in programming doesn't need

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,660
to specifically be Python or spark in the past but you should have experience of some programming language

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,890
preferably Python.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,180
But we do have the python crash course to kind of get you up to speed on that quickly.

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,550
And this course is for people that are interested in using SPARC in Python for analyzing big data.

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,200
If you're interested in just general data science machine learning with Python and you don't really

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,980
have a need for a really large data sets that is data sets in bigger than like 32 gigabytes and you're

28
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,580
just interested in basic data analysis machine learning visualization with data science and you're just

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,760
starting to get into it.

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,940
Check out my other course Python for data science and machine learning boot camp and take a look at

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,750
that curriculum.

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,580
It might be better suited for you.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,020
This course is better suited for people that have may already gone through that course this python for

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,040
data science and machine learning boot camp.

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,320
So I just want to make sure that your expectations are set here on what you're going to experience in

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,390
this course.

37
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,870
So again this course is ideal for students who enrolled in that previous course or who already have

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,160
some sort of general knowledge with basic data analysis with Python or maybe some other programming

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,850
language.

40
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,660
It's designed to add spark and price spark to your professional resume.

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,240
So you already have some skills you want to level up with SPARK and Paice park.

42
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,120
So what this course is not we're not going to cover typical Python libraries such as some pie pandas

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,330
visualization sikat learn.

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,610
This course is really just for big data that those technologies themselves can't handle.

45
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,670
So at a certain point your data becomes so large that none pie panda sikat learned they can't deal with

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,310
it anymore.

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,220
You need to move on something like Sparke.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,830
So that's what this course is about.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,300
OK.

50
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,200
So again this course is for people looking to build skills in things like Paice marked data frames Sparke

51
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,360
2.0 working with very large data sets and things like Spark's to suffix.

52
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,340
Maybe you've heard of sparks streaming or.

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,150
An employer is asking for you to learn that.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,340
We cover that sort of stuff in this course.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,200
OK.

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Hopefully that gives you an idea of the target audience.

57
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,870
But let's discuss a few more things before we get started.

58
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,050
We have various installation lectures for different ways of setting up PI SPARC but I don't want you

59
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,350
to feel obligated to use any of them specifically if you already have your own setup.

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,130
We're going to be using the Jupiter notebook system for video lectures.

61
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,430
But if you prefer that PI files with some sort of ID like pi charm or a text editor like sublime text

62
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,500
editor that's also no problem.

63
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,520
I've provided the PI files for you to follow along with.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,940
So it's totally up to you whether you want to stick to the notebook system or use your own favorite

65
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,780
editor.

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,660
You have the py files to basically explore any options you want.

67
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,580
So speaking of these pie in these notebook files you can grab the notes as a zip file as a resource

68
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,700
in this lecture.

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,400
So as you're watching throughout the course you can click on check resources or you may see a little

70
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,520
pop up saying there are resources there'll be a zip file and that contains all the notes.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,960
So in the FNQ lecture the installation overview.

72
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,400
And in this specific lecture you'll see the pop up for those zip files.

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,990
It's all the same zip files.

74
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,220
I just put them in several lectures for convenience.

75
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,550
So any of those will work.

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,970
You can just click on whichever one you're currently at is more convenient to you.

77
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,270
The slides shown in the course are also linked to as a resource in their respective lecture and they're

78
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,920
hosted as Google slides so you can just visit online to see any updates.

79
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,030
So I prefer hosting them as Google slides versus using a PDA.

80
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,670
That way if there's any changes I can easily edit them online and you can get the latest stuff by clicking

81
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,480
on that link.

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,450
All right.

83
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,060
Now let's discuss how to get help during the course.

84
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,960
So whenever you're working through the course and you get stuck on something or there's an error you

85
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,120
should always double check that your code matches the notes exactly.

86
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,280
If you follow the same set up procedure and you're running on the same version of Python that sparked

87
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,180
the I am in this video lecture you should have everything working.

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,990
If your code matches the notes exactly.

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,170
So definitely double check that that's the case.

90
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,240
I would say somewhere around 80 percent of all errors are just because there was a typo or something

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,550
didn't quite match up to the notes you maybe did something in a different order.

92
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,540
So definitely double check that your code matches those notes exactly.

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,610
If you're still having trouble with that you're pretty sure it matches the notes exactly.

94
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,910
Maybe even Aranda notes do a quick check on Stack Overflow for a fast answer.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,870
A lot of times questions have already been answered on that Web site.

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,110
OK so let's say those two methods you're still getting those errors.

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,070
No problem.

98
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,920
You can check the course FNQ lecture.

99
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,140
Maybe your questions are already being answered there.

100
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,560
That's the very next lecture.

101
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,490
He still can't find there not a problem.

102
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,270
Search the Kewaunee forums of course to see if someone else has already asked your question and if you

103
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,590
still can't find it you check the queue.

104
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,460
You check the notes.

105
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,760
Everything looks good to you but you're still having that trouble again.

106
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,650
That's not a problem.

107
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,330
All you have to do is post a new question to the Kewney forums.

108
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,270
If you still can't resolve that issue given the previous methods and I and the other students are happy

109
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,400
to help out I'm on the forums everyday checking trying to help out helping you troubleshoot any errors

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,030
you may have.

111
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,160
So again the Kewney forums are where you should be focusing your questions.

112
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,090
After you check the notes and stack overflow.

113
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,540
All right let's quickly cover the course curriculum and what you can expect to learn throughout the

114
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,890
entire course.

115
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,710
So we're going to cover the following topics.

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,670
Kind of these are big overview topics will start with spark in the Big Data basics.

117
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,690
Give an overview of what it really is how it works etc. then we'll talk about setting up spark in various

118
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,110
ways.

119
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,580
You have basically 4 installation options and we'll talk about that later on through an installation

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,900
overview lecture.

121
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,970
Now we have a quick Python crash course and then we have the Python and SPARC 2.0 data frame section

122
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,250
where we discuss how to use data frames with the spark 2.00 syntax and Python and then will also have

123
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,540
a Paice Park Project exercise to kind of wrap up that section.

124
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,620
Then the second half the course really focuses on sparc machine learning.

125
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,370
So you get an introduction to machine learning what it is and you also get an introduction to how SPARC

126
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,750
works with machine learning in particular with its M-L lib library.

127
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,590
And then we'll discuss some particular machine learning topics like linear regression logistic regression

128
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,790
decision trees and random force and in things like gradient boosting trees and there we're going to

129
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,000
continue on to k means clustering recommender systems.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,650
Natural Language Processing and then things like Sparke streaming which aren't exactly machine learning

131
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,260
but it is another facet of SPARC and we'll discuss streaming something locally and also doing a project

132
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,510
with Twitter.

133
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,790
So streaming tweets using Sparc and within all those topics that I just mentioned those larger sections

134
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,450
we also introduce other things like pipelines or cross-validation.

135
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,590
So some of these topics don't really merit their own particular section like pipelines.

136
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,270
Instead we introduce them with other topics.

137
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,560
So when we talk about natural language processing we'll also introduce pipeline's explain what they

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,210
are etc..

139
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,620
All right thank you so much for listening to all of that.

140
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,340
But it should make your course experience much smoother.

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,130
Having known all that information.

142
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,200
So one last thing before we continue on.

143
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,030
I just want to give you a huge thank you for enrolling in this course.

144
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,360
I truly appreciate it.

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
And I'm really going to try my best to make sure you have the best learning experience possible.

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,540
OK let's get started with learning one of the latest technologies which has sparked with Python.

147
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,050
I will see you at the next lecture.
