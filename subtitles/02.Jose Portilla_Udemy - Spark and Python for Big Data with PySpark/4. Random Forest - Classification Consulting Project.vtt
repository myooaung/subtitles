Hello everyone and welcome to the tree methods consulting project you've been contracted by the Purina

2
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.490
dog food company and flown out to their headquarters in St. Louis Missouri.

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.260
So you've been hired by this dog food company to help them try to predict why some batches of their

4
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.020
dog food are spoiling much quicker than intended.

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.140
Unfortunately this dog food company hasn't upgraded to the latest machinery meaning that the amounts

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
of the five preservative chemicals that they're using can vary a lot.

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.760
But you want to answer the question Which of these chemicals is having the strongest effect.

8
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.740
So the dog food company first mixes up a batch of preservative and then that preservative contains four

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.980
different preservative chemicals labeled A B C and D and then it's completed with some sort of filler

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.570
chemical.

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.690
Now the food scientists working at this dog food company believe that one of the actual preservatives

12
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.790
that is label either A B C or D is causing the problem of the dog food spoiling early.

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.040
But they need your help to figure out which one of these chemicals that is.

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
So you're going to be using machine learning with random force to find out which parameter had the most

15
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.920
predictive power.

16
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.570
Thus finding out which chemical causes the early spoiling.

17
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.800
So you're going to create a model that tries to predict which dog food samples will spoil and then find

18
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.880
out if you can decide which of the features in this case the preservative chemicals is the problem.

19
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.070
So the data that they presented you with looks like this.

20
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.950
They have the four preservative chemicals that are not the filler.

21
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.750
So a preservative A B C and D and the actual value is the percentage of the preservative A in that particular

22
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.170
mix then you have a label column of spoiled indicating whether or not that dog food batch was spoiled

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.260
early so think really carefully about what this problem is really asking you to solve.

24
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.590
In fact you don't actually need to perform such a complicated machine learning tasks like random forest.

25
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.270
But I want to reflect a reality and consulting projects where sometimes a company asks you to solve

26
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
a project where you didn't need full blown machine learning to do it but you could solve it anyways

27
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.270
using that.

28
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.980
So while we will use machine learning to solve this it actually won't be your typical train test split

29
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.910
workflow.

30
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.250
If this confuses you skip ahead to the solution code along but try your best to figure out which actual

31
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.010
chemical is causing the early spoilage.

32
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.420
All right.

33
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.570
Best of luck on the project and I will see you at the next lecture where we'll go through an example

34
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.880
solution to solving this actual task.
