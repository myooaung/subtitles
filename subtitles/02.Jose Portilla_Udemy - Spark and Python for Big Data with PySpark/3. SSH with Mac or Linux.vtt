00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.130
Hello everyone and welcome to the S-sh with Mac and Linux lecture.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
You can go ahead and skip this lecture if you're on Windows from the previous lecture you should have

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.010
already connected to your instance.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.390
This is only for Linux and Mac users who only watch the first half of the previous lecture.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
We've already created our SC to instance using the AWOS console.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.670
You should have also already downloaded that Doppie M-file.

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.620
Now what we're going to do is connect to our instance through our terminal using the secure shell.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.270
Make sure you can locate your PM file.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
I would recommend that you relocate it from wherever you saved to your desktop so you can follow exactly

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.470
along what I'm doing and also make sure you have the DNS address your easy to instance and I'll review

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640
how you can get that then you're going to check the resource link for the step by step instructions

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.680
from Amazon.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.100
In case you actually want a written guide for everything that we're about to do but everything we're

14
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.470
about to do is actually quite simple it's just basically one or two lines of code.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110
Let's go ahead and get started by opening our terminal.

16
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.220
I'm going to go ahead and hop to that now.

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.860
OK.

18
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.760
Here I am at my desktop.

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.700
I'm going to go ahead and grab my terminal by just doing a spotlight search for a terminal and then

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.550
hit enter.

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.640
You should get something that looks like this.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.100
And then the first thing you need to do is to use the S.H. Maat command to make sure our private key

23
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.470
file isn't publicly viewable.

24
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.660
I went ahead and saved it to my desktop right here.

25
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.170
Jupiter 13:00.

26
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.750
Yours might be called news sparked up sparked up PM whatever you happen to call it.

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.370
First thing to do is actually change directory to the desktop.

28
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:42.210
All right CD space desktop hit enter and then I'm going to write See H M O D.

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.600
Change my code and then 400 space and then my key which is Jupiter 1 p.m..

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.250
Yours may be sparked up my spark.

31
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.720
News spark whatever every happen to save it.

32
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.940
And then enter here and you should get no output.

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.160
Just a clean line.

34
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.080
And that means it worked then what we're going to go ahead and do is use the S-sh command to connect

35
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.310
to our instance going to go ahead and type in S-sh space dash.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.430
I and then Taipan Jupiter 1 p.m. or whatever your PM file is and then you're going to go ahead and make

37
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.430
sure that you put in the DNS.

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.470
Now let me go in to remind you how you can grab the DNS of your instance.

39
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.050
Go ahead and go to your AWOS console.

40
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.560
I'm going to jump to it now.

41
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.760
OK here I am at my AWOS console in order to find your public DNS.

42
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.680
You can just go scroll down a little bit you should find the here it should look something like this

43
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.210
to a bunch of numbers and then a location and then compute amazon.de WS.

44
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.060
Go ahead and make sure you copy this and then move back to your terminal.

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.340
I'm going to jump to the terminal now.

46
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.030
All right.

47
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.640
Back to my terminal I'm going to write Ubuntu apps and then I'm going to paste.

48
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.180
Right click paste that entire path that DNS right now S-sh space dash space 21:00 file whatever that

49
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.480
namespace Xubuntu at my DNS address hit enter.

50
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.620
You'll get a warning here it says authenticity.

51
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.270
Are you sure you want to continue.

52
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.880
Go ahead and type in yes hit enter again.

53
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.400
And you should be logged in you should get something that looks like this.

54
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.420
At the bottom it should say Ubuntu at some sort of IP address.

55
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.510
You can go ahead and clear this and right now what you're looking at is the command line interface to

56
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.070
your E.C to instance you're running right now through the command line.

57
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.110
A virtual connection to that computer that AC to instance and you can check everything's working and

58
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.080
you can actually just run Python on this and it should work.

59
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.910
You probably won't get this Anaconda's yet we still need to install that actually install it before

60
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.000
you film this video.

61
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.050
But you should be able to at least get the built in Python 2.7 on Ubuntu.

62
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.190
You can print something like Hello run it and it should work.

63
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.720
You can go out and quit out of this.

64
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.410
All right.

65
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.940
So that's all you need to do in order to continue onto the next video in the next video.

66
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.560
You're going to be using this command line interface to actually download everything we need to run

67
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.110
Sparc and Jubran notebook on an easy to Mansons and that includes stuff like Java Skala Hadoop Sparc

68
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.660
the Jupiter notebook's system Anaconda and more.

69
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.890
We're going to teach Hadad everything step by step and the next video.

70
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.270
But as far as this video and the S-sh you're done it's a really easy process on Mac and Linux computers.

71
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.480
You just use the change of command S.H. Ma'at 400 and then put in your PM file and then you just going

72
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.650
to say S-sh space dash I your PM file and Ubuntu at your DNS and that's all you have to do.

73
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.580
OK.

74
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.910
Feel free to post any questions to the Cuneta forums.

75
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.230
But other than that I will see at the next lecture.

76
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.880
Thanks everyone.
