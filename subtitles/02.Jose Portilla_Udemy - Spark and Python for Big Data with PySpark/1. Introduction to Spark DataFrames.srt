00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,450
Welcome to the section on Sparke data frame's in this course the main way we will be working in Python

2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,270
and Sparke is through the data frame syntax.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,350
If you've worked with panderers in Python the our programming language sequel or even just basic Excel

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,780
a data frame will feel very familiar.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,990
And this data frame syntax is the main way we can work with Sparke with SPARC 2.0 or higher SPARC data

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:36,050
frames hold data in a column and row format where each column represents some feature or variable and

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,010
each row corresponds and represents an individual data point.

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,290
And we're going to be seeing tons of examples of data frames throughout the entire course spark in its

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,810
early days began with something known as the already decent tax which was a little ugly and a bit tricky

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,760
to learn.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,260
Fortunately now SPARC 2.0 and higher has shifted towards a data frame syntax which is much cleaner and

12
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,080
easier to work with and this data from syntax looks really similar across all the API which is nice

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,090
meaning if you've already done a course in something like Scala and spark learning Python and Sparke

14
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,650
data frame's is really easy.

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,370
A lot of that stuff looks extremely similar now Sparke data France are able to input output data from

16
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,470
a wide variety of sources and we can use the state of frame's to apply various transformations on the

17
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,160
data.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,170
At the end of those transformation calls we can either show that data or collect the results so you

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,180
need to display them or collect them for some sort of final processing.

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,390
And in this section We'll cover all the main features of working of data frames that you need to know

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,640
once you have a solid understanding of Sparke data frames.

22
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,290
We can move on to utilizing the data from M-L lib API or machine learning library for machine learning.

23
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,980
And that's the machine learning library that comes with SPARC after this section.

24
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:56,750
We're going to have another section called the data frame project and this project will be an analysis

25
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,240
of some historical stock data information that uses all the spark data for knowledge from this particular

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,040
section of the course.

27
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,060
It's going to serve as just a quick exercise review to test all the skills learned in this section.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,910
So as you continue throughout this section Don't worry if you feel a little fuzzy on it in the very

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,770
next section with this project exercise we're going to test all your skills so you can review everything

30
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,260
that you learn in this particular section.

31
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,280
All right let's get started with learning the very basics of Sparke data frame's.
