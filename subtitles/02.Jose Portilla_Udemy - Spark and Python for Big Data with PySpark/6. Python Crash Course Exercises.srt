Welcome back to the Python crash course exercises lecture in this lecture.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,130
We're going to get a brief overview of the actual notebook that corresponds to the exercises in the

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,090
next lecture.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,840
I'll be coding through the solutions to the exercises.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,230
Let's hop over to the No.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,430
So the notebook file you need to open is called Python crash course exercises and this is just an optional

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,950
exercise to test your understanding of Python.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,540
The questions start are pretty simple and honestly most of them are just pretty simple questions especially

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,990
if you already have a lot of experience of Python.

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,680
But you just come down here you check up the first question or all the questions it's going to have

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
an empty cell free to play around with.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,120
And then right below that cell is the expected answer.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,630
But keep in mind that once I run something in this cell it will delete that expected answer.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,430
So it wants to ask what is 7:2 the power for.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,040
How can you figure that out with Python.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,000
Hopefully you remember that and then you just continue on it keeps asking you questions and expected

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,020
answers below.

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,120
If you go all the way down eventually you have a final problem.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,190
This one's a little different.

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,880
It basically has a little word problem to solve.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,770
It wants you to fill out a function and then it gives you two examples of how it should work.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,510
So go ahead and read that for the final problem.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,110
OK.

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,120
Coming up next I'm going to be personally coding you through the solutions and then explaining the tricky

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
parts that you may have encountered.

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,360
Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
