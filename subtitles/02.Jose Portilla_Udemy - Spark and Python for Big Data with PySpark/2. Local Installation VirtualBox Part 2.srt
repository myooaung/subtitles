00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,260
Hello everyone and welcome to part two.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,860
The spark in Python was virtual box installation guide in part 2 where we're going to be doing is installing

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,110
Python Sparc and the Jupiter notebook system onto our Ubuntu machine.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,880
Ubuntu is already our local operating system.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,770
He's skipped the previous lecture in part 1 and came directly to this video.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,270
If you don't have Ubuntu either as a local OS or on a virtual machine please go back to the previous

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,290
lecture apol the guy there before starting with this one as a quick note.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,680
The current version of SPARC at the time of filming this video lecture is sparked 2.1 and that particular

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,010
version is incompatible.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,060
The latest version of Python which is 3.6.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,700
This will be fixed when SPARC 2.2 is released.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,520
In the meantime we're going to stick to Python 3.5 to avoid any issues.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,540
Now let's hop over to the actual Ubuntu desktop and show you how to set up everything all right.

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,330
Here I am at my Ubuntu desktop instead of my virtual box.

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,890
Now the first thing I want to do is confirm that Python 3.5 is already on Ubuntu now it should have

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:18,100
been on Ubuntu sorgen select terminal and if you just type in Python you'll notice you get Python 2.7

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,520
out.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,930
But I'm going to quit this and then I'm going to type python 3 so that's all one word.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,560
And then I get Python 3.5 which is the version I'm looking for.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,560
So it already comes Ubuntu we're going to quit and that step is done pretty simple because it came with

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,330
it already.

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,170
We're going to do now is install the Jupiter notebook system so to do that all you have to do is say

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,190
Pip three install Jupiter.

24
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,640
Then enter.

25
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,680
And if it says Pip's 3 is currently not installed.

26
00:01:51,890 --> 00:02:02,990
We're going to do say sudo apt install Python 3 bash pit and then put in your test password and it's

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,070
going to install that for you.

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,750
It's going to ask if you want to continue.

29
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:13,160
Select y free s and then I'm going to jump forward in time to this finished downloading and installation.

30
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,760
It should be relatively quick and alright once Pip 3 is done installing and the previous command again

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,290
which was picked 3 install Jupiter.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,730
Hit enter and it's going to click then install Jupiter which is going to allow CS to Jupiter notebook

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,490
system.

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,600
So once that's downloaded and installed will test it out by typing out Jubran output at the command

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
line.

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm going to hop Cordone time for this to finish installing and downloading all right once that is done.

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,560
You may get a warning about using a older PYT version.

38
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,740
Don't worry about that.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
Just type in Jupiter space notebook.

40
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,430
Hit enter once you type that in.

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,380
You'll notice that Jupiter notebook's system automatically opens the Mozilla Firefox browser and is

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,280
ready to go.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,900
But you'll notice if you come back to the command line it says copy and paste it into your browser when

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,560
you connect for the first time to log in with a token.

45
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,420
So if you want we're going to copy this come toward your L and then paste that it will say paste and

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,680
go and then we're ready to go.

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,230
So we're going to use this is home and I always recommend that you do that.

48
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,750
If you get that warning of a first time copy and paste it and then here I'm going to zoom in a little

49
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,370
bit.

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:33,310
Zoom in and then once we're zoomed in I'm going to hit new note book Python 3 and then just type something

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,630
like one plus one new shift enter and then you get some sort of output.

52
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,240
If you are able to get this far.

53
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,920
That means that Jupiter notebook is working correctly on your system and what I also want you to check

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,310
is do one divided by two.

55
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,850
That's a forward slash do shift enter and if you're getting zero point and five out then that means

56
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,360
you're correct.

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,740
You're running Python 3 not Python 2.

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,340
So so far we are all good on our Jupiter notebook and our Python.

59
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,700
All we have to do let is download Sparc and make sure that we connect SPARC with Python.

60
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,250
So let's go ahead and do that.

61
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,010
What I'm going to do now is come over here to the virtual box do Control-C to shut down and then hit

62
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,700
why might you bring an opaque server that's going to shut down.

63
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,120
You'll notice something like connection failed.

64
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:23,290
Totally ok makes sense to just everything down and I will close that close those mokel tabs leave the

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,510
page.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,350
Now what I'm going to do is I need to install Java.

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:38,810
So what I'm going to do is say sudo X gets updates and it's going to update the apt get mechanism which

68
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,310
I'm then going to use to install Java that's it all finished relatively quickly and then once you've

69
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:53,680
done that we'll go ahead and install it Java with pseudo apps bash gets install default dash.

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
J R E.

71
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Enter the Laski if you want to continue.

72
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,120
Say yes and then it's going to Dalat install Java for us.

73
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,850
So I will jump forward in time until this is a finished installation.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,190
Quite so after a few minutes you want to check if that all works.

75
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,840
After it's done and you can type Java bash version and if you get something looks like this one point

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,130
eight.

77
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,730
Or maybe something a little newer than your good to go.

78
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:30,900
So once you've installed Java that means we can install Skala so we all say sudo app gets install Skala

79
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,110
enter and then select quite Contini that operation.

80
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,330
And this should be a little quicker than installing Java.

81
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,670
It's about a third of the size I'm willing to jump forward in time until Skala is uninstalling.

82
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,990
Now we're going to check that it installed correctly using the exact same thing we did for Java which

83
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,770
was just Java dash version and that will do Skala dash version.

84
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,600
So let me hop forward in time for Skoll it could be done installing all right now let's check on that

85
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,410
by saying Skala dash version enter.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,930
He should see something like two point eleven point something.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,360
Maybe a little more recent but that means it's good to go we have Skala installed.

88
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,990
The next thing we have to do is install a library called pi for J which connects Java and Skala with

89
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,000
Python.

90
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,940
All you have to do is say Pipp 3 install.

91
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,250
Pi the number 4 and then the letter J.

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,570
Enter they'll collect it and then install it.

93
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,760
It's quite a small package so should be done pretty quickly.

94
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,480
Then once you've done that the last thing I do is install Sparc and Hadoop itself.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,460
So in order to do this there's various ways we come to Mozilla Firefox again.

96
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,170
We can search for Apache Sparke.

97
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,790
Make sure you spell it right.

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:55,300
Patchi spark enter and then come over to spark that Apache the short and then select download and it

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,950
will get a spark release.

100
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,200
So at this point in time the latest release is 2.1.

101
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,750
So that's what we're going to be using.

102
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,380
And if you want to follow along everything in this course and make sure everything works exactly the

103
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,380
same as me then I would also suggest you do 2.1 and then we'll choose the package type mix we choose

104
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,990
pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 and later.

105
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,510
Then if it says download type you can do.

106
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,740
Download or select Apache.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,970
So we'll just download and then we're going to be downloading SPARC 2.0 1.0 been Hadoop 2.7 thought

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,190
DGC and once you have that just click on it and it should begin the download and will select Save file

109
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,100
will hit OK.

110
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,130
And it's going to be quite a large file.

111
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,000
So here it's taking about 8 minutes.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,310
Depends on your internet speed.

113
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,010
It's about 187 megabytes.

114
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,320
But I mean that's a spark.

115
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
We're going to need it.

116
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,870
So I will hop 40 in in time until it's finished install or downloading and then we'll show you how to

117
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,260
install it with ubuntu all right.

118
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,950
Once that's done finished in downloading we want to install it but I want to make sure it's in the correct

119
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,830
location.

120
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:02,950
So click here on the little file explorer and then I'll go over to downloads.

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,810
Double click on that and I'm going to move this.

122
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,490
So let's cut this.

123
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,060
We just downloaded sparking Hadoop and then bring it over to our home folder.

124
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,740
So then we will paste it here and that's exactly where I want it.

125
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,630
So then I can just come over to my command line and them the type is sudo tar

126
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:36,110
z x the X and then start typing the word spark and then hit tab to auto complete this.

127
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,120
So basically this is going to unzip this for us and then you'll be prompted for a password.

128
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,620
Put it in and then that's going to unzip that and create the hole that we need.

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,550
Perfect.

130
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,330
So what we want to do is tell Python where it's actually fine spark.

131
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,010
So you can copy and paste this from the resource lecture notes or just type it along with me.

132
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:10,880
I only say export Sparke underscore home is equal to home slash wound to slash Sparke and then let me

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,510
make sure I get the file path right.

134
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:22,400
It's going to be cash to point one point zero that's been cash Dhoop 2.7.

135
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:29,030
Basically the folder or file that we just made directory so export that to spark home and you're going

136
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:41,570
to type export pass equal to dollar sign spark and this is in all caps here underscore home Kolin dollar

137
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,350
sign.

138
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,250
And then in all caps again Pat which is basically going to tell the path of where to find Sparke home

139
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,430
and set the path.

140
00:09:48,640 --> 00:10:00,140
And they're going to say export Python pass is equal to dollar sign Sparke underscore home slash Python

141
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,960
Colan dollar sign.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,310
And then in all caps Python path then hit enter and we have a few more things to do before we can actually

143
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,100
get up and running with Sparke running in the notebook.

144
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:23,970
But we're going to do is say export pie Sparke underscore driver underscore Python is equal to double

145
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:31,400
quote Jupiter double quote enter and you'll also say export in all caps here.

146
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:41,550
Weissberg underscore driver underscore Python underscore o pete t s o p TS is equal to and then in double

147
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,300
quotes.

148
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:51,800
Notebook close that all enter and finally to link it up with Python 3 you want to say export Paice spark

149
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,340
underscore Python is equal to and it will say without quotes.

150
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,840
Python 3.

151
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,930
Enter in order to fix any possible permission errors.

152
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,520
You may get when using the Jupiter notebook under the spark folder.

153
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,730
You see here in home there's a little icon saying it's kind of locked here.

154
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,680
If I double click on this folder eventually I can see under Python that I do have pi SPARC ready to

155
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,550
go but what I need to do is set the permissions so I can access it.

156
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:30,520
So what we will do here is inside the terminal the command I'm going to use is S.H. maade and then I'm

157
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:37,320
going to write 777 and then the file name which in this case is Sparke 2.1 etc..

158
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,380
So hit enter and it says change permissions blah blah is not permitted so we're going to do a pseudo

159
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:53,790
S.H. maade 777 and spark enter is going to ask you for your password when I type in my test password.

160
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,850
Enter again.

161
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,710
And now that should work.

162
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,400
So I'm going to see the into Sparke CD into Python there and then if I just type in Python 3 I should

163
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,920
be able to then say something like import.

164
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,220
Spark and it will import it just fine.

165
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,600
So what I want to do is check if this actually works now that Jupiter notebook.

166
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,690
So I won't say quit in once we've changed the permission of Sparke we can come back here to home and

167
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,750
see that no longer has that icon.

168
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,160
But if you click on this you still see that Python has that permission icons are going to come back

169
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,220
to terminal CD into Sparc and then we're going to do the same thing.

170
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,300
Sudo S.H. maade on Python.

171
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:46,130
Whoops forgot to add code which basically is me read write and execute permissions on that folder.

172
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,890
Hit enter and now we can see if.

173
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,600
Come back here.

174
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,000
That's unlocked and it should be ready to go except we have Paice Birk So one more left.

175
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:03,410
We're going to then CD into Python and then say sudo changed bar so it 7:7 on py Sparke.

176
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,210
Hit enter and now in this python folder Let's go ahead and type in Jupiter notebook

177
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,790
and inside of this we'll create a new notebook.

178
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:23,510
Python 3 and inside of this note but I'm going to type in import PI spark shift enter and there it goes.

179
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,950
So once we have that you are ready to go and you have spark running on your computer.

180
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,620
Any time you want to come and start a new notebook and work with Paice SPARC all you have to do is CD

181
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:40,400
into SPARC 2.7 into Python and make sure you change those permissions as we just showed.

182
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,380
Otherwise you'll get errors saying something like.

183
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,120
Permission denied on untitled.

184
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,000
I wipe or IPY in B file.

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,450
All right.

186
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,870
Thanks everybody and I will see you at the next lecture if you have any questions on this process.

187
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,310
I know it's a bit complicated.

188
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,020
Feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and makes you check up the resource in this lecture which has a written

189
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,520
guide of everything we covered.
