Welcome to the spark data France project exercise section of the Course.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,660
This section of the Course is essentially just two lectures this lecture where we go over the exercise

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,990
and the next lecture where we actually code through the solutions.

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,030
The overall goal of this section is to review everything you learn about Sparke data frame basics those

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,990
operations group by order by filtering etc.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,830
So let's get started by going over the notebook which contains the exercise questions.

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,140
All right here I have the notebook open.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,440
The spark data France project exercise and what this is going to do is like to get some quick practice

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,260
for new Sparke data frame skills and we'll again be looking at historical stock market data.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,020
In this case we'll look at Wal-Mart stock data from the year 2012 to 2017.

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,880
And this exercise is basically going to be just a series of questions and tasks so you start a simple

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,430
Sparke session low the CSP file that asks you what are the column names etc. and you can see here that

13
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,210
there is an empty cell free to fill out the actual code.

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,730
And right below it is the expected output.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,630
So luckily you can see before you actually run the so you actually expect the output to look like.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,230
So you just continue on and you'll notice kind of in the middle here there's a bonus question.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,650
So over here when you actually display the output of that data frame there's a lot of decimal points.

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,450
So as a bonus question to you I want you to check out see how to actually reduce that number of decimal

19
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,020
places.

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,480
And there's a little link here for a hint that takes you to the actual documentation page for the function

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,010
need to use.

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,640
So if you get stuck on that little thing don't worry about it just be the solutions.

23
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,010
But continuing on that should look something like this.

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,240
That's kind of a solution to that bonus question that I want to create a new data frame with the column

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,590
called H V ratio and that is the ratio of the high price versus the volume of stock traded for a day.

26
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,040
So the ratio is just one divided by the other and you should get some pretty small numbers here.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,770
So it should look something like that.

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,740
And then we also ask questions like what they had the peak high end price.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,370
What does that mean of the close column the max and min the volume column.

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,930
How many days the close lower than $60.

31
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,840
What percentage of the time was the hike greater than $80 and basically what I mean by that is what

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,480
are the number of days that the high was greater than $80 divided by the total number of days in the

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,260
data set.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,000
And then I also asked you something that we didn't exactly cover but there is a hint here for you which

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,190
is what does the Pearson correlation between high end volume.

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,530
So you basically have to figure out what kind of function you need to use here.

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,160
And there's also a big hint as far as the column name there then what does the max high per year.

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,460
We actually kind of showed this when we talked about dates and time stamps.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,230
So if you get stuck on this one and make sure to review that lecture towards the end.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,670
All right we'll ask you what is the average close for each color of the month.

41
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,600
And in other words across all the years Carlists if it's in 2012 2013 et cetera what does the average

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,160
close price for all those Januarys all those Februarys et cetera.

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,900
So it should look something like that.

44
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,110
And those are basically all the questions at the end hopefully did a great job.

45
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,010
If you get stuck on anything don't worry about it.

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,600
You can either post to the coupÃ©e forums for a hint or just go to the next lecture where we're going

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,480
to go over all the solutions.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,930
Thanks everyone and best of luck on the exercise.

49
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,350
I'll see you at the next lecture where we go through solutions.
