00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.580
[Autogenerated] When we create state machines,

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.870
we have the option to choose the type.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.710
This type can either be standard or express.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.240
This does not affect the way we be our work flows.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.200
We're still going to use Amazon states language and have

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.250
the same states as we normally have.

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.140
When we build our work flows,

8
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.740
a type of workflow is tightly coupled with what you want to use it for.

9
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.190
If we're going to run long running durable work flows,

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.440
we need to juice standard work throes.

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.650
They can run for up to a year,

12
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.540
and we can easily retrieve the full execution history for up to 90 days.

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.240
They are ideal for slow changing data, for example,

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.440
payment processing,

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.020
multistep sina processes and other processes that do not run at very high rates.

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.100
Express work flows, on the other hand,

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.020
are made for high volume event processing scenarios like they die,

18
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.140
ingestion and transformation.

19
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.930
For example, from Io __ devices, they can run for up to five minutes,

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.820
and the execution history can only be found in Amazon.

21
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.120
Cloudwatch looks.

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.040
They are very good at scenarios where we might want to transform

23
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.550
input and storied in Amazon dynamodb for example,

24
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.940
where the execution rate is very high and execution time is very low.

25
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.470
Let's look at the side by side comparison to put things in perspective,

26
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.980
as I mentioned earlier.

27
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.820
Standard work clothes can run up to a year,

28
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.930
while express work flows can only run upto five minutes.

29
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.530
While the execution rate off a standard workflow is

30
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.710
2000 per second express work.

31
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.540
Those have an execution read or 100,000 per seconds.

32
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.650
Standard work slows hello 4000 state transitions per account,

33
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.460
while express work flows allow nearly unlimited state transitions.

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.650
When it comes to pricing, standard work flows are prized for state transition,

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.040
so this would count anytime workflow state is changed from one step to another.

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040
Express work flows, on the other hand,

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.430
are prized by the number off executions there

38
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.970
duration and the memory they consume.

39
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.540
Unlike standard work, clothes, express work clothes to not support activities.

40
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.700
If we want an activity that runs on an easy to instance,

41
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.730
or on premise that is not going to be supported by express work flows,

42
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.340
this is because of their execution rate and their five minute runtime limit.

43
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.900
A good way to tell which type off work floor you need is to look at the

44
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.770
execution rate and the duration of your work floor.

45
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.820
If you need fast running work close to execute high res,

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.340
then you need to go with express work flows.

47
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.920
If you are trying to coordinate a business workflow,

48
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.940
then standard work clothes are what you're looking for.

49
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.960
It's important to keep in mind that the type of

50
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.750
four flow cannot be changed later.

51
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.570
Once we select the time, that's it.

52
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.000
We have to create another work floor with a different type if you want to change the type.
