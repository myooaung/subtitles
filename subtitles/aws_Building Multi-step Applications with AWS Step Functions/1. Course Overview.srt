[Autogenerated] Hi,

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,850
my name is not steal and welcome to my course building

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,920
multistep applications with a W.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,540
Let's step functions.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,710
Modern applications are becoming more and more small.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,830
Independent media service is that fit together to make up

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,020
the applications that we see today.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,430
Feeding all these service's together monitoring and tracking their

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,570
progress is a very involved and complex task.

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,530
Learn how AWS step functions work and how they can help us build large,

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,930
complex, multi step work clothes that are easily debug and visualize.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,150
Some of the major topics that we look over in this course include

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,270
creating step function were close with many different steps.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,000
Setting up error handling and retry logic using activities toe

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,870
add logic that runs on our local environment,

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,850
monitoring work for performance using cloudwatch events and

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,210
finally learn about security and best practices when it comes

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,460
to building step function were close.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,590
By the end of this course,

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,330
you'll know how to take your existing micro service's and create multistep work.

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,000
Clothes that are easy to visualize and monitor howto have called that runs

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,720
on your own environment and make it part of your cloud.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,090
Were close using activities and how to debug work

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,640
flows in development and production.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,110
Before beginning this course,

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,680
I recommend that you are familiar with creating London functions and

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,580
having some basic no jail skills to get the most out of it.

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,690
I hope you'll join me on the journey to learn how to create

29
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:41,000
work flows with the building multistep applications with a W Step functions course at lower side.
