00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,920
[Autogenerated] throughout this motion recovered how to

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,030
monitor secure and some of the best practices when it

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,540
comes to building step function.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,570
Work flows.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,220
We learned how to use Cloudwatch Matics to look at

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,920
our workflow execution history toe,

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,340
identify potential performance issues and errors to improve upon.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,830
We also looked at setting up alarms so we can get notified when the

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,650
performance off our work flows falls below unacceptable threshold.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,140
So we don't have to constantly tech dramatics on a regular basis.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,470
We learned how to create custom policies based on the service is that are

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,140
utilized in the work floor and how to find and customize those policies or

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,010
great new custom policies for our work flows.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,320
We looked at how using attack based policy can be really powerful way off,

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,160
creating policies that are based on the work for properties that allow us to

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,640
be very specific on who s permission on which work for.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,450
We also went over the data encryption issue when building step function,

18
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,410
work clothes and how the payloads passed between steps cannot be in

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,960
creep it and how we can use as three or another storage medium to

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,510
avoid sensitive data between steps but rather as file ideas where

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,640
the actual payload resides.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,380
We went over the different limitations that step functions head,

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,120
and we learned how to avoid reaching those limitations or how to get

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,200
around them when we do reach those limitations.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,910
And finally,

26
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,260
we learned about some of the common best practices why we

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,420
should use time outs and handle exceptions,

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,180
how to better pass payloads between states and what

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,860
types of worth close to choose.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,780
I hope this has given you a good understanding on how to properly monitor,

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,070
secure and identify limitations for your work flows and how to use some of

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:51,000
the best practices when you're building your work clothes. Thank you for watching.
