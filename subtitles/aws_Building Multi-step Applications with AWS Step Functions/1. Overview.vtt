[Autogenerated] hi.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.210
In this module, I'll teach you how to monitor,

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.800
secure and some of the common best practices when it comes to building step,

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.740
function workforce.

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.840
Throughout this motion,

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.850
you learn how to monitor your work clothes after you

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.340
make them available to the public.

8
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.520
We will go over how to use a different metrics that cloudwatch makes

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.440
available to us to identify and fix potential performance issues.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.670
You will also learn how to create alarms so that you will get notified

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.760
when the performance level falls below or above a desire threshold

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.040
that you said based on your requirements.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.140
Security is always important for any kind of service.

14
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.670
We will go over the different security options that

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.890
we have for our step functions.

16
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010
We'll take a look at security policies.

17
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.560
Apply toe work close automatically based on the

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.940
service is that are utilized toe only.

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.770
Allow the minimum possible rights to a workflow.

20
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.010
You will also learn how to create users with right permissions to use with

21
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.400
activities that you might be running on your own environment.

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.680
We will also go over the data encryption options that we have

23
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700
to prevent unauthorized entities from viewing the payload

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.520
information passed between steps,

25
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.960
which is visible to anyone who has access to all the workflow

26
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.220
designer or the workflow execution history.

27
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.720
He will also learn what the different limitations,

28
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.620
off step functions are on,

29
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.240
how to avoid reaching them or what to do when we reach them.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.000
And finally, we'll go over some of the best practices. When it comes to building our work force, Let's get started.
