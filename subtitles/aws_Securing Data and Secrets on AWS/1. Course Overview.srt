Hi everyone.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,700
My name is Danny Jessee.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,110
Welcome to my course, Securing Data and Secrets on AWS.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,470
I have six AWS certifications, including the AWS Certified Security Specialty,

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,920
and work as a senior cloud engineer and software

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,940
developer in the Washington DC area.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,970
Now more than ever,

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,730
cloud engineers must understand how to properly secure

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,110
sensitive data and workloads running on AWS.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,070
In this course,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,470
we will cover the various data encryption and protection mechanisms within

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,650
AWS and prepare you to answer questions from the data protection domain of

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,200
the AWS Certified Security Specialty exam.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,490
Some of the major topics that we will cover include leveraging the

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,200
various encryption options available within AWS Services,

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,990
creating and storing customer master keys in the AWS Key Management Service,

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,420
designing secure parameter stores,

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,070
replicating data for protection using AWS Services,

19
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,540
and identifying and protecting sensitive data using Amazon Macie.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,610
By the end of this course,

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,730
you will be able to design secure storage solutions for data in S3,

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,450
create and manage your own encryption keys, and

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,620
understand best practices for storing,

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,540
classifying, and retrieving sensitive data in AWS.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,900
Before beginning this course,

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,720
you should have some experience working with the

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,360
various security offerings within AWS,

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,490
as well as a working knowledge of AWS Services, such as S3, RDS, and EC2. You

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,380
should also have a few years of IT experience and a basic understanding of

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,490
fundamental security concepts, such as encryption.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,010
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about the data

32
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:52,000
security offerings in the AWS Cloud with this course, Securing Data and Secrets on AWS at PluralSight.
