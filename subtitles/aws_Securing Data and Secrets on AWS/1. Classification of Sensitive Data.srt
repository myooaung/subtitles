Hi.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,210
My name is Danny Jesse, and I would like to welcome you to this

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,010
module, data protection with Amazon Macie.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,360
Let's learn a little more about this unique service that

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,680
uses machine learning to classify,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,270
secure, and protect sensitive data stored in S3. Amazon Macie is a

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,420
security service that protects your data by analyzing S3 buckets and

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,240
their contents for sensitive information.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,800
And this sensitive data can take the form of personally

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,950
identifiable information, or PII, which includes things like

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,340
credit card numbers and social security numbers,

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,880
which might be found in the contents of an S3 bucket, and of course,

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,440
you may have a perfectly valid reason for storing this data in S3,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,810
but Macie will make sure you know about it.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,220
Macie will also ensure you are implementing S3 security best practices,

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,220
such as having default,

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,440
encryption enabled and public access turned off at the bucket level.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,860
You can also configure and schedule jobs in Macie to scan

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,740
the contents of objects stored in S3, including text files,

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,320
code and script files,

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,190
Microsoft Office products, and even RDS snapshots stored in

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,220
Apache Parquet format. Macie can further be customized to use

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,580
any kind of regular expression to match sensitive content that

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,540
might exist within your data.

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,920
And if you aren't familiar with regular expressions,

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
think of them as a way to specify a particular string of text or pattern that

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,240
can be matched within a document or larger text string.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,620
So there are the obvious regular expressions for things like phone numbers,

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,910
social security numbers,

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,260
credit card numbers, and even things like AWS secret keys, but if

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,340
you can define your own custom text patterns for sensitive data

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,460
that are valuable to your organization,

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,580
such as employee numbers or user IDs, you can configure Macie to scan for it.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,700
Macie will then generate alerts based on what it

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,230
discovers using CloudWatch events.

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,450
And later in this module,

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,210
I'll show you how we can automatically notify administrators about Macie's

38
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,720
data security findings or even execute a lambda function to quickly automate

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,720
the remediation of any issues Macie discovers.

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,000
So let's see this whole process in action starting with setting up Macie in the AWS console.
