1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,840
Obviously, S3 isn't the only place we can store data in AWS,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,110
and S3 is a little unique because you can enable default encryption or change

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,290
the encryption of an individual object anytime you'd like.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,140
But that isn't how most AWS services handle encryption.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,580
In this demo, we'll see the different S3 encryption options in action,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,560
but we'll also see that most other AWS services require you to

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,840
enable encryption at the time a resource is created.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,300
This goes for EBS volumes andy EFS file systems,

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,910
as well as DynamoDB tables and Redshift clusters.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,340
I'll hop onto the AWS console now to show you what I mean.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,890
Here we are in the console.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,860
I'll start by going to S3,

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,110
and you'll see I don't have any S3 buckets created yet.

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,340
So I'll go ahead and create one.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,170
I'll give it the name myawssecuritycoursebucket and then

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,840
scroll down to click Create Bucket.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,760
Now that I've created the bucket, I get this message.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,410
And I could click this link up top,

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,340
but let me show you where you can always go to set this property.

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,350
I'll click the bucket name, and up here I will click Properties.

21
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,410
And if I scroll down here,

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,430
you'll see that default encryption is currently disabled.

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,270
So to change that, I'll click the box here,

24
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,720
and you'll see the options for default encryption are none,

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,640
which is the current selection.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,140
Or I can choose AES‑256 or AWS‑KMS.

27
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,440
So you see, these are the SSE‑ S3 and SSE‑KMS options we talked about earlier.

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,810
So I can choose SSE‑S3.

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,040
Or if I choose SSE‑KMS, you'll see I have the option of selecting a key.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
We'll create some keys later on in this module.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
But for now, you see the only option is the default AWS S3 key,

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,940
or I could enter the ARN of another key.

33
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,940
But for this demo, I'm just going to select SSE‑S3 and click Save.

34
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,930
And you see now it says AES‑256 is the default encryption for this bucket.

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,330
Now if I go back to my bucket,

36
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,430
I want to add a new item and show you a little quirk of the S3 console UI.

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,630
I'm going to go into my bucket here and click Upload,

38
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,230
and then I'm just going to browse to a random file here.

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,600
And if I click Next, I'm going to see the permissions for the object,

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,080
and Next will show me the storage class for the object.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,950
But the final screen will show me the encryption for this object,

42
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,890
and here you'll see that it says no for encryption.

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,490
And although this is telling us we haven't chosen to apply

44
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,380
any encryption specifically to this object,

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,550
it does not show us that, in fact,

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,480
the default encryption setting will apply to this file.

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,070
So I'll click Upload here and select my file,

48
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,550
and you'll see under Properties that yes,

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,540
in fact, this file does have AES‑256 encryption applied to it.

50
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,150
So that's default encryption.

51
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,330
And we can turn on and off default encryption at the bucket level or

52
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,560
change the key we use to encrypt or any other options related to

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,010
encryption at any time whenever we need to.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,610
So that's S3.

55
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,010
And now I'll quickly show you some encryption options for other AWS services.

56
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,940
So if I go to EC2, I can show you the create experience for a new EBS volume.

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,640
So if I come down here and I click Create Volume,

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,840
here on the first screen, you'll see a checkbox for encryption.

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,050
And if I check that box and hit the dropdown,

60
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,710
you'll see the default option here is the aws/ebs key,

61
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,740
which is an AWS managed key.

62
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,050
When you create your own keys, as we will do later in this module,

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,510
you'll see those keys appear as options here as well.

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,120
Also note some important information here regarding the

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,910
encryption status of new EBS volumes based on encrypted

66
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,740
versus unencrypted snapshots.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,080
What this is basically saying is if you're creating a new

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,140
EBS volume from an existing snapshot,

69
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,240
it will inherit the encryption status of that snapshot.

70
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,430
If you're creating a new volume, you can decide whether or not to encrypt it.

71
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,240
But you have to make this decision at the time you create the volume.

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,800
You can only change it down the road by creating a new snapshot and

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,040
then creating a new volume based on that snapshot.

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,700
And now I'll show you the create experience for a new EFS file system.

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,960
So If I go to EFS and then click Create file system,

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,240
I can go to the next step here and scroll down.

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,340
And you'll see again, I have the option to enable encryption of data at rest.

78
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,600
And there is an important note you see here,

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,660
encryption of data at rest can only be enabled during file system creation.

80
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,630
But encryption of data in transit is configured when

81
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,840
mounting the file system from an EC2 instance.

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,870
So keep in mind that there is not just encryption at rest,

83
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,930
but also encryption in transit here with EFS with data going across

84
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,310
the network to be stored on the network file system.

85
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,260
And again, if I check the box here, just like with EBS,

86
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,410
I can choose which KMS master key to use.

87
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,390
And if I had my own keys, they would appear in this list here.

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,940
Or I can enter the ARN of a key to use from another account.

89
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,610
Now a couple of other services we'll look at quickly here,

90
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,940
starting with DynamoDB.

91
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,260
When I go to create a new DynamoDB table,

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,490
you'll see the settings include encryption at rest enabled by default.

93
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,990
If I uncheck this quickly,

94
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,380
you'll see I can also choose encryption with KMS using a

95
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,080
customer‑managed CMK or an AWS‑managed CMK.

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,770
So I don't have any customer‑managed keys here yet,

97
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,540
but I can choose to use the AWS Managed DynamoDB key here.

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,840
And as a final example, we'll take a look at Redshift.

99
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,080
So when I create a new Redshift cluster,

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,860
if I scroll down here and turn off the default configuration,

101
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,970
I can scroll down to Database configurations. And here you'll

102
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,850
see similar options, so use an AWS KMS key,

103
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,760
which could be the default AWS‑managed Redshift key or a CMK you manage

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,360
from this account or from another account. And you'll see also here a

105
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,430
hardware security module or HSM option,

106
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,840
which I'll discuss more at the end of this module.

107
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
So that's a quick tour around several AWS services

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
and how they manage encryption.

109
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,140
But the point I want to drive home is that with the exception of S3,

110
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,710
you generally have to configure encryption at rest at

111
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,900
the time you're creating the resource.

112
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,380
So whether that's an EBS volume, an EFS file system,

113
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,840
DynamoDB table, Redshift cluster, etc.

114
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,000
Now during the course of this demo, we saw KMS come up several times, so let's talk a little bit more about KMS.
