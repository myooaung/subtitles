00:00:01.356 --> 00:00:02.480
Now before we move any further,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.644
it's important to point out that there are a few minor

3
00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:09.943
differences between Spring Boot Actuator 1.x and 2.x.

4
00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.605
The actual implementation change from 1.x to 2.x,

5
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.336
they took the 1.x API and improved upon it,

6
00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:20.325
but fundamentally, the concepts are still the same.

7
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:26.827
So 1.x and 2.x vary in implementation, but conceptually, they're the same.

8
00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.832
Now I've listed a number of the differences between

9
00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:32.410
version 1 and version 2 and we're not going to go into

10
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.035
the detail into each individual 1, but I've listed them here so that one,

11
00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.566
you're aware of them, and two, you can refer back to this list if you need to.

12
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:47.828
The main focus of this course is on Spring Boot Actuator 2.x, or version 2.

13
00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:55.000
Now that we've seen and learned about what Spring Boot Actuator is, let's dive in and actually start using it.
