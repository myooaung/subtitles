1
00:00:01,049 --> 00:00:01,507
In this demo,

2
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,427
we're going to call and see the results of a number

3
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:05,851
of different actuator endpoints.

4
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:09,970
First, we need to add a bit of configuration in order for our demos to work.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,727
We need to add configuration that exposes the endpoints

6
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,869
so that we can actually call them.

7
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,460
We'll talk more about enabling and exposing endpoints in the next section.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,996
Navigate to the src, main,

9
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:24,856
resources folder and open up the application.properties file.

10
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:26,411
In the application.properties file,

11
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:31,282
add the management.endpoints .web .exposure .include

12
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:35,652
configuration and set this to a comma-separated list of all the

13
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:38,918
names of the endpoints that you want to expose.

14
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,974
For demo purposes, we'll set the value to an asterisk,

15
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:45,132
which is to expose all endpoints.

16
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:45,479
Typically,

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,200
it's not recommended to expose all of the endpoints

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,636
since it could pose a security risk, but in this case,

19
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:54,176
we're just demoing so it should be fine for now.

20
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:56,502
Now go ahead and start the application.

21
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:59,163
To do so, find the main application class,

22
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:02,066
right-click on it, and go to Run application.

23
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:06,143
Once the application is up and started, fire up a new browser window.

24
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:06,694
By default,

25
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:09,713
all of the actuator endpoints are located at /actuator

26
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:12,673
and then the id of the endpoint.

27
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,818
The /actuator part is, of course, configurable.

28
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:19,047
The first endpoint we'll call is the health endpoint.

29
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:26,855
In the address bar, type localhost:8080/actuator/health.

30
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,074
If everything went as planned,

31
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:32,224
you'll get back a very boring status UP response letting

32
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,908
you know that the application is healthy.

33
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:37,286
There's actually a lot behind this response though,

34
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:39,644
which we'll cover in the next sections.

35
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:41,922
Next, let's call the matrix endpoint.

36
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:46,036
In the browser bar, replace health with metrics.

37
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,327
You'll get back a response with all of the available metrics that

38
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,458
Spring Boot Actuator is collecting for you.

39
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,686
Now your response might look a bit different than mine since I have a

40
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:59,387
Chrome plugin that formats in pretty prints that output.

41
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,312
You can search the Chrome app store and install a similar

42
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:05,920
plugin in your browser for more readable output.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,935
Each of these individual metrics in this names array can be queried further.

44
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:14,688
In the browser bar at the end of the URL add a slash

45
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:17,899
and then type jvm.memory .used.

46
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:21,819
You'll get back a more detailed response about that particular metric,

47
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,861
in this case, the amount of used jvm memory in the running application.

48
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:30,639
We'll cover the metrics endpoint in more detail in the following sections,

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,465
as well as the next module.

50
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,927
Next, we'll cover the logger endpoint.

51
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:40,118
Modify the path so that it shows /actuator/loggers.

52
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,137
This will return a list of all of the available and

53
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,652
configured loggers for your application.

54
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:48,074
You could also use this endpoint to change the log

55
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:50,636
level of a live running application.

56
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,402
We won't specifically cover that here,

57
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:57,571
but there is an excellent example on how to do this in the actuator API docs.

58
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,388
Lastly, we'll cover the config props endpoint.

59
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,692
In the browser bar, visit /actuator/configprops.

60
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,665
You'll get back a response of all the configured

61
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,190
properties and their respective values.

62
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,000
This is a super useful endpoint for inspecting the running configuration of an application.
