On the surface,

00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:04.349
a number of the endpoints can seem like they're very

3
00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:05.939
simple in terms of functionality,

4
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.113
but you'd actually be pretty surprised to learn that they go a lot deeper.

5
00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:11.117
In this section,

6
00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:13.881
we're going to cover some of the more commonly used endpoints a

7
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:17.744

9
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:26.000
Here are the endpoints we'll cover. We'll cover the health endpoint and the metrics endpoint.
