00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to another course module. By now, the basics should be set

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,810
and we had a closer look at what makes up an Angular app.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,500
Now chances are you already encountered your first error in your app,

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,700
we even had some errors together in the apps we built.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,870
Now fixing these errors is of course very important and not always straightforward,

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,120
that is why in this section, we're going to have a brief look at the tools we have at our disposal for

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,280
fixing errors in our Angular app.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,420
Here's a little example app attached to this lecture which looks nice but won't work as expected.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,570
We are on our servers dashboard you could say

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,610
but if I click add server to add a new server,

11
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,840
watch what happens,

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,030
we get an error.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,290
Now you might get such errors a lot and generally, you might not always have your developer console open,

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,440
though for developing that's a good idea

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,550
but if something doesn't work the way you expect it to work, like here when you click the button and nothing

16
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,320
happens,

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,670
opening the console, the developer tools and there, the Javascript console is a great idea.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,310
Now here, we clearly get an error message and error messages have gotten better in Angular,

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,760
so chances are the error message is indeed helpful.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,510
So let's have a look at the error message,

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
you should find it right at the top and here it says that in app component,

22
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,150
that's the first important information piece, in the inline template,

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,110
then this would be the line number and then the column where in the line, so line 4,

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,850
now let's see if that is helpful,

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,800
that there the error was caused because we cannot read the property

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,250
push of undefined. Well, we get a couple of useful information pieces here,

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,190
so let's go to the app component then and let's have a look at it.

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,350
If we go there,

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:01,310
well the line 4 argument is only kind of helpful because line 4 is neither the problematic code in our

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,910
template nor in the TypeScript file. The report says

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,590
line 4

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,840
because in the end everything gets merged together and rebuilt, so that is where probably the code then is

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,940
triggered in line 4 in the final code but not in our code.

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,890
Still, we get one important clue here, property push of undefined.

35
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,070
So we try to call push on something which is not defined at the point of time we do call it.

36
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,690
So if we have a look at our code here, we see that there is only one place where we call push and

37
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,230
that is of course here in the

38
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,470
onAddServer method which makes sense because this is the method which gets triggered once we click the

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,030
button.

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,750
So that would have been another way of finding where the problematic code has to be as this error occurred

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,120
when we click the button,

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,040
it probably is somewhere in the method which is then executed.

43
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,560
So here there's something wrong with pushing, though not with pushing itself,

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,290
remember it said push of undefined.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,480
So the thing we're calling push on is undefined, so that would be this servers.

46
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,280
How can these servers be undefined,

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,740
we do declare it up here, right?

48
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,070
That's exactly the issue in this case.

49
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,200
We do declare it here but we don't define it,

50
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,940
we tell TypeScript,

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,050
there's going to be a property called servers but we don't initialize it.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,220
It doesn't have any value assigned to it,

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,400
it's not an empty array, it's not a string, it's nothing.

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:38,400
So to fix our code, we simply have to make sure that before trying to push a new item on servers, we set

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,660
servers to an array because otherwise, it could be anything, it's undefined in the end,

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,370
so pushing is not supported here.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,630
So what we can do is we can simply initialize an empty array at the beginning and with this little change

58
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,590
in place,

59
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,270
this should now work as expected once it reloads and we click add server,

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,590
now we can add our servers to this list.

61
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,260
So this was a brief example for a potential error message,

62
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,780
how to read it and how to try to get to the root of the error.

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Now of course, it's impossible for me to show all possible error messages and what can go wrong

64
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,560
and there are some more tricky error messages but it's always great to not panic but have a look at

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,330
the message, read which file it points to, read the exact message,

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,700
there are even error messages in Angular which are much clearer than the one I just showed you.

67
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,950
And with that, you should be able to narrow down the issue and hopefully, solve it.
