00:00:02,320  -->  00:00:08,580
We finished for now all our recipes components, let's work on the shopping list now.

2

00:00:09,020  -->  00:00:11,240
Now the shopping list component,

3

00:00:11,320  -->  00:00:20,660
if we have a look at it here in our files, here in the HTML file, we already added some content to its

4

00:00:20,930  -->  00:00:22,650
template here

5

00:00:22,760  -->  00:00:29,210
but instead of saying the list, I want to output an unordered list of type list group or of the class list

6

00:00:29,210  -->  00:00:31,940
group I should say, so using this Bootstrap class

7

00:00:31,960  -->  00:00:35,280
and in there, I want to have clickable list items,

8

00:00:35,330  -->  00:00:42,260
so I'll add an anchor tag pointing to just hash for now again to make sure it doesn't reload the page accidentally

9

00:00:42,830  -->  00:00:46,980
and then add some Bootstrap classes or one class to be precise,

10

00:00:47,120  -->  00:00:53,210
the list group item class to make this look like an item in this unordered list and I'll even get rid

11

00:00:53,210  -->  00:00:55,180
of the anchor tag here, of the ref

12

00:00:55,190  -->  00:01:01,990
I should say and therefore set an inline style to enforce a cursor which looks like the pointer.

13

00:01:02,150  -->  00:01:09,530
The reason why I'm removing this is, I will later use this like a button and therefore, I don't need this

14

00:01:09,620  -->  00:01:11,090
ref element there,

15

00:01:11,090  -->  00:01:14,720
it would simply lead to unwanted behaviors.

16

00:01:14,720  -->  00:01:20,100
So that will be a single element, a single item on our shopping list.

17

00:01:20,180  -->  00:01:25,370
Now to display something here, we need an array of ingredients though.

18

00:01:25,730  -->  00:01:34,190
So what I'll do for now is, I'll add my ingredients property here to the shopping list and this will

19

00:01:34,190  -->  00:01:35,500
be an empty array

20

00:01:35,750  -->  00:01:41,090
but now just like with the recipe, we're going to use ingredients a lot throughout our app,

21

00:01:41,090  -->  00:01:45,790
also in the recipe section, so we probably should also create a model for this.

22

00:01:45,860  -->  00:01:47,820
Let's do this in the next lecture.
