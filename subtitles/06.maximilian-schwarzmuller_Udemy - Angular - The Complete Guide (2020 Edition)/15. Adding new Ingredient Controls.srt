00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,710
In the last lecture, we added our array,

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,530
now I want to clean up how it looks,

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,680
some styling but mainly, I want to add a button which allows us to add a new ingredient to that array.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,770
Well to work on the styling, all I really want to do is I want to have some spacing between the

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,760
rows.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,790
Well, there are a couple of ways of getting this style, what I will simply do is I will add an inline style,

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,750
a normal style, no Angular style, no ngStyle directive, a

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,610
normal style where I say margin top and set this to 10 pixels maybe

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,710
and with that, it looks much better.

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,910
So that's all I wanted to do for now,

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:57,970
the more important part is that we're able to add new ingredients and for this, I'll simply add a new

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,340
button at the end of this array area,

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,360
so outside of the div which is responsible for my individual form groups, I'll add a new row with a new

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,840
column inside of it

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:22,550
and here, I will simply add a button which says add ingredient which will be of type or which will get

16
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,530
a class of btn btn-success maybe.

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,390
So now it sits directly at the bottom,

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,810
maybe let's simply add a horizontal line between rows and that looks pretty good.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,810
So now we get this button, let's now also hook it up.

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,500
I will add a click listener, onAddIngredient

21
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:50,120
and here in this method which I'll add to the TypeScript file, I want to add new control to this array

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,190
of form controls.

23
00:01:52,190 --> 00:02:03,500
Now I can simply do this by accessing my recipe form, there I can get my ingredients control and I know

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,750
that this will be a formArray but Angular or TypeScript to be precise doesn't know this.

25
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:18,020
So I will explicitly cast it with this cast command here basically by enclosing the type I want to convert

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:24,990
it to between smaller and greater than signs and then enclosing this all in parentheses

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,160
and now the part here between the parentheses is treated like a formArray because I know that it

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,910
indeed is one.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:40,940
So here I can call push and I want to push a new FormGroup because remember, we don't push a control

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,630
here, we need two inputs,

31
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,850
so a group of inputs and there again, I will have a name which is a new FormControl and I will have

32
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,230
an amount which will be a new FormControl and we don't need to provide any initial values because I

33
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,600
don't want to have any.

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:05,650
So if I save this and we go back to the application, we should indeed see that once this reloads here, if I

35
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,970
click add ingredient, we add a new line,

36
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,030
however I also submit the form with each click as you can see here on the right.

37
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,070
This is quickly fixed by making sure that this button receives the type button

38
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,460
and now it shouldn't submit the form anymore,

39
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,120
so now it just adds ingredients. This is all working, this is great,

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,240
now before we make this form submittable or we do something upon submission, let's make sure that we

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,940
add some validation to it.
