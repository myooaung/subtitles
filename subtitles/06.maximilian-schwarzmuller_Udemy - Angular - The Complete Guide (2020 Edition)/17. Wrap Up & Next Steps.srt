1

00:00:02,600  -->  00:00:05,330
So that's the first basic set up,

2

00:00:05,330  -->  00:00:07,450
of course we can improve this app,

3

00:00:07,490  -->  00:00:13,840
for example I don't want to have recipes and shopping lists component on the same page.

4

00:00:13,970  -->  00:00:20,870
We will fix this soon, first temporarily and then with a real good solution later in the course

5

00:00:20,990  -->  00:00:27,110
and I also want to have my components communicate with each other, so that we can actually store the

6

00:00:27,110  -->  00:00:32,750
content of the items in our recipe-list in their own component, that we can select a recipe here and

7

00:00:32,750  -->  00:00:35,920
load it in the detail section and so on.

8

00:00:35,930  -->  00:00:42,230
For now though, that is how far we can go with the knowledge we gathered, the blocking thing right now

9

00:00:42,230  -->  00:00:44,180
is the component communication

10

00:00:44,270  -->  00:00:48,180
and that's why we're going to dive into this in the next course section.

11

00:00:48,200  -->  00:00:52,190
See you there and then see you back in this project later in the course.
