00:00:02.490  -->  00:00:06.240
So here I am on a simple example form just to get started,

2

00:00:06.330  -->  00:00:11.850
the code responsible for it is this HTML code in the template of my app component here

3

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:15.620
and you can find this code attached to this lecture here.

4

00:00:15.900  -->  00:00:17.230
Now it's a simple form,

5

00:00:17.250  -->  00:00:23.380
we're going to expand it or enhance it with some features throughout this module, to get started,

6

00:00:23.400  -->  00:00:25.090
this is just fine.

7

00:00:25.120  -->  00:00:27.200
Now if we have a look at this HTML code,

8

00:00:27.210  -->  00:00:35.370
you will quickly realize that on the form tag here, I don't have the action attribute pointing to some

9

00:00:35.370  -->  00:00:36.070
route,

10

00:00:36.140  -->  00:00:40.740
I'm also not specifying the method attribute which typically would be post.

11

00:00:40.860  -->  00:00:46.160
The reason for this is that this form should not get submitted to a server,

12

00:00:46.200  -->  00:00:51.770
I don't want a HTTP request to be the result of me clicking the submit button, instead

13

00:00:51.780  -->  00:00:58.260
as mentioned earlier, Angular should handle this form and therefore, I don't have an action on it.

14

00:00:58.260  -->  00:01:02.820
This of course means that right now if I hit the submit button, nothing happens,

15

00:01:02.910  -->  00:01:08.640
if you have a look at the refresh icon up there, you see it's not spinning, nothing happens because we're

16

00:01:08.640  -->  00:01:10.640
not actually sending a request.

17

00:01:10.920  -->  00:01:17.910
Well we will work on this but first, let's understand what actually happens behind the scenes and how

18

00:01:17.910  -->  00:01:24.450
Angular infers such forms, create such a Javascript object for us as it does when using the template

19

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:25.250
driven approach.

20

00:01:25.350  -->  00:01:30.460
Let's understand how we get Angular to create this form object for us.
