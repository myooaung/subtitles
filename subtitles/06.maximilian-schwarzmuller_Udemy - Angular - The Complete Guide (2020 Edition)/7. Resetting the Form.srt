1

00:00:02,560  -->  00:00:05,670
So let's reset the form once we click update or add.

2

00:00:05,780  -->  00:00:11,000
Definitely go ahead and try it on your own, time to pause the video now before I will show you how I

3

00:00:11,000  -->  00:00:11,920
will do that.

4

00:00:15,040  -->  00:00:16,930
So were you successful?

5

00:00:16,930  -->  00:00:21,670
There is something tricky about that but let's start with the straightforward part.

6

00:00:21,940  -->  00:00:28,870
After we saved our updated value or either saved the updated value or the new value I should say, we can of course

7

00:00:28,880  -->  00:00:32,600
call form reset here.

8

00:00:33,150  -->  00:00:41,160
Now if I do this, let's see if it works as expected. If I type bread here, 10 and I clicks add, it resets

9

00:00:41,170  -->  00:00:42,690
so this works,

10

00:00:42,690  -->  00:00:49,100
if I select tomatoes and change this to bread, it updates it to bread

11

00:00:49,440  -->  00:00:52,070
but now we're stuck in the update mode.

12

00:00:52,470  -->  00:00:57,980
If I add bread again, maybe 12, it still updates the old one right,

13

00:00:57,990  -->  00:01:01,860
it doesn't add a new one because we never leave the editMode.

14

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:07,910
The reason for this of course is that initially, we are in editMode set to false,

15

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:13,390
then we switch it to true whenever we get the startedEditing observable to fire

16

00:01:13,650  -->  00:01:16,150
but we never switch it back.

17

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:24,450
Well we should switch it back and actually we only need to switch it back here in onAddItem, here I

18

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:28,150
can simply called this editMode and set it to false

19

00:01:28,200  -->  00:01:30,210
no matter what it was before,

20

00:01:30,420  -->  00:01:34,190
this ensures that we definitely leave it because we are done.

21

00:01:34,380  -->  00:01:43,560
Also we could rename this onAddItem to simply say onSubmit because onAddItem is not correct all the

22

00:01:43,630  -->  00:01:45,580
time but that is not important, that is

23

00:01:45,600  -->  00:01:47,750
just a little cosmetic change, also

24

00:01:47,800  -->  00:01:50,540
rename it in the template then though.

25

00:01:51,090  -->  00:01:59,480
So with this in place, if we now try this again, let's add a new item, that works, let's edit an existing

26

00:01:59,480  -->  00:02:10,450
one, bananas 2 and now let's try adding Schnitzel 1.

27

00:02:10,520  -->  00:02:14,020
Now you see, that seems to work again,

28

00:02:14,210  -->  00:02:20,260
now we can correctly update tomatoes, our items here

29

00:02:20,300  -->  00:02:24,050
and it switches between editMode and updateMode.

30

00:02:24,230  -->  00:02:30,440
Of course I also need to make sure that the delete and clear button works,

31

00:02:30,440  -->  00:02:32,660
so let's work on the clear button next.
