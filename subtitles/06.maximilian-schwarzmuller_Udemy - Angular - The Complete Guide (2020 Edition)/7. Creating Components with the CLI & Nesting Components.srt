1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,930
In the last lectures, we learned a lot including the creation of a new component by hand.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,300
Now there also is an alternative to creating it manually. When using the CLI, you can open a new terminal

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,470
window or command line, leave the ng serve window running,

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,470
that's important, don't close it

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,440
and in this new window we can use some CLI command to also create a new component.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,110
Let's say we want to have our single server components here in another component, so nested into

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,320
another component, a servers, multiple servers component.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,500
We can create this manually by adding a servers folder with our component or we use the CLI with

9
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,780
ng and there we have a generate command, which allows us to generate some elements, some elements

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,790
supported by Angular.

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,420
One such element is a component, so we can create a new component with ng generate component and

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,830
then passing the name, servers like this.

13
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,990
You can also use a shortcut and instead of ng generate component, you could say ng g c which does

14
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,580
the same.

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,940
So if you hit enter, what this will do is it will give you a new folder in your app folder with the name

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,780
of your component, servers

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,060
and in there, you basically find the same files as you had for the app component, HTML, CSS, TS and this

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,160
spec file which basically is used for testing.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,670
Now I will remove this,

20
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,120
we will later have a section about the testing and we'll have a look at the styling later too,

21
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:52,770
for now let's say it is in this servers component that we want to output our single server.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,110
Well we already have this selector, app server,

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,580
so in this template of the servers component, we can overwrite the default text with app server and maybe

24
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,250
simply replicate this so that we have two components because remember, components are reusable.

25
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,610
We can use the same component as often as we want by simply using its selector as often as we want.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,500
So now we have two servers here and with this in our servers component, you need to make sure that you

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,770
also update the app module.

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,510
Now the CLI should do this automatically which is why you already find the import and the declaration

29
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,480
in this file

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,460
but make sure you really do have it here.

31
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,610
With this, we can go to our servers.component.ts file to check the selector which is app-servers

32
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:52,080
and then we can go to our app.component.html file and update the selector to use

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,310
this new component instead of the old one.

34
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,290
With this if we now save this and go back to our application, it looks almost the same as before, we see

35
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,910
our single server component twice

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,430
but if we inspect the code here in the developer tools of Chrome for example, you'll see that we have

37
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,050
this outer app servers component, this newly created component

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,720
and in between, we have two single app server components.

39
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,710
So with that, we learned a couple of important things about how to create components manually or with

40
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:32,160
the CLI, how we can nest them into each other, that we can use components selectors in any other template

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,110
of any other component and how we can replicate components by simply using them

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,530
multiple times, using their selectors multiple times.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,940
Let's dive into how we can actually style them, what we can do regarding the style and the template

44
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,740
of components.
