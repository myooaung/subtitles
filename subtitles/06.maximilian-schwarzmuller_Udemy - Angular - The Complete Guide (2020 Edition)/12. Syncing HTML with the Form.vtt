00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.370
So we created our form,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.140
let's now synchronize it to the HTML code. For this,

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.300
first of all and that's very important,

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.620
we need to add something to the app module. In the imports array,

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:24.170
we now not only need the forms module, we'll also need the reactive forms module which needs to be imported

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.840
from @angular/forms, otherwise synchronizing with our 

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.720
HTML code will fail because we don't have access to the directives we need for that.

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.890
So therefore, what I'll do is go to my recipe-edit.component.html file and now I want to connect my form.

9
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.870
Let's start on the overall form element, here

10
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.670
we have the FormGroup directive which we should use with square brackets because we need to pass some

11
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.290
data to that directive

12
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.920
via property binding and that data is our recipe form,

13
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.190
so let's quickly assign this. Now we're telling Angular that our overall form is managed by us

14
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.630
and that Angular itself should not manage it,

15
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.030
instead it should take our form.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.440
With this, we can now assign our own controls.

17
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.910
So let's simply go to a first input, the name here and there we have the formControlName directive.

18
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.230
Now we could enclose it in square brackets and then use single quotation marks but we need double quotation

19
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:41.480
marks or we omit both and simply use this syntax and now the name here of course has to match the name

20
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.830
we set up here.

21
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.600
So here we chose a name

22
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.930
we should choose the same in the HTML code. Now I'll copy this,

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.060
also for the imageUrl, here I chose imagePath as a name,

24
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.480
so let's make sure to use this

25
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
and of course description for our text area here, here

26
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.060
I also will add the formGroupName directive and assign description. Now to be able to see something,

27
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.450
I'll also set up the ngSubmit listener and listen to onSubmit,

28
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.130
now here of course I don't need to pass the form as an argument,

29
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.280
instead I can simply add the onSubmit method here

30
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.170
and for now simply log my recipe form to the console.

31
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.250
Let's see if everything works as it should.

32
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:42.760
So once this has recompiled, I'll head over to the form and this looks OK,

33
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.010
it almost works as expected.

34
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.670
The name was pre-populated for the selected recipe and it does update

35
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.830
if we change this to big fat burger, the description is not displayed though.

36
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.790
So that is not how I want this to behave.

37
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.420
As a side note, on new recipe, it correctly sets this to an empty form, so that is OK but would be nice

38
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.660
if the description is displayed too.

39
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.320
If I submit the form, let's have a look at the value, description,

40
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.530
actually it says what else you need to say,

41
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.940
so what could be wrong about the description then.

42
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.650
Well if we have a look at the text area, I simply assign the wrong directive,

43
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.550
it should be formControlName. With this in place if it reloads,

44
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.420
this looks much better.

45
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.150
So with that, the synchronisation is working,

46
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.440
the next step is to get our ingredients to work correctly and that actually will involve a couple of

47
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.160
steps because we need to manage this array of ingredients for that.
