That is error handling and what you can do, some ideas on how to get started with error handling.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.170
For the moment, I'll switch this rule back to true so that we can work with the data again

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.360
but it is worth keeping these concepts, these ideas in mind because it can be very helpful and will definitely

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.590
improve the experience

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.270
users have on your webpage

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.730
if you properly handle errors. Speaking of handling errors,

7
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.710
one last thing we could do here, in our alert,

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.510
of course we could also add a button,

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.180
where we say OK or anything like this

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.600
and this is simply there for the user to get rid of that error message, where we then trigger onHandleError

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.790
and now in that method in the app component,

12
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.630
let's add onHandleError and there, I simply set error back to null and

13
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
this will get rid of this error alert as well.

14
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.230
Now to see that, I will indeed quickly switch back to false here again so that we can get an error,

15
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.810
so let's fetch posts, here's the error,

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.100
let's click OK, now we get rid of that.

17
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.970
Now we see loading again and that of course should also not be the case

18
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.160
and indeed, the right thing to do would be to reset

19
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.140
this is fetching property

20
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.680
whenever we get an error as well

21
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.170
because even if we have an error, we are definitely not fetching data again.

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.560
So setting is fetching to false here in the error use case when we subscribe

23
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.180
is the right thing to do

24
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.730
because even with an error, you're not fetching data anymore, so that state definitely changed and therefore

25
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.720
it should be reflected in the UI too and in your data too.

26
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.170
So now with this changed,

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.650
here's the error and if we handled this, we just see no posts available which makes more sense than loading

28
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.320
I guess.

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.130
So with that out of the way however, let's now really switch this back to true

30
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.930
and now we have an error handling strategy that is very basic but a good start.
