00:00:02.160  -->  00:00:03.540
So we're almost done

2

00:00:03.650  -->  00:00:07.560
but the delete button isn't entirely working as expected.

3

00:00:07.820  -->  00:00:14.960
It's updating the list but we're staying on the page of the deleted recipe. So to change this, we need

4

00:00:14.960  -->  00:00:22.400
to go to the recipe detail component which again is where the delete recipe button lives and in

5

00:00:22.430  -->  00:00:26.680
onDeleteRecipe, we simply need to navigate away.

6

00:00:26.780  -->  00:00:35.770
We already get the router injected here, so we can simply call this router navigate

7

00:00:35.990  -->  00:00:39.740
and now I simply want to navigate to /recipes here

8

00:00:39.740  -->  00:00:46.490
and with that, we should have the right user experience that once this updates here, that

9

00:00:46.550  -->  00:00:53.100
if I click delete here, it is deleted and we are taken back to the main view.

10

00:00:53.540  -->  00:01:05.450
So let's try this a final time here with spaghetti, searching for a fitting image for spaghetti,

11

00:01:05.460  -->  00:01:08.010
let's pick this one here

12

00:01:09.920  -->  00:01:11.980
and let's insert it here

13

00:01:14.420  -->  00:01:21.270
and let's finally enter a description, tasty spaghetti.

14

00:01:21.410  -->  00:01:28.610
Let's hit add ingredient to add some spaghetti, 10 let's say and let's save the form

15

00:01:28.840  -->  00:01:30.970
and this all works

16

00:01:31.030  -->  00:01:33.580
but one thing is not working,

17

00:01:33.580  -->  00:01:40.680
do you see which? The image, we're not getting a preview of the image here.

18

00:01:40.750  -->  00:01:45.200
So let's fix this in the next lecture before we finally move on.
