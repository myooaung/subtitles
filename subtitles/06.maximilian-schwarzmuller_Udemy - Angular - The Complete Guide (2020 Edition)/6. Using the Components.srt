1

00:00:02,310  -->  00:00:04,170
We created all these components,

2

00:00:04,290  -->  00:00:05,860
let's start using them.

3

00:00:05,880  -->  00:00:12,680
I will start using them in the app.component.html file, here where I say I'm working, here I want

4

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:15,180
to display my app recipes component,

5

00:00:15,360  -->  00:00:21,950
so the one we created here in the recipes folder and below it, the app shopping list component,

6

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:28,040
so this component here. If we save this, we see recipes works and shopping list works,

7

00:00:28,110  -->  00:00:29,900
which of course are the default strings

8

00:00:29,900  -->  00:00:31,830
the CLI gave us here.

9

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:38,130
So with these added and working here, let's now also work on the individual components here,

10

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:42,950
starting with recipes maybe. In my recipes component,

11

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:48,310
as I said in my set up, I want to have a recipes list and detail next to each other.

12

00:00:48,330  -->  00:00:56,760
So for this, I'll add a row div here and in this row, I'll add a div with the class col-md-5

13

00:00:57,000  -->  00:01:04,280
to have a smaller column on the left and then another one with col-md-7, using these Bootstrap columns

14

00:01:04,280  -->  00:01:07,800
sizing classes to have a broader column on the right,

15

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:09,820
so two columns next to each other.

16

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:15,880
Now in the first column, I want to have my app recipe-list component,

17

00:01:16,110  -->  00:01:22,710
in the second one I want to have my app recipe detail component, just like that.

18

00:01:22,770  -->  00:01:25,870
So that should place these two components next to each other,

19

00:01:25,890  -->  00:01:33,000
if we save this and have a look at our app, we indeed see list and detail below each other simply because

20

00:01:33,050  -->  00:01:39,250
due to the console, the viewport was so small and then it automatically wraps them below each other.

21

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:44,370
So if you have a normal page, they sit next to each other and I actually want them to wrap below each

22

00:01:44,370  -->  00:01:46,160
other on smaller pages.

23

00:01:46,620  -->  00:01:52,270
So this is now working too. Now in my recipe-list component here,

24

00:01:52,380  -->  00:01:56,120
as I said, I somehow want to include that recipe-item.

25

00:01:56,160  -->  00:02:02,040
So here I will later output a list of items, for now I will simply include the recipe-item here, app

26

00:02:02,040  -->  00:02:07,710
recipe item, so only the selector, which should now ensure that we no longer see recipe-list works

27

00:02:07,710  -->  00:02:13,210
but recipe-item works because that's the only content of our recipe-list component for now.

28

00:02:13,560  -->  00:02:14,910
So that's looking great,

29

00:02:14,940  -->  00:02:21,960
now for the shopping list, I'll do pretty much the same. In my shopping list component, here I want to display

30

00:02:21,970  -->  00:02:28,910
the list and above it this shopping edit area, so I'll add a row here too and in this row, so let's say with

31

00:02:28,920  -->  00:02:33,610
col-xs-10 to create a very wide column here, I'll first

32

00:02:33,650  -->  00:02:39,990
add my shopping edit component to have this editing area at the top where we can add new ingredients

33

00:02:39,990  -->  00:02:41,570
or edit existing ones

34

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:48,660
and then I want to have a horizontal line here and somehow output my list below this.

35

00:02:48,660  -->  00:02:51,930
So that's the rough setup I want to have in this component.

36

00:02:52,230  -->  00:02:53,610
So it should work like this,

37

00:02:53,610  -->  00:02:57,630
that will be the recipe-list component, later on we're going to fill this with more life

38

00:02:57,630  -->  00:03:00,750
but for now, I'm very happy with how that looks.

39

00:03:00,750  -->  00:03:02,640
Talking about how it looks,

40

00:03:02,770  -->  00:03:06,680
the header really kind of destroys our whole layout here.

41

00:03:06,720  -->  00:03:12,780
So let's work on the header in the next lecture and let's actually bring it into its almost final form

42

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:13,520
already.
