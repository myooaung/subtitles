00:00:02,410  -->  00:00:08,350
Time to take another look at directives and not only repeat quickly what we've learned thus far but also

2

00:00:08,440  -->  00:00:13,990
learn how to build our own directives and really dive into the difference between attribute and structural

3

00:00:13,990  -->  00:00:14,600
directives

4

00:00:14,620  -->  00:00:18,130
and what this star means on the structural directives.

5

00:00:18,580  -->  00:00:20,280
Well, I already said it right,

6

00:00:20,290  -->  00:00:27,190
we get attribute and structural directives. Attribute directives are called like this because they sit

7

00:00:27,280  -->  00:00:32,860
on elements, just like attributes and structural directives basically do the same

8

00:00:32,880  -->  00:00:37,250
but they also change the structure of the DOM around this element.

9

00:00:37,330  -->  00:00:44,490
If you have ngIf on a paragraph, if that condition is false, this paragraph is removed from the DOM,

10

00:00:44,500  -->  00:00:47,110
so the overall view container is affected,

11

00:00:47,260  -->  00:00:51,840
whereas on the attribute directive, you never destroy an element from the DOM,

12

00:00:51,940  -->  00:00:54,280
you only change properties of that element,

13

00:00:54,280  -->  00:00:56,480
for example the backgroundColor.

14

00:00:56,650  -->  00:01:02,980
So that is why we have attribute directives only affecting the element they sit on and structural directives

15

00:01:03,070  -->  00:01:08,200
which also affect the whole DOM or the view container, the area around the element which they

16

00:01:08,200  -->  00:01:09,930
were placed on.

17

00:01:09,970  -->  00:01:11,290
That is the difference,

18

00:01:11,290  -->  00:01:17,020
now with that let's briefly have a look at the directives we already know and how to use them before we

19

00:01:17,020  -->  00:01:21,290
then dive into building our own ones and learn more about structural directives.
