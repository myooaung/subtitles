00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,080
In the last lecture, we parameterised our first pipe here, the date pipe.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,450
Now let's learn more about all the built-in pipes and how we can configure them. The place to learn more

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,580
is the official documentation,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,180
so you can just head to angular.io and there under docs,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,280
click on API reference.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,190
Now you may ignore the version number up here, it should be 4.something at the point of time you

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,100
view the video,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm just recording this in advance

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,740
but the pipes won't change or haven't changed.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,810
So here, you can enter pipe as a filter and then you view all the pipes which are built into Angular

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,150
and there you see we get a couple of them,

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,680
we already use the date pipe and the uppercase pipe but

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,750
there also is a slice pipe which allows you to take a slice of the input and there you would see that

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:00,120
the slice pipe actually takes multiple arguments, the start and the end, so where it should start slicing

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,070
out a piece of the word and where it should end.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,140
There you can also give you a detailed explanation and an example,

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,480
so this is really a great place to dive into pipes and play around with them since there is not much

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,660
sense in covering them all in detail here

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,550
video by video as they are very specific in the use case and the documentation here is really great

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,250
for diving deeper into it.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,780
So with that out of the way, I want to have a look at the date pipe. Here

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,370
you can see how you can configure it,

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,480
you can see a couple of different shortcuts for getting a specific date format

24
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,410
or you can format it from scratch with the typical symbols like a lowercase D for a day and so on.

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,340
So this is where you can dive into how to make the date look exactly how you want it to look.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,030
Now with that, let's move on to creating our own pipe or almost move to that point

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,310
one other thing and then we'll move on.
