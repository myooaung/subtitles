1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:09,310
So here's the application we built, this project we worked on, the folder structure you already know and

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,520
let's assume that our code is already optimized and that we tested this thoroughly and therefore, the

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,530
only thing that's missing is that we deploy this application.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,570
Now before we do that, let me dive into that environment variable thing which you saw on the slides and

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:34,450
that is a feature that's actually built into every project you build with the Angular CLI. In the source

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,110
folder, you have your app folder, there

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,230
you also have an environments folder. In that environments folder, you have two files,

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,740
environment.ts and environment.prod.ts

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,720
.

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,710
Now we're not using these files but what you could do here, you see you have an exported constant

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,710
in the 

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,050
environment.ts

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,010
and in the environment.prod.ts file, it's the same constant with the same name,

14
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,640
you can add key-value pairs to that constant.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,990
For example if you were using an API that requires some API key and actually, we are using something

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,730
like this and hence I will show you how to use this environment variable in a second, if you are using

17
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:23,590
something like this, then you can store that API key here, you can import that environment constant here

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,870
into your files to use that API key and what the CLI, the Angular CLI does for you is that it

19
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,420
will automatically swap these two files when you are building for production.

20
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:44,200
So during development, this environment.ts file and the value you have in here will be used and during

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,810
production, this constant will be used instead

22
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,430
and this is swapped automatically,

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,170
you don't need to write any special code for this behavior to occur.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,470
Now why is this useful?

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,960
Well you might have certain values that differ from development to production.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,690
You might have some API keys that are meant to use during development and then you have different keys,

27
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,460
which maybe are more restrictive, for production or any other value.

28
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,100
You can store anything in here, any value which you need in your other files and you have the option

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:23,380
of using different values for production and development. Now as I mentioned, we are using such an API

30
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:34,540
key, we are using that in our auth service. In the auth service, we're sending requests to the Firebase

31
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:43,940
back-end APIs here, to sign a new user up or to log a user in and there, I'm referring to that key thing

32
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,330
here,

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,790
right,

34
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,380
we're using that Firebase API key here. Check the authentication section where I add this in case you

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,040
haven't seen this code before.

36
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,140
This key is the same here for signing users up and for signing users in and therefore, we could of course

37
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,260
manage it in a constant inside of this file

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,320
but especially if we were using that in other files as well, it's definitely worth moving that into this

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,230
environment file in the environments folder.

40
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,970
So here, I'll name this Firebase API key,

41
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,340
the name is totally up to you

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,440
and the value is then just that key-value here. Now with that stored in the environment.ts file, we

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,900
should also copy that into these environment.prod.ts file because this is the file that will be

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,300
used when you build for production

45
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,570
and now with these keys added here, you can go back to the auth service and there, you now need to import

46
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,220
these environment values.

47
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:48,470
So here, you can import environment, which is the name of that exported constant, from

48
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,360
and now you simply point at the environments folder and there the environment file, not environment prod

49
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,490
but just environment

50
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,840
and again this will be swapped automatically for you by the Angular CLI when you build for production.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,390
Now you can use that environment constant here and in the places where we are using that key, here for

52
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,820
example, you get rid of that key and instead, you add environment.firebaseAPIKey to that string

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,440
and therefore, use that as a key-value.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,030
The same of course here for signing users in, remove it here and add this environment.firebaseAPIKey

55
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,130
thing.

56
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,650
Now that's a tiny thing but the advantage here really is that you can swap values from development to

57
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,890
production, here

58
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,890
we're not doing that but of course that would be an option and it's a powerful tool that can really

59
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,060
help you with development.
