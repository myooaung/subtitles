00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,230
As mentioned at the end of the last lecture, the next goal is to implement child routing for our recipe

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:15,040
routes here, so that when we click a recipe here, we actually load it by adding let's say slash and then the

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,150
ID of that recipe in our recipes array here in the URL, so recipes 1 would load the first element

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,800
or recipes 0 actually, since we started 0 in the array and so on.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,550
So that would be great if we could load our recipes like that and render them here then,

6
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,980
so with a child router again. And the same for new recipe and edit

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,240
but for that, we will need a new component,

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,920
let's implement this in a second step,

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,400
the first step should be to make these items clickable and load the detail component as a child route

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:55,720
here in a new router outlet probably. We will also need another new component then for the case that we

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,230
first visit our page,

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,680
in this case we should have a starting component which kind of says please select a recipe, something

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,400
we right now do by displaying this template here in our recipes component, here the ng-template

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,550
but that will then also be removed because all I want to have inside of this div with the col-md-7

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:15,980
class

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,550
here is our router outlet.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,430
So again, this is a challenge for you,

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,180
try implementing this child routing or at least try to do this first steps of that.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,240
Setting up the router, creating that component which basically says please select a recipe and then loading

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,440
either that component or the detail route, the detail component depending on whether we click the recipe

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,530
in the list or not.

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,410
Certainly a challenge but also something where you can practice a lot of the things we learned in the

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,580
last lectures. Starting in the next lecture,

24
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,020
we will do this together,

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,990
so then you can see my approach on implementing this.
