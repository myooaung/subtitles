00:00:02.450  -->  00:00:04.970
So let's start working on that shopping list form.

2

00:00:05.150  -->  00:00:07.940
As mentioned, I want to use the template driven approach.

3

00:00:08.120  -->  00:00:15.960
So in the shopping list edit component here, we already got our form element up here, now Angular

4

00:00:16.010  -->  00:00:16.460
already

5

00:00:16.550  -->  00:00:23.030
take control over this and we already get the forms module added in app module by default,

6

00:00:23.030  -->  00:00:25.690
we of course will need this too.

7

00:00:26.420  -->  00:00:33.580
So with the form here, we now can start working on our form controls.

8

00:00:33.830  -->  00:00:36.890
I will get rid of these local references,

9

00:00:36.890  -->  00:00:39.550
I will no longer use that approach,

10

00:00:39.560  -->  00:00:44.140
I will also get rid of the click listener on the add button, instead

11

00:00:44.180  -->  00:00:51.310
I want to use ngSubmit to submit the form and then call onAddItem here.

12

00:00:51.350  -->  00:00:57.680
I also will get access to the form created by Angular and as you learned, we can get access by placing a

13

00:00:57.680  -->  00:01:00.480
local reference on the form element

14

00:01:00.800  -->  00:01:06.590
and now this would give us access to the form element itself but by setting this equal to ngForm,

15

00:01:06.980  -->  00:01:13.570
we get access to this Javascript object Angular created behind the scenes and now we can simply pass

16

00:01:13.570  -->  00:01:17.680
this object to this onAddItem method.

17

00:01:17.860  -->  00:01:23.290
So that is how we can submit the form but we also should register some controls.

18

00:01:23.290  -->  00:01:25.020
We get a couple of controls here,

19

00:01:25.120  -->  00:01:29.520
let's start with the first one. Here on the name control,

20

00:01:29.530  -->  00:01:33.440
I will assign a name, so the name attribute of name,

21

00:01:33.460  -->  00:01:39.850
so a lot of names here but of course the name between the quotation marks is the name of the property we'll

22

00:01:39.940  -->  00:01:48.700
later have in this form object Angular created and I will assign ngModel to this input, so that

23

00:01:48.730  -->  00:01:53.830
we register it as a control in our template driven form.

24

00:01:53.890  -->  00:02:02.350
Now for the second input, the name will be amount and then I'll also add ngModel and make sure that

25

00:02:02.360  -->  00:02:04.330
you import it from forms module,

26

00:02:04.330  -->  00:02:11.890
otherwise this is not available, so we should have this control added to our form too. And the add button

27

00:02:11.890  -->  00:02:15.950
here will submit the form because it's only button of type submit,

28

00:02:16.000  -->  00:02:24.660
the other two buttons are of type button. So in onAddItem, in this TypeScript file now, I no longer will

29

00:02:24.660  -->  00:02:30.510
use my element refs here, so I can remove these declarations here,

30

00:02:30.540  -->  00:02:36.510
I can get rid of the @ViewChild in element ref import and I can get rid of these two lines where I extract

31

00:02:36.510  -->  00:02:37.790
the data.

32

00:02:37.890  -->  00:02:43.830
I still want to create a new ingredient but now we will simply get the form here and it will be of

33

00:02:43.830  -->  00:02:45.860
ngForm, so of this type.

34

00:02:46.200  -->  00:02:54.260
Since this is the form, we will get the value of the form on the value property.

35

00:02:54.320  -->  00:03:03.450
Now we can simply use the value and access name to get the name of the ingredient and value amount to

36

00:03:03.450  -->  00:03:09.780
get the amount because name and amount were the names we specified here in our template on these input

37

00:03:09.810  -->  00:03:10.650
elements.

38

00:03:11.820  -->  00:03:13.480
Well, let's see if this works.

39

00:03:13.500  -->  00:03:23.490
If I save this and we go back to the shopping list, ng serve is still running, here if I add Bread one,

40

00:03:24.330  -->  00:03:32.220
that looks good. Works like before but now using the better approach of using the built-in tools and

41

00:03:32.280  -->  00:03:35.120
therefore building a better form.

42

00:03:35.130  -->  00:03:40.710
Now we can also take advantage of validation and so on and that is something I will do in the next lecture

43

00:03:40.720  -->  00:03:41.020
.
