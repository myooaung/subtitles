Throughout this section, you learned a lot about routing. You know how to set up routes, to load them, both

2

00:00:09.060  -->  00:00:15.630
through routerLink or programmatically, how to pass params, query params, how to use that data, how to

3

00:00:15.630  -->  00:00:18.660
load different components and much more.

4

00:00:18.660  -->  00:00:23.220
One important feature is left in this module which I definitely want to cover,

5

00:00:23.310  -->  00:00:25.110
route guards.

6

00:00:25.110  -->  00:00:35.190
So basically functionality, logic, code which is executed before a route is loaded or once you want to

7

00:00:35.190  -->  00:00:36.470
leave a route.

8

00:00:36.870  -->  00:00:38.980
Let's start with a simple use case,

9

00:00:39.300  -->  00:00:47.210
let's say you only want to give access to your server component, your single server component or the

10

00:00:47.220  -->  00:00:48.640
edit server component

11

00:00:48.720  -->  00:00:53.880
if a user is logged in. Now we're not going to add a full login functionality, for this

12

00:00:53.870  -->  00:00:59.150
we will later have the authentication section in this course but we will fake it for now.

13

00:00:59.310  -->  00:01:04.660
Still, we want to check this before any of our subroutes here,

14

00:01:04.690  -->  00:01:06.970
so servers/3, servers/1

15

00:01:07.050  -->  00:01:16.110
and then also the added routes are accessed. Now manually checking this in the onInit function of our

16

00:01:16.110  -->  00:01:22.800
server and edit server component would be very cumbersome because you would have to add it in both

17

00:01:22.800  -->  00:01:28.250
components and if you add more components belonging to the servers feature, you would have to add this

18

00:01:28.290  -->  00:01:30.200
over and over again.

19

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:37.500
So therefore, we want to use a feature built into the Angular router, running some code before the component

20

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:38.550
is loaded,

21

00:01:38.550  -->  00:01:43.200
we will use the CanActivateGuard and we will do so in the next lecture.
