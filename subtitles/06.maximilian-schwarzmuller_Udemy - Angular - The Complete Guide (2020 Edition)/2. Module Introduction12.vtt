00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.830
Thus far in our application, we always worked in the browser only.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.690
That means that we control all our data with Angular,

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.100
we store our data somewhere in memory in the browser and it also means that whenever we restart the

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.340
application, all our data is gone.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.000
It also means that we can't persist data anywhere

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.220
and of course, a typical requirement of an application you're building would be that the front-end,

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.100
so the part that runs in the browser, which is your Angular app, that this does not work standalone but

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.480
that it is able to communicate to some server to store data there, to fetch data from there, to do whatever

9
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.460
you need to do in your application

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.340
and that is exactly what we'll have a look at in this module. We'll learn how Angular communicates with

11
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.400
a back-end, with a database and so on.

12
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.520
You'll learn how to send HTTP requests and also how to transform data

13
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.480
if you need to. You might remember that observables section where I gave you a first introduction to that,

14
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.970
now we'll take a closer look.
