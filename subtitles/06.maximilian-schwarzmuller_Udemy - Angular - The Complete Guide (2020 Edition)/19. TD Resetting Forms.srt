00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,360
In the last lecture, we saw how we can finally submit the form, extract the data we want to extract, just

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,270
so that you saw this too, that you can access the value property on your form.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,800
Now let's say we did extract all the data and now we want to reset the form,

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,400
well turns out this is super simple. On our form, signupForm in this case which again is just fetched

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,240
directly from our template with @ViewChild, on this form,

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:40,010
we can call reset like this and this will reset the form and what this means is it will not only empty

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,240
all the inputs,

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,780
you could do this with setValue too as you learned,

9
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:51,410
it will also reset the state like the valid, the touched and so on, these properties.

10
00:00:51,410 --> 00:01:01,520
So now if I enter something here again like this and I hit submit, you'll see everything is empty and

11
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,920
if we inspect it, you'll see that also the classes have been reset to pristine and valid and so on,

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,320
so it's really like the page was loaded again, very helpful to know this, how to reset the forms. With that,

13
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,230
you got a great overview over how you can quickly create powerful forms with Angular, with the template

14
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,220
driven approach,

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,790
this approach might be well-suited for the majority of your use cases, during the rest of the module

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,340
though, we're going to have a look at the other approach, the reactive approach which gives us even

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,910
more control over our forms and which allows you to create more powerful forms, your own validators

18
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,120
and much more.

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,030
So let's dive into this in the next lectures.
