00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,400
One thing we haven't covered thus far in this cause is authentication.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,080
Now of course a lot of modern web applications require users to authenticate,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,290
that means to sign up and login, at least to use certain features of these applications typically

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:25,070
and it's also something we can add to our application here. Thus far in the course project, in the recipe

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,670
book,

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,680
we're not using authentication.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,510
We always interact with our back-end where we store our data in an unauthenticated way,

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,630
there is no feature in our application that would require authentication.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:42,350
Therefore in this module, you will learn how you can add authentication to an Angular application,

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:49,220
how it works and how to make sure that you lock down parts of your application or the entire application

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,630
with authentication.
