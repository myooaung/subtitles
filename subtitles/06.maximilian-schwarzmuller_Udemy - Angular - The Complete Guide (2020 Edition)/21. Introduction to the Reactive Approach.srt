00:00:02,680  -->  00:00:08,070
In the last lectures of this module, we learned a lot about Angular forms and how we can create such

2

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:10,060
a form and configure it to our needs

3

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:14,170
but remember there were two approaches, not just one.

4

00:00:14,250  -->  00:00:16,580
So we had a look at the template driven approach,

5

00:00:16,590  -->  00:00:19,580
now we're going to have a look at the reactive approach.

6

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:23,940
This approach allows you to configure your form in greater detail,

7

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:31,050
you create the form programmatically in TypeScript and whilst this might sound more complicated, it actually

8

00:00:31,050  -->  00:00:35,810
isn't that difficult and it might be what you need for your new project.

9

00:00:35,820  -->  00:00:37,940
So let's dive into this approach now.
