00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:09,720
This was a super large module and we had a thorough look at NgRx.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,320
Now as you can tell, NgRx can be complex, setting it up can be quite a lot of work

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:22,810
but as you hopefully also saw, as soon as it's set up, adding more actions, handling them with effects and

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,550
so on is really streamlined and you have a clear plan on how you handle things. Asynchronous code and

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:38,110
any side effects in the effects file, state changes in the reducer file and you hopefully also see how

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:44,560
all these pieces come together and give you one global store in your application that you can use anywhere

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,880
to access any data and dispatch any event.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:56,440
Now again, if you prefer services and subjects, that is absolutely fine, you don't have to use NgRx if

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,400
you don't want to but it can be a decent alternative to services and subjects in bigger applications,

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,190
the bigger your app grows and the more people are working on it, a streamlined approach like this can

11
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,420
be really helpful.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,190
Now I also want to point you at ngrx.io which is the official webpage of the NgRx project

13
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:24,550
and there in the documentation, you can learn way more about NgRx and also about advanced features

14
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:29,140
of NgRx because we actually only scratched the surface here.

15
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:38,840
Also search for Github NgRx and check out that ngrx/platform repository and in there, you'll

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,650
find a projects folder with example apps and this example app here combines a lot of the advanced and

17
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,930
best practice features and patterns you can for NgRx, so checking out this application also

18
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,340
is a right next step if you want to learn more about NgRx. And with that, you've got all the tools

19
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:07,550
to build powerful Angular applications, either with services and subjects or with NgRx for a streamlined,

20
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,120
highly structured state management solution.
