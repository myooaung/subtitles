00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.550
In the last lecture, we split up our app into multiple components which is great, that is why we use components

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.910
but one issue is that we need to pass data between these components.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.680
Now in the basics section, we learned about property and event binding and there we used it to, for example

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
bind the disabled property of a HTML element.

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.140
So we kind of passed the data to that element,

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.930
we passed the information that it should be disabled, that this is set to true to this HTML element. The same

7
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.900
with event binding, when we click this HTML button,

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.420
something happened,

9
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
this button emitted an event to which we were able to listen,

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.510
so it sent us some data. The same for the input

11
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.760
where we even used that data with $event if you remember this.

12
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.600
There, we get data from the input element.

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.990
This is exactly the behavior we need now with our own components,

14
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.130
we need to be able to send data into a component or receive data, receive an event and Angular of course

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.670
gives us great tools to implement this flow.

16
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.490
We can use property in event binding not only on HTML elements and their native properties and events

17
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.300
as we did thus far,

18
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.450
we can also use it on directives and we also did this with ngClass and ngStyle,

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.980
there we use property binding but and that is important,

20
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.920
we can also use it on our own components and bind to our own custom properties and custom events.

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.940
We can emit our own events,

22
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.760
that is what I'll dive into in the next lecture starting with custom property binding.
