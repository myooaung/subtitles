00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,230
Inside of an interceptor, you can not only log data,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,330
you can also modify the request object.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,910
However, the request object itself is immutable, so you can't set request URL to a new URL, that

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,920
will not work and you also get an error here.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,890
Instead if you want to modify the request, you have to create a new one, like modified request sounds

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,750
like a fitting name for the constant, where you call request clone and inside of clone, you pass in

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,070
a Javascript object where you now can overwrite all the core things. You could set a new URL here

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,400
or you could add new headers, if you want to keep the old headers by the way, then you simply do that

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,810
by using the request headers and calling append or you add new params or whatever you want.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,720
Now, I wanted to add a header here, so indeed I will access my headers and I will access the old headers

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,110
on the original request object and then simply call append and as you learned, this will return a new headers

12
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:11,230
object where I then have all the old headers but also the new headers and these will then be set here as

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,450
headers for this modified request. And here, I'll have my auth key

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,640
let's say, with xyz as a value, of course this just some made up header which doesn't really do anything.

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:31,760
And now the important thing here is, I do not forward the original request but my modified request and

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,350
that of course is a typical use case for an interceptor,

17
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,690
you change the request and then you forward that modified request and if you only wanted to append the

18
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:48,110
auth header for certain URLs, then you could use an if check with the request URL key for

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,850
example. Here I will indeed log request URL, so that we really see for which request the interceptor

20
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,080
ran

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,940
and now let's go back and let's fetch some posts for example,

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:09,640
you see the URL is being logged. If we have a look at the network, we fetch again and we inspect that request,

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,830
you'll see that there on the request headers, auth

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,560
xyz was indeed added and we should see the same if I now add a post. There

25
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,770
if we have a look at the request headers, we also see this.

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,470
So our interceptor is adding that for all outgoing requests and therefore, interceptors are a super important

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,490
and useful feature.
