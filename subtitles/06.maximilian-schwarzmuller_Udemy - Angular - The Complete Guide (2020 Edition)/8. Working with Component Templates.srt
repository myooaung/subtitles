1

00:00:03,270  -->  00:00:10,320
Thus far, we always used an external template file and we haven't done anything regarding the styling

2

00:00:10,320  -->  00:00:11,310
of components,

3

00:00:11,340  -->  00:00:13,110
time to change both.

4

00:00:13,530  -->  00:00:21,170
Now instead of using an external template file, you can also use an inline template which means you define

5

00:00:21,230  -->  00:00:22,110
the HTML

6

00:00:22,130  -->  00:00:25,680
code in the TypeScript code, sounds strange?

7

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:33,520
Well it's possible. We can do this by simply going to our servers components here for example and right

8

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:37,210
now, we point to this HTML file here,

9

00:00:37,260  -->  00:00:40,500
now we can change templateUrl to template,

10

00:00:40,710  -->  00:00:47,250
one of the two has to be present, either linked to an external template or just the template to define it in

11

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:48,240
this file

12

00:00:48,270  -->  00:00:50,750
but each component needs to have a template,

13

00:00:50,750  -->  00:00:55,160
this is the one property you have to have at all times.

14

00:00:55,650  -->  00:00:58,600
So with that, now I change it to template,

15

00:00:58,740  -->  00:01:01,790
now we can write our template code here.

16

00:01:01,950  -->  00:01:07,560
So here we could now replicate app-server, like this,

17

00:01:08,420  -->  00:01:14,810
maybe twice, we have to make sure that we don't wrap this line because this is not supported in a default

18

00:01:15,050  -->  00:01:16,700
TypeScript string

19

00:01:16,820  -->  00:01:21,200
and if I now save this, we see the same result as before.

20

00:01:21,380  -->  00:01:23,120
So it looks like nothing changed

21

00:01:23,120  -->  00:01:23,780
and that is good

22

00:01:23,780  -->  00:01:26,760
in this case because we try to make it look like this

23

00:01:26,990  -->  00:01:31,280
but actually, we did change the way we set up our template here,

24

00:01:31,280  -->  00:01:35,370
now we're defining the HTML code in this same file.

25

00:01:35,600  -->  00:01:41,120
And actually if you want to write multi-line strings here, which you probably want if you add more HTML

26

00:01:41,120  -->  00:01:49,520
code to it, you can switch from a normal string with single quotation marks to using back ticks to use

27

00:01:49,520  -->  00:01:55,540
Javascript template expressions, to be able to write multi-line strings in between there now.

28

00:01:55,790  -->  00:02:03,390
So now between the opening and closing back tick, you may actually wrap the line and now write your HTML

29

00:02:03,440  -->  00:02:10,070
code, like this. What should you use, should you use this approach here of using template or an external

30

00:02:10,070  -->  00:02:10,880
file?

31

00:02:10,880  -->  00:02:17,960
It depends, if you have not that much code, not that much HTML code, using an inline template like

32

00:02:17,960  -->  00:02:19,130
this might be fine,

33

00:02:19,130  -->  00:02:23,550
then you have all the logic in the TypeScript code and that is absolutely OK

34

00:02:23,750  -->  00:02:29,300
but as soon as you have let's say more than three lines of code in the HTML part here in the template,

35

00:02:29,510  -->  00:02:35,420
using an external file is a good idea to make it easier to follow and easier to understand.

36

00:02:35,450  -->  00:02:42,560
It is important though to keep in mind that you can use this approach, that you can inline your templates

37

00:02:42,680  -->  00:02:48,290
and very important, that you need to have at least a template in a component.

38

00:02:48,500  -->  00:02:54,500
You can omit the selector, you will later in the routing section learn a different way of loading components

39

00:02:54,500  -->  00:03:01,880
without using their selector and you don't have to add styles but templates have to be present. So that

40

00:03:01,880  -->  00:03:03,200
was templates,

41

00:03:03,200  -->  00:03:06,480
now let's have a look at the styles in the next lecture.
