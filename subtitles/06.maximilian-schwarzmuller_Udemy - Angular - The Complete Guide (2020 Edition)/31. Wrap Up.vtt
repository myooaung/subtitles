00:00:03.040  -->  00:00:05.580
Well, we're really covered a lot in this section.

2

00:00:05.590  -->  00:00:10.810
We learned a lot about routing, setting up routes, setting up child routes, navigating there, navigating

3

00:00:10.810  -->  00:00:16.480
there in code, passing parameters, passing query parameters, extracting parameters, extracting parameters

4

00:00:16.540  -->  00:00:22.390
dynamically, using guards, using different types of guards, preventing the user from accidentally navigating

5

00:00:22.400  -->  00:00:27.140
away, resolving data, passing static data, styling the links which are active

6

00:00:27.190  -->  00:00:32.350
and so much more. This is how you may use the Angular router

7

00:00:32.440  -->  00:00:38.320
we're going to use in our course project soon but I can only encourage you to play around with it, to

8

00:00:38.320  -->  00:00:40.240
really get a feeling for it

9

00:00:40.540  -->  00:00:46.120
and I will also take a closer look at these observables we used in this section so that you feel more

10

00:00:46.120  -->  00:00:48.200
comfortable using them too.

11

00:00:48.370  -->  00:00:49.160
Let's move on.
