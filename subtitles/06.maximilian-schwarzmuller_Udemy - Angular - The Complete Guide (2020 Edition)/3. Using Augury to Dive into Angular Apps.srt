1

00:00:03,090  -->  00:00:08,760
So in this section, we learn about how to read error messages and how to use the debugger with source

2

00:00:08,760  -->  00:00:09,420
maps.

3

00:00:09,420  -->  00:00:13,240
There is a third tool you can use when working with Angular apps,

4

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:15,420
it's called augury,

5

00:00:15,450  -->  00:00:18,840
so you can simply google for this, Angular Augury.

6

00:00:19,150  -->  00:00:23,910
If you click on this, you should get taken to the official webpage where you can click install which

7

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:26,020
should take you to the Chrome store

8

00:00:26,040  -->  00:00:29,970
since this is a Chrome extension. Now I already added it,

9

00:00:30,000  -->  00:00:36,270
you can add it by clicking up here on add to Chrome and once you added it, you can open it in your developer

10

00:00:36,270  -->  00:00:36,680
tools,

11

00:00:36,690  -->  00:00:42,210
maybe you need to open and close your developer tools to see it and then pick augury here. Now

12

00:00:42,240  -->  00:00:48,800
Augury is a nice little tool which allows you to analyze your Angular application.

13

00:00:48,810  -->  00:00:55,920
So if we reload our app here, we see for example all our components and here we only have one and on this

14

00:00:55,920  -->  00:01:02,040
component, you can jump into the state and see the properties of this component and also see the elements

15

00:01:02,040  -->  00:01:02,870
of that

16

00:01:03,120  -->  00:01:07,920
and for more complex applications, you can have a look at the injector graph and injection is something

17

00:01:07,920  -->  00:01:14,340
we will cover in one of the later modules but basically which will allow you to see dependencies between

18

00:01:14,340  -->  00:01:16,690
your components and your services in your app,

19

00:01:16,690  -->  00:01:21,450
again this will be taught in a later module. When we come to routing, you can also have a look at your

20

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:23,570
routes here and how they work together.

21

00:01:23,610  -->  00:01:28,740
You can check your NgModules like the app module, what it imports, what it declares, what it offers

22

00:01:28,740  -->  00:01:29,210
you.

23

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:36,060
So that is a nice little tool to understand your app at runtime, to see the app dependencies and jump

24

00:01:36,060  -->  00:01:39,650
right into them and to be able to analyze them.

25

00:01:39,660  -->  00:01:46,970
So with these tools, reading the error messages, using source maps to easily debug and using augury

26

00:01:47,070  -->  00:01:52,890
to understand the application and your dependencies, you've got a lot of great tools which should really

27

00:01:52,890  -->  00:01:59,100
help you debug your applications and create great Angular applications therefore.
