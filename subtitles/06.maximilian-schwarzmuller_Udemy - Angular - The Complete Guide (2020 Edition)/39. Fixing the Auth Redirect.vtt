00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.040
Instead it's related to the auth effects where I redirect

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.450
whenever we logged in, here when we have an authentication success which is also the case after I

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.880
auto login, I navigate.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.610
Now we would probably want to tweak this a little bit,

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.010
we should only do that if we have an authentication success outside of the auto logging mechanism

6
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.530
or to handle it differently, in auth actions, for authenticate success

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.680
we can add a new item here to the payload and that could be redirect which is a boolean.

8
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.700
Now we can go to the effects and when we auto login,

9
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.810
we can set redirect to false.

10
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.140
I don't want to redirect to that default page,

11
00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.850
I only want to do this up here in the normal handle authentication function for manual login and sign

12
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.940
up, there we can set redirect to true.

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.750
Now what's the advantage of this?

14
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.940
Now we can go to our auth redirect effect here, where we redirect after a successful login and actually

15
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.000
what we do get here is our auth success action.

16
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.510
So here we can then simply check if auth success

17
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.110
action

18
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.060
and I should set a type here to get better auto completion, the type here will be auth actions authenticate

19
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.700
success.

20
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.850
If my payload here includes redirect or it will include that but if it is true, only if it is true, I

21
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.020
will call navigate,

22
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.690
otherwise we won't. With that,

23
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.790
let's first of all login manually,

24
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.410
that works as before and now if I fetch data and I reload here on the detail page,

25
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.950
you see that now also works, we stay on the page and the data here is loaded without any errors.
