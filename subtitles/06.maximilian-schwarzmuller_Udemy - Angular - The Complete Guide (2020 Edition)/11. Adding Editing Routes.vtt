00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.790
So with child routing almost finished,

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.680
let's make sure that we can create new recipes and that we can edit the existing ones.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.260
So for this, we need a new component,

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.060
so let's generate this first. I'll use the CLI

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.580
again with ng g c and I want to store it in the recipes folder

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.110
and here, I will name it recipe-edit and I don't want to create this spec file which is why I set it

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.580
to false.

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.130
So with this ,if I shrink down the other files, we get this new recipe edit folder here with the recipe

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.060
edit component. We'll work on the content of this file after the forms section

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.960
but I already want to load it and I want to retrieve the route parameter. So to load this, what I

11
00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.290
will do is I will go to my AppRoutingModule and I will register a new route here. The first route is for

12
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.650
a new recipe,

13
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.650
so maybe new would be a good path so that we have /recipes/new in the end

14
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.900
and with that, we could load our recipe-edit component here and of course you need to add the import here

15
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.440
from the newly created recipes /recipe-edit folder.

16
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.590
Also make sure that it was added to the app module and this is done automatically as always by the CLI

17
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.440
but you need to ensure that it is added to declarations and as an import here at the top, to have it

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.860
work correctly and to be able to load it.

19
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:50.150
So with that added here, we have our new recipe route. Now I'll duplicate it to also have a :id/edit

20
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.960
route maybe, so that we have the ID available in this route because we need to load it but I want

21
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.870
to have a /edit at the end so that it's clear that we're in editMode.

22
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.290
And this is the same component, that's also the recipe-edit component,

23
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.170
I will in the component determine whether we are in editMode or not.

24
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.680
Now with this set up here, if we go back to the application and we enter /edit after this, we see

25
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.240
recipe-edit works,

26
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.090
so that's great but we will see something maybe unexpected

27
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.550
if I try to go to /recipes/new. Now we try to load the detail component and therefore, we

28
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.050
get an error because it basically failed to get a recipe with the ID new

29
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.870
and that's exactly what went wrong here.

30
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:51.070
If we visit recipes/new, due to the way how we ordered our routes, it will try to parse new as

31
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.060
an ID because the route with the dynamic ID parameter comes before the route definition where we have

32
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.540
new hardcoded into the path.

33
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.870
So we should switch these two routes, so that the new route comes before the route with the dynamic parameter,

34
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.190
otherwise how would Angular know if whatever we pass right now should be interpreted as the new hardcoded

35
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.510
path or as a dynamic parameter.

36
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.680
So with this order, now we should be able to load new without any issues.

37
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.220
If we hit enter, that looks all right and we can also still load the existing recipes. So with that, these paths

38
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.440
are set up too, the missing piece is

39
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.830
now to retrieve the ID in the recipe-edit component and to determine whether we are in editMode or

40
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.280
not.
