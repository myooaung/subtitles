1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,440
Now are you already a component ninja?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,820
We learned a lot about components, about the templates, options we have there and about the styles. I want

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,480
to focus on the last property we see in this component decorator for now,

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,310
the selector. I already mentioned that this has to be a unique selector, so that you don't overwrite accidentally

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,450
an already existing element or maybe a component made available by another third-party package you

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
use in your project.

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,000
There's one other piece of information about the selector

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,430
though, you don't have to use this type of selector. Right now, our selector is the same selector as we

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,840
use it in CSS

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:57,210
for selecting an element, so we have app-servers here as an element and this is recognized by Angular

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,050
because the selector we chose is app servers and this basically just looks how you use select elements

12
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,490
in CSS, right.

13
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,950
We select the h3 element by just typing h3 here,

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,460
we select the app servers element by just typing app servers here.

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,840
So that actually works like a CSS selector and therefore, you are not limited to selecting by element.

16
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,620
You could put this into square brackets to use the attribute selector,

17
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,190
so in CSS, you can select elements by attribute by enclosing that attribute in squared brackets

18
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,150
and now if you save this, you would see that our app actually is broken because if we have a look at

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,670
the error message, app servers is an unknown element because now, our code in Angular doesn't recognize

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,330
app servers anymore because we change the selector to be an attribute.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,220
So to make this work again, we would have to comment this out or remove it and maybe add a div or any

22
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,120
other element, a normal HTML element which has an app servers attribute now.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,240
Now with this custom attribute added now,

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,170
now the app works again because now, Angular selects the element by attribute and not by the element itself

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,630
because we changed the selector. Another alternative is to select by and I'm just going to comment

26
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,630
this out so that the code is still there for reference, to select by class, 

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,120
so with a dot at the beginning, .app-servers, again just like in CSS.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,120
So here, we can now select by class,

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,600
so let's add a new div here which has a CSS class of app-servers, which we of course could now also

30
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,380
style

31
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,240
but besides that, it's also recognized by Angular as a selector which is why we still see the app.

32
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,460
Now these are all options you have,

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:12,330
as a side note, selecting by ID won't work, that's not supported by Angular and all those pseudo-selectors

34
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,170
like hover and so on also don't work and you typically use the elements style here,

35
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,750
app servers for components,

36
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,820
we will soon learn about directives,

37
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,920
another feature where this is different

38
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,360
but for components, you typically create your own elements and therefore you don't use that style and

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,140
you don't use the attribute style,

40
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,530
instead you use app servers like an element but it is important to understand that you are not limited to

41
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:43,840
this

42
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,750
and there might be use cases where you want to use a different selector.
