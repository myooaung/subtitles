00:00:02,320  -->  00:00:06,010
So we added our routes for the edit component,

2

00:00:06,010  -->  00:00:11,980
now let's go to that component and retrieve the ID and therefore determine whether we are in editMode

3

00:00:12,010  -->  00:00:13,480
or not.

4

00:00:13,480  -->  00:00:21,610
I will inject the ActivatedRoute in there as you learned it before from @angular/router and in 

5

00:00:21,610  -->  00:00:22,230
ngOnInit,

6

00:00:22,240  -->  00:00:29,050
this is a good place to now retrieve the ID. As before, I want to do this dynamically,

7

00:00:29,070  -->  00:00:33,730
so I will use my route and the params observable and subscribe to that

8

00:00:33,820  -->  00:00:41,080
and here I will receive my params which are of type params and here I then want to retrieve the ID

9

00:00:41,200  -->  00:00:43,510
on which I'm currently working.

10

00:00:43,510  -->  00:00:50,500
I will store the ID here in a property named or not named, named ID but of type number,

11

00:00:50,530  -->  00:00:59,380
so here I will set this ID equal to plus to convert it into a number, params ID because that's the name

12

00:00:59,380  -->  00:01:03,200
of our dynamic parameter in our route set up, right?

13

00:01:03,640  -->  00:01:07,150
With that, we retrieve that ID here

14

00:01:07,180  -->  00:01:11,850
but I also want to find out whether I'm editing the recipe or creating a new one.

15

00:01:11,980  -->  00:01:16,180
I actually want to store this information in a new property, editMode

16

00:01:16,180  -->  00:01:18,700
maybe, I'll set it to false initially,  

17

00:01:18,730  -->  00:01:22,370
so initially you could say we assume that we are creating a new recipe,

18

00:01:22,390  -->  00:01:24,360
we are not in editMode.

19

00:01:24,940  -->  00:01:29,170
Now I will check this whenever the parameters change,

20

00:01:29,320  -->  00:01:32,080
then I will assign a new value to editMode

21

00:01:32,230  -->  00:01:36,430
and here I will simply assign the value of the following check,

22

00:01:36,490  -->  00:01:44,470
I want to see if params has an ID property. So if it has one, then this will actually be a string with

23

00:01:44,470  -->  00:01:47,720
the ID, otherwise it will be undefined.

24

00:01:48,100  -->  00:01:52,770
So by comparing it to null and checking if it is not null, I'm checking

25

00:01:52,780  -->  00:02:02,050
does it have the ID because params and that there, the ID will only be not undefined if we are in edit

26

00:02:02,050  -->  00:02:04,700
mode because then an ID will be present.

27

00:02:04,990  -->  00:02:07,150
If this check returns true,

28

00:02:07,210  -->  00:02:14,380
so if the ID indeed is undefined and therefore equal to null, this will return false because I'm checking

29

00:02:14,380  -->  00:02:21,820
the opposite and therefore, we are in new mode. And we can check this by simply logging it in the console

30

00:02:21,820  -->  00:02:23,080
here, editMode,

31

00:02:23,230  -->  00:02:28,690
let's see if this works. We're at zero edit here and it returns true

32

00:02:28,780  -->  00:02:32,370
and now we're at new and it returns false.

33

00:02:32,410  -->  00:02:33,690
So that seems to work,

34

00:02:33,700  -->  00:02:38,140
this is a nice way of checking in which mode we are.

35

00:02:38,140  -->  00:02:43,250
So with that, we are able to retrieve the ID of the element we want to edit and to find out whether we are

36

00:02:43,250  -->  00:02:45,060
in editMode or not,

37

00:02:45,190  -->  00:02:51,310
now I want to make this edit link here work and the new recipe link because these are both things which

38

00:02:51,340  -->  00:02:52,870
are not working as of now,

39

00:02:52,870  -->  00:02:54,800
let's work on this next.

40

00:02:54,850  -->  00:03:00,070
And actually this is a nice challenge for you, make these links work.

41

00:03:00,070  -->  00:03:08,140
Make sure that when we click this link or this button, we get taken to the recipes new page or the recipes

42

00:03:08,200  -->  00:03:11,680
edit page for that respective recipe we had loaded.

43

00:03:11,680  -->  00:03:16,350
It's a nice challenge for you, in the next lecture we can view my solution together.
