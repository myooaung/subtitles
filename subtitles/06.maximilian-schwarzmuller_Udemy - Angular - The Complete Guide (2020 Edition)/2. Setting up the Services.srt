00:00:02,580  -->  00:00:06,060
So let's add some services manually.

2

00:00:06,060  -->  00:00:12,690
Now we should place the services next to the feature or in the folder holding the feature they belong

3

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:13,690
to.

4

00:00:13,710  -->  00:00:19,480
So if we create a recipe service, the recipes folder looks like a good place for it.

5

00:00:19,500  -->  00:00:22,550
So here, I'll add a recipe service

6

00:00:22,980  -->  00:00:29,550
and of course the file is named recipe.service.ts due to that and here I'll simply export

7

00:00:29,550  -->  00:00:32,540
a class which is named recipe service.

8

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:36,000
Remember, a service simply is a TypeScript class,

9

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:41,790
you don't need to add any special decorator to it, at least not if you don't plan on injecting a service

10

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:43,200
into the service.

11

00:00:43,770  -->  00:00:46,580
Well and the same for the shopping list service.

12

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:50,280
I'll place it in the shopping list folder, here

13

00:00:50,310  -->  00:00:54,050
I'll name it shopping-list.service.ts, 

14

00:00:54,060  -->  00:00:56,080
that's the file name

15

00:00:56,100  -->  00:01:02,060
and then inside the file of course, I'll export a class named shopping list service.

16

00:01:02,160  -->  00:01:05,720
So these are the two service files.

17

00:01:05,790  -->  00:01:09,710
Now let's start working on the recipe service first,

18

00:01:09,720  -->  00:01:12,890
let's start working on it in the next lecture.
