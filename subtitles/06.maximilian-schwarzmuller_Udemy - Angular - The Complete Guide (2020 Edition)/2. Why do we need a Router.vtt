00:00:02.810  -->  00:00:06.070
Attached to this lecture, you find this example project here.

2

00:00:06.230  -->  00:00:11.420
Now on the first look, it might look nice but it has one fundamental issue,

3

00:00:11.420  -->  00:00:13.620
we can't switch the pages here.

4

00:00:13.760  -->  00:00:20.000
We get some tabs at the top but these tabs are not working and therefore what we see on this home page

5

00:00:20.090  -->  00:00:22.110
are actually all the components

6

00:00:22.160  -->  00:00:28.550
I later want to split up over multiple pages or multiple pages in quotation marks I should say in this

7

00:00:28.550  -->  00:00:32.750
module. We do have a home, a servers and a users page

8

00:00:32.750  -->  00:00:38.440
and as you can see here, we got users, servers and the home page on the same page.

9

00:00:38.450  -->  00:00:45.220
So that is something we can improve but it would be nice to have separate pages as I said,

10

00:00:45.260  -->  00:00:49.730
so a /users page or a /servers page and so on.

11

00:00:49.730  -->  00:00:55.310
So this is what we're going to work in this module and for this, we need routes, we need the Angular

12

00:00:55.310  -->  00:01:02.090
router and the Angular router needs to know which routes our front-end application has.

13

00:01:02.090  -->  00:01:07.790
So you might know this pattern from a full-stack application where you also register some routes the

14

00:01:07.790  -->  00:01:09.270
user can then visit,

15

00:01:09.470  -->  00:01:13.800
we can do the same in Angular and we will do this in the next lecture.
