00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:08,050
We're nearing the end of the first part of this section, the template driven approach,

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,030
there are still some things I want to show you, for example how to work with radio buttons.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:19,620
We don't have any radio buttons in our form as of now, so let's add some. Let's add a property in the app

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,700
component first with some genders.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,790
So this is simply an array where I have male and female and I don't want to insult anyone, I know there

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:33,810
are more genders nowadays, I'm going to go with the classic approach here just to keep it simple.

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,030
We have this genders array and now with that array, I want to output genders here,

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,170
so let's say below our

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,730
your reply paragraph here, I'll add a new div with a class of radio

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,230
and this div should be replicated for all the genders.

11
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,580
So I'm going to loop through my genders, maybe bind it to a gender variable and this is just a setup

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,880
of Bootstrap uses to give this some nice styling, of course

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,950
use any other setup to style your radio buttons here. I'm looping through all the genders

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,270
and now again in the bootstrap world, to create a nice looking radio button,

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,940
I'm going to wrap it in a label, this input here which is of type radio

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,460
and I'm going to wrap this over multiple lines too, just to make it all super simple to read and to understand

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,800
and here I will give it a name of gender because in a radio button, I can only select one of them in a group, 

18
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,430
so

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,360
the name should be gender for whichever button is selected and I will place ngModel on it to make

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,670
it a control

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,230
and I will prepopulate or I set the value of this button equal to gender,

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,430
so this variable of my ngFor loop.

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,960
Now with that if we save this, we should see that we have some gender buttons, to output a text,

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,600
I need to add it here after my input.

25
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,370
So again, gender here

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,200
like that

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,560
and now we have male and female here

28
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,830
and if I just enter something so that I can submit the form and I pick male here, you will see that on

29
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,720
the value object here,

30
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:27,450
we got gender which is male and of course if I pick female, this will, you guessed it. be set to female.

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,300
So this is how you can easily incorporate radio buttons by binding or by placing ngModel on the

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,320
input as always, setting the value, of course you could also hardcode the value and that well makes

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,630
it usable just like any other input.

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,480
And if you want to set it to a default gender of course, you can use one-way binding again to make sure

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,070
that one of the two buttons is selected by default at the start

36
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:02,360
when you load the form. You can also of course add the required directive or attribute to that input

37
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,310
here to make sure that now the form will not be valid until one of the two has been selected,

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,620
so that works just like on any other input.

39
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,490
So I just want to highlight this because radio buttons can look like a very special case,

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:24,870
they aren't, they are used like any other input when using the template driven approach in your Angular

41
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,410
app.
