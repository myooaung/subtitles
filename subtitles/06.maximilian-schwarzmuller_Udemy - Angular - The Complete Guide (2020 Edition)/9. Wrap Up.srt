00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:09,520
That's it for observables. You saw how you can build your own observable, to basically get an idea of

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,490
what's happening behind the scenes, how you can subscribe to it and provide different functions to do

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,690
different things for data, errors or the observable being completed.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,930
You learned about operators which you add by using the pipe method on the observable and then by

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,810
adding the operators you import from rxjs/operators, which are tools that might not look

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,240
super useful right now but which will actually become quite handy throughout the course since they make

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,960
it easy for us to build nice code structures where we have a clear chain of steps we want to execute

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,990
on the data we're getting let's say from a server and therefore, they're really powerful. And you learned

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:56,470
about subjects, which are in the end a better event emitter you could say. And with that, you have a

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,100
thorough foundation about observables. Now also check out the advanced resources you find in the last

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,170
lecture of this module and which l already show throughout this module if you want to dive way

12
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,970
deeper but with that, we now have all the preparation to continue with the course.
