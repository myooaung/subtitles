00:00:03.070  -->  00:00:06.440
So throughout the section, you learned a lot about components,

2

00:00:06.460  -->  00:00:08.740
we really had a deep dive on them.

3

00:00:08.740  -->  00:00:14.590
You learned how to use data binding with custom properties and events, how to pass data around, how to access

4

00:00:14.590  -->  00:00:20.680
elements in your DOM, how to use local references, how to really create a dynamic app and how to use

5

00:00:20.680  -->  00:00:25.230
lifecycle hooks to run some code at specific points of time.

6

00:00:25.350  -->  00:00:31.740
With that, a lot of core features of Angular have been set now, have been taught,

7

00:00:31.780  -->  00:00:37.190
now it's time to of course practice them in the recipe book in the next module where we will enhance

8

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:38.900
it as with our new knowledge

9

00:00:39.010  -->  00:00:42.700
and of course to play around with that knowledge in your own apps.

10

00:00:42.700  -->  00:00:47.770
So let's move onto the recipe book before we dive deeper into directives.
