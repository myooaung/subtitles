1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,780
So that's it for the HTTP module,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,730
quite a long module where you learned a lot about the Angular HttpClient.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,930
Now the most common task you will do is of course that you send requests by using post, get

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,790
and so on by adding a URL, possibly a request body and maybe some request headers.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,860
This will be your bread and butter thing and therefore this is the task you should practice and you

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,790
should feel confident about. Always remember that these methods, like get and post give you back an

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,790
observable to which you have to subscribe to actually kick of the request and to send it. Since it

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:47,170
is an observable, you can use operators, rxjs/operators to transform the data, log data, catch

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,470
errors or whatever you want to do but ultimately, you need to subscribe and you can do this in a service

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,110
or in a component depending on where you need to work with the response and in the subscribe method,

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,530
you pass in a function to handle the data you get back and possibly also an error handling function,

12
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,850
like this one.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,600
This is how you generally work with HTTP requests.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,990
Now you've got advanced features, like the possibility of setting what you want to observe if you are

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:27,010
interested in the response or just the body of the response or all the events, which type of data should

16
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,970
be returned,

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,720
you can set query params and you have that very useful features, auth interceptors which can really help

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,080
you save time and code if you have some header that needs to be appended to every outgoing request for

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,040
example

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,470
and as I already mentioned, we'll see interceptors in action again later in the course

21
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,910
once we add authentication. For now, this is it,

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,270
let's now move on to the course project and practice using these HTTP requests there.
