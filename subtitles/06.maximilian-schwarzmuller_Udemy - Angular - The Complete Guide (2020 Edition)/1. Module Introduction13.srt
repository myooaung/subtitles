00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,760
Let's now apply our newly gained knowledge about sending HTTP requests in our course project.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,090
So here's the recipe book as we left it after the last course project section and now my goal is to make

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,770
sure that we can actually click these manage save data and fetch data buttons to save all our recipes

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,880
on a server in the web and with the fetch data button, of course to fetch them.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,350
So the idea is pretty simple, the idea simply is that we can store and fetch all our recipes we created

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,370
on demand.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,790
Now obviously, you can alter this in a lot of different ways, you could auto fetch any recipes whenever

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,310
the application starts or anything like that,

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,030
the core thing we'll handle in this section of course is the sending of the HTTP requests.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,550
So let's take care about this

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:52,890
now.
