Angular is a framework which allows you to create reactive, single page applications. This sounds great, but
1

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.020
what exactly does it mean?
2

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.070
A Single Page Application (SPA) is an application like the one shown here;
3

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.270
the project we're going to build throughout the course. You can navigate around and in the URL,
4

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.150
you can see that we seem to visit different pages,
5

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.140
but in the end, our page never changes.
6

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.270
It's only one HTML file and a bunch of JavaScript code we got from the server and everything which you see
7

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.340
here, every change, is rendered in the browser.
8

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.780
Now, why is that awesome?
9

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.600
It gives the user a very reactive user experience (UX).
10

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.030
JavaScript is much faster than having to reach out to a server for every page change and for every new
11

12
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.880
piece of data you want to display. Therefore, this approach allows you to create web applications
12

13
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.800
which look and feel almost like mobile applications; very fast!
13

14
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500
Everything happens instantly.
14

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.490
If you do need some data from a server, you simply load it in the background so that the user
15

16
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.430
never leaves this experience of having a reactive web application to use.
16

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.360
So every click I do here simply changes this one single page
17

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.980
we're using; this one HTML page.
18

19
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.340
So, how is this done?
19

20
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.230
Well, JavaScript changes the DOM, changes whatever is displayed here (in the browser), by changing the HTML code during runtime
20

21
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.480
(so to say). That is why you never see the refresh icon on the top-left spin; because we're only changing
21

22
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.580
the currently-loaded page. You can even see that if you inspect the source code of a page like this.
22

23
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.770
That is the HTML file
23

24
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.310
and as you can see, it doesn't seem to contain the content you are seeing on this page.
24

25
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.030
We only have one single HTML element which doesn't seem to be a built-in one (a native one), but that's Angular
25

26
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.050
doing its job.
26

27
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.620
Throughout the course, you're going to learn exactly what happens here and how Angular does this job.
