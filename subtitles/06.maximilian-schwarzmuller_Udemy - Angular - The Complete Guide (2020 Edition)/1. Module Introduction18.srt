Welcome to this bonus module.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,720
Now in this course, you already learned a lot about Angular and actually, we already went through all

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,820
the important fundamentals you've got to know. Now

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,880
this is a bonus module and it is about a topic, NgRx, which is also maintained or developed by

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:30,610
parts of the official Angular team, which can help you with state management in bigger Angular applications.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,010
So let's first of all have a look at which problem it tries to solve and then we'll have a detailed

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:43,930
look at how you use NgRx to manage your application state in a maybe more streamlined and elegant

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,290
way.
