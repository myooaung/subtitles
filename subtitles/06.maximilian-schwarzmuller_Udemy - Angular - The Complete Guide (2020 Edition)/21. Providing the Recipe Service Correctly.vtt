00:00:02.240  -->  00:00:06.740
The bug we recognized in the last lecture is a pretty mean one.

2

00:00:06.740  -->  00:00:15.590
If we add a new recipe here, we hit save and we go to shopping list and go back,

3

00:00:15.600  -->  00:00:18.790
you see it's lost, it's gone again,

4

00:00:18.810  -->  00:00:22.760
test test and gone.

5

00:00:22.760  -->  00:00:24.320
So what's happening here?

6

00:00:26.080  -->  00:00:34.510
The issue we encounter here is that we provide our recipe service in the recipes component,

7

00:00:34.750  -->  00:00:39.520
so all the components in this area share the same instance

8

00:00:39.820  -->  00:00:47.650
but if we navigate away to the shopping list area, the recipes component is destroyed and so is the instance

9

00:00:47.650  -->  00:00:49.640
of this service.

10

00:00:49.660  -->  00:00:57.010
So what we need to do to ensure that our service survives is we need to add it to our app module here

11

00:00:57.850  -->  00:01:07.840
by adding it to here, recipes service, recipe service and adding the import too, we make sure that now we

12

00:01:07.840  -->  00:01:11.530
have one instance of the service all the time available

13

00:01:11.530  -->  00:01:13.800
as long as our app is running.

14

00:01:13.900  -->  00:01:22.360
So now if we add the spaghetti one more time with our beautiful image, very tasty as mentioned before

15

00:01:22.700  -->  00:01:24.430
and I hit save,

16

00:01:24.520  -->  00:01:27.850
now if I come back, it's still there

17

00:01:27.850  -->  00:01:30.270
and as you can see, I can still edit it.

18

00:01:30.700  -->  00:01:32.290
So this is now working,

19

00:01:32.350  -->  00:01:36.020
now we can try putting it to the shopping list which of course doesn't add.

20

00:01:36.040  -->  00:01:40.040
We first of all have to add some ingredients like spaghetti

21

00:01:40.300  -->  00:01:43.550
but now this is working as expected,

22

00:01:43.810  -->  00:01:45.820
well almost.

23

00:01:45.820  -->  00:01:54.150
With the remaining bug that here once we clicked this X button, we're not deleting the ingredient,

24

00:01:54.310  -->  00:01:56.970
so that's something we should also have a look at.
