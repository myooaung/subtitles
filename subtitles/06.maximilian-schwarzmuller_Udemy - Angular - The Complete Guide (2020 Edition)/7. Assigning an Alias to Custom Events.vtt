In the last lecture, you learned how to use @output to enable other components to listen to your

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.540
own custom events which you could create with eventEmitter.

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:20.300
Now just like on @input, on @output you also can assign an alias but here for blueprintCreated,

4
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.840
maybe you want to name this bpCreated. Now with this,

5
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.770
this is the event you can listen to from outside.

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.820
So in the app component where we try to listen, we now need to rename it here to and listen to be bpCreated,

7
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.940
which is now just like on @imput,

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.880
the one and only event you can listen to when it comes to this blueprintCreated event.

9
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.730
The other name, blueprintCreated here will not be exposed to the outside anymore, so it has to be

10
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.240
bpCreated now.

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.170
All the rest stays in touch and works just like before.
