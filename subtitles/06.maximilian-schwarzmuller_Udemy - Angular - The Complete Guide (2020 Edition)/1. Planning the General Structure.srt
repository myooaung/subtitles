00:00:01,960  -->  00:00:04,030
Welcome back to the Recipe Book.

2

00:00:04,030  -->  00:00:09,660
Now that we learned about routing in the last course section, it's time to add it to our recipe book

3

00:00:09,690  -->  00:00:11,020
course app.

4

00:00:11,180  -->  00:00:17,020
This is the structure of our app thus far and we already get a lot of components and so on.

5

00:00:17,100  -->  00:00:23,940
Right now we implemented the navigation in our application with ngIf though and that is not really the

6

00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:26,000
best way of navigating around,

7

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:32,880
instead I want to use the Angular router to load pages and to allow the user to switch between pages.

8

00:00:33,120  -->  00:00:33,960
In this section

9

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:40,920
however, we will not only add the router, we will also add one new component, the recipe-edit component

10

00:00:41,250  -->  00:00:44,560
because now that we have a way of loading different pages,

11

00:00:44,580  -->  00:00:51,420
we can also add this, this is the component which we will fill with some life after the form section in this course

12

00:00:51,510  -->  00:00:55,520
which will then allow us to create new recipes or edit existing ones.

13

00:00:55,560  -->  00:01:02,460
So I want to set up routing in this section and we definitely need routes to load either the shopping

14

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:04,090
list or the recipe book

15

00:01:04,230  -->  00:01:11,310
but inside of the Recipe Book section of the app, I want to have some child routes targeting the recipe

16

00:01:11,310  -->  00:01:13,710
detail or recipe-edit component.

17

00:01:13,940  -->  00:01:20,040
These components which will always be loaded on the left side of our list of recipes should be loaded

18

00:01:20,040  -->  00:01:23,320
dynamically and only one of the two should be loaded at a time,

19

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:25,070
therefore child routing.

20

00:01:25,200  -->  00:01:27,580
So that is the general structure,

21

00:01:27,660  -->  00:01:32,470
let's now put this into practice and build our application, add routing to it

22

00:01:32,520  -->  00:01:34,170
starting in the next lecture.
