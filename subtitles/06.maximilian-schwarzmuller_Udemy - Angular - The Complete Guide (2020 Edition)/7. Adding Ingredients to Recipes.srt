1

00:00:02,180  -->  00:00:08,810
We're almost finished, our application is taking shape and services really improved it.

2

00:00:08,850  -->  00:00:16,320
Now I want to do something here on the recipe section, I want each recipe to have some ingredients, so

3

00:00:16,320  -->  00:00:22,680
we need to implement this and thereafter, I want to make these two shopping list buttons work, so that

4

00:00:22,680  -->  00:00:31,870
we can send our ingredients to the shopping list. So to do this, what I will do is first of all, I will

5

00:00:31,870  -->  00:00:35,560
work on the recipe model,

6

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:38,590
it should now also have ingredients.

7

00:00:38,890  -->  00:00:40,440
So this will be of type

8

00:00:40,430  -->  00:00:46,440
ingredient array, ingredient of course needs to be imported from the respective model file in the

9

00:00:46,440  -->  00:00:47,620
shared folder

10

00:00:48,440  -->  00:00:54,680
and when we create a new instance of this model, I expect to get some ingredients here.

11

00:00:54,710  -->  00:01:00,800
Again, this will be of type ingredient array, so that here we can assign ingredients equal to the ingredients

12

00:01:00,830  -->  00:01:02,670
we get as an argument here.

13

00:01:03,140  -->  00:01:09,520
So with that, we are prepared to have some ingredients, now in the recipe service, I also need to add some

14

00:01:09,520  -->  00:01:10,340
here.

15

00:01:10,580  -->  00:01:15,890
So when we create a new recipe and I simply structure this over multiple lines to make it easier to

16

00:01:15,890  -->  00:01:23,220
read, I also now will pass an array of ingredients, the same for the second recipe here

17

00:01:24,520  -->  00:01:28,540
and now I guess it's time to also turn this into some real recipe,

18

00:01:28,540  -->  00:01:30,670
so let me quickly do this.

19

00:01:30,670  -->  00:01:36,130
So I quickly changed the pictures in the text to have a schnitzel and a burger here and now let's add

20

00:01:36,130  -->  00:01:41,580
some ingredients here in this array of ingredients. We can use the ingredient constructor for this

21

00:01:41,620  -->  00:01:47,440
and of course we need to import the ingredient type here from the model file located in the shared folder

22

00:01:47,440  -->  00:01:48,200
for that

23

00:01:48,550  -->  00:01:54,000
and now for the Schnitzel, let's say we need the meat, with an amount of one maybe

24

00:01:54,220  -->  00:02:03,520
and then we also want to have some french fries here, now let's say exactly 20, with one extra it would probably

25

00:02:03,520  -->  00:02:04,060
not taste

26

00:02:04,060  -->  00:02:05,640
well I guess. So

27

00:02:05,650  -->  00:02:12,600
now with the array for the burger, here we need a new ingredient, we need the buns,

28

00:02:12,710  -->  00:02:16,470
so the bread basically, let's say 2

29

00:02:16,810  -->  00:02:20,230
and we also want to have the meat here, of course

30

00:02:20,230  -->  00:02:22,550
feel free to add more ingredients.

31

00:02:22,600  -->  00:02:31,240
So now that we added that in the recipe detail component, here where we have this ingredients placeholder,

32

00:02:31,560  -->  00:02:34,370
we can actually now output them here.

33

00:02:34,450  -->  00:02:41,330
So let's add something here, let's add an unordered list with a class of list-group

34

00:02:41,420  -->  00:02:50,600
and now here I want to add a list-group-item. This item here will actually be replicated because again,

35

00:02:50,630  -->  00:02:53,230
this will of course be my ingredient.

36

00:02:53,340  -->  00:02:59,730
So here, ngFor and now I will loop through all the ingredients, so ingredient of

37

00:03:00,020  -->  00:03:06,420
and now of recipe ingredients of course because remember in the recipe detail component, we have a recipe

38

00:03:06,660  -->  00:03:10,480
and that has some ingredients since a couple of seconds at least.

39

00:03:10,830  -->  00:03:18,690
So now, we can simply use string interpolation here to output the ingredient name and then maybe separated

40

00:03:18,840  -->  00:03:21,840
by a dash, the amount,

41

00:03:21,840  -->  00:03:24,890
of course any format you like.

42

00:03:25,020  -->  00:03:26,640
So that's the first step,

43

00:03:26,640  -->  00:03:31,850
now if we select a recipe, we see a list of ingredients at the bottom.

44

00:03:31,860  -->  00:03:34,560
Now I want to send these to the shopping list

45

00:03:34,590  -->  00:03:37,100
if I click this to shopping list button.

46

00:03:37,350  -->  00:03:39,950
So that is what we'll work on in the next lecture.
