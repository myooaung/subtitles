1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,130
Let's use our newly created ingredient model,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,180
so just like with recipe, we can now define the type for our ingredients array and this will be of type

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,480
ingredient array and of course for this, we have to import ingredient,

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,010
so let's quickly do this from

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,710
and now we have to move up one folder so that we are in the app folder and then we have to go into the

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,010
shared folder and there, it's in the ingredient.model file, without the file extension.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,570
With that, we can now create one first ingredient,

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,650
so let's use our ingredient constructor and we have to pass name and amount here.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:51,200
So the name could be apples and we want five let's say and then let's also say we want to have some

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,500
tomatoes, maybe 10.

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,540
That is our shopping list for now,

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,580
now we want to output it here in the component. So we get an anchor tag here which represents a single

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,640
item and now you could put this into its own component too

14
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,590
but since this is going to be such a straightforward easy item, I don't see much sense outsourcing it

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,960
into its own component, though it wouldn't necessarily be bad to do so

16
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,170
but I also don't see a great advantage,

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,940
there also isn't a lot of business logic attached to this.

18
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,100
So I will place ngFor on this anchor tag to loop through all the ingredients,

19
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:41,630
so ingredient of ingredients and now we can output the ingredient data here inside our anchor tag.

20
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,570
So it makes sense to output the ingredient name I believe

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,090
and then maybe in parentheses thereafter and these parentheses here are no Angular syntax, that is

22
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,980
normal text here I'm outputting, inside the parentheses,

23
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:06,550
I'm going to use string interpolation to also output ingredient amount. With that if we now save this,

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,940
we already see our shopping list here at the bottom,

25
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,100
the last missing piece I want to add is this shopping list edit section here which should display us

26
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,480
an input field which then allows us to actually edit our items or add new ones, at least later in the

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,870
course,

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,110
it will add this functionality.
