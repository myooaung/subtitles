If I do fetch my recipes and I try to edit one of them, for example I want to add an exclamation mark

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,570
here,

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,370
you'll see that these changes are not saved and

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,780
the reason for that is the resolver which is used whenever we visit the recipe detail route.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,380
It fetches new recipes from the server and that simply overwrites our existing recipes, including our

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,390
changes to these recipes.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:32,920
Now the solution is to first check whether we do have recipes and only fetch new ones if we don't.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,250
So I can inject my recipes service here

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,400
like this, import it from recipe service.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:52,660
With this injected, we can get our recipes from this recipe service get recipes

11
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,590
and now we can check if recipes length is equal to zero,

12
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,390
then this means we have no recipes and we should fetch them, otherwise

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,480
if this is not zero, we can just return these recipes because then, we do have recipes so no need

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:15,280
to fetch them again. With that change, we can still reload the page whilst we're on it but we can also

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,960
of course reload the app somewhere else and just fetch data

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,200
but now if I edit this, indeed the changes are saved. If I reload and I

17
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,120
then get my old data because I didn't save them to the server before my changes but they were saved

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,860
locally and if I would have chosen save data, we would have also saved them on a server.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,820
So this is a tiny adjustment which we should make to avoid strange bugs.
