00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,520
So we learned so much about Angular throughout this course

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:12,300
and by the way, there still are some bonus modules to come after this module here, so definitely continue

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,300
thereafter

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,120
but at this point of time, I now want to show you how you can take your application as you build it locally

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,800
and deploy it onto a server, so that your application does not just run on your machine which is nice

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,250
for development but not that useful for your potential users but that you instead really ship it onto

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,270
a server, that it has its own domain and people can visit it from anywhere in the web.

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,800
Now for that,

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,240
we'll first of all dive into the necessary preparations and then I'll show you how you can host your

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,190
Angular application in the web.
