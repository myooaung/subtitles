00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,840
In the last lecture, we added navigation and we are now able to switch between our pages here,

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,280
that's great.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,570
Now I want to mark the active route and actually Bootstrap, the CSS framework we're using gives us a

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,790
class to mark the active route. If we add this class to the list item which holds the link,

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,950
it's the active class there,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,140
if we save this, now this is marked as active.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,060
Of course it doesn't change because I hardcoded it into there but this is the class we dynamically

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,140
need to add.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,420
Well and you learned how to do this,

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,670
we got a helpful directive for this,

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,030
the routerLinkActive directive.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,000
Here we simply define the class we want to conditionally attach to this element

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,650
whenever the link on this element or nested inside of it, like it's the case here, gets active.

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,310
So here, that would be the active class as we just saw

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,520
and the same of course for shopping list,

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,420
so routerLinkActive should also be placed on this one

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,260
and with this you see it's still active but now it switches because now this CSS class gets applied

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,810
to the correct route.

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,380
So that's now working,

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,520
with that let's make sure that when I click a recipe here, we don't actually reload the app as we do

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,370
now if you watch this reload icon next to the browser URL bar, that happens because we have this ref

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,500
element on it.

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,780
So we will fix this and then think about the next steps of our app.
