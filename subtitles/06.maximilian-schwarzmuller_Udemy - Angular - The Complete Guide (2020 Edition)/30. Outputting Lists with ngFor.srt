1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,620
With all these directives learned, let's now have a look at the last built-in directive for now,

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,720
an important one though.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,520
It's sad that we can click the add server button but we don't actually add servers to our list here right,

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,340
this list doesn't grow, this list is totally static,

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,720
we can change this with the ngFor directive,

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,310
so let's have a look at how it works. In our servers component here,

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,810
we right now manually add our app-server component twice,

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,490
it would be nicer to have an array of servers which adds it dynamically.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,350
So in the servers component here, I'll add a new property, servers

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,120
and this is an array

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:01:03,070
and here, I could have my Testserver and my Testserver2 maybe and when we create a new server here,

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:10,420
I actually want to access this array of servers and push a new server on it

13
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,190
and this should of course use the server name

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:19,290
I set up. Now with this, I have an array of servers,

15
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:26,890
it would now be great if we could replicate the app-server component as often as needed to have a server

16
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,470
for each element in the array.

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,460
So the two initially and then a new one for each server we add.

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,530
We can do this.

19
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,180
I'll get rid of the second app-server here and on the first one, I will place another directive with

20
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,440
a star because this is now also a structural directive,

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,550
changing the DOM itself,

22
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:52,740
is the ngFor directive. The ngFor base syntax looks like this,

23
00:01:52,750 --> 00:02:00,040
we define a temporary variable for inside the loop with let, give it any name you like, like server for

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:11,230
example and then of servers. Servers here is the property we defined in the TypeScript file and this will

25
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,590
now loop through all elements in this array and assign the individual element to this dynamic server

26
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,370
variable.

27
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,460
So that's just like you might know this loop from a normal Javascript code, the for/of loop. This server

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,490
variable can now be used in the template

29
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,890
but here, we don't really need it to be honest,

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:41,400
we will soon learn in the next course section how we can pass data to our own components to output it there.

31
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,460
So for now, we won't need that

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,570
but one thing we should see is that if I save this and we go back to our application, we still see two

33
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,030
because we start with two

34
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,590
but if I add more servers, you see our list grows and we can click this as often as we want.

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,030
Of course the content of the individual server is still static because we can't pass the data like the

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,630
server name to that component but that is something we will learn in the next course section when we

37
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,750
dive deeper into components and we will learn how we can create our own properties on components

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,770
we can then set from outside the feature which would be great to have here.

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,380
So let's dive into this in the next course section, before doing so though,

40
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,590
well let's practice the things we learned in the last lectures and then let's also set up our course

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,210
project before we then dive deeper into components and data binding again.

42
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,610
So see you there.
