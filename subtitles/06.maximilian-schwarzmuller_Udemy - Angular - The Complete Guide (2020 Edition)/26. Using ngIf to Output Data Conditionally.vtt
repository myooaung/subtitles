00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.310
In the example application we built thus far, we haven't used any directives besides components which are

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.850
directives, that's important but we haven't used any other directives,

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.000
no built-in directives.

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.400
Now let's say one thing we want to do is we only want to show this server was created text here,

5
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.360
there is no need to have this

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.460
no server was created text to be displayed.

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.820
So it would be nice if we could conditionally show this message

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.610
and for that, we need some help,

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.260
we can use a directive shipping with Angular, the ngIf directive.

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.370
Now it works like an if statement

11
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.770
and to be precise, it works like this. In our servers component here where we output the server creation

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.940
status,

13
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.220
I will comment this out so that we can still reference this code but now I will add a new paragraph

14
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.550
where I simply say server was created, server name is bind my server name.

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.730
Now with this in place, it will still work

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.790
but now we always see with every keystroke how we change this server name, not really what I want,

17
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.610
instead I want to output it as soon as we click this button here.

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.270
So what I can do is I can add a directive here

19
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.930
and as I said, typically directives are added by using an attribute selector

20
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.520
and pretty much all the built-in directives use that selector, ngIf does and then ngIf is added by

21
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.740
adding a star,

22
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.810
this is important,

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.530
ngIf. The star is required because ngIf is a structural directive which means it changes the structure

24
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.490
of our DOM, it either adds this element or it doesn't add it.

25
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.840
So that's just some extra information for Angular,

26
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.570
the directive itself is just ngIf but the star is required,

27
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.780
without it, it will not work correctly.

28
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.580
So ngIf and then we can set up our conditions here between the quotation marks. For ngIf,

29
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.510
this has to be

30
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.610
any expression returning true or false,

31
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670
deciding whether this should be added or not.

32
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.840
So here it would make sense to add a new property which we name serverCreated and set it to false and

33
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.850
we set this to true once the button is clicked,

34
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.360
so here in onCreateServer which is triggered when the button is clicked, here we set serverCreated equal

35
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.780
to true, like that.

36
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.740
Now with this, we can go back to our template and simply bind ngIf to serverCreated

37
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.800
and again this could also call a method which returns true or false

38
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.240
or directly perform the check between the quotation marks,

39
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.390
anything which returns true or false.

40
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.410
Now with this if we save this, what you see is that there is no text

41
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.350
but if I name this Testserver 2 and click the button, now the text is added here

42
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.450
and the interesting thing is if I reload the app and we inspect our DOM here, you'll see here that's our app server

43
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.160
component, above that is the button

44
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.440
but if I click this button, a new element was entered here,

45
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.720
the paragraph and here you see kind of the hook which Angular created to know where this should be entered.

46
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.660
But the important thing is it's really added or removed to or from the DOM,

47
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.470
it's not there all the time, it's not hidden, it's just not there

48
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.880
which is super important to understand.

49
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.230
So that's ngIf, again the star at the beginning indicates that this is a structural directive, really

50
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.860
changing the DOM as you just saw.
