1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,170
Now let's dive into using Angular's HTTP features

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,370
and for that, we need a back-end.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,790
Now as I mentioned before, we'll not write our own server-side solution here because you would do that

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,740
with a server-side language and not with Angular and therefore this is of course not the scope of this course.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,400
By the way if you want to see how to build a complete Angular front-end and a custom back-end,

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,340
My Mean Course which you also find here on Udemy or on my page, academind.com, is a great place to go

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,300
but here, we'll simply use Firebase. Firebase

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,100
sounds like it's a database only,

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,080
instead it's a whole back-end solution which gives us a REST API as well

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,270
and it's a perfect solution for this course in this module because it's free to get started with and

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,400
we can send requests there, we can send different types of request, we can easily see the changes we make

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,550
through these requests and we can store data there and therefore, it's perfect.

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,190
Now you need a Google account for that,

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,580
once you got that you can go to the console on firebase.com and there, simply click on add project.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,460
Now give that project any name you want

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,990
and you can leave the other default settings and then check both checkmarks here.

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,650
Now this will create a new Firebase project for you

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,730
and again, getting started here is free,

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,320
you can of course check the pricing pages of Firebase to learn what else you can use for free

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,020
and when it would start cost money.

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,570
Now once it's loaded, you'll see an interface that looks something like this and here, we'll go to database.

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,590
Now again, Firebase is not just a database, it's a complete back-end solution that also offers the database

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,420
but it's not just a database,

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,470
it's not an alternative to MongoDB or anything like that,

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,890
it's more than a database,

26
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,070
it's a complete back-end service.

27
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,510
Now here, we'll not use Cloud Firestore but instead if you scroll down, we'll use that real-time database,

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,830
it's a bit easier to use and gives us a nicer visual feedback.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,760
So click on create database here

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,400
and important, start in test mode,

31
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,510
that's important.

32
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,910
Later, we will add authentication

33
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,780
but for now we'll use that test mode to be able to send requests and work with data without being restricted.

34
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,380
Normally, you are of course protecting against unwanted access,

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,080
here we are temporarily disabling this so that we can interact with that without issues. Now

36
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,260
and that is our basic setup we'll need, the

37
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,460
URL you see here will already be the URL

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,790
you can send requests to.

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,770
So let's do that and let's make sure that we now use that to store data by sending a post request.
