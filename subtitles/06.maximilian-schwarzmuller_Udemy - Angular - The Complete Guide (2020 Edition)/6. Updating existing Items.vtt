00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.630
In the last lecture, we finished our set up which allowed us to load an item.

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.900
Now I want to make sure that if we are in the editMode, we actually don't add a new one but update the

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.280
existing one.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.820
It starts in the template with the button name, here this won't be add at all times,

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.630
instead this will only be add if we are indeed adding an item,

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.390
otherwise it will be safe.

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.980
So here we can check if editMode

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.600
and if this is true and I'm using a ternary expression here, I want to output update maybe,

9
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.910
otherwise if we are not in editMode,

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.170
so if we are creating a new item, I will save add.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.290
And now with that, we see add is the default

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.920
but if I click an item here, this switches to update. Now with that, of course I also want to change the

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.100
way we save this. So in onAddItem,

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.030
right now we always call add ingredient,

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.680
now that's not correct if we want to update an existing one.

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.930
First of all in the shopping list service, I'll add a new method which I'll name updateIngredient,

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.060
updateIngredient

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.000
and here I expect to get the index of the ingredient which should be updated and the new ingredient

19
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.830
of type ingredient. 

20
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.640
And with that information, I can simply reach out to my ingredients, get the one with the index I'm

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.960
looking for and set it equal to the new ingredient and thereafter, I want to call ingredients changed

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
and emit my updateIngredients

23
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.480
and as always, just a slice of them as we did before.

24
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.830
So with this, I'm now updating the ingredients here,

25
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.260
we need to call this method in onAddItem if we are in editMode.

26
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.340
Well, nothing easier than that, we can simply use an if expression, check our mode here,

27
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:08.450
so if editMode, if editMode is true, well then I don't want to add a new ingredient,

28
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.590
then I want to reach out to the shopping list service and call updateIngredient

29
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:24.820
and here I will pass my editedItemIndex and my new ingredient, otherwise then in this case here, I will

30
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.560
call add ingredient.

31
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.170
So now if we save this, we should see that indeed if I change this to 10 here or 19 because I mistyped and

32
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.980
I click update, it does update here

33
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.160
and the same for tomatoes, it updates here, of course

34
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.750
also if I rename this to bread.

35
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.510
So that's working,

36
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.160
that is awesome.

37
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.510
Now let's see if it also works if we create a new item,

38
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.460
Bread, now it correctly adds a new one

39
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.810
and if we now click on this, we do indeed edit it, so this works fine.

40
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.460
However now I also want to reset the form after updating or creating an item

41
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.180
and I also want to make this clear button work as well as the delete button.

42
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.510
Let's start with resetting the form though

43
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.500
in the next lecture.
