In last lectures, we added a lot of routing functionality to our app,

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.560
it's looking pretty good.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.410
We get all the main pieces tied together,

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.880
one thing I want to bring to your attention again is we are subscribing to params here in the detail

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.850
component and in the edit component.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.300
Now as I explained, you don't need to clean up the subscription here, I just want to bring it to your

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.670
attention again.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.930
In other cases where you use your own observables, observables you created and not managed by Angular

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.740
therefore, you will need to clean up the subscription.

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.020
So definitely keep that in mind if you work with your own observables, here for now

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.600
we can simply proceed with the set up and let Angular do the cleanup work.
