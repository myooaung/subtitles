1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,120
Well there are two things we should definitely do,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,990
three actually, we should enable this delete button and when editing a recipe, no matter if creating a

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,640
new one or editing an existing one,

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,280
we should make the cancel button work and upon hitting save,

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,810
we should navigate away.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Actually that's the same which would happen when hitting cancel.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,870
So that would be a challenge for you again, make all three buttons work, save and cancel to simply navigate

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,760
away

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,260
and then also the delete button to delete our recipe.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,020
Here is my approach.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,930
What I want to do is I want to start with the delete button. For this,

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,060
I'll start with the recipe service and add a deleteRecipe method,

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,450
where I will get the index of the recipe which should get deleted

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,000
and in here, I will then use my recipes array, call the splice method and splice at the index one element

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,170
to remove it,

16
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:17,080
thereafter I'll call recipesChanged and enit a copy of the updated recipes, like this.

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,420
That's the first step.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:27,310
Now I can call deleteRecipe from the recipe detail component which is where we have this delete button

19
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:36,410
by adding a click listener, onDeleteRecipe and here I will copy that and implement it in the TypeScript

20
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:45,320
file, here onDeleteRecipe and I simply want to reach out to the recipe service, call deleteRecipe

21
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,880
and now we also need the ID here.

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,450
So we used that earlier in this course to have this more complicated way of navigating

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,380
but for deleting, now we really need it,

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,580
so here we should add this ID as an argument.

25
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,060
So before we test this, let's also make the cancel and save button work and let them navigate us away.

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,510
So in the recipe edit component which is where we have these buttons, here

27
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:21,280
we should hook them up to an event listener, so cancel we should hook up, the other one already is automatically

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,910
triggering the submission event. When we hit cancel,

29
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,740
I want to execute onCancel and in the recipe-edit.component.ts file,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,970
we don't need that import any more so we can remove it but the thing I wanted to do is I will add the

31
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,070
onCancel method and in onCancel,

32
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,580
well here I simply want to navigate away.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,000
So for that, we need the router of type router, so let's inject it here,

34
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:01,550
make sure to import the router type from @angular/router and with that injected in onCancel, I

35
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,650
can simply access the router and navigate and I want to go up one level.

36
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,360
If we were editing, this will take me back to the detail page,

37
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,440
if we clicked on the new button, it will take me back to the recipes page.

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,540
So for this to work, we need to tell Angular what our current route is and we do already inject it here,

39
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,040
the activated route.

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,860
So with that, we can pass the second parameter relative to this route.

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,450
So that happens if we click the cancel button,

42
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,540
I actually want the same to happen once I submit the form.

43
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,970
So here, I will call onCancel even though it sounds wrong but we are done at this point,

44
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,910
we can simply navigate away.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,830
Let's see if that all works. If I click cancel,

46
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,510
we're back to our recipe, the same for this one

47
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,420
and if I do change something and hit save,

48
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,110
we're also back to the updated recipe and if we create a new one and I hit cancel,

49
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,780
we're back to the place like the recipe state which makes sense and if I enter something here and click

50
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,430
save,

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,530
we're back to this state too. So this is our application working fine here,

52
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,240
all these buttons working,

53
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,910
let's see if we can delete this recipe now.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,250
Looks almost OK but we still see it here in the detail view, even though we deleted it. We can demonstrate

55
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,780
this again for the schnitzel,

56
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,020
see it, it's still here even though we removed it.

57
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,880
So that is something we need to update before we are finally done with this section.
