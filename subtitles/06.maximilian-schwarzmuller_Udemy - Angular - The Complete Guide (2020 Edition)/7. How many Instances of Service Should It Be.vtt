00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.480
In the last lecture, we learned about that hierarchical injector

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.560
and actually, this injection behavior leads to the behavior we see here.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.760
Now that's not a bug, it's intended,

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.860
you might have an application where you want to have many different instances of the same service, where

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.950
you absolutely don't want to have the same instance but sometimes, you want to have the same instance

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.630
and we definitely do because right now for our account service, we have three instances.

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.750
The first one gets created here in app component,

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.190
we provide it here, app component receives its own service or it's own instance of the service I should

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270
say as do all the child components.

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.460
Now you might say fine because new account and account are child components, right but there we provide it

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.070
again and hence we overwrite the instance we would get from the app component.

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.060
Now new account and accounts component have their own instances,

13
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.370
so these are the other two instances of this service class.

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.680
And therefore if we add a new service, we call add account, there we push it on this array of accounts

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
and this actually works but it's a totally different instance of the service than the one

16
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.430
we use here in app component,

17
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.060
the one through which we loop. How can we fix it then here for our app? Simple, we just remove it from

18
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.470
the providers array.

19
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.570
Don't remove it from the constructor,

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.840
we of course do need it here because that tells Angular that we want an instance, the providers array

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.120
basically tells which instance so there we need it to remove it

22
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.010
and the same for account component.

23
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.060
Leave it in the constructor, leave the import at the top but remove it from the providers array. With

24
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.260
that little change,

25
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.970
if we go back to the application after saving it, let's add another account.

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.910
Now you'll see it at the bottom,

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.650
now you can change the status again.

28
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.410
So this is the difference,

29
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
different instances of the service.

30
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.520
Now we're using one and the same, before we weren't. Both

31
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.390
may be the behavior you want in your app

32
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.970
but make sure that you get the correct one.
