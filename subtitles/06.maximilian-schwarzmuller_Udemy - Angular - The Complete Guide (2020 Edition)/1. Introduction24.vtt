00:00:01.410  -->  00:00:02.610
One.

2

00:00:02.730  -->  00:00:03.630
I'm in a good mood.

3

00:00:03.720  -->  00:00:04.730
I hope you are too.

4

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:05.680
The weather is nice.

5

00:00:05.700  -->  00:00:06.750
Everything is great.

6

00:00:06.990  -->  00:00:15.420
So in this course we're using typescript to create our applications now probably you don't have that

7

00:00:15.420  -->  00:00:21.240
strong of a type school background and you don't need to because I'm sure you will learn most of it

8

00:00:21.270  -->  00:00:22.330
on the fly.

9

00:00:22.530  -->  00:00:28.050
Nonetheless if you're interested here's a little primer on typescript where I will go for the basic

10

00:00:28.050  -->  00:00:30.210
concepts we're using flautas course.

11

00:00:30.480  -->  00:00:37.350
Now beware typescript is much more than these basic concepts and they are from that document which will

12

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:41.350
lead you to additional resource if you want to dive deeper into it.

13

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:44.070
So what is typescript to begin with.

14

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:49.810
It's a superset of group which means in the end it compiles to javascript.

15

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:51.420
Why would we use it then right.

16

00:00:51.420  -->  00:00:54.160
Because then we could just use javascript.

17

00:00:54.180  -->  00:01:02.040
Not really it adds some nice features to the language which makes coding more fun in my opinion but

18

00:01:02.040  -->  00:01:04.800
also less error prone and easier.

19

00:01:04.800  -->  00:01:11.670
The most important thing and this is where the name comes from are typings the fact that became assigned

20

00:01:11.670  -->  00:01:15.710
types to variables and properties for class members.

21

00:01:15.750  -->  00:01:20.080
This is not possible in pure javascript as Javascript does not.

22

00:01:20.100  -->  00:01:23.400
No typing in this way.

23

00:01:23.470  -->  00:01:29.490
Therefore in shell script we can have a variable assigned strict with a next step outside the number

24

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:32.680
and then a boolean and this will work in time.

25

00:01:32.680  -->  00:01:39.390
We can't do compilable yell at us and this is a good thing and reduce our chance to make errors to assign

26

00:01:39.480  -->  00:01:42.230
wrong types to variables for example.

27

00:01:42.410  -->  00:01:49.890
Additionally from this typing thing bigger our nice features like easily creating classes for Klasky

28

00:01:49.890  -->  00:01:59.670
word using interfaces to create contracts or classes or pay burgles have to fulfill to use generic types

29

00:02:00.060  -->  00:02:04.370
and use modules and I would guide through all these parts.

30

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:05.310
Next we.

31

00:02:05.370  -->  00:02:06.330
