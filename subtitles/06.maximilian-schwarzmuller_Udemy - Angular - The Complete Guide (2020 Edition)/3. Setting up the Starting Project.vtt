00:00:02.010  -->  00:00:04.820
In this application you are seeing here I get two buttons.

2

00:00:04.830  -->  00:00:07.250
Any made in shrink and they don't do anything.

3

00:00:07.250  -->  00:00:10.760
I'll come back to these buttons in a second and then me got two lists and I can.

4

00:00:10.760  -->  00:00:15.900
Items to the list with the Add button list or witty add item button you can add a to build lists.

5

00:00:15.900  -->  00:00:20.920
Actually I do have twice the same list because I want to show different animations later on.

6

00:00:21.180  -->  00:00:25.620
Let's start with the two buttons up here and the basics of animations.

7

00:00:25.680  -->  00:00:29.390
As a side note this project is of course attached to this lecture.

8

00:00:29.790  -->  00:00:32.250
So how do we start with that.

9

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:36.340
How does the enemy mation system in England generally work.

10

00:00:36.630  -->  00:00:42.300
Well if we have a look at the source code behind this template here we see that you would get two buttons

11

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:44.150
and then we get this empty div..

12

00:00:44.200  -->  00:00:50.280
Now that's the death of one to animate and on which I want to show how any mation turning on to generally

13

00:00:50.280  -->  00:00:51.530
work.
