1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,720
For this, we of course need a back-end

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:12,040
and just as in the HTTP section, I will use Firebase here because I don't want to write any server-side

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,170
code because that's simply not the course for that, Angular doesn't run on the server after all,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,140
you could of course have your own back-end written in PHP or Node or whatever you want but this again

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,810
is not the focus of the course,

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,510
so we will use Firebase here since it's easy to set up, free to use and has everything we need here.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,880
So on firebase.com, visit the Firebase console just as we did it in the last course section and there,

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,690
create a new project which you can give any name you want.

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,590
Now I will name it ng-course-recipe-book but again, you are free to pick any name you want here.

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:59,620
So ng-course-recipe-book accepts both checkmarks or both terms here and then create that project

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,340
and definitely check out that last course section where we used the HTTP service

12
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:12,030
Angular offers for the first time so that this is not brand new to you. With this created, let's open our

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,670
project and just as before, we'll use a database and we'll use that realtime database. So not Firestore

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,700
because that's a bit more clunky to use but instead, we'll use the realtime database down here,

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,870
create a database

16
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:31,770
and for now, start in test mode so that we have unlimited read and write access without being authenticated,

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,360
though we will add authentication soon in a separate module.

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,270
So for now, start in test mode, enable this and create your database in that Firebase project

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,380
and now as you learned in the last section, this will be the URL you use to save data or at least

20
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,960
a part of that URL we'll use.

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,280
But before we'll use that,

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,920
let's go back to our code and let's make sure that here, we have some way of interacting with the back-end

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,500
and of using the Angular HTTP service.
