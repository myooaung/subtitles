1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,490
We're now outputting our loaded post,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,660
we can re-fetch them here by clicking fetch, though

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:12,080
we of course don't really see a difference here because we fetched the same posts and we have no indicator

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,710
for whether a request is currently on its way or not

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,470
whilst we're waiting for the response. Would be nice to have such an indicator and that can be easily

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,900
implemented by adding a new property, which you could name isLoading which initially is false and you

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,460
want to set is loading

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,290
or maybe let's name it is fetching because I only want to use it for fetching posts and you can use

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,610
is fetching and set it to true whenever you start fetching posts,

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,470
so here at the beginning of this fetch posts. There, you can set this is fetching to true because now

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:48,500
we are starting to fetch posts and once we're done, so here in the subscribe function, we can set

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,770
this is fetching back to false.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,810
Now what's the advantage of this?

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,870
Well we can show a loading indicator whilst we are fetching posts.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:05,050
So back here in our template, we want to show no posts available if we have no posts and also important,

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,490
if we're not currently fetching because if we are fetching posts, then we want to wait for that result

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,510
and not show no posts available too early.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,700
Of course, we also only want to output posts if we're currently not fetching too.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,440
So here, I also will output this only if we have posts and we're not fetching.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,990
This of course means we have a third scenario now, that we are fetching and we don't care about whether

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,630
we have posts or not

22
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,140
and for this, you could output simply loading or display a nice CSS spinner if you wanted to, by using

23
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,060
ngIf equal is fetching.

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,690
Now let's have a look at that,

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,770
let's reload and you see loading here

26
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,280
and if I click fetch post, again you see loading.

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,370
Now unfortunately kind of, Firebase is really fast and therefore, you only see this for a fraction of

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,720
a second but you see it does work

29
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,670
and if you had a slower server, you would of course see it a bit longer.
