00:00:01,800  -->  00:00:08,670
Now for animating an item out let's say we wanted to have two different animations which take a different

2

00:00:08,670  -->  00:00:10,190
amount of time.

3

00:00:10,290  -->  00:00:13,230
So two different animations would be rather easy.

4

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:21,180
Here is where we animate out and we're having it this style being set up during the any made function

5

00:00:21,190  -->  00:00:21,420
.

6

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:29,250
And if we don't want to have a second style we could add a new animate function here and let's say here

7

00:00:29,580  -->  00:00:34,680
we simply want to change the text color to red.

8

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:41,460
Now if it's safe this let's see what happens if I do animate out the item on the bottom list if I click

9

00:00:41,460  -->  00:00:42,580
on milk.

10

00:00:43,380  -->  00:00:48,280
Well it's invisible before I see the color turn to red.

11

00:00:48,300  -->  00:00:50,340
That is not really optimal.

12

00:00:50,340  -->  00:00:56,550
So if I switched the order a year so that I at least see this let's see if it at least works how it

13

00:00:56,550  -->  00:00:58,590
should work.

14

00:00:58,590  -->  00:01:01,530
If I click an item it gets red and that is animated out.

15

00:01:01,740  -->  00:01:06,960
But what if I wanted to have both at the same time but maybe with different timings so that they don't

16

00:01:06,960  -->  00:01:11,040
wait for one animation to finish before starting the next.

17

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:16,160
I can do this by passing or by using the group method.

18

00:01:16,380  -->  00:01:21,180
That's also a method to be imported by Anglo to or from Anglo core.

19

00:01:21,180  -->  00:01:22,250
I mean yes.

20

00:01:22,350  -->  00:01:23,870
So from English coworker.

21

00:01:24,060  -->  00:01:31,860
And in this group method here as an argument we pass an array of animations we want to perform synchronously

22

00:01:31,860  -->  00:01:31,920
.

23

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:33,820
So at the same time.

24

00:01:34,170  -->  00:01:40,170
So here I can now pass might you any made methods and I'll give it different durations so that we can

25

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:42,980
clearly see that both happens at the same time.

26

00:01:43,050  -->  00:01:49,660
And now if I save this and we let it reload let's remove an item you see it turns red.

27

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:56,250
Whilst moving but it moves slower than it takes to turn it red and this is how we can use animation

28

00:01:56,400  -->  00:02:02,490
group to group multiple animations with possibly different timings to gabber to have them at the same

29

00:02:02,490  -->  00:02:03,270
time.

30

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:08,940
And any made different things over as is your possibly different durations
