1

00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:03,720
So we're able to hard switch between states.

2

00:00:03,720  -->  00:00:09,180
Now let's animate it in our animations trigger on the same level as the state method.

3

00:00:09,180  -->  00:00:12,800
Implement the transmission method.

4

00:00:12,810  -->  00:00:15,840
This also needs to be imported from an angle or core.

5

00:00:16,110  -->  00:00:19,970
Now transition is a very intuitive method.

6

00:00:20,160  -->  00:00:26,880
It allows us to describe how the transition from one state to another state should look like or should

7

00:00:26,880  -->  00:00:33,540
work how it should be animated therefore transition as a first argument expects the starting state then

8

00:00:33,540  -->  00:00:38,090
an arrow pointing or indicating the direction and then highlighted here.

9

00:00:38,190  -->  00:00:41,070
So this means from normal to highlighted.

10

00:00:41,340  -->  00:00:42,530
Well now what.

11

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:48,200
Well now in the second argument to specify what to do we specify animate.

12

00:00:48,210  -->  00:00:50,950
Which all needs to be imported from an angle or coord.

13

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:56,560
So now for this direction from normal to highlighted we now set up how to animate this.

14

00:00:56,760  -->  00:01:02,040
And the easiest way is to simply pass that number here the number of milliseconds it should simply take

15

00:01:02,380  -->  00:01:02,730
all.

16

00:01:02,800  -->  00:01:08,860
Also come to more advanced use cases where we can also have some in-between styles during the animation

17

00:01:08,870  -->  00:01:09,310
.

18

00:01:09,570  -->  00:01:16,260
Well before coming to so advanced topics let me also copy it and let's change the timing so that we

19

00:01:16,260  -->  00:01:18,730
can see a difference for the other way around.

20

00:01:18,750  -->  00:01:25,570
So highlighted to normal like this and if we now safeties

21

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:32,400
we see that now it moves and it moves slower back.

22

00:01:32,760  -->  00:01:41,460
And this is now our first animation using the Anglish view animation framework or or this here with

23

00:01:41,460  -->  00:01:44,130
that trigger the different states.

24

00:01:44,130  -->  00:01:46,720
And then the transitions between these states.

25

00:01:46,740  -->  00:01:51,510
Now let's dive a little bit deeper into this and see how we can find to do this to our needs in the

26

00:01:51,510  -->  00:01:53,480
next videos.
