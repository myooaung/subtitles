00:00:02.290  -->  00:00:09.390
Now let's finish this CanActivate behavior by allowing the user to login. I'll quickly do this by going

2

00:00:09.390  -->  00:00:10.740
to my home component

3

00:00:11.080  -->  00:00:22.020
and there I want to add two new buttons, one login button and one logout button and I will add some

4

00:00:22.100  -->  00:00:23.950
CSS classes,

5

00:00:24.000  -->  00:00:29.570
btn-default maybe and btn btn-default here too

6

00:00:29.900  -->  00:00:40.970
and here I want to execute onLogout and for the other one of course, I will execute onLogin and I

7

00:00:40.970  -->  00:00:46.610
will keep this really simple since it's not about having a nice UI here, I will simply inject my auth

8

00:00:46.610  -->  00:00:49.340
service here of type auth service of course,

9

00:00:49.340  -->  00:00:54.260
make sure to add the import at the top and then I'll add my two methods here,

10

00:00:54.350  -->  00:01:02.120
so onLogin will simply reach out to the auth service and call the login method to set this loggedIn

11

00:01:02.120  -->  00:01:03.630
boolean to true

12

00:01:04.070  -->  00:01:10.660
and onLogout will of course do the same but will call the logout method to set it to false.

13

00:01:10.700  -->  00:01:15.320
And this simple improvement now makes sure that we can of course login,

14

00:01:15.320  -->  00:01:20.420
we don't see any visual indication here but we do see it if we try to access a single server.

15

00:01:20.420  -->  00:01:26.720
Now this is working, always after this 800 milliseconds which it takes to evaluate whether we are allowed

16

00:01:26.720  -->  00:01:27.740
to access

17

00:01:27.800  -->  00:01:32.330
but if I switch this back to logout again, you see we're redirected again.

18

00:01:32.360  -->  00:01:33.810
So now we can control this,

19

00:01:33.830  -->  00:01:40.590
now we finish this fake auth service and more importantly, the

20

00:01:40.640  -->  00:01:41.090
CanActivate guards.
