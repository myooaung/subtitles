We're about to get started soon,
1

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,860
but I did mention that we're going to use Typescript in this course.
2

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,850
We already did use it when we changed the first app. What is Typescript? Typescript, really is just a superset
3

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,770
of JavaScript.
4

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,750
It offers more features than vanilla JavaScript, like classes, interfaces and, very important, which
5

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,850
gives it the name, types; strong typing.
6

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,030
So, you define in Typescript if a certain variable is a number, a string or something else.
7

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,960
You don't do this in vanilla JavaScript.
8

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,720
There, you have dynamic typing.
9

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,390
You can have a string variable and then you can assign a number and that's totally fine.
10

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,790
That won't work in Typescript.
11

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,270
It will give you an error and therefore it allows you to write much more robust code which gets checked
12

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,560
at the time you write it;
13

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,460
and not just at the time you run it. This is
14

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,300
a great enhancement.
15

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,610
However, Typescript doesn't run in the browser, so it is compiled to JavaScript in the end.
16

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:01,050
This compilation is handled by the CLI; one of the reasons why we need the CLI, why we need a
17

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,960
project management tool like the CLI.
18

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,480
Now, this compilation is really fast and therefore, in the end, in the browser JavaScript is going to run.
19

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,780
We're not writing the Angular app in JavaScript though because, whilst technically possible,
20

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,600
that wouldn't be much fun.
21

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,820
A lot of the features really only exist in Typescript and Angular is meant to be used together with Typescript.
22

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,190
That being said, you don't have to learn Typescript
23

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,160
for this course.
24

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,720
You should be able to pick it up along the way.
25

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,460
I do have a whole section giving a brief introduction into Typescript at the end of this course,
26

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
so feel free to jump ahead.
27

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,950
Go through that section right now if you feel like you need it
28

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,300
or, throughout the course if you feel like you need some deeper dive into some of the features you see
29

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,080
there and you should be fine,
30

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,400
you should be able to follow along just fine.
31

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,350
Of course, if you feel like it, feel free to pick up another course or tutorial focused on Typescript so that
32

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,610
you have something to look at
33

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,000
if something is unclear in this course. Generally though, Typescript is an addition to JavaScript; not
34

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,290
a complete replacement,
35

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,180
so a lot of the commands will look really familiar.
