1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,220
So we learned about @HostListener and this set up here is absolutely fine for what we're doing

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,720
but we got another decorator we can use which then allows us to not use the renderer.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,670
There is nothing wrong with using the renderer but we get an even easier way of simply changing the

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,840
background color if that is all we want to do in the directive,

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,600
again using the renderer is not wrong though. The decorator I'm referring to is called @HostBinding

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,760
which also needs to be imported from @angular/core

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,980
and since we got a lot of imports, I'll quickly restructure this to cover multiple lines.

8
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,620
So @HostBinding,

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,630
that's the new decorator

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,090
and I will come back to what we pass here in a second.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:56,410
First of all, we need to bind this to some property which value will become important,

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,500
so that could be a backgroundColor property, a new property I create here which is of type string.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,520
Now in @HostBinding, we can pass a string defining to which property of the hosting element we want to

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,650
bind. Now properties of the hosting element,

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,710
that is simply what we also access here in the BasicHighlightDirective, style would be such a property

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,540
and there then the backgroundColor property to be precise.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:36,180
Therefore we can simply say style. and now camel case backgroundColor and that's all. Camel case

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,020
is important here because we're accessing the DOM property which doesn't know dashes.

19
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:50,500
So with this, what we're telling Angular is on the element this directive sits, please access the style

20
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,130
property which pretty much any input has on other directives which access something like the value, you

21
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,730
of course have to make sure that they are only added to inputs which have this property

22
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,610
but here again, the style property should be available on any element.

23
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,170
So here we access the style property

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,990
and then there a sub-property, the backgroundColor and we set this equal to whatever background color

25
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,380
is set to here.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,910
Well and we can simply change background color here when we mouseover it, we can set backgroundColor

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,680
to blue in this case and set it to transparent

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,680
in this case here, transparent and I will comment out the renderer code here, again not wrong to use it

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,510
but no longer needed it in this example.

30
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,140
Of course we also have to set some initial color so that we don't get an error before we

31
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,420
mouse over it the first time,

32
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,460
so here I will set this to transparent initially, give this an initial value.

33
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,960
With this it's transparent,

34
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,850
no error,

35
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,000
looks good

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,700
and if we hover over it, it works the same way as before but now solely driven through @HostListener

37
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,530
and @HostBinding, a great way for working with the element inside of a directive.

38
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,510
And of course here on @HostBinding,

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,890
you can bind to any property of the element you are sitting on.
