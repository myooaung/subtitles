00:00:00.330  -->  00:00:05.460
Welcome back to the advanced course on Tablo and the previous tutorial we created these a beautiful

2

00:00:05.460  -->  00:00:06.930
four box plots.

3

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:10.470
And today we're going to learn how to analyze them.

4

00:00:10.470  -->  00:00:14.360
We've got quite a lot of ground to cover so let's jump straight into it.

5

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:21.780
First off I'd like to make sure that everybody is on the same page and therefore let's look at how exactly

6

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:23.780
box plots work.

7

00:00:23.820  -->  00:00:28.290
So I'm going to bring up a slide that I've prepared very excited about this.

8

00:00:28.290  -->  00:00:28.680
All right.

9

00:00:28.680  -->  00:00:33.960
So let's say you have an access as it can be vertical horizontal in all cases vertical so let's stick

10

00:00:33.960  -->  00:00:39.540
with that and you have a certain number of observations that you can plot on this axis.

11

00:00:39.570  -->  00:00:41.630
So there are 10 observations.

12

00:00:41.820  -->  00:00:46.470
Now in order to create an a box plot which you have to do is you have to physically count the number

13

00:00:46.470  -->  00:00:51.970
of observations of one two three up to 10 and then take the middle between them.

14

00:00:52.020  -->  00:00:58.030
So in our case there's an even number of observations so there is no one middle observation.

15

00:00:58.080  -->  00:00:59.630
The middle ones are 5 and six.

16

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:05.810
So we are going to put a line exactly between Fifth the fifth and the sixth observation.

17

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:11.900
Now what are we going to do is we're going to do the same thing for the top five here.

18

00:01:11.910  -->  00:01:12.720
We've counted.

19

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:14.040
We have five observations.

20

00:01:14.040  -->  00:01:15.870
The middle one is number three.

21

00:01:15.900  -->  00:01:17.770
We put a line through that one.

22

00:01:17.770  -->  00:01:20.360
Now those are the exact same thing for the bottom half.

23

00:01:20.360  -->  00:01:21.540
One two three for five.

24

00:01:21.540  -->  00:01:23.480
This is the middle one over here.

25

00:01:23.520  -->  00:01:24.790
So we put a line through it.

26

00:01:24.810  -->  00:01:31.310
Now if we replace these lines with a box we are slowly starting to create a box plot.

27

00:01:31.320  -->  00:01:37.350
Now all we have to do is plot the whiskers so the whisker goes all the way up to the top one over here

28

00:01:37.410  -->  00:01:43.200
and the other whisker goes all the way up to the bottom one here and elements of the book's plot have

29

00:01:43.290  -->  00:01:44.250
their own names.

30

00:01:44.250  -->  00:01:45.360
This is the minimum.

31

00:01:45.450  -->  00:01:48.710
This is the first quartile or the lower quartile.

32

00:01:48.720  -->  00:01:50.120
This is the median.

33

00:01:50.160  -->  00:01:52.950
This is the upper quartile of the third quarter.

34

00:01:52.980  -->  00:01:54.680
And this is the maximum.

35

00:01:54.960  -->  00:01:56.910
And just make sure you don't get confused here.

36

00:01:56.910  -->  00:02:01.960
This is not the mean this is the median and that's because of the way we've constructed it.

37

00:02:02.100  -->  00:02:05.820
So that is how a box plot gets built.

38

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:12.540
So basically it's about counting the number of records and breaking it up into four Court-House So every

39

00:02:12.540  -->  00:02:16.830
single Courtown has an equal number of records in it.

40

00:02:16.830  -->  00:02:20.260
Now let's look at another example here again another axis.

41

00:02:20.310  -->  00:02:24.090
We've got our observations and let's do the same thing.

42

00:02:24.090  -->  00:02:28.170
So that's our median that is going to be our first quartile.

43

00:02:28.260  -->  00:02:30.620
That is our third quartile.

44

00:02:30.630  -->  00:02:32.640
Now if we connect them that's our box.

45

00:02:32.930  -->  00:02:38.730
And now what we can do here is if we measure the distance between the third quarter and the first quarter

46

00:02:38.740  -->  00:02:40.930
it is called the entire quartal range.

47

00:02:41.070  -->  00:02:47.040
Well the way we can sort box plots is we want to make sure that our analysis is not affected by outliers

48

00:02:47.060  -->  00:02:47.100
.

49

00:02:47.130  -->  00:02:53.290
So if any observation falls too far away then we want to exclude it from the construction of boxwood

50

00:02:53.360  -->  00:02:53.640
.

51

00:02:53.730  -->  00:02:56.330
And how do we determine if an observation is too far away.

52

00:02:56.370  -->  00:03:01.190
Well you need to take one and a half times the entire quarter mile range.

53

00:03:01.410  -->  00:03:03.300
And that is going to be a cutoff point.

54

00:03:03.300  -->  00:03:08.350
So if an observation falls further than that then you shouldn't include it in the box.

55

00:03:08.400  -->  00:03:10.400
And it's considered an outlier.

56

00:03:10.560  -->  00:03:16.270
So in this case our box flight is going to look like this and that Separ or out there is considered

57

00:03:16.270  -->  00:03:17.580
to be an outlier.

58

00:03:17.590  -->  00:03:20.040
All right so that's how books plus are constructed.

59

00:03:20.050  -->  00:03:24.550
Now let's have a look at a few sample use cases of box plots.

60

00:03:24.580  -->  00:03:29.440
So here I've got a horizontal axis and for a change we're going to be looking at horizontal box plots

61

00:03:29.830  -->  00:03:36.430
and to make things interesting let's say we're analyzing sales representatives and their daily sales

62

00:03:36.430  -->  00:03:36.640
.

63

00:03:36.640  -->  00:03:42.280
So what would you rather would you rather have your observations plotted like this or would you rather

64

00:03:42.280  -->  00:03:44.200
have your observations planned like this.

65

00:03:44.350  -->  00:03:46.660
In both cases the median is the same.

66

00:03:46.660  -->  00:03:48.700
It is a thousand dollars.

67

00:03:48.700  -->  00:03:55.420
Now this is where we can look at the book's plot and if we create the box put for the first example

68

00:03:55.450  -->  00:03:57.920
you will see that it is quite compact like that.

69

00:03:57.940  -->  00:04:02.570
The second box plot is much more wider.

70

00:04:02.590  -->  00:04:10.150
So what does that tell us that tells us that the variance in the first box plot is lower so you have

71

00:04:10.330  -->  00:04:13.050
more chances of being closer to the median.

72

00:04:13.060  -->  00:04:18.340
You can only from the observation that we have you are only going to be somewhere between these two

73

00:04:18.340  -->  00:04:24.970
whiskers and more likely you're actually going to be inside the second and third quarter owls groups

74

00:04:25.870  -->  00:04:28.940
and therefore you're more likely to be next to the median here.

75

00:04:29.050  -->  00:04:35.650
You have more room to go up what you have more room to go down so that basically means that the risk

76

00:04:35.650  -->  00:04:41.370
is higher or the volatility is higher and your sales reps can bring.

77

00:04:41.380  -->  00:04:48.700
They do bring a median back over a thousand dollars per day but at the same time it can it can really

78

00:04:48.700  -->  00:04:55.330
vary it can be anywhere on the right and you're on the left so you have more certainty from more compact

79

00:04:55.330  -->  00:04:59.770
box what you have less certainty with a wider box.

80

00:04:59.980  -->  00:05:06.940
Even given the same media and the way to think about it or another way to think about it is in terms

81

00:05:06.940  -->  00:05:13.330
of distribution so this distribution is narrower this distribution is wider so if we talk in terms of

82

00:05:13.330  -->  00:05:18.450
standard deviations instantiation is here is which is also a measure of variance.

83

00:05:18.460  -->  00:05:18.820
Right.

84

00:05:18.850  -->  00:05:25.930
So here the standard deviation is higher or larger here it's smaller so you have a more narrow distribution

85

00:05:25.930  -->  00:05:29.280
and you're more likely to actually hit the nail on the head here.

86

00:05:29.770  -->  00:05:33.340
Whereas here you can either go left or right which is more uncertain.

87

00:05:33.650  -->  00:05:35.790
OK let's have a look at another example.

88

00:05:36.370  -->  00:05:38.410
Can you tell me right away what do you think.

89

00:05:38.410  -->  00:05:41.220
Is this a good box or a bad box point.

90

00:05:41.470  -->  00:05:47.380
Let's say we're also measuring sales and now it's a vertical axis and of course would be better if it

91

00:05:47.380  -->  00:05:52.400
were compacter like this but is this a good box or a bad spot.

92

00:05:52.420  -->  00:06:00.190
And given that the minimum or the maximum are fixed and in essence the question we're asking is is this

93

00:06:00.190  -->  00:06:02.420
box a lot better than this box plot.

94

00:06:02.710  -->  00:06:08.080
And if you think of it in terms of median the median here is higher than the median here and it makes

95

00:06:08.080  -->  00:06:09.190
the answer obvious of course.

96

00:06:09.190  -->  00:06:12.160
This box Plaut is preferrable to this box.

97

00:06:12.160  -->  00:06:18.030
So basically if if your media minimum and maximum fixed you want your box the pot or the box part of

98

00:06:18.030  -->  00:06:28.020
the box what you want it to be as a higher or as closer as more closer to your desired result as possible

99

00:06:28.030  -->  00:06:32.560
so here we're talking about sales so the larger sales or higher sales are better.

100

00:06:32.560  -->  00:06:35.340
So we want the box to be higher not lower.

101

00:06:35.530  -->  00:06:37.720
But that is the obvious answer.

102

00:06:37.720  -->  00:06:44.500
How do how do we think of it in terms of distributions and how do we think of it exactly why this is

103

00:06:44.500  -->  00:06:48.300
the case so if we plot them now sideways so this is the good box plot.

104

00:06:48.310  -->  00:06:55.870
This is the bad box blood let's plot the observations that make these booklets happen.

105

00:06:55.860  -->  00:07:00.420
So these are 10 observations in this case and these are 10 observations in this case.

106

00:07:00.600  -->  00:07:03.670
How do we see them in terms of distributions.

107

00:07:03.780  -->  00:07:07.410
And for me personally this is the part that drives this point home.

108

00:07:07.410  -->  00:07:08.900
This is what makes things click.

109

00:07:08.910  -->  00:07:17.820
So I'm going to put distributions here and this here you can see that this is a Arite skewed distribution

110

00:07:17.840  -->  00:07:17.870
.

111

00:07:17.880  -->  00:07:23.460
And by the way right skewed is because the tails on the right not we don't look at the hump.

112

00:07:23.460  -->  00:07:30.730
We look at the tail where the tail is and that is how we define whether it's a right skewed or electrocuted

113

00:07:30.900  -->  00:07:31.070
.

114

00:07:31.140  -->  00:07:38.910
So this is a rice distribution and if you think of it in this sense what it's telling us is that if

115

00:07:38.910  -->  00:07:41.550
you throw a random observation.

116

00:07:41.550  -->  00:07:48.630
Another one observation onto this chart then it is more likely to end up in this area in this more dense

117

00:07:48.630  -->  00:07:54.240
area than it is on in this tale part right because that's how distributions work.

118

00:07:54.240  -->  00:07:59.810
There are more observations here so you've got your mean median mode in this part of the chart.

119

00:07:59.850  -->  00:08:03.240
And this part of the chart so you throw a Aranda bearable here.

120

00:08:03.270  -->  00:08:12.030
It is more likely to end up here and here and on this other side if you throw a random variable into

121

00:08:12.030  -->  00:08:18.750
this environment into this example then what will happen is it will more likely end up on the right

122

00:08:18.750  -->  00:08:19.210
side.

123

00:08:19.210  -->  00:08:24.560
So this is a left skewed distribution that tells on the left but most of the observations are concentrated

124

00:08:24.570  -->  00:08:29.150
over here so if you throw another round variable it will most likely end up here.

125

00:08:29.370  -->  00:08:37.050
And which is good for us because the sales are higher so that is how I personally think of books plus

126

00:08:37.060  -->  00:08:44.970
sometimes because you know we like distribution's we're used to them and they've got a lot of mathematics

127

00:08:44.970  -->  00:08:46.220
behind them.

128

00:08:46.230  -->  00:08:47.940
They got sand and things like that.

129

00:08:47.950  -->  00:08:52.160
Bookstores are also also great but they're simpler things I think.

130

00:08:52.170  -->  00:08:57.480
And when you think of them in terms of distributions it makes a lot of sense that why a box plot which

131

00:08:57.480  -->  00:09:00.760
is which looks like this is worse.

132

00:09:00.780  -->  00:09:04.490
If you want to be on the right of access then a box plot that looks like that.

133

00:09:04.780  -->  00:09:05.060
OK.

134

00:09:05.070  -->  00:09:08.030
So that is how box plots work.

135

00:09:08.070  -->  00:09:13.670
Let's not jump back into Tablo and see what analysis we can derive from them there.

136

00:09:13.680  -->  00:09:14.920
All right so there is our chart.

137

00:09:14.940  -->  00:09:16.700
What can we see from this chart.

138

00:09:16.710  -->  00:09:19.490
Knowing that everything we know now.

139

00:09:19.590  -->  00:09:21.990
Well right away we can see outliers here and here.

140

00:09:21.990  -->  00:09:27.510
So what this means is that in these three states in New South Wales Queensland and Victoria there are

141

00:09:27.510  -->  00:09:33.660
companies that are underperforming in terms of the overall performance in that specific state.

142

00:09:33.840  -->  00:09:36.670
Then in Queensland they are companies that are over performing.

143

00:09:36.810  -->  00:09:42.480
Also if you put your mouse over the box plus you will get some information which directly relates to

144

00:09:42.510  -->  00:09:45.350
the five points we discussed about box pots.

145

00:09:45.360  -->  00:09:50.920
So the minimum the lower cost tell the medium the upper quartile and the maximum.

146

00:09:51.180  -->  00:09:57.720
And if you use this information you can compare the box plots among each other and for instance we can

147

00:09:57.720  -->  00:10:01.230
say that this box plot has the highest median which is 8 percent.

148

00:10:01.230  -->  00:10:08.180
This one is also 8 percent but you can visually see that it's lower than this box part comes in a third

149

00:10:08.220  -->  00:10:13.680
so the state has the third median which is 6 percent and this one has a 4 percent.

150

00:10:13.950  -->  00:10:21.390
And finally let's talk about the variance and the sizes of the box plus you can see that this box plot

151

00:10:21.390  -->  00:10:26.640
here and this box plot here they are pretty big compared to these two box plots.

152

00:10:26.640  -->  00:10:33.090
And that means that the variance here is much greater so there is less certainty that the like a random

153

00:10:33.090  -->  00:10:39.500
company thrown into this one of these states will be performing at the median net profit margin.

154

00:10:39.570  -->  00:10:44.880
And bear in mind when we say random company we're not taking into account all the amazing things about

155

00:10:44.910  -->  00:10:50.760
our specific company we're not taking into account the product differentiation that we can offer the

156

00:10:50.760  -->  00:10:55.920
amazing customer service that we deliver and all those great things we were just saying if we throw

157

00:10:55.920  -->  00:11:04.180
in a random company that performs comparable to the companies in that specific state and you know it's

158

00:11:04.180  -->  00:11:09.190
work it's performing about a somewhere on average Wi-Fi on a certain level variance.

159

00:11:09.190  -->  00:11:10.780
Where will it end up.

160

00:11:10.780  -->  00:11:18.970
So it is likely to end up in this box but because the box is so big there is more uncertainty as to

161

00:11:19.180  -->  00:11:21.960
where it will be performing in this specific state.

162

00:11:21.960  -->  00:11:28.020
So basically we're kind of assessing the business environment in each of these states in Western Australia

163

00:11:28.030  -->  00:11:33.340
once again there is more uncertainty where your company will end up in terms of net profit margin because

164

00:11:33.340  -->  00:11:36.520
the bookstore is quite large here the box plus are smaller.

165

00:11:36.670  -->  00:11:42.130
And as you remember what we just discussed which one is better let's say here would you rather have

166

00:11:42.130  -->  00:11:47.170
this box here or would you have it up at the top you would rather have it up at the top because higher

167

00:11:47.170  -->  00:11:54.070
profit net profit margin is better for us so this is not the best set up in this specific said could

168

00:11:54.070  -->  00:11:58.210
have been better if this box had had been higher at the top would have been better.

169

00:11:58.240  -->  00:12:03.460
On the other hand in Victoria you can see that the box part of the box part is at the top meaning that

170

00:12:03.460  -->  00:12:07.720
the set up in this business environment is actually pretty good.

171

00:12:07.720  -->  00:12:12.880
You can see that the box part is quite compact meaning that there is less uncertainty in terms of where

172

00:12:13.180  -->  00:12:16.340
a random company would end up in terms of net profit margin.

173

00:12:16.510  -->  00:12:22.720
And also you can see that the median of course the median is higher than these two other states but

174

00:12:22.720  -->  00:12:28.950
also you can see that the box part of the box part is closer to where we want to be to the top.

175

00:12:29.050  -->  00:12:34.710
And as we discussed that's a good thing as better than if this box part was lower.

176

00:12:34.720  -->  00:12:38.830
So there we go that's how you analyze box plots and what can we conclude from here.

177

00:12:38.830  -->  00:12:45.180
Well we can say that out of these three states you know since we already are working in or the businesses

178

00:12:45.180  -->  00:12:51.430
operating in yourself wells out of these three states it's obvious that this state of Victoria is the

179

00:12:51.430  -->  00:12:57.400
better one in terms of expansion in terms of a business environment and this analysis has been performed

180

00:12:57.910  -->  00:13:00.710
based on competitor research.

181

00:13:00.700  -->  00:13:02.950
Now that's not the end of our challenge.

182

00:13:02.950  -->  00:13:07.960
We of course have to analyze the economies of these states.

183

00:13:07.960  -->  00:13:12.610
We have to analyze how the industries are performing and how the populations are growing things like

184

00:13:12.610  -->  00:13:12.730
that.

185

00:13:12.730  -->  00:13:14.650
So we will definitely get to that.

186

00:13:14.650  -->  00:13:20.110
This was like the very first stage and what we want to do now is when to use the rest of our analysis

187

00:13:20.110  -->  00:13:26.170
and hopefully back this finding that the business environment seems to be best for this specific industry

188

00:13:26.170  -->  00:13:28.220
at this specific time in Victoria.

189

00:13:28.480  -->  00:13:30.440
And I look for the next Tauriel.

190

00:13:30.460  -->  00:13:32.160
Until then happy on lising
