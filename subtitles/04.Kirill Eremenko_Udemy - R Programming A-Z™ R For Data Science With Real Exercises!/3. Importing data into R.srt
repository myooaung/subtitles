00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,480

2

00:00:02,480  -->  00:00:07,520
Hello and welcome back to the course on R

3

00:00:07,520  -->  00:00:09,469
programming and in this tutorial we will

4

00:00:09,469  -->  00:00:11,660
learn how to import data into R studio

5

00:00:11,660  -->  00:00:14,150
and we'll look at two methods. One where

6

00:00:14,150  -->  00:00:15,500
you will be able to choose the file

7

00:00:15,500  -->  00:00:17,390
manually and another one where you'll

8

00:00:17,390  -->  00:00:19,550
have to set your working directory. So

9

00:00:19,550  -->  00:00:21,589
let's jump straight into it. The function

10

00:00:21,589  -->  00:00:22,820
that we're going to be using is called

11

00:00:22,820  -->  00:00:26,689
read dot CSV and let's have a look at

12

00:00:26,689  -->  00:00:28,910
the help for that function. So if we zoom

13

00:00:28,910  -->  00:00:31,579
in over here we can see that there's a

14

00:00:31,579  -->  00:00:33,410
function, it's got quite a few parameters

15

00:00:33,410  -->  00:00:35,629
but all we are interested right now is

16

00:00:35,629  -->  00:00:37,640
actually the description. It says here

17

00:00:37,640  -->  00:00:40,399
reads a file in table format and create

18

00:00:40,399  -->  00:00:43,129
a data frame from it with cases

19

00:00:43,129  -->  00:00:45,710
corresponding two lines and variables to

20

00:00:45,710  -->  00:00:47,600
fields in the file. So there we go, that's

21

00:00:47,600  -->  00:00:49,370
the important bit that we are going to

22

00:00:49,370  -->  00:00:53,149
be reading this data into a data frame.

23

00:00:53,149  -->  00:00:56,179
Alright, let's get started. So the first

24

00:00:56,179  -->  00:00:59,899
method, we're going to select the file

25

00:00:59,899  -->  00:01:02,510
manually and we're going to call the

26

00:01:02,510  -->  00:01:05,990
read dot CSV file a function and in the

27

00:01:05,990  -->  00:01:07,850
brackets we're going to type in instead

28

00:01:07,850  -->  00:01:10,100
of typing in the file itself, we're going

29

00:01:10,100  -->  00:01:12,020
to say file choose. So this function

30

00:01:12,020  -->  00:01:15,740
inside will tell us, will create a prompt

31

00:01:15,740  -->  00:01:18,020
for us to select the file manually and

32

00:01:18,020  -->  00:01:19,820
whatever this returns, whatever this

33

00:01:19,820  -->  00:01:21,200
function returns, which will be a data

34

00:01:21,200  -->  00:01:24,560
frame we want to put into a an object

35

00:01:24,560  -->  00:01:26,750
right? So let's create an object and this

36

00:01:26,750  -->  00:01:29,330
object we will call it just stats

37

00:01:29,330  -->  00:01:31,460
because we've kind of overused the word

38

00:01:31,460  -->  00:01:33,200
data already in the past tutorials, so

39

00:01:33,200  -->  00:01:35,450
let's work with stats for a while.  So if I run this line

40

00:01:35,450  -->  00:01:37,370
now, what will happen is a pop-up appears

41

00:01:37,370  -->  00:01:40,640
and from here I can navigate to my file

42

00:01:40,640  -->  00:01:43,430
like I usually do and I can select it

43

00:01:43,430  -->  00:01:46,400
and click open and there you go so the

44

00:01:46,400  -->  00:01:48,650
stats have been imported you can see

45

00:01:48,650  -->  00:01:51,020
them over there and if I run this

46

00:01:51,020  -->  00:01:53,870
variable you will see that the steps

47

00:01:53,870  -->  00:01:56,930
indeed here so I can make some space and

48

00:01:56,930  -->  00:01:58,940
do that again stats there we go, so you

49

00:01:58,940  -->  00:02:00,950
can see that the same file that we

50

00:02:00,950  -->  00:02:03,110
looked at previously is now in R

51

00:02:03,110  -->  00:02:03,980
studio.

52

00:02:03,980  -->  00:02:05,960
Alright well that's great and now let's

53

00:02:05,960  -->  00:02:08,420
look at method number two, because

54

00:02:08,420  -->  00:02:11,090
sometimes in your work with R, you will

55

00:02:11,090  -->  00:02:12,890
need this one actually more often you

56

00:02:12,890  -->  00:02:14,900
will need method number two where you

57

00:02:14,900  -->  00:02:16,140
you set the working

58

00:02:16,140  -->  00:02:19,770
directory and read data from there.

59

00:02:19,770  -->  00:02:22,020
So first one is a working directory, well

60

00:02:22,020  -->  00:02:24,450
the working directory is where by

61

00:02:24,450  -->  00:02:27,660
default your R studio goes to save files

62

00:02:27,660  -->  00:02:30,870
open files or do like even save the R

63

00:02:30,870  -->  00:02:33,450
files that you're creating and so on so

64

00:02:33,450  -->  00:02:35,850
that's what a working directory is. How

65

00:02:35,850  -->  00:02:37,500
did you find out what it is currently

66

00:02:37,500  -->  00:02:40,230
set to? Well the easiest way is to type

67

00:02:40,230  -->  00:02:43,350
and get WD and then brackets because the

68

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:45,630
function and if you run that it will

69

00:02:45,630  -->  00:02:47,489
tell you what the current working

70

00:02:47,489  -->  00:02:49,560
directory is, so for me it's currently my

71

00:02:49,560  -->  00:02:51,690
desktop. So that's not exactly what I

72

00:02:51,690  -->  00:02:55,140
want because I want to save my files

73

00:02:55,140  -->  00:02:57,209
in a folder that I have on the desktop.

74

00:02:57,209  -->  00:03:00,090
So how do I do that? Well you need to

75

00:03:00,090  -->  00:03:03,239
type in the function which is setwd and

76

00:03:03,239  -->  00:03:05,430
here you'll be able to supply the path

77

00:03:05,430  -->  00:03:08,070
to where your working directory is. Now

78

00:03:08,070  -->  00:03:10,560
the tricky bit is that said working

79

00:03:10,560  -->  00:03:13,110
directory works differently in Windows

80

00:03:13,110  -->  00:03:16,860
and Mac. So let me type in the command

81

00:03:16,860  -->  00:03:18,390
that you will need to type in for

82

00:03:18,390  -->  00:03:20,940
windows and then I will show you how

83

00:03:20,940  -->  00:03:23,519
to do it on Mac as well, so depending on

84

00:03:23,519  -->  00:03:25,200
which machine you're on you will use one

85

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:28,410
or the other. So let's start over here,

86

00:03:28,410  -->  00:03:31,049
let's start with windows, so in windows if it's on

87

00:03:31,049  -->  00:03:34,290
your desktop you would type in c colon

88

00:03:34,290  -->  00:03:37,500
then you would type in double backslash

89

00:03:37,500  -->  00:03:41,910
users double backslash, your name or the

90

00:03:41,910  -->  00:03:46,530
login desktop double backslash, for me

91

00:03:46,530  -->  00:03:48,390
it would have been for instance R

92

00:03:48,390  -->  00:03:50,549
programming. If that's the folders name

93

00:03:50,549  -->  00:03:55,440
right? For Mac it's different, for Mac you

94

00:03:55,440  -->  00:03:59,190
would type in slash users so forward slash

95

00:03:59,190  -->  00:04:00,450
single falls and don't forget the

96

00:04:00,450  -->  00:04:03,959
quotation marks slash your name in my case,

97

00:04:03,959  -->  00:04:05,910
it's Kirill Eremenko, that's the

98

00:04:05,910  -->  00:04:10,500
username desktop and slash R programming.

99

00:04:10,500  -->  00:04:14,130
So you can adjust all these based on

100

00:04:14,130  -->  00:04:16,500
where exactly your folder is. It might not be

101

00:04:16,500  -->  00:04:18,660
on your desktop or in Windows. It might

102

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:20,400
not be on your desktop but basically

103

00:04:20,400  -->  00:04:22,109
that's the concept, you find the drive

104

00:04:22,109  -->  00:04:23,550
and then you select where you want to go

105

00:04:23,550  -->  00:04:26,250
and on Mac so you just start with users

106

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:28,800
and then your name and so on.

107

00:04:28,800  -->  00:04:29,820
Alright, so

108

00:04:29,820  -->  00:04:31,320
I'm going to run the mac one because I

109

00:04:31,320  -->  00:04:33,720
am on a mac right now and if I run that

110

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:35,790
you will see that my work interaction

111

00:04:35,790  -->  00:04:38,040
has been set without an error which is

112

00:04:38,040  -->  00:04:40,350
always good news and now if I look at get

113

00:04:40,350  -->  00:04:42,990
wd, you'll see that my new working

114

00:04:42,990  -->  00:04:45,240
directory has been changed to exactly

115

00:04:45,240  -->  00:04:46,950
what I want to that folder on my desktop.

116

00:04:46,950  -->  00:04:49,920
So now I can import the file using the

117

00:04:49,920  -->  00:04:52,470
second way so I'm going to overwrite our

118

00:04:52,470  -->  00:04:54,720
variable that we have stats. In fact just

119

00:04:54,720  -->  00:04:58,110
to make this absolutely clear or like

120

00:04:58,110  -->  00:05:01,350
like the experiment is going to be

121

00:05:01,350  -->  00:05:03,960
unjeopardized, I'm going to remove stats so

122

00:05:03,960  -->  00:05:05,760
I'm going to type in RM stats. As you can

123

00:05:05,760  -->  00:05:08,430
see the object has been removed and now

124

00:05:08,430  -->  00:05:11,700
I will populate it with the value that

125

00:05:11,700  -->  00:05:14,010
once. I'm going to type in read dot CSV

126

00:05:14,010  -->  00:05:16,260
and now what I'm going to do is I'm

127

00:05:16,260  -->  00:05:18,120
going to type in the name of the file in

128

00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:21,450
quotation marks so demographic data dot

129

00:05:21,450  -->  00:05:24,690
CSV and now if I run this line, you will

130

00:05:24,690  -->  00:05:26,850
see that the object has been imported

131

00:05:26,850  -->  00:05:30,060
without me having to select manually

132

00:05:30,060  -->  00:05:33,090
and now if I select stats, you will

133

00:05:33,090  -->  00:05:35,520
see that same file is here. So there you

134

00:05:35,520  -->  00:05:37,560
go, that's two ways how to import data

135

00:05:37,560  -->  00:05:40,620
into R studio and in the next tutorial

136

00:05:40,620  -->  00:05:43,620
we will start exploring our data set. I

137

00:05:43,620  -->  00:05:44,790
look forward to seeing you then,

138

00:05:44,790  -->  00:05:57,220
until next time happy coding.
