00:00:02,470  -->  00:00:07,000
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,000  -->  00:00:09,550
R programming and slowly but surely

3

00:00:09,550  -->  00:00:11,350
we're making our way to the top

4

00:00:11,350  -->  00:00:14,470
we're at the coordinates layer of our

5

00:00:14,470  -->  00:00:16,390
visualization. Last time we talked about

6

00:00:16,390  -->  00:00:18,400
facets and today we're going to learn a

7

00:00:18,400  -->  00:00:19,509
lot of things we are going to learn about

8

00:00:19,509  -->  00:00:22,570
limits, zooming in, zooming out and things

9

00:00:22,570  -->  00:00:26,380
like that. So let's dive right into it, so

10

00:00:26,380  -->  00:00:27,699
this is what we created last time

11

00:00:27,699  -->  00:00:29,650
beautiful visualization that is nearly

12

00:00:29,650  -->  00:00:32,290
ready. All we have to do is fix up these axes

13

00:00:32,290  -->  00:00:34,780
so that the y-axis is from zero to a

14

00:00:34,780  -->  00:00:36,910
hundred and how do we do that? We need to

15

00:00:36,910  -->  00:00:40,480
learn how to zoom in and zoom out how to

16

00:00:40,480  -->  00:00:44,530
control our coordinates so let's start

17

00:00:44,530  -->  00:00:45,940
talking about that.

18

00:00:45,940  -->  00:00:47,890
So today we're going to cover the

19

00:00:47,890  -->  00:00:50,650
agenda for today. Today we're going to cover limits,

20

00:00:50,650  -->  00:00:54,250
how to limit our axis and zoom, how to

21

00:00:54,250  -->  00:00:57,610
zoom into our axis. Alright what's that

22

00:00:57,610  -->  00:01:01,540
are we on W, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and I don't really

23

00:01:01,540  -->  00:01:03,130
want to use X, Y and Z because that might

24

00:01:03,130  -->  00:01:06,340
come off a bit confusing so let's start

25

00:01:06,340  -->  00:01:09,460
somewhere at M right M was going to

26

00:01:09,460  -->  00:01:11,860
be a letter for today ggplot and data

27

00:01:11,860  -->  00:01:14,950
equals movies aesthetics so what are we

28

00:01:14,950  -->  00:01:18,040
doing? We're going to be recreating this

29

00:01:18,040  -->  00:01:20,290
plot so not exactly this plot without

30

00:01:20,290  -->  00:01:22,659
the fastest for now we'll just say X

31

00:01:22,659  -->  00:01:27,280
equals critic rating, Y equals audience

32

00:01:27,280  -->  00:01:31,450
rating and size you can actually see now

33

00:01:31,450  -->  00:01:33,310
why it's important to give your variable

34

00:01:33,310  -->  00:01:35,890
simple names because you might end up

35

00:01:35,890  -->  00:01:38,650
typing and up a hundred times like we

36

00:01:38,650  -->  00:01:42,130
are. Alright so there's our M. What are we

37

00:01:42,130  -->  00:01:43,600
going to do now? We're going to say m

38

00:01:43,600  -->  00:01:47,770
plus some points, geom point on that

39

00:01:47,770  -->  00:01:49,930
beautiful beautiful beautiful.

40

00:01:49,930  -->  00:01:52,600
Alright so let's say I want to cut out a

41

00:01:52,600  -->  00:01:55,540
piece I want to visualize only this bit,

42

00:01:55,540  -->  00:02:00,400
so this top top corner right? The top

43

00:02:00,400  -->  00:02:02,380
what is this called, the first quadrant or the

44

00:02:02,380  -->  00:02:05,680
the best quadrants at the movies with

45

00:02:05,680  -->  00:02:07,540
the highest ratings that's what I want

46

00:02:07,540  -->  00:02:10,390
to cut out of this plot so 50-100 by

47

00:02:10,390  -->  00:02:13,240
critics and 50-100 by the audience, how do

48

00:02:13,240  -->  00:02:14,040
I do that?

49

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:16,650
Very very simple and we are in fact very

50

00:02:16,650  -->  00:02:19,260
no we haven't touched on this yet but

51

00:02:19,260  -->  00:02:21,150
we're going to touch on it right now.

52

00:02:21,150  -->  00:02:25,260
So geom point okay and then we're adding

53

00:02:25,260  -->  00:02:28,200
a layer as we always do, add a layer

54

00:02:28,200  -->  00:02:32,400
which is the limit Xlim fifty to a

55

00:02:32,400  -->  00:02:35,670
hundred so if I run this, that cuts it off

56

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:38,040
so you can see here on the left 50 is the

57

00:02:38,040  -->  00:02:40,290
lowest, hundred is the highest and so

58

00:02:40,290  -->  00:02:41,790
basically cut off all the points on the

59

00:02:41,790  -->  00:02:43,709
left and you can see the warning message

60

00:02:43,709  -->  00:02:46,290
removed 304 rows. So this is going to be

61

00:02:46,290  -->  00:02:47,939
the key going forward that it actually

62

00:02:47,939  -->  00:02:51,030
not just zoomed in it actually removed

63

00:02:51,030  -->  00:02:54,180
the rows. You set a limit to the value of

64

00:02:54,180  -->  00:02:56,489
x and let's do the same for y, y

65

00:02:56,489  -->  00:02:59,220
limb fifty to a hundred so if I run

66

00:02:59,220  -->  00:03:02,849
these three lines now, viola! Now we've got

67

00:03:02,849  -->  00:03:05,909
that quadrant left and so we removed

68

00:03:05,909  -->  00:03:09,419
quite a lot of rows in total right?

69

00:03:09,419  -->  00:03:13,230
Not quite a lot of values ok? So that is

70

00:03:13,230  -->  00:03:15,989
a good method but it doesn't always work,

71

00:03:15,989  -->  00:03:19,260
let's have a look. Won't work always,

72

00:03:19,260  -->  00:03:22,829
won't work, well it will work won't work

73

00:03:22,829  -->  00:03:23,549
well

74

00:03:23,549  -->  00:03:26,159
always, why not? Let's have a look, let's

75

00:03:26,159  -->  00:03:31,079
say M. Let's say M is GGplot but here

76

00:03:31,079  -->  00:03:34,049
we've got data equals movies as always and

77

00:03:34,049  -->  00:03:36,690
then we have aesthetics x equals budget

78

00:03:36,690  -->  00:03:38,370
millions right?

79

00:03:38,370  -->  00:03:40,349
What is that going to be? What we're

80

00:03:40,349  -->  00:03:42,329
creating here? In creating a histogram

81

00:03:42,329  -->  00:03:45,449
because we only have one axis or one of

82

00:03:45,449  -->  00:03:48,900
those variables x and y histogram binwidth

83

00:03:48,900  -->  00:03:52,859
equals 10, aesthetic especially the

84

00:03:52,859  -->  00:03:55,260
one we've already created genre so

85

00:03:55,260  -->  00:03:57,269
that's our histogram with which is the

86

00:03:57,269  -->  00:04:00,359
blurry one and then color equals black

87

00:04:00,359  -->  00:04:02,159
that's a pretty one.

88

00:04:02,159  -->  00:04:03,780
Alright so but let's say I want to cut

89

00:04:03,780  -->  00:04:05,819
it off up to 50. I want to cut it off

90

00:04:05,819  -->  00:04:06,419
over here.

91

00:04:06,419  -->  00:04:07,859
I want to zoom in, let's say I want to

92

00:04:07,859  -->  00:04:11,549
zoom in from 0 to 50 on the y-axis and

93

00:04:11,549  -->  00:04:14,699
I decide to use the Y limb function

94

00:04:14,699  -->  00:04:19,289
so then I say plus ylim fifty to a

95

00:04:19,289  -->  00:04:22,200
hundred and if I run that which you will

96

00:04:22,200  -->  00:04:24,320
see then make some space.

97

00:04:24,320  -->  00:04:27,470
Well huh actually I was going to say 0

98

00:04:27,470  -->  00:04:30,230
to 50 but still, alright let's do that

99

00:04:30,230  -->  00:04:33,560
again. 0 to 50, you can see that it did

100

00:04:33,560  -->  00:04:35,720
zoom in to 0 to 50 but it actually cut

101

00:04:35,720  -->  00:04:37,670
off any data that was supposed to be

102

00:04:37,670  -->  00:04:40,400
above and that's not what we want that's

103

00:04:40,400  -->  00:04:42,950
like not the opposite of what we want

104

00:04:42,950  -->  00:04:45,530
but it's definitely not we want very very bad

105

00:04:45,530  -->  00:04:48,380
looks not like what we were expecting.

106

00:04:48,380  -->  00:04:50,300
We're checking just to zoom in not to

107

00:04:50,300  -->  00:04:53,300
actually cut out the data so how do we

108

00:04:53,300  -->  00:04:55,370
do that? How do we zoom in?

109

00:04:55,370  -->  00:04:56,660
Well let's look at that there's a

110

00:04:56,660  -->  00:05:01,070
different way instead zoom so how do we zoom in?

111

00:05:01,070  -->  00:05:03,290
Well what we need to do is I'm going to

112

00:05:03,290  -->  00:05:05,330
re-type this and just going to copy it

113

00:05:05,330  -->  00:05:08,990
okay that's that's the plot right and

114

00:05:08,990  -->  00:05:13,220
now we want to say plus equals and here

115

00:05:13,220  -->  00:05:14,960
what we want. The layer that we're

116

00:05:14,960  -->  00:05:17,120
looking for is called cord underscore

117

00:05:17,120  -->  00:05:20,030
Cartesian and this is the Cartesian

118

00:05:20,030  -->  00:05:22,010
coordinate system that we are using the

119

00:05:22,010  -->  00:05:24,620
XY and that's why we're using this

120

00:05:24,620  -->  00:05:26,150
function and here we want to say instead

121

00:05:26,150  -->  00:05:28,550
of ylim and then in brackets like

122

00:05:28,550  -->  00:05:30,920
here, here ylim is a parameter. So we

123

00:05:30,920  -->  00:05:33,110
have to say ylim equals and then

124

00:05:33,110  -->  00:05:37,250
pass it the values in a vector of 2, 0 and 50.

125

00:05:37,250  -->  00:05:39,950
So this is our vector of 2, it's got two

126

00:05:39,950  -->  00:05:41,450
values and fifty were passing it to

127

00:05:41,450  -->  00:05:43,580
ylim so now it knows that the limits

128

00:05:43,580  -->  00:05:46,250
are 0 and 50 and that's called cartesian,

129

00:05:46,250  -->  00:05:48,200
that's a new layer which will zoom in

130

00:05:48,200  -->  00:05:51,140
for us and if we run this viola! As you

131

00:05:51,140  -->  00:05:52,880
can see, we've actually zoomed-in

132

00:05:52,880  -->  00:05:56,090
literally zoomed into the chart and then

133

00:05:56,090  -->  00:05:57,620
like it's still there, the data is

134

00:05:57,620  -->  00:05:59,270
still there. Everything is still there

135

00:05:59,270  -->  00:06:01,910
but after this visualization was created,

136

00:06:01,910  -->  00:06:04,730
this first bit that we are well familiar

137

00:06:04,730  -->  00:06:08,270
with then a new layer was applied which

138

00:06:08,270  -->  00:06:11,660
facilitated the zoom on this chart. Once

139

00:06:11,660  -->  00:06:14,720
again that's how layering works in GG

140

00:06:14,720  -->  00:06:15,860
plot.

141

00:06:15,860  -->  00:06:20,780
Ok so now we know how to zoom into our

142

00:06:20,780  -->  00:06:25,220
charts, so let's go ahead and zoom in to

143

00:06:25,220  -->  00:06:28,010
this beautiful plot that we were

144

00:06:28,010  -->  00:06:30,410
creating right? The one that we really

145

00:06:30,410  -->  00:06:32,150
wanted to improve so let's go ahead and

146

00:06:32,150  -->  00:06:35,990
just copy that and we already have the W

147

00:06:35,990  -->  00:06:37,729
letter, so we're not going to

148

00:06:37,729  -->  00:06:40,969
copy the W because we're going to carry

149

00:06:40,969  -->  00:06:45,710
it alone so improve number one and here

150

00:06:45,710  -->  00:06:48,830
so if we run that, what will we see, we will see

151

00:06:48,830  -->  00:06:51,349
that amazing visualization that we like a

152

00:06:51,349  -->  00:06:55,039
lot but it's from minus 50 to 150 which

153

00:06:55,039  -->  00:06:58,430
is not what we want. We're gonna say plus cord

154

00:06:58,430  -->  00:07:00,979
Cartesian and here we want to say y

155

00:07:00,979  -->  00:07:05,930
lim equals C zero to a hundred. Alright

156

00:07:05,930  -->  00:07:10,039
if I run that, give it a second. Viola!  Beautiful!

157

00:07:10,039  -->  00:07:15,319
Exactly what we wanted right? So here now

158

00:07:15,319  -->  00:07:17,839
you can derive so many more insights

159

00:07:17,839  -->  00:07:21,409
from this chart, you can see that you can

160

00:07:21,409  -->  00:07:23,569
see the trends this exactly the CEO was

161

00:07:23,569  -->  00:07:25,849
are asking, remember that little scribble they

162

00:07:25,849  -->  00:07:27,979
were supplied with at the very start. All

163

00:07:27,979  -->  00:07:29,689
this is what he wanted he just didn't

164

00:07:29,689  -->  00:07:33,110
know what he wanted and so like all

165

00:07:33,110  -->  00:07:34,460
these over here at the bottom

166

00:07:34,460  -->  00:07:36,289
statistically probably insignificant

167

00:07:36,289  -->  00:07:39,020
except for probably romance in 2011

168

00:07:39,020  -->  00:07:40,729
really picked up but otherwise not

169

00:07:40,729  -->  00:07:42,589
enough data to make a lot of conclusions

170

00:07:42,589  -->  00:07:45,080
but here we've got some interesting

171

00:07:45,080  -->  00:07:48,050
visualizations so you can see that for

172

00:07:48,050  -->  00:07:49,550
instance or can receive you can see that

173

00:07:49,550  -->  00:07:52,849
action is when the critics rate action

174

00:07:52,849  -->  00:07:56,449
low, the audience tends to rate it pretty low to,

175

00:07:56,449  -->  00:07:58,490
right but when critics rate it high,

176

00:07:58,490  -->  00:08:01,669
audience also rated pretty high whereas

177

00:08:01,669  -->  00:08:06,110
in the what is this comedy in the comedy

178

00:08:06,110  -->  00:08:07,789
genre you can see that the audience

179

00:08:07,789  -->  00:08:10,370
rarely rated across the years. The

180

00:08:10,370  -->  00:08:12,680
audience rarely rates comedies very low

181

00:08:12,680  -->  00:08:15,169
right rates them pretty ok.

182

00:08:15,169  -->  00:08:17,029
Regardless of how the critics rate them

183

00:08:17,029  -->  00:08:19,339
but it's the same time it is also hard

184

00:08:19,339  -->  00:08:22,999
and has been hard for comedies to get

185

00:08:22,999  -->  00:08:24,919
very high ratings of audience like for

186

00:08:24,919  -->  00:08:28,249
instance in 2008, no comedy ever got a

187

00:08:28,249  -->  00:08:31,159
rating over 80 and then improved a

188

00:08:31,159  -->  00:08:32,959
little bit, improved ability and better

189

00:08:32,959  -->  00:08:34,880
so you can see that the tendency for

190

00:08:34,880  -->  00:08:37,639
comedies that the audience ratings are

191

00:08:37,639  -->  00:08:41,180
slowly slowly improving whereas with the

192

00:08:41,180  -->  00:08:43,320
action genre

193

00:08:43,320  -->  00:08:45,360
and even though it's a bit more volatile

194

00:08:45,360  -->  00:08:47,610
so it's a bit riskier to be here because

195

00:08:47,610  -->  00:08:49,800
you can get a bad rating from the

196

00:08:49,800  -->  00:08:51,420
audience but you can also get a very

197

00:08:51,420  -->  00:08:53,850
good rating and a respectable viewer. So if

198

00:08:53,850  -->  00:08:55,260
you want to play it safe, you might

199

00:08:55,260  -->  00:08:57,900
create a comedy if you want to be on the

200

00:08:57,900  -->  00:08:59,700
riskier your side and you want the great

201

00:08:59,700  -->  00:09:01,650
ratings for the audience then you might

202

00:09:01,650  -->  00:09:05,250
create an action film and what else

203

00:09:05,250  -->  00:09:06,750
do we have? Well we've got some information

204

00:09:06,750  -->  00:09:10,110
here on drama as well right so it looks

205

00:09:10,110  -->  00:09:12,570
like especially in the recent years

206

00:09:12,570  -->  00:09:15,000
looks like people like drama a lot so if

207

00:09:15,000  -->  00:09:17,490
you just look at this smoother it's

208

00:09:17,490  -->  00:09:19,560
sitting regardless of the critic rating

209

00:09:19,560  -->  00:09:21,960
it's sitting above 50 for the past three

210

00:09:21,960  -->  00:09:24,090
years of two 2009, 2010, 2011

211

00:09:24,090  -->  00:09:25,980
really actually all the years in all the

212

00:09:25,980  -->  00:09:29,100
years the smoother the middle line is

213

00:09:29,100  -->  00:09:31,440
sitting above 50 regardless of the

214

00:09:31,440  -->  00:09:32,760
critic rating which is also an

215

00:09:32,760  -->  00:09:34,800
interesting insight. So there we go so

216

00:09:34,800  -->  00:09:38,070
quite a few valuable insights from this

217

00:09:38,070  -->  00:09:40,950
one chart and we'll definitely include

218

00:09:40,950  -->  00:09:43,950
it finally ready so let's save it as image.

219

00:09:43,950  -->  00:09:46,650
This one's tricky because it's like if I

220

00:09:46,650  -->  00:09:49,260
just said different proportions it might

221

00:09:49,260  -->  00:09:52,110
squeeze it now it actually looks pretty

222

00:09:52,110  -->  00:09:54,090
alright so let's go ahead and save that

223

00:09:54,090  -->  00:09:56,790
and where is it?

224

00:09:56,790  -->  00:09:59,310
There it is going to be our first chart.

225

00:09:59,310  -->  00:10:01,320
Alright beautiful

226

00:10:01,320  -->  00:10:03,990
so there we go one more to go, one more

227

00:10:03,990  -->  00:10:05,250
chart to go and we already know what that is

228

00:10:05,250  -->  00:10:07,470
that's the bar chart which we wanted to

229

00:10:07,470  -->  00:10:09,570
improve and that's what we're going to

230

00:10:09,570  -->  00:10:11,340
be talking about next time. We're going

231

00:10:11,340  -->  00:10:14,850
to be learning how to further improve

232

00:10:14,850  -->  00:10:17,580
our charts and I hope you enjoyed today's

233

00:10:17,580  -->  00:10:20,250
tutorial. I look forward to seeing you

234

00:10:20,250  -->  00:10:21,690
next time, happy

235

00:10:21,690  -->  00:10:33,049
coding.
