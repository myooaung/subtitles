00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06,960  -->  00:00:08,610
R programming and in today's tutorial

3

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:11,160
we will solve the challenge for section

4

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:11,849
five.

5

00:00:11,849  -->  00:00:14,340
So I've already copied the csv file onto

6

00:00:14,340  -->  00:00:17,010
my computer and I've got the vectors

7

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:19,800
file open here in R. So let's go ahead

8

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:22,170
and run all this so that we got the

9

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:24,480
vectors in our environment prepared over

10

00:00:24,480  -->  00:00:26,460
there and let's make some space on here.

11

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:29,099
So there are the vectors that's beautiful

12

00:00:29,099  -->  00:00:31,830
now let's load the csv file. The comments

13

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:33,450
load data, now

14

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:35,969
first we'll get the working directory. Ok

15

00:00:35,969  -->  00:00:38,640
that's not exactly what I need to load

16

00:00:38,640  -->  00:00:39,899
my data because it's in a different

17

00:00:39,899  -->  00:00:43,230
folder so I 'll just copy that and I will

18

00:00:43,230  -->  00:00:45,960
set the working directory to desktop slash

19

00:00:45,960  -->  00:00:49,469
R programming, if I run that get working

20

00:00:49,469  -->  00:00:52,110
directory good now bear in mind that

21

00:00:52,110  -->  00:00:54,539
this is for a mac this style is for mac

22

00:00:54,539  -->  00:00:56,579
for windows it would be different it

23

00:00:56,579  -->  00:00:59,940
would be something like let me try type

24

00:00:59,940  -->  00:01:03,059
it up here so it'd be C colon, slash, slash

25

00:01:03,059  -->  00:01:05,339
actually backslash backslash users

26

00:01:05,339  -->  00:01:08,610
backslash backslash, Kirill desktop and so

27

00:01:08,610  -->  00:01:09,000
on

28

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:11,220
right so you can complete that if you're

29

00:01:11,220  -->  00:01:13,740
working windows. Alright now what we're

30

00:01:13,740  -->  00:01:14,850
going to do is we're going to actually

31

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:16,950
load the data we're going to put into a

32

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,020
data frame called the data into an object

33

00:01:19,020  -->  00:01:21,240
called data and we'll use the

34

00:01:21,240  -->  00:01:23,220
CSV function and here we'll say

35

00:01:23,220  -->  00:01:28,320
section 5 more data dot CSV, run that

36

00:01:28,320  -->  00:01:29,549
you can see that the data frames

37

00:01:29,549  -->  00:01:31,829
appeared and we can look at it already

38

00:01:31,829  -->  00:01:34,200
now but once again it's very big we

39

00:01:34,200  -->  00:01:36,119
don't want to scroll through all of this

40

00:01:36,119  -->  00:01:38,549
will take time. So let's use the

41

00:01:38,549  -->  00:01:41,430
functions that we now know to explore

42

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:44,790
data sets so head data gives the top six

43

00:01:44,790  -->  00:01:47,640
rows and here we can see we've got

44

00:01:47,640  -->  00:01:50,909
country name, country code, region, year and

45

00:01:50,909  -->  00:01:52,200
fertility rate. So what's missing from

46

00:01:52,200  -->  00:01:52,829
here?

47

00:01:52,829  -->  00:01:55,259
Well what's missing is of course our

48

00:01:55,259  -->  00:01:57,509
life expectancy for variable and that is

49

00:01:57,509  -->  00:01:59,939
given to us in the vectors

50

00:01:59,939  -->  00:02:02,219
ok so that's good to know, let's look at tail

51

00:02:02,219  -->  00:02:03,570
alright.

52

00:02:03,570  -->  00:02:05,460
Do you see anything suspicious here? Well

53

00:02:05,460  -->  00:02:08,190
maybe a little bit, you can see that year

54

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:10,770
here was nineteen sixty across-the-board

55

00:02:10,770  -->  00:02:12,720
here is 2013.

56

00:02:12,720  -->  00:02:15,120
So that right away jumps out at you

57

00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:16,500
you're paying attention to the data

58

00:02:16,500  -->  00:02:19,230
that's a good thing that we noticed

59

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:20,790
something plus we also know that from

60

00:02:20,790  -->  00:02:22,230
the challenges we've got two years in

61

00:02:22,230  -->  00:02:24,900
the data set so looks like first to all

62

00:02:24,900  -->  00:02:26,640
the rows for one year and then it's all

63

00:02:26,640  -->  00:02:28,830
the rows the next year. So let's have a

64

00:02:28,830  -->  00:02:30,570
look at the next function str structure

65

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:35,070
for data and here we've got, we've got

66

00:02:35,070  -->  00:02:39,960
five columns and we've got 374

67

00:02:39,960  -->  00:02:42,630
observations and we've got some factors

68

00:02:42,630  -->  00:02:44,970
then we've got year which seems to be an

69

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:47,400
integer instead of a factor as you can

70

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:48,720
imagine in we're not going to be

71

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:51,150
performing any arithmetic calculations with

72

00:02:51,150  -->  00:02:54,060
year but R is seeing it as an an

73

00:02:54,060  -->  00:02:56,370
numeric variable instead of a factor

74

00:02:56,370  -->  00:02:57,750
would have been better for the factor

75

00:02:57,750  -->  00:02:59,940
for us but anyway doesn't make that much

76

00:02:59,940  -->  00:03:01,590
of a difference. So let's look at summary

77

00:03:01,590  -->  00:03:03,780
data. What do we see here? Well here we've

78

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:05,340
got country name and what you can see

79

00:03:05,340  -->  00:03:06,959
right away and country code is that

80

00:03:06,959  -->  00:03:09,660
instead of being there being one record

81

00:03:09,660  -->  00:03:11,640
for each country is two records right

82

00:03:11,640  -->  00:03:13,500
and that is in line with what we were

83

00:03:13,500  -->  00:03:15,600
told that there's two years in the

84

00:03:15,600  -->  00:03:17,700
data set and then if you look at here

85

00:03:17,700  -->  00:03:19,680
we've got the minimum, the maximum and a

86

00:03:19,680  -->  00:03:21,750
median. So once again this makes

87

00:03:21,750  -->  00:03:24,840
absolutely no sense and that is because

88

00:03:24,840  -->  00:03:27,239
year should be a factor variable should

89

00:03:27,239  -->  00:03:28,830
get categorical variable rather than

90

00:03:28,830  -->  00:03:30,480
numeric. So now I'm going to actually

91

00:03:30,480  -->  00:03:31,709
show you a quick preview and this

92

00:03:31,709  -->  00:03:33,330
previous only going to be available for

93

00:03:33,330  -->  00:03:36,450
people that watched the solution for

94

00:03:36,450  -->  00:03:39,030
this section so congratulations and it's

95

00:03:39,030  -->  00:03:43,019
going to be end in sight into the next

96

00:03:43,019  -->  00:03:46,500
section. So we've got a variable here data

97

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:47,940
this is going to be talking a little bit

98

00:03:47,940  -->  00:03:50,549
about in the next session. So we've got a

99

00:03:50,549  -->  00:03:53,610
variable here data and it's called year, if

100

00:03:53,610  -->  00:03:56,400
I run that you can see that it's got

101

00:03:56,400  -->  00:03:59,010
all these years in there so what I want

102

00:03:59,010  -->  00:04:01,680
to do is I want to turn this variable

103

00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:03,900
into a factor right. We saw that it's not

104

00:04:03,900  -->  00:04:05,910
a factor it's just a numeric number.

105

00:04:05,910  -->  00:04:09,090
Let's say a temp variable and here we'll

106

00:04:09,090  -->  00:04:10,830
say factor,

107

00:04:10,830  -->  00:04:12,480
surprise, surprise the function name is

108

00:04:12,480  -->  00:04:16,680
very obvious data, year so if I run that

109

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:19,799
I've got a temp variable that is a

110

00:04:19,799  -->  00:04:21,599
factor so you can see that it's got all

111

00:04:21,599  -->  00:04:23,310
the same numbers but at the end it tells

112

00:04:23,310  -->  00:04:24,450
you how many levels it has,

113

00:04:24,450  -->  00:04:26,490
two levels and you can actually check

114

00:04:26,490  -->  00:04:29,400
that a separate. You can say levels temp

115

00:04:29,400  -->  00:04:32,910
so there you go so that's how to turn a

116

00:04:32,910  -->  00:04:35,220
normal variable and numeric variable that you

117

00:04:35,220  -->  00:04:36,900
don't want to be in numeric into a

118

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:38,850
factor variable and in fact you could

119

00:04:38,850  -->  00:04:42,600
even override your existing column with

120

00:04:42,600  -->  00:04:44,520
this new temp variable but we're not

121

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:45,720
going to do that that was just quick

122

00:04:45,720  -->  00:04:47,790
sneak peek into the next section.

123

00:04:47,790  -->  00:04:49,860
Alright so let's get back to chart what

124

00:04:49,860  -->  00:04:52,080
are we doing now? What we're doing now is

125

00:04:52,080  -->  00:04:55,230
we are going to split the data frame

126

00:04:55,230  -->  00:04:57,510
because we have two years and one

127

00:04:57,510  -->  00:04:58,950
data frame we want to split it into

128

00:04:58,950  -->  00:05:01,590
two so let's go ahead and do that, filter

129

00:05:01,590  -->  00:05:04,770
the data frame. Alright how do we

130

00:05:04,770  -->  00:05:06,720
filter a data frame? Ok just because

131

00:05:06,720  -->  00:05:08,550
put this tab and now it's following

132

00:05:08,550  -->  00:05:10,740
around good. How do we filter the data

133

00:05:10,740  -->  00:05:14,340
frame? We say data1960, going to be

134

00:05:14,340  -->  00:05:15,720
a first data frame is going to be

135

00:05:15,720  -->  00:05:19,080
data and here we want the filter right.

136

00:05:19,080  -->  00:05:21,090
So I'll create the filter first and then

137

00:05:21,090  -->  00:05:24,630
we'll play paste in that year equals to

138

00:05:24,630  -->  00:05:28,950
1960 maybe remove that space.

139

00:05:28,950  -->  00:05:31,230
Okay so if I run that you'll see we've

140

00:05:31,230  -->  00:05:33,930
got first about true true true true

141

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:36,900
true and then we've got false, false ...

142

00:05:36,900  -->  00:05:39,330
so basically we've create a filter vector

143

00:05:39,330  -->  00:05:41,100
right which we talked about in this

144

00:05:41,100  -->  00:05:43,710
section and if I copy here it will tell

145

00:05:43,710  -->  00:05:45,750
me which rows I want to take and don't

146

00:05:45,750  -->  00:05:47,940
forget the comma, comma nothing because I

147

00:05:47,940  -->  00:05:49,440
want all the columns and I want only the

148

00:05:49,440  -->  00:05:52,140
rows that will have true in this vector.

149

00:05:52,140  -->  00:05:54,870
So if I run this you'll see that it's a

150

00:05:54,870  -->  00:05:58,440
data frame that only has 1960 and right

151

00:05:58,440  -->  00:06:00,840
so if you look on the right here in

152

00:06:00,840  -->  00:06:03,360
the year column you'll see that only has

153

00:06:03,360  -->  00:06:05,700
1960 all the way and hundred

154

00:06:05,700  -->  00:06:08,310
eighty-seven rows. So exactly half of

155

00:06:08,310  -->  00:06:10,440
the data frame so if I run this line

156

00:06:10,440  -->  00:06:12,840
I've got the data 1960 now same thing

157

00:06:12,840  -->  00:06:16,470
for data 2013, 13 they're just copy this

158

00:06:16,470  -->  00:06:20,190
line and here we want equals 2013,

159

00:06:20,190  -->  00:06:21,900
beautiful.

160

00:06:21,900  -->  00:06:23,730
Okay, so we split the data frame into 2

161

00:06:23,730  -->  00:06:25,980
now let's do a quick check because

162

00:06:25,980  -->  00:06:28,440
always good to do checks for audit

163

00:06:28,440  -->  00:06:30,810
purposes, check row count and also we get

164

00:06:30,810  -->  00:06:32,340
to practice the end row function which

165

00:06:32,340  -->  00:06:35,760
we learnt data 1960.

166

00:06:35,760  -->  00:06:38,010
If you  run that you've got 180 sounds good

167

00:06:38,010  -->  00:06:41,070
idea to put a comma here saying that there's

168

00:06:41,070  -->  00:06:45,570
187 rows and row data 2013 run that

169

00:06:45,570  -->  00:06:50,550
once again 187 rows and let's type it in and

170

00:06:50,550  -->  00:06:53,760
we can say equal split which is good

171

00:06:53,760  -->  00:06:56,340
right means everything is working as it

172

00:06:56,340  -->  00:06:58,200
should be and also they should adapt to

173

00:06:58,200  -->  00:07:00,630
374 which is a total number of rows and

174

00:07:00,630  -->  00:07:03,240
they do alright. Now we want to create

175

00:07:03,240  -->  00:07:06,870
the additional data frames because we

176

00:07:06,870  -->  00:07:08,580
have those vectors and they should

177

00:07:08,580  -->  00:07:10,710
actually be in data frames so that

178

00:07:10,710  -->  00:07:12,060
we can work with them better

179

00:07:12,060  -->  00:07:14,670
let's do that, add 1960's going to be the

180

00:07:14,670  -->  00:07:18,120
name of our data frame for the 1960

181

00:07:18,120  -->  00:07:21,540
vectors data frame and so here we're going

182

00:07:21,540  -->  00:07:23,190
to use that trick. We're not going to

183

00:07:23,190  -->  00:07:25,470
just type in country code right? We're

184

00:07:25,470  -->  00:07:28,620
going to actually say country equals

185

00:07:28,620  -->  00:07:30,660
country code because we want the name of

186

00:07:30,660  -->  00:07:32,760
the new column to be country and then

187

00:07:32,760  -->  00:07:35,310
we're going to say life that's a dot

188

00:07:35,310  -->  00:07:39,450
expectancy equals life expectancy at

189

00:07:39,450  -->  00:07:44,160
Birth 1960, alright and then add 2013

190

00:07:44,160  -->  00:07:47,340
data frame and same thing. So let's just

191

00:07:47,340  -->  00:07:50,490
copy that here will say 2013 right and

192

00:07:50,490  -->  00:07:52,740
by the way this is life expectancy at

193

00:07:52,740  -->  00:07:54,690
birth just an average in that population

194

00:07:54,690  -->  00:07:58,110
for that year and we'll see how they

195

00:07:58,110  -->  00:08:00,120
work together with fertility and the

196

00:08:00,120  -->  00:08:01,740
final result, so there we go we've got

197

00:08:01,740  -->  00:08:03,510
the two new data frames which is great

198

00:08:03,510  -->  00:08:05,730
now let's check them will check

199

00:08:05,730  -->  00:08:08,580
summaries this time. Will say summary,

200

00:08:08,580  -->  00:08:12,330
add 1960 right. So there you go, you get

201

00:08:12,330  -->  00:08:14,790
your countries so that should add up to

202

00:08:14,790  -->  00:08:18,150
187 and here you've got your mean,

203

00:08:18,150  -->  00:08:21,750
median, maximum and quartiles and you can

204

00:08:21,750  -->  00:08:23,610
kind of understand the life expectancy

205

00:08:23,610  -->  00:08:26,160
was never less than 28 which is very low

206

00:08:26,160  -->  00:08:28,920
actually and never more than 73 for any

207

00:08:28,920  -->  00:08:35,099
country in 1960 summary add 2013 so here

208

00:08:35,099  -->  00:08:36,300
you can see that life expectancy

209

00:08:36,300  -->  00:08:39,630
increased I went from 28 to 48 add the 20

210

00:08:39,630  -->  00:08:41,580
years to the average life expectancy

211

00:08:41,580  -->  00:08:45,240
across countries of the world and maximum

212

00:08:45,240  -->  00:08:47,490
went up to 83 so maximum increase as

213

00:08:47,490  -->  00:08:48,870
much but it increased

214

00:08:48,870  -->  00:08:51,779
by around 10 years. Alright that's

215

00:08:51,779  -->  00:08:55,710
good, now we're going to merge the pairs

216

00:08:55,710  -->  00:08:57,750
of data frames.

217

00:08:57,750  -->  00:09:00,779
Let's do that alright let's make some

218

00:09:00,779  -->  00:09:03,270
space and how do we merge? Well we'll use

219

00:09:03,270  -->  00:09:04,650
the merge function. First we're going

220

00:09:04,650  -->  00:09:08,610
to create object merged 1960 and here we

221

00:09:08,610  -->  00:09:13,860
want to merge data 1960 then add 1960

222

00:09:13,860  -->  00:09:15,750
which makes sense right that the data

223

00:09:15,750  -->  00:09:18,810
frame that we split out this one and

224

00:09:18,810  -->  00:09:20,520
the one that we created over here from

225

00:09:20,520  -->  00:09:23,220
the vectors and then we want how to merge

226

00:09:23,220  -->  00:09:25,380
by dot X which column we're

227

00:09:25,380  -->  00:09:26,490
going to use in the first data frame

228

00:09:26,490  -->  00:09:30,150
going to use country dot code and which

229

00:09:30,150  -->  00:09:33,060
one gonna use the second data frame by dot y if

230

00:09:33,060  -->  00:09:34,620
you're going to use just code because

231

00:09:34,620  -->  00:09:36,510
that's the name of the column in this

232

00:09:36,510  -->  00:09:37,710
data frame.

233

00:09:37,710  -->  00:09:43,020
Ok so now let's go ahead and actually

234

00:09:43,020  -->  00:09:45,180
run this. What you'll see is actually one

235

00:09:45,180  -->  00:09:47,370
run because I named these columns and

236

00:09:47,370  -->  00:09:48,960
correctly this should be called as like

237

00:09:48,960  -->  00:09:50,130
wondering what's going on.

238

00:09:50,130  -->  00:09:52,260
So this should be code not country

239

00:09:52,260  -->  00:09:54,600
codes for the re-run those and now if

240

00:09:54,600  -->  00:09:56,760
we try running that there we go now it

241

00:09:56,760  -->  00:09:59,940
works, ok so be careful with that hope

242

00:09:59,940  -->  00:10:01,589
you picked up on that too well as typing

243

00:10:01,589  -->  00:10:04,350
it and now we're going to do emerged

244

00:10:04,350  -->  00:10:08,700
2013 let's do same thing but just 2013

245

00:10:08,700  -->  00:10:12,990
alright. Alright run that

246

00:10:12,990  -->  00:10:15,480
and there we go so both data

247

00:10:15,480  -->  00:10:18,450
frames ok let's now check how we're going

248

00:10:18,450  -->  00:10:20,940
to check them maybe let's check the

249

00:10:20,940  -->  00:10:25,080
structure hashtag check the new

250

00:10:25,080  -->  00:10:27,779
structures cause ultimately we've just

251

00:10:27,779  -->  00:10:30,120
created new data frames by merging so

252

00:10:30,120  -->  00:10:31,950
it's a good idea to check the structure

253

00:10:31,950  -->  00:10:34,770
and see how they going. Alright so you're a

254

00:10:34,770  -->  00:10:37,230
country code, country name, region, year,

255

00:10:37,230  -->  00:10:39,089
fertility rate, life expectancy so we've

256

00:10:39,089  -->  00:10:41,160
basically added that column that we were

257

00:10:41,160  -->  00:10:42,690
after and we just need to make sure that

258

00:10:42,690  -->  00:10:45,180
we added the right year to the right a

259

00:10:45,180  -->  00:10:50,100
year and same thing merge 2013 okay

260

00:10:50,100  -->  00:10:52,920
looks good so there we go the only thing

261

00:10:52,920  -->  00:10:54,330
I wanted to say here is be careful when

262

00:10:54,330  -->  00:10:57,660
merging so in our case we know that the

263

00:10:57,660  -->  00:11:00,089
number of variable is the same in these

264

00:11:00,089  -->  00:11:02,400
are number of rows of the same in these

265

00:11:02,400  -->  00:11:05,040
then there's no duplicate on so none of

266

00:11:05,040  -->  00:11:07,860
these columns is duplicated in their

267

00:11:07,860  -->  00:11:09,660
respective data set if you're merging

268

00:11:09,660  -->  00:11:12,120
and for instance there's a duplicate in

269

00:11:12,120  -->  00:11:14,850
this column code then what that will do

270

00:11:14,850  -->  00:11:17,880
is obviously it will duplicate the

271

00:11:17,880  -->  00:11:21,930
matching rows for this data set. So be

272

00:11:21,930  -->  00:11:24,090
very careful careful emerging outcomes

273

00:11:24,090  -->  00:11:28,260
of experience has emerged more data sets

274

00:11:28,260  -->  00:11:30,630
and kind of think of it as a v-look

275

00:11:30,630  -->  00:11:33,390
up operation so if you were doing a

276

00:11:33,390  -->  00:11:35,370
v-lookup and there was a duplicate in

277

00:11:35,370  -->  00:11:37,830
this column or in this column obviously

278

00:11:37,830  -->  00:11:40,680
they're the v-lookup in Excel. You know we

279

00:11:40,680  -->  00:11:43,170
generate and not the exact results that

280

00:11:43,170  -->  00:11:45,060
you want to be careful if your data does

281

00:11:45,060  -->  00:11:46,770
have duplicate rows or even duplicate

282

00:11:46,770  -->  00:11:49,020
values in the columns year. A merging on

283

00:11:49,020  -->  00:11:51,810
so you need to take that into

284

00:11:51,810  -->  00:11:53,790
account when you're pretty merges.

285

00:11:53,790  -->  00:11:55,980
Alright so what are we doing now we're

286

00:11:55,980  -->  00:11:59,490
going to get rid of this variable of

287

00:11:59,490  -->  00:12:02,190
this column year because we don't really

288

00:12:02,190  -->  00:12:04,680
need it it's it's obsolete because we

289

00:12:04,680  -->  00:12:07,470
know the year and here's 1960 and here

290

00:12:07,470  -->  00:12:10,560
2013 there is no different years and each

291

00:12:10,560  -->  00:12:12,480
data set. lt'll be good chance for us

292

00:12:12,480  -->  00:12:14,640
to practice the leading columns so

293

00:12:14,640  -->  00:12:16,470
delete columns.

294

00:12:16,470  -->  00:12:21,720
Let's go and do that merged 1960 dollar sign

295

00:12:21,720  -->  00:12:24,810
year and that's going to be a null, run that.

296

00:12:24,810  -->  00:12:28,650
Ok and run this one is going to be 2013

297

00:12:28,650  -->  00:12:31,830
here run that beautiful so now we're

298

00:12:31,830  -->  00:12:33,960
around this line and this line you'll

299

00:12:33,960  -->  00:12:36,090
see that we don't have the year column

300

00:12:36,090  -->  00:12:37,320
anymore because we don't really need it

301

00:12:37,320  -->  00:12:39,030
we know what you're dealing with.

302

00:12:39,030  -->  00:12:42,480
Alright visualization time, time, yey

303

00:12:42,480  -->  00:12:45,540
library looking at the library ggplot2

304

00:12:45,540  -->  00:12:47,130
don't forget you need to install the

305

00:12:47,130  -->  00:12:49,350
package this actually package the

306

00:12:49,350  -->  00:12:51,360
functions collaborate. You need to

307

00:12:51,360  -->  00:12:54,210
install the package if you don't have it

308

00:12:54,210  -->  00:12:57,570
but you should buy now visualize the

309

00:12:57,570  -->  00:12:59,850
1960 data set.

310

00:12:59,850  -->  00:13:02,550
Alright let's do this Q plot, Q plot to

311

00:13:02,550  -->  00:13:03,330
the rescue.

312

00:13:03,330  -->  00:13:05,940
How do we use q plot well let's step it up

313

00:13:05,940  -->  00:13:10,140
data equals emerged 1960 obviously in

314

00:13:10,140  -->  00:13:12,240
the data then you need X we were told

315

00:13:12,240  -->  00:13:14,340
was supposed to be thrilled to fertility

316

00:13:14,340  -->  00:13:15,480
rate

317

00:13:15,480  -->  00:13:17,910
and why it's supposed to be life dot

318

00:13:17,910  -->  00:13:21,990
expectancy, good! That's a start and then we

319

00:13:21,990  -->  00:13:25,560
want to color going to be a region and

320

00:13:25,560  -->  00:13:28,410
looks just from that for now, see what we

321

00:13:28,410  -->  00:13:28,829
get.

322

00:13:28,829  -->  00:13:31,620
Ok it looks good, it's over here. It's

323

00:13:31,620  -->  00:13:35,459
tiny. It's but it's there and let's make

324

00:13:35,459  -->  00:13:36,720
some space.

325

00:13:36,720  -->  00:13:38,639
Alright next we want to do is increase

326

00:13:38,639  -->  00:13:41,190
the size, size equals don't forget about

327

00:13:41,190  -->  00:13:43,260
the I because we want to apply to

328

00:13:43,260  -->  00:13:46,019
everything and add transparency right

329

00:13:46,019  -->  00:13:51,600
away alpha equals I 0.6. So if I run that

330

00:13:51,600  -->  00:13:53,010
awesome

331

00:13:53,010  -->  00:13:56,730
the last thing we need is to add a title

332

00:13:56,730  -->  00:14:01,740
main and I'll say life expectancy vs

333

00:14:01,740  -->  00:14:06,360
fertility. Fertility is how many children

334

00:14:06,360  -->  00:14:08,970
per woman or that per woman on average

335

00:14:08,970  -->  00:14:11,160
in that country that year. So if I run that

336

00:14:11,160  -->  00:14:13,920
we've got the title and now I'm just

337

00:14:13,920  -->  00:14:15,570
going to copy that and I'm going to

338

00:14:15,570  -->  00:14:18,480
change this to 2013 it's as easy as that

339

00:14:18,480  -->  00:14:19,860
because the data sets are actually

340

00:14:19,860  -->  00:14:23,279
identical in terms of the structure we

341

00:14:23,279  -->  00:14:24,420
don't have to change anything else

342

00:14:24,420  -->  00:14:26,040
inside so far on this is going to be

343

00:14:26,040  -->  00:14:29,490
2013. Alright beautiful so now I'll show

344

00:14:29,490  -->  00:14:30,750
you another trick over here there's two

345

00:14:30,750  -->  00:14:33,899
arrows and actually let's let's make

346

00:14:33,899  -->  00:14:35,639
some space because we don't need the

347

00:14:35,639  -->  00:14:37,529
code anymore we just need this chart and

348

00:14:37,529  -->  00:14:39,540
let's zoom into the chart and you'll see

349

00:14:39,540  -->  00:14:42,269
that here there are two arrows and you

350

00:14:42,269  -->  00:14:44,459
can go back in terms of visualization

351

00:14:44,459  -->  00:14:47,370
and forward and now just bear in mind

352

00:14:47,370  -->  00:14:49,050
that access did change but we can

353

00:14:49,050  -->  00:14:51,120
compare the two years so we can see that

354

00:14:51,120  -->  00:14:52,440
here

355

00:14:52,440  -->  00:14:55,019
african countries the red ones were at

356

00:14:55,019  -->  00:14:56,699
high fertility rates are lots of

357

00:14:56,699  -->  00:15:00,089
children per woman and very low life

358

00:15:00,089  -->  00:15:02,160
expectancy, where as the European

359

00:15:02,160  -->  00:15:05,819
countries were at very low fertility so

360

00:15:05,819  -->  00:15:08,250
between two and four children proven and

361

00:15:08,250  -->  00:15:10,860
very low, still very high but you know

362

00:15:10,860  -->  00:15:13,170
lower than African countries and very

363

00:15:13,170  -->  00:15:15,209
high in terms of life expectancy and

364

00:15:15,209  -->  00:15:17,220
what changed in the past all not done in

365

00:15:17,220  -->  00:15:19,139
the past but in 53 years between the two

366

00:15:19,139  -->  00:15:21,029
data sets. What which you can see

367

00:15:21,029  -->  00:15:23,250
that the fertility rates dropped

368

00:15:23,250  -->  00:15:26,189
substantially so here it was between six

369

00:15:26,189  -->  00:15:28,019
and eight for African country

370

00:15:28,019  -->  00:15:31,110
now or in 2013 was between four and six

371

00:15:31,110  -->  00:15:34,290
and the life expectancy increased so

372

00:15:34,290  -->  00:15:38,069
back here it was between just 30 and

373

00:15:38,069  -->  00:15:42,119
up to 60-below 60 and now is between 50

374

00:15:42,119  -->  00:15:44,610
and 70. In European countries these

375

00:15:44,610  -->  00:15:46,739
green ones you can see how the number of

376

00:15:46,739  -->  00:15:48,839
children between two and four and now

377

00:15:48,839  -->  00:15:51,660
it's dropped between one and two

378

00:15:51,660  -->  00:15:54,149
children. So less than two children on

379

00:15:54,149  -->  00:15:56,309
average along European country but the

380

00:15:56,309  -->  00:15:58,470
life expectancy has increased so as you

381

00:15:58,470  -->  00:16:01,199
can see a huge dramatic changed all of

382

00:16:01,199  -->  00:16:02,639
these countries are moving from here

383

00:16:02,639  -->  00:16:05,850
into the left top left corner slowly

384

00:16:05,850  -->  00:16:07,769
slowly slowly getting there and that's

385

00:16:07,769  -->  00:16:09,629
where the world is going and that's

386

00:16:09,629  -->  00:16:11,670
exactly the inside the beautiful inside

387

00:16:11,670  -->  00:16:13,470
that the world bank was after and

388

00:16:13,470  -->  00:16:15,569
congratulations on delivering that

389

00:16:15,569  -->  00:16:17,610
successfully. I hope you enjoyed this

390

00:16:17,610  -->  00:16:19,649
homework exercise and you were able to

391

00:16:19,649  -->  00:16:21,059
practice a lot of things that we talked

392

00:16:21,059  -->  00:16:23,160
about can't wait to see in the next section

393

00:16:23,160  -->  00:16:32,659
and until next time, happy coding.
