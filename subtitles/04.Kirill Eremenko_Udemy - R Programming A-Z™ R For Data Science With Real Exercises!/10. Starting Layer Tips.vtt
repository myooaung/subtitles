00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.839
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:06.839  -->  00:00:09.269
R programming and today we're back at

3

00:00:09.269  -->  00:00:11.849
aesthetics and that's because I would

4

00:00:11.849  -->  00:00:15.240
like to give you some tips on how to

5

00:00:15.240  -->  00:00:18.150
strategically approach your chart

6

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:21.090
creation process with ggplot. Alright

7

00:00:21.090  -->  00:00:23.789
let's go into R studio, so this is

8

00:00:23.789  -->  00:00:24.810
where we stopped last time. We look at

9

00:00:24.810  -->  00:00:27.330
histograms density chart and today I'm

10

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:29.220
going to give you some starting layer

11

00:00:29.220  -->  00:00:30.210
tips.

12

00:00:30.210  -->  00:00:34.140
Alright let's look at what like a simple

13

00:00:34.140  -->  00:00:35.700
histogram that we were you know how

14

00:00:35.700  -->  00:00:37.739
much great. So what's our next letter is

15

00:00:37.739  -->  00:00:40.530
T , T is our next letter, we'll

16

00:00:40.530  -->  00:00:44.610
say ggplot and you by now I am sure

17

00:00:44.610  -->  00:00:46.440
you're getting used to typing on ggplot

18

00:00:46.440  -->  00:00:50.460
plot, ggplot it's it's becoming part of

19

00:00:50.460  -->  00:00:52.500
your skill set.

20

00:00:52.500  -->  00:00:56.340
Alright movies aesthetics extra equals

21

00:00:56.340  -->  00:00:59.550
audience rating right? So that's going to

22

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:02.370
be our T we've prepared our data, we've

23

00:01:02.370  -->  00:01:04.199
prepared our aesthetic and now what are

24

00:01:04.199  -->  00:01:06.299
we going to overlay what geometry? We're going

25

00:01:06.299  -->  00:01:09.119
to say geom histogram and here we want

26

00:01:09.119  -->  00:01:13.409
been with as well you know equals 10 and

27

00:01:13.409  -->  00:01:15.930
then let's say we already know how to

28

00:01:15.930  -->  00:01:18.780
give it color. So we want to, what are we

29

00:01:18.780  -->  00:01:20.610
doing here are we setting or are we mapping?

30

00:01:20.610  -->  00:01:23.040
That's right, we're setting here because

31

00:01:23.040  -->  00:01:24.600
we are not using the static function.

32

00:01:24.600  -->  00:01:26.820
We're not connecting the color to a

33

00:01:26.820  -->  00:01:28.920
variable we're connecting it to a value

34

00:01:28.920  -->  00:01:31.710
we're relying on the underlying value of

35

00:01:31.710  -->  00:01:33.869
that word which is white and then we'll

36

00:01:33.869  -->  00:01:36.840
say color equals and blue, that's the

37

00:01:36.840  -->  00:01:37.530
border.

38

00:01:37.530  -->  00:01:39.630
Alright so if I run these two lines

39

00:01:39.630  -->  00:01:42.150
you'll see that this is the distribution

40

00:01:42.150  -->  00:01:44.970
of audience ratings for the movies

41

00:01:44.970  -->  00:01:48.030
between 2007-2011 and you can see that

42

00:01:48.030  -->  00:01:51.990
it is somewhere around the mean is

43

00:01:51.990  -->  00:01:55.409
around like 50 maybe 60 somewhere there

44

00:01:55.409  -->  00:01:58.290
and so it is a bit above average and

45

00:01:58.290  -->  00:01:59.880
then it's like a normal distribution and

46

00:01:59.880  -->  00:02:00.840
as it should be.

47

00:02:00.840  -->  00:02:02.610
Right, so because we've got lots and lots

48

00:02:02.610  -->  00:02:05.460
of people and people are like just human

49

00:02:05.460  -->  00:02:08.009
beings and human beings often behave in

50

00:02:08.009  -->  00:02:10.349
a normally distributed way. We can

51

00:02:10.349  -->  00:02:12.239
actually observe that there, which is

52

00:02:12.239  -->  00:02:12.700
pretty

53

00:02:12.700  -->  00:02:15.190
cool in when you think about it.

54

00:02:15.190  -->  00:02:16.780
Alright what we're talking about here is

55

00:02:16.780  -->  00:02:19.269
actually how what other way could have

56

00:02:19.269  -->  00:02:22.030
we achieved this plot. Well let's see,

57

00:02:22.030  -->  00:02:25.540
another way another way to achieve the

58

00:02:25.540  -->  00:02:28.180
same thing. We could have said T and this

59

00:02:28.180  -->  00:02:29.590
should come from the knowledge that you

60

00:02:29.590  -->  00:02:32.739
already have from the section. So ggplot

61

00:02:32.739  -->  00:02:35.080
and we could have just said simply data equals

62

00:02:35.080  -->  00:02:37.720
movies and we didn't have to specify

63

00:02:37.720  -->  00:02:40.120
aesthetic right away because just specify T

64

00:02:40.120  -->  00:02:41.470
like that and when then we could have

65

00:02:41.470  -->  00:02:45.010
said all of this T plus. All of this and

66

00:02:45.010  -->  00:02:47.500
the aesthetic would have been somewhere

67

00:02:47.500  -->  00:02:50.019
inside here. We could've said aesthetic X

68

00:02:50.019  -->  00:02:53.470
equals audience rating, right? Do you

69

00:02:53.470  -->  00:02:55.750
agree? That we could have one way is

70

00:02:55.750  -->  00:02:58.120
reset the aesthetic at the start in this

71

00:02:58.120  -->  00:03:01.329
in the base layer and then we add the

72

00:03:01.329  -->  00:03:03.940
geometry with all these other things or

73

00:03:03.940  -->  00:03:05.709
the other way is we don't set this

74

00:03:05.709  -->  00:03:08.650
aesthetic to start we actually set it

75

00:03:08.650  -->  00:03:10.450
inside our geometry. So if I run this

76

00:03:10.450  -->  00:03:12.160
line I should get exactly the same

77

00:03:12.160  -->  00:03:15.910
result. Viola! It is the same and right

78

00:03:15.910  -->  00:03:18.670
makes sense so doesn't matter here like

79

00:03:18.670  -->  00:03:21.549
where we're basically over riding using

80

00:03:21.549  -->  00:03:23.650
the overriding process where over riding

81

00:03:23.650  -->  00:03:26.139
an aesthetic but their aesthetic didn't

82

00:03:26.139  -->  00:03:28.630
even exist in the start. So because we

83

00:03:28.630  -->  00:03:31.540
only have this one layer that it doesn't

84

00:03:31.540  -->  00:03:33.010
make a difference which way we do it. So

85

00:03:33.010  -->  00:03:35.560
the question is which way do we do it and

86

00:03:35.560  -->  00:03:37.150
before we answer that question I wanted

87

00:03:37.150  -->  00:03:39.190
to say this is going to be our fourth

88

00:03:39.190  -->  00:03:42.100
chart in our presentation. So we'll copy it

89

00:03:42.100  -->  00:03:43.420
in at the end of this tutorial.

90

00:03:43.420  -->  00:03:47.290
So what's the difference? How why would

91

00:03:47.290  -->  00:03:48.639
you do it this way or what would you do

92

00:03:48.639  -->  00:03:50.290
it that way? Well it really depends on

93

00:03:50.290  -->  00:03:53.170
what you want from your visualization

94

00:03:53.170  -->  00:03:55.359
process, which one from the data? If you

95

00:03:55.359  -->  00:03:58.060
are set in what you're visualizing, if

96

00:03:58.060  -->  00:03:59.170
you know that you're going to be using

97

00:03:59.170  -->  00:04:02.109
this object just to visualize audience

98

00:04:02.109  -->  00:04:03.459
rating and maybe once in a while you

99

00:04:03.459  -->  00:04:05.620
will override it if you really need to.

100

00:04:05.620  -->  00:04:08.200
Then you can go ahead and use this

101

00:04:08.200  -->  00:04:10.180
approach and then you know one chart

102

00:04:10.180  -->  00:04:12.790
will be this then the next chart will be

103

00:04:12.790  -->  00:04:14.950
something else might be a point chart or

104

00:04:14.950  -->  00:04:17.979
a line chart or a bar chart or or

105

00:04:17.979  -->  00:04:21.849
anything but also relying on this aesthetic,

106

00:04:21.849  -->  00:04:24.520
but if on the other hand you want more

107

00:04:24.520  -->  00:04:25.860
flexibility. So

108

00:04:25.860  -->  00:04:28.439
you don't want to always visualize X as

109

00:04:28.439  -->  00:04:30.180
audience rating, you want to show you

110

00:04:30.180  -->  00:04:31.860
might want to visualize the budget as

111

00:04:31.860  -->  00:04:33.509
the x-axis. So you might want to

112

00:04:33.509  -->  00:04:37.530
visualize genre on the x-axis, then you

113

00:04:37.530  -->  00:04:39.479
might want to use this approach and when

114

00:04:39.479  -->  00:04:40.680
could that happen? When would you want that

115

00:04:40.680  -->  00:04:42.870
flexibility? When one then one of the

116

00:04:42.870  -->  00:04:45.539
examples is what we're doing now when

117

00:04:45.539  -->  00:04:47.099
we're exploring the data set. When you're

118

00:04:47.099  -->  00:04:48.810
exploring the data when you don't

119

00:04:48.810  -->  00:04:51.090
know exactly what you want. You might

120

00:04:51.090  -->  00:04:53.400
want that extra flexibility so it's

121

00:04:53.400  -->  00:04:55.650
faster for you and to adapt your charts

122

00:04:55.650  -->  00:04:57.150
and in that case you might want to just

123

00:04:57.150  -->  00:04:59.250
create this T object. So use you know

124

00:04:59.250  -->  00:05:00.990
that every time it's going to be the

125

00:05:00.990  -->  00:05:02.189
same data set and if you look through

126

00:05:02.189  -->  00:05:03.900
what we've been doing it every single

127

00:05:03.900  -->  00:05:05.370
time we've been using the same data set.

128

00:05:05.370  -->  00:05:06.810
That's just because we only have one

129

00:05:06.810  -->  00:05:09.360
with us so that's definitely a good

130

00:05:09.360  -->  00:05:11.159
start and that's set in stones. You might

131

00:05:11.159  -->  00:05:13.259
want to start by doing that and then you

132

00:05:13.259  -->  00:05:16.949
just build onto that with new layers

133

00:05:16.949  -->  00:05:19.349
with different aesthetics within those

134

00:05:19.349  -->  00:05:20.969
layers. So I 'll show you an example right

135

00:05:20.969  -->  00:05:23.490
away, so here we could just simply take

136

00:05:23.490  -->  00:05:27.779
this. We could create this chart and we

137

00:05:27.779  -->  00:05:29.759
could just replace here and just one

138

00:05:29.759  -->  00:05:36.060
word in fact critic ratings and then if

139

00:05:36.060  -->  00:05:39.389
we run this, you see that that is the

140

00:05:39.389  -->  00:05:40.860
critical thing. I didn't have to do much.

141

00:05:40.860  -->  00:05:43.860
I didn't have to recreate the T variable

142

00:05:43.860  -->  00:05:45.449
whereas if I use this approach, I would

143

00:05:45.449  -->  00:05:47.009
have had to recreate the T variable

144

00:05:47.009  -->  00:05:48.659
first because the aesthetic is in there

145

00:05:48.659  -->  00:05:50.669
and then do that or I would have to

146

00:05:50.669  -->  00:05:52.560
override aes, I could have used the same

147

00:05:52.560  -->  00:05:53.909
thing I could have over ridden the

148

00:05:53.909  -->  00:05:57.000
variable but Mike overriding is moreover

149

00:05:57.000  -->  00:06:00.180
a one-off or a tool off thing like you

150

00:06:00.180  -->  00:06:02.310
don't do it rarely, don't rely on

151

00:06:02.310  -->  00:06:03.930
overriding all the time because it's not, it's not

152

00:06:03.930  -->  00:06:07.080
the best coding practice and what

153

00:06:07.080  -->  00:06:09.060
do we have here? Well another very

154

00:06:09.060  -->  00:06:11.159
interesting observation. The critic

155

00:06:11.159  -->  00:06:13.979
rating is actually different to the

156

00:06:13.979  -->  00:06:16.500
audience rating. So this was our audience

157

00:06:16.500  -->  00:06:18.629
rating normally distributed. Critic

158

00:06:18.629  -->  00:06:21.539
rating looks like it's more uniformly

159

00:06:21.539  -->  00:06:26.490
distributed and that is a function or

160

00:06:26.490  -->  00:06:28.229
the reason for that is that critics

161

00:06:28.229  -->  00:06:30.419
actually rely on the judgment and their

162

00:06:30.419  -->  00:06:32.520
professional that they you know they

163

00:06:32.520  -->  00:06:35.580
don't have a bias like people are most

164

00:06:35.580  -->  00:06:37.319
people like ok right here plus minus

165

00:06:37.319  -->  00:06:38.880
only the movies really battle

166

00:06:38.880  -->  00:06:40.620
rated their it's really good already

167

00:06:40.620  -->  00:06:42.450
that they're gonna stick around like

168

00:06:42.450  -->  00:06:43.740
over here and that's why we see a normal

169

00:06:43.740  -->  00:06:45.660
distribution. Critics they have a certain

170

00:06:45.660  -->  00:06:48.120
set of rules or certain set of like

171

00:06:48.120  -->  00:06:50.130
parameters that they assess movies based

172

00:06:50.130  -->  00:06:52.140
on you know you look at the camera work,

173

00:06:52.140  -->  00:06:55.380
they look at the audio, they look at like

174

00:06:55.380  -->  00:06:57.120
the acting of the actors and so on and

175

00:06:57.120  -->  00:06:59.340
then they're set so that is what's

176

00:06:59.340  -->  00:07:01.470
changing normal description into a

177

00:07:01.470  -->  00:07:03.510
uniform distribution. I think this is a

178

00:07:03.510  -->  00:07:05.760
very interesting observation and I think

179

00:07:05.760  -->  00:07:07.830
we need to include both of these charts

180

00:07:07.830  -->  00:07:09.750
and in our final presentation because

181

00:07:09.750  -->  00:07:11.850
everything to do with human behavior is

182

00:07:11.850  -->  00:07:14.700
ultimately very interesting so once

183

00:07:14.700  -->  00:07:18.690
again export then you just said it. I

184

00:07:18.690  -->  00:07:21.420
kind of like that a resolution so if I

185

00:07:21.420  -->  00:07:25.410
save that and if I say that let me do

186

00:07:25.410  -->  00:07:26.790
this one quickly.

187

00:07:26.790  -->  00:07:30.930
Ok let's I think that just didn't update

188

00:07:30.930  -->  00:07:31.830
the preview.

189

00:07:31.830  -->  00:07:34.770
Alright so what do we have? We've got

190

00:07:34.770  -->  00:07:37.890
five and six right? So if I take this one

191

00:07:37.890  -->  00:07:40.260
and put it here and then if I take this

192

00:07:40.260  -->  00:07:44.490
one put here so there you go so we've

193

00:07:44.490  -->  00:07:46.290
already got three out of six charts.

194

00:07:46.290  -->  00:07:49.020
Beautiful, awesome.

195

00:07:49.020  -->  00:07:51.660
Alright so some interesting insights

196

00:07:51.660  -->  00:07:54.390
today and some tips hopefully you'll

197

00:07:54.390  -->  00:07:57.180
take that to heart and look into that

198

00:07:57.180  -->  00:07:59.040
last thing I want to show you is

199

00:07:59.040  -->  00:08:02.610
sometimes sometimes very rarely you

200

00:08:02.610  -->  00:08:05.670
would say something like ggplot just

201

00:08:05.670  -->  00:08:07.590
brackets. This is called the skeleton

202

00:08:07.590  -->  00:08:09.870
plot and why would you use it? Well you'll use

203

00:08:09.870  -->  00:08:11.850
it in the case when you want to create a

204

00:08:11.850  -->  00:08:13.770
plot but you want to use different

205

00:08:13.770  -->  00:08:15.990
data sets on that plot and that is also

206

00:08:15.990  -->  00:08:18.660
very valid approach you can do that, you

207

00:08:18.660  -->  00:08:20.310
can run that I 'll have a completely

208

00:08:20.310  -->  00:08:22.410
empty plate without even a data set in

209

00:08:22.410  -->  00:08:24.960
it and then I can set the data inside my

210

00:08:24.960  -->  00:08:27.090
plot layers that I add on to this

211

00:08:27.090  -->  00:08:28.560
skeleton plot.

212

00:08:28.560  -->  00:08:31.020
Ok so that brings us to the end of

213

00:08:31.020  -->  00:08:33.150
today's tutorial and I look forward to

214

00:08:33.150  -->  00:08:46.149
seeing you next time until then, happy coding.
