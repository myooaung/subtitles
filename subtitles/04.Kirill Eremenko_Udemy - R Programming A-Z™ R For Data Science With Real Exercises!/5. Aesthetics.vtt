00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.200
Hello and welcome back to the course on R

2

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:09.150
programming and today we're talking

3

00:00:09.150  -->  00:00:11.969
about the aesthetics layer of

4

00:00:11.969  -->  00:00:14.160
our visualization and actually we're

5

00:00:14.160  -->  00:00:17.369
going to get introduction to GGplot2, the

6

00:00:17.369  -->  00:00:19.500
main function of the GGplot to library.

7

00:00:19.500  -->  00:00:21.689
So let's go and check it out,

8

00:00:21.689  -->  00:00:23.100
so this is what we did in the previous

9

00:00:23.100  -->  00:00:25.109
tutorial. We talked about factors and we

10

00:00:25.109  -->  00:00:27.240
prepared our data set. Now let's start

11

00:00:27.240  -->  00:00:28.949
talking about aesthetics.

12

00:00:28.949  -->  00:00:31.019
Alright we're going to first load the

13

00:00:31.019  -->  00:00:33.989
library which is or the package the

14

00:00:33.989  -->  00:00:36.510
correct term is load the package using

15

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:39.809
the library function GGplot2 and the

16

00:00:39.809  -->  00:00:41.550
function that we're going to be using is

17

00:00:41.550  -->  00:00:43.230
GGplot. The last time

18

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:45.780
previously we used Q plot and Q plots

19

00:00:45.780  -->  00:00:47.550
kind of like a quick plot that's

20

00:00:47.550  -->  00:00:49.260
what the Q stands for. It's a very quick

21

00:00:49.260  -->  00:00:52.170
tool. GGplot is the actual heavy

22

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:54.780
artillery function of this library and

23

00:00:54.780  -->  00:00:56.820
we're going to start learning it today.

24

00:00:56.820  -->  00:00:59.399
Alright, first you want to just like

25

00:00:59.399  -->  00:01:01.140
with Q plot supply the data. You want

26

00:01:01.140  -->  00:01:04.019
to say data equals movies. Then you want to

27

00:01:04.019  -->  00:01:05.820
create the aesthetics and this is where

28

00:01:05.820  -->  00:01:07.260
things start getting a bit more

29

00:01:07.260  -->  00:01:09.060
complicated but don't worry throughout this

30

00:01:09.060  -->  00:01:10.650
section you will definitely practice

31

00:01:10.650  -->  00:01:12.479
this so many times that it will be

32

00:01:12.479  -->  00:01:13.439
coming to it.

33

00:01:13.439  -->  00:01:15.090
Alright so you gotta type in the

34

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:18.240
function called aes for aesthetics and that

35

00:01:18.240  -->  00:01:20.549
is a function that allows you to set a

36

00:01:20.549  -->  00:01:23.340
aesthetics and as we remember aesthetics

37

00:01:23.340  -->  00:01:26.880
is how your data maps to what you wanna

38

00:01:26.880  -->  00:01:28.979
see. It's it's not even the geometry layer yet.

39

00:01:28.979  -->  00:01:31.829
We're still if I go back here, we still

40

00:01:31.829  -->  00:01:33.930
here. So we're these first two layers are

41

00:01:33.930  -->  00:01:35.400
insufficient actually see something

42

00:01:35.400  -->  00:01:37.560
we'll need the geometry layer so let's

43

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:40.920
go ahead and first tell ggplot how we

44

00:01:40.920  -->  00:01:42.270
want to map the data. We want to say,

45

00:01:42.270  -->  00:01:43.860
let's go ahead and start by creating

46

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:46.320
that plots that the CEO wanted. The

47

00:01:46.320  -->  00:01:49.290
critic rating on the bottom and axis on

48

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:50.970
the audience rating on the top on so we

49

00:01:50.970  -->  00:01:54.000
want to say X because critic rating and

50

00:01:54.000  -->  00:01:56.399
now we can actually not say movies

51

00:01:56.399  -->  00:01:59.610
dollar sign, critic rating because GGplot

52

00:01:59.610  -->  00:02:01.229
knows that we're working with this data set

53

00:02:01.229  -->  00:02:03.719
and then here we're going to go

54

00:02:03.719  -->  00:02:07.500
y equals audience rating alright. So what

55

00:02:07.500  -->  00:02:09.509
happens if I run this line? Nothing

56

00:02:09.509  -->  00:02:11.440
happens, but actually let's have a

57

00:02:11.440  -->  00:02:14.020
look here. You can see that an empty plot

58

00:02:14.020  -->  00:02:16.990
has appeared with nothing on it and why

59

00:02:16.990  -->  00:02:19.150
is that? Well we did say critic rating. We

60

00:02:19.150  -->  00:02:20.920
want critic rating on the bottom and

61

00:02:20.920  -->  00:02:22.720
audience rating on the top. That's an

62

00:02:22.720  -->  00:02:25.270
order on the Left. That's right, but where

63

00:02:25.270  -->  00:02:27.100
are the dots or the squares of the

64

00:02:27.100  -->  00:02:28.390
triangles of the lines.

65

00:02:28.390  -->  00:02:30.910
Well that's exactly it. On a GGplot doesn't

66

00:02:30.910  -->  00:02:31.960
know what we want.

67

00:02:31.960  -->  00:02:34.060
He doesn't know that we want lines or do

68

00:02:34.060  -->  00:02:36.370
we want dots or do we want bubbles? So

69

00:02:36.370  -->  00:02:37.900
we've got to tell it right? So we've got

70

00:02:37.900  -->  00:02:40.030
we're actually going to run a bit

71

00:02:40.030  -->  00:02:41.110
ahead of ourselves we're going to

72

00:02:41.110  -->  00:02:44.260
introduce the geometry layer but it's a

73

00:02:44.260  -->  00:02:46.480
necessity because otherwise we won't see

74

00:02:46.480  -->  00:02:48.100
anything so let's go ahead and just copy

75

00:02:48.100  -->  00:02:51.160
that and this time we'll say plus right

76

00:02:51.160  -->  00:02:53.800
and it's let's actually say here and

77

00:02:53.800  -->  00:02:56.170
geometry so we remember what's going on

78

00:02:56.170  -->  00:02:59.170
plus and here we're going to say geome

79

00:02:59.170  -->  00:03:02.140
underscore point and so if we run this

80

00:03:02.140  -->  00:03:03.010
now,

81

00:03:03.010  -->  00:03:05.200
there we go. Now we can see something

82

00:03:05.200  -->  00:03:08.620
good and by the way is a convenient to

83

00:03:08.620  -->  00:03:10.510
add new layers with this plus sign when

84

00:03:10.510  -->  00:03:12.040
you just put them on a new line. So we

85

00:03:12.040  -->  00:03:14.170
keep the plus on this line so R doesn't run

86

00:03:14.170  -->  00:03:15.940
this line by itself. It

87

00:03:15.940  -->  00:03:17.830
expects a new line and then you just add a

88

00:03:17.830  -->  00:03:19.239
new layer on every new line and just

89

00:03:19.239  -->  00:03:22.540
more convenient like that. So like this I

90

00:03:22.540  -->  00:03:24.250
can either highlight both lines and run

91

00:03:24.250  -->  00:03:26.920
it or I can lie run line by line and

92

00:03:26.920  -->  00:03:29.739
R will wait until the end and so there

93

00:03:29.739  -->  00:03:32.709
we go that's our critics rating and

94

00:03:32.709  -->  00:03:35.320
audience ratings. Okay beautiful,

95

00:03:35.320  -->  00:03:38.260
so now what we're going to do let's add

96

00:03:38.260  -->  00:03:40.180
more aesthetics and let's remember aesthetics are

97

00:03:40.180  -->  00:03:42.430
things that we can see right? Now we have

98

00:03:42.430  -->  00:03:44.200
the geometry, now we can assign more

99

00:03:44.200  -->  00:03:46.180
parameters of that challenge and what is

100

00:03:46.180  -->  00:03:47.380
the parameter of this challenge and

101

00:03:47.380  -->  00:03:49.900
another one is of course color so let's

102

00:03:49.900  -->  00:03:53.680
do that. Let's add color I'm gonna just

103

00:03:53.680  -->  00:03:56.290
copy this so you don't have to retype it

104

00:03:56.290  -->  00:03:59.920
and here we're going to say comma, I'm

105

00:03:59.920  -->  00:04:03.040
sure here I'm gonna say color equals genre that

106

00:04:03.040  -->  00:04:05.140
makes sense right? So if I run these two

107

00:04:05.140  -->  00:04:08.950
lines, you'll see that the plot has been

108

00:04:08.950  -->  00:04:11.050
colored by the genre of movie and we

109

00:04:11.050  -->  00:04:13.239
actually got a legend so GGplot is

110

00:04:13.239  -->  00:04:15.070
actually very smart. We don't have to

111

00:04:15.070  -->  00:04:16.750
create the legend on our own it gets

112

00:04:16.750  -->  00:04:18.790
added automatically. Alright,

113

00:04:18.790  -->  00:04:20.169
and another thing is like because we're

114

00:04:20.169  -->  00:04:21.250
running out of space and we're going to

115

00:04:21.250  -->  00:04:22.600
put this on a new line as well and

116

00:04:22.600  -->  00:04:24.440
because of this comma, R is going to know

117

00:04:24.440  -->  00:04:26.330
that this line's not finished. So it's going to go

118

00:04:26.330  -->  00:04:29.240
and wait until we're on all of them.

119

00:04:29.240  -->  00:04:31.190
Alright and now we're going to add another

120

00:04:31.190  -->  00:04:33.740
aesthetic which size, size another

121

00:04:33.740  -->  00:04:36.530
thing we can see right and all this is

122

00:04:36.530  -->  00:04:38.630
possible because we know or R knows

123

00:04:38.630  -->  00:04:40.790
what geometry we want and now we can just

124

00:04:40.790  -->  00:04:42.980
keep adding things on, so we're going to say

125

00:04:42.980  -->  00:04:46.760
size equals let's also genre right?

126

00:04:46.760  -->  00:04:48.170
Let's have a look at that,

127

00:04:48.170  -->  00:04:50.150
so what you'll see here is that they're

128

00:04:50.150  -->  00:04:53.510
colored by the size is selected by genre

129

00:04:53.510  -->  00:04:55.910
which and you've got a legend here which

130

00:04:55.910  -->  00:04:57.860
combines color and generally which are very

131

00:04:57.860  -->  00:04:59.810
smart but you've got a warning at the

132

00:04:59.810  -->  00:05:02.120
bottom saying using size for discrete

133

00:05:02.120  -->  00:05:04.430
variable is not advised. Makes sense right?

134

00:05:04.430  -->  00:05:06.620
Because that's very misleading to the I,

135

00:05:06.620  -->  00:05:09.380
why would thriller be bigger than action.

136

00:05:09.380  -->  00:05:11.600
What is the logic behind that? So we're

137

00:05:11.600  -->  00:05:13.160
going to replace that. We're going to say

138

00:05:13.160  -->  00:05:17.600
add size, what's a better way and here

139

00:05:17.600  -->  00:05:19.340
we can say instead of genre, well let's

140

00:05:19.340  -->  00:05:22.310
just say budget budget millions is our

141

00:05:22.310  -->  00:05:25.610
variable and if I run that, okay that

142

00:05:25.610  -->  00:05:27.530
makes more sense right? So bigger bubbles

143

00:05:27.530  -->  00:05:29.270
represent movies that had a bigger

144

00:05:29.270  -->  00:05:32.419
budget and smaller bubbles are smaller

145

00:05:32.419  -->  00:05:34.460
budgets and then color is genre and then

146

00:05:34.460  -->  00:05:36.230
you've got the critic rating here and

147

00:05:36.230  -->  00:05:37.340
the audience rating and you can already

148

00:05:37.340  -->  00:05:40.370
tell some some very interesting insights

149

00:05:40.370  -->  00:05:42.560
from this visualization on its own. You can

150

00:05:42.560  -->  00:05:43.430
see that,

151

00:05:43.430  -->  00:05:45.710
alright so if our horizontal or our

152

00:05:45.710  -->  00:05:48.500
diagonal goes through this, you can see that

153

00:05:48.500  -->  00:05:50.000
the audience is definitely more

154

00:05:50.000  -->  00:05:51.740
forgiving to movies and they only kind of

155

00:05:51.740  -->  00:05:53.450
lineup together with the critics over

156

00:05:53.450  -->  00:05:56.030
here so the audience, the bubbles are

157

00:05:56.030  -->  00:05:57.770
always above the diagonal mostly above

158

00:05:57.770  -->  00:05:59.150
the diagonal and it means the audience

159

00:05:59.150  -->  00:06:02.000
is decorate the movies higher and you

160

00:06:02.000  -->  00:06:03.410
can tell other things from here as well.

161

00:06:03.410  -->  00:06:05.480
Like this not, it's a bit hard because

162

00:06:05.480  -->  00:06:07.550
and we'll make it. We'll definitely make

163

00:06:07.550  -->  00:06:09.830
it better throughout this section but

164

00:06:09.830  -->  00:06:11.300
it's already a good starting point. So

165

00:06:11.300  -->  00:06:14.030
here I wanted to say something like I

166

00:06:14.030  -->  00:06:16.669
wanted to say this is number one that

167

00:06:16.669  -->  00:06:17.780
we're going to put into our

168

00:06:17.780  -->  00:06:19.760
visualization but I'll just keep it like

169

00:06:19.760  -->  00:06:22.250
that but remember that we will make it.

170

00:06:22.250  -->  00:06:26.060
We will improve it further down in the

171

00:06:26.060  -->  00:06:27.830
section as we learn new things, We'll see

172

00:06:27.830  -->  00:06:29.270
how we can actually position but it's

173

00:06:29.270  -->  00:06:33.169
already a great start and that's it for

00:06:33.169  -->  00:06:36.169
today. In the next tutorial, we will learn

175

00:06:36.169  -->  00:06:38.340
another new skill of GGplot

176

00:06:38.340  -->  00:06:40.919
and go ahead and practice with that, try

177

00:06:40.919  -->  00:06:42.930
fiddling around with the GGplot function and

178

00:06:42.930  -->  00:06:44.850
changing the variables or aesthetics

179

00:06:44.850  -->  00:06:48.030
here and I look forward to seeing you next time. Until then,

180

00:06:48.030  -->  00:06:59.409
happy coding.
