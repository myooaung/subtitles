00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.810
Hello and welcome back to the course

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:09.300
R programming. So let's go ahead and

3

00:00:09.300  -->  00:00:11.940
solve this homework exercise.

4

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:14.370
Alright, so here I've got the file open

5

00:00:14.370  -->  00:00:16.740
the section for homework data dot

6

00:00:16.740  -->  00:00:19.199
R file that comes in a zip file and

7

00:00:19.199  -->  00:00:22.140
this one looks like inside, so here we

8

00:00:22.140  -->  00:00:23.699
scroll down you'll see we've got the

9

00:00:23.699  -->  00:00:26.250
season director, the players vector then

10

00:00:26.250  -->  00:00:28.980
we've got the vectors for free throws

11

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:30.779
and then no matrix which will have to

12

00:00:30.779  -->  00:00:33.809
create ourselves and then there's a free

13

00:00:33.809  -->  00:00:35.610
throw attempts of the vectors and we're

14

00:00:35.610  -->  00:00:37.200
going to have to create the matrix. As

15

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:38.790
you can see my environment right now is

16

00:00:38.790  -->  00:00:41.790
empty and we're going to proceed with

17

00:00:41.790  -->  00:00:45.030
these matrices to start over. Okay so I'm

18

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:46.680
going to run this line by line so first

19

00:00:46.680  -->  00:00:48.270
we're gonna run this line there we go

20

00:00:48.270  -->  00:00:50.250
that's the seasons vector then the

21

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:52.980
players vector and now if we run all

22

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:55.230
these let's run them all together.

23

00:00:55.230  -->  00:00:56.910
Ok so now we have all of these vectors

24

00:00:56.910  -->  00:00:59.100
that we want to put in a matrix right so

25

00:00:59.100  -->  00:01:01.590
there they are all of these ten vectors.

26

00:01:01.590  -->  00:01:02.969
How do we put them in the matrix?

27

00:01:02.969  -->  00:01:04.830
Well let's start coding this up. We're

28

00:01:04.830  -->  00:01:06.420
going to create a matrix-matrix and

29

00:01:06.420  -->  00:01:09.600
we'll call it free throws and we're going to use

30

00:01:09.600  -->  00:01:11.580
which function, that's correct we can

31

00:01:11.580  -->  00:01:13.740
choose the rbind function and now were just

32

00:01:13.740  -->  00:01:16.290
going to list these vectors one by

33

00:01:16.290  -->  00:01:18.090
one comma out to the a comma.

34

00:01:18.090  -->  00:01:19.830
Alright there we go to put all 10

35

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:21.780
vectors into the  rbind let's just

36

00:01:21.780  -->  00:01:23.729
check that there is indeed 10. So that's

37

00:01:23.729  -->  00:01:29.040
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. eight,

38

00:01:29.040  -->  00:01:32.610
nine and ten perfect.

39

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:34.229
Ok so that's going to create R matrix

40

00:01:34.229  -->  00:01:36.420
if we run this line now we've got the

41

00:01:36.420  -->  00:01:38.700
free-throws matrix it's ready

42

00:01:38.700  -->  00:01:41.310
next we're going to do is as in the

43

00:01:41.310  -->  00:01:44.399
previous examples in the section. We

44

00:01:44.399  -->  00:01:45.689
don't actually need these vectors

45

00:01:45.689  -->  00:01:48.240
anymore we have the matrix, so just to

46

00:01:48.240  -->  00:01:49.829
clear up the working space we're going

47

00:01:49.829  -->  00:01:51.689
to practice removing these vectors so

48

00:01:51.689  -->  00:01:53.729
we'll just take all these put them in

49

00:01:53.729  -->  00:01:56.610
the RM function. So if I run this line

50

00:01:56.610  -->  00:01:59.520
now I've got rid of the vectors

51

00:01:59.520  -->  00:02:01.200
that's good now let's have a look at

52

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:04.229
free throws, ok so if I run that you can

53

00:02:04.229  -->  00:02:07.500
see that there is our matrix as you can

54

00:02:07.500  -->  00:02:09.479
see doesn't have the correct names it's

55

00:02:09.479  -->  00:02:11.910
got the names of the vectors here on the

56

00:02:11.910  -->  00:02:14.790
left instead of the names that we want

57

00:02:14.790  -->  00:02:17.460
to see and that would be these names of

58

00:02:17.460  -->  00:02:20.010
these players and also it doesn't have any

59

00:02:20.010  -->  00:02:21.600
column name. So let's go ahead and fix that up.

60

00:02:21.600  -->  00:02:23.940
We're going to say no I'm list of

61

00:02:23.940  -->  00:02:26.670
columns so we'll say column names, free

62

00:02:26.670  -->  00:02:28.830
throws right so if I run that I 'll just

63

00:02:28.830  -->  00:02:31.050
get null because no column names but now

64

00:02:31.050  -->  00:02:32.460
we're just going to use this vector that

65

00:02:32.460  -->  00:02:34.740
we have seasons so let's put that in

66

00:02:34.740  -->  00:02:37.440
there, I run that run that and now more thing

67

00:02:37.440  -->  00:02:41.190
row names names for free throws is

68

00:02:41.190  -->  00:02:44.670
going to be players, run that

69

00:02:44.670  -->  00:02:47.790
let's have a look at the matrix free

70

00:02:47.790  -->  00:02:48.900
throws.

71

00:02:48.900  -->  00:02:51.360
There you go it looks beautiful right so

72

00:02:51.360  -->  00:02:53.520
we've prepared this matrix it looks

73

00:02:53.520  -->  00:02:54.720
fantastic.

74

00:02:54.720  -->  00:02:56.640
Ok so I 'm just going to remove this line

75

00:02:56.640  -->  00:02:58.980
because then for somebody who comes

76

00:02:58.980  -->  00:03:00.690
along and just runs all the code we

77

00:03:00.690  -->  00:03:03.360
don't want that check to pop up but the

78

00:03:03.360  -->  00:03:05.310
rest of the lines of valid. Now if you

79

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:06.840
want to go ahead and do this part

80

00:03:06.840  -->  00:03:08.880
yourself feel free to do so what I'm

81

00:03:08.880  -->  00:03:10.170
going to do is I'm just going to copy

82

00:03:10.170  -->  00:03:12.870
all of this and I'm gonna going to use a

83

00:03:12.870  -->  00:03:14.730
bit of a shortcut so let's just copy

84

00:03:14.730  -->  00:03:16.860
that in here and now what we want to do

85

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:18.630
is we want to replace wherever it says

86

00:03:18.630  -->  00:03:21.510
ft by pressing ctrl f, we're going to

87

00:03:21.510  -->  00:03:23.520
place that with FTA and I 'm just going

88

00:03:23.520  -->  00:03:26.340
to find them one by one. So I don't

89

00:03:26.340  -->  00:03:28.770
replace other one somewhere else in the

90

00:03:28.770  -->  00:03:30.870
code there we go and I don't need to

91

00:03:30.870  -->  00:03:32.670
replace those anymore.

92

00:03:32.670  -->  00:03:35.250
Ok so that's fixed here just need to

93

00:03:35.250  -->  00:03:38.070
change this free throw attempts and this

94

00:03:38.070  -->  00:03:40.380
also over here so let's do that

95

00:03:40.380  -->  00:03:42.330
alright beautiful. So let's check this

96

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:43.920
out so if I run this line,

97

00:03:43.920  -->  00:03:45.750
ok I've got a problem somewhere here

98

00:03:45.750  -->  00:03:48.570
Kobe Bryant FTA ohh that's right because I

99

00:03:48.570  -->  00:03:50.489
haven't run this code so let's go ahead

100

00:03:50.489  -->  00:03:52.290
and run these vectors first.

101

00:03:52.290  -->  00:03:55.230
Ok now if I run this line there at the

102

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:57.300
matrix that's removing the vectors

103

00:03:57.300  -->  00:03:59.670
that's fixing up to column names, row

104

00:03:59.670  -->  00:04:01.800
names and now we can just go ahead and

105

00:04:01.800  -->  00:04:04.290
check this matrix.

106

00:04:04.290  -->  00:04:06.150
There we go that's our free throw

107

00:04:06.150  -->  00:04:08.370
attempts beautiful so we can remove that

108

00:04:08.370  -->  00:04:10.739
we can save this file we don't need this

109

00:04:10.739  -->  00:04:13.230
search functionality anymore and that's

110

00:04:13.230  -->  00:04:15.209
a wonderful, so that's prepared

111

00:04:15.209  -->  00:04:16.770
what do we need to do now so that's just

112

00:04:16.770  -->  00:04:18.239
our data preparation place what do

113

00:04:18.239  -->  00:04:20.580
we need to actually find so here's the

114

00:04:20.580  -->  00:04:22.710
challenge for this section we need to

115

00:04:22.710  -->  00:04:24.610
find these three things. So

116

00:04:24.610  -->  00:04:27.069
build these three diagrams we need free

117

00:04:27.069  -->  00:04:30.669
throw attempts per game, accuracy of free

118

00:04:30.669  -->  00:04:32.860
throws and player playing style two

119

00:04:32.860  -->  00:04:35.349
vs. three point preference excluding free

120

00:04:35.349  -->  00:04:37.030
throws alright. So let's get straight to

121

00:04:37.030  -->  00:04:40.060
it. We're going to need a new file right.

122

00:04:40.060  -->  00:04:42.580
So let's create a new file and here

123

00:04:42.580  -->  00:04:44.319
we're going to first of all we're going

124

00:04:44.319  -->  00:04:46.870
to go into our previous file where the

125

00:04:46.870  -->  00:04:49.000
function is for plotting and we'll just

126

00:04:49.000  -->  00:04:51.909
take it and copy it so that we have it

127

00:04:51.909  -->  00:04:53.680
in here as well and then we're going to

128

00:04:53.680  -->  00:04:56.560
run this function or create this object

129

00:04:56.560  -->  00:04:58.659
actually there we go that function is

130

00:04:58.659  -->  00:05:01.659
being created and now we can go ahead

131

00:05:01.659  -->  00:05:04.060
and use it right. So let's start by

132

00:05:04.060  -->  00:05:07.300
plotting the free-throws, free-throws, it's

133

00:05:07.300  -->  00:05:09.250
not required from us but just to see

134

00:05:09.250  -->  00:05:11.740
what it looks like there is a new data

135

00:05:11.740  -->  00:05:14.379
set that was just incorporated into

136

00:05:14.379  -->  00:05:17.199
analysis. So there we go lets just rerun

137

00:05:17.199  -->  00:05:19.000
that so the legend looks good.

138

00:05:19.000  -->  00:05:21.189
Alright so that's the free-throws just

139

00:05:21.189  -->  00:05:22.990
by themselves and what we're checking

140

00:05:22.990  -->  00:05:24.669
here is for any anomalies like does

141

00:05:24.669  -->  00:05:26.469
something like all of maybe there's

142

00:05:26.469  -->  00:05:28.210
something wrong with the vectors or

143

00:05:28.210  -->  00:05:29.770
maybe we didn't create the matrix

144

00:05:29.770  -->  00:05:32.110
properly but it looks ok so let's do the

145

00:05:32.110  -->  00:05:33.669
same thing for attempts.

146

00:05:33.669  -->  00:05:35.919
That's the free-throw attempts all right

147

00:05:35.919  -->  00:05:37.479
great, so now we can proceed to the

148

00:05:37.479  -->  00:05:39.699
analysis so first thing we're checking

149

00:05:39.699  -->  00:05:43.960
free-throw attempts per game right.

150

00:05:43.960  -->  00:05:46.150
So in order to obviously visualize this

151

00:05:46.150  -->  00:05:48.430
we're actually going to need the games

152

00:05:48.430  -->  00:05:49.930
matrix as you can see we don't actually

153

00:05:49.930  -->  00:05:52.270
have the games matrix here because it

154

00:05:52.270  -->  00:05:53.710
was in the original data set. So I 'm

155

00:05:53.710  -->  00:05:55.810
going to go back to the original data

156

00:05:55.810  -->  00:05:57.279
set that we used in this whole section

157

00:05:57.279  -->  00:05:59.650
and we going to rerun the whole thing

158

00:05:59.650  -->  00:06:02.229
run it and that will give us those extra

159

00:06:02.229  -->  00:06:04.839
matrices that were in the original

160

00:06:04.839  -->  00:06:06.789
challenge for the whole section. So

161

00:06:06.789  -->  00:06:09.250
there's that games matrix and now we can

162

00:06:09.250  -->  00:06:10.389
go ahead and use it in our

163

00:06:10.389  -->  00:06:12.939
visualizations, so I'm going to say my plot

164

00:06:12.939  -->  00:06:18.669
and free throw attempts divided by games so if I

165

00:06:18.669  -->  00:06:21.069
run just this inside part what I'll get

166

00:06:21.069  -->  00:06:24.099
is a matrix, let's make some space here so

167

00:06:24.099  -->  00:06:25.810
what I'll get is a matrix that actually

168

00:06:25.810  -->  00:06:29.680
has the information on how many attempts

169

00:06:29.680  -->  00:06:31.960
per game each player had right so that's

170

00:06:31.960  -->  00:06:34.389
that matrix separation of dividing every

171

00:06:34.389  -->  00:06:36.190
element of this matrix by every element

172

00:06:36.190  -->  00:06:37.300
of this matrix

173

00:06:37.300  -->  00:06:38.680
and that's something we talked about

174

00:06:38.680  -->  00:06:40.960
quite a lot in this course in this section

175

00:06:40.960  -->  00:06:43.000
of the course and now what I'm going to

176

00:06:43.000  -->  00:06:45.310
do is I'm just going to plot this whole

177

00:06:45.310  -->  00:06:47.409
thing and by running this line

178

00:06:47.409  -->  00:06:49.930
all together, so I run that line of code

179

00:06:49.930  -->  00:06:52.990
this is the result that we're after this

180

00:06:52.990  -->  00:06:57.400
is free throw attempts per game and then

181

00:06:57.400  -->  00:06:58.629
let's have a look at this chart so what

182

00:06:58.629  -->  00:07:00.129
can we see here, so we can see that

183

00:07:00.129  -->  00:07:02.680
players average about somewhere anywhere

184

00:07:02.680  -->  00:07:06.190
between 2 to 12 free throw attempts

185

00:07:06.190  -->  00:07:09.789
per game and so some players are quite

186

00:07:09.789  -->  00:07:12.729
up there were up there now in the most

187

00:07:12.729  -->  00:07:13.780
recent season.

188

00:07:13.780  -->  00:07:15.610
Everybody's kind of under eight

189

00:07:15.610  -->  00:07:18.639
free-throw attempts and what else can we

190

00:07:18.639  -->  00:07:19.120
see here?

191

00:07:19.120  -->  00:07:21.789
Well let's have a look at Chris Paul. So

192

00:07:21.789  -->  00:07:23.409
this will be an interesting one

193

00:07:23.409  -->  00:07:24.849
so if you look at Chris Paul over here

194

00:07:24.849  -->  00:07:27.129
you can see that his free-throw attempts

195

00:07:27.129  -->  00:07:29.139
are quite low so currently sitting about

196

00:07:29.139  -->  00:07:31.930
for between four and six free throw

197

00:07:31.930  -->  00:07:35.110
attempts for per game and let us

198

00:07:35.110  -->  00:07:36.699
remember that because it will be

199

00:07:36.699  -->  00:07:38.800
interesting to kind of revert back to it

200

00:07:38.800  -->  00:07:41.560
when we create the next visualization. So

201

00:07:41.560  -->  00:07:42.969
let's proceed to the second one so

202

00:07:42.969  -->  00:07:47.139
number two is free-throw accuracy right

203

00:07:47.139  -->  00:07:48.880
and how do we get accuracy

204

00:07:48.880  -->  00:07:50.889
well we need to take off obviously my

205

00:07:50.889  -->  00:07:53.979
plot and here we want to take free-throw,

206

00:07:53.979  -->  00:07:56.770
free-throws that's the number of

207

00:07:56.770  -->  00:07:58.270
successful free throws and therefore the

208

00:07:58.270  -->  00:07:59.529
number of points.

209

00:07:59.529  -->  00:08:00.969
Well in this case we're just looking at

210

00:08:00.969  -->  00:08:02.229
the success were interesting and

211

00:08:02.229  -->  00:08:04.000
how many successful free-throws they had

212

00:08:04.000  -->  00:08:07.300
and divide that by free-throw attempts.

213

00:08:07.300  -->  00:08:10.120
So if I run this line what you'll see

214

00:08:10.120  -->  00:08:12.550
is a new chart and this is their actual

215

00:08:12.550  -->  00:08:14.199
accuracy and you can tell that it is

216

00:08:14.199  -->  00:08:16.419
indeed a necklace because it is between

217

00:08:16.419  -->  00:08:19.960
0 and 1 where actually 0.5 and one so

218

00:08:19.960  -->  00:08:23.229
obviously can never go over one and why

219

00:08:23.229  -->  00:08:26.289
did we look at Chris Paul last time?

220

00:08:26.289  -->  00:08:28.840
Well look at Chris Paul here so this red

221

00:08:28.840  -->  00:08:31.029
triangle you can see that his accuracy

222

00:08:31.029  -->  00:08:33.039
is actually one of the highest right so

223

00:08:33.039  -->  00:08:35.979
his accuracy is over there point 0.85 and

224

00:08:35.979  -->  00:08:38.050
actually it in the last season it was a

225

00:08:38.050  -->  00:08:40.570
higher accuracy about 0.9 higher than

226

00:08:40.570  -->  00:08:42.579
all other place and I personally find it

227

00:08:42.579  -->  00:08:45.520
quite surprising that he has the highest

228

00:08:45.520  -->  00:08:47.199
accuracy when it comes to free throws

229

00:08:47.199  -->  00:08:49.899
but he gets the lowest number of free

230

00:08:49.899  -->  00:08:50.930
throw attempts

231

00:08:50.930  -->  00:08:53.600
per game and that is finding that you'd

232

00:08:53.600  -->  00:08:54.800
probably expect in a movie like

233

00:08:54.800  -->  00:08:57.950
Moneyball right so that maybe the I'm

234

00:08:57.950  -->  00:09:00.920
sure coach of this of his team and you

235

00:09:00.920  -->  00:09:02.720
know the whole team themselves they have

236

00:09:02.720  -->  00:09:05.000
they have a strategy but maybe this is

237

00:09:05.000  -->  00:09:06.320
something that they overlooked and maybe

238

00:09:06.320  -->  00:09:07.640
you could communicate to them and say

239

00:09:07.640  -->  00:09:10.190
hey guys actually Chris Paul has the

240

00:09:10.190  -->  00:09:12.200
highest accuracy but he's not getting as

241

00:09:12.200  -->  00:09:14.390
many free throw attempts so if you look

242

00:09:14.390  -->  00:09:16.190
here per game

243

00:09:16.190  -->  00:09:18.350
so he's not getting as many free throw

244

00:09:18.350  -->  00:09:21.110
attempts per game and maybe if you can

245

00:09:21.110  -->  00:09:22.850
give them more opportunities to do free

246

00:09:22.850  -->  00:09:23.630
throws

247

00:09:23.630  -->  00:09:26.270
maybe then he will actually score more

248

00:09:26.270  -->  00:09:27.680
points you'll have more converted

249

00:09:27.680  -->  00:09:29.029
free-throw attempts.

250

00:09:29.029  -->  00:09:31.310
That's a just the hypothesis and

251

00:09:31.310  -->  00:09:33.380
basketball fans out there can comment on

252

00:09:33.380  -->  00:09:35.720
that further but that was just an

253

00:09:35.720  -->  00:09:37.730
interesting finding another thing you'll

254

00:09:37.730  -->  00:09:39.410
see from this chart is that Dwight

255

00:09:39.410  -->  00:09:43.010
Howard over here has a very very low

256

00:09:43.010  -->  00:09:45.770
accuracy when it comes to free throws right

257

00:09:45.770  -->  00:09:48.140
and that is very surprising because that

258

00:09:48.140  -->  00:09:50.300
name rings a bell right don't you don't

259

00:09:50.300  -->  00:09:52.820
you think so? Let's let's look at

260

00:09:52.820  -->  00:09:55.430
something over here, let's look at field

261

00:09:55.430  -->  00:09:58.430
goal accuracy field goals divided by field goal

262

00:09:58.430  -->  00:09:59.570
attempts right.

263

00:09:59.570  -->  00:10:01.610
Remember we had this plot in our data

264

00:10:01.610  -->  00:10:04.160
so here we've got Dwight Howard and he's

265

00:10:04.160  -->  00:10:06.350
got the highest accuracy when it comes

266

00:10:06.350  -->  00:10:09.290
to field goals but in free throws he's

267

00:10:09.290  -->  00:10:11.180
got the lowest accuracy and I found that

268

00:10:11.180  -->  00:10:13.160
very confusing I did not understand

269

00:10:13.160  -->  00:10:15.170
what's going on there at first and this

270

00:10:15.170  -->  00:10:16.279
is this is something the data is

271

00:10:16.279  -->  00:10:18.290
telling us but at the moment we don't

272

00:10:18.290  -->  00:10:19.790
have enough information to understand

273

00:10:19.790  -->  00:10:20.540
what's going on.

274

00:10:20.540  -->  00:10:22.010
So let's investigate that further and

275

00:10:22.010  -->  00:10:24.890
this is where on this part 3 player

276

00:10:24.890  -->  00:10:27.589
style will come in handy, so let's look

277

00:10:27.589  -->  00:10:30.260
at that. Part 3 player style so it's set

278

00:10:30.260  -->  00:10:34.670
up player style patterns excluding free

279

00:10:34.670  -->  00:10:37.520
throws right. So this is that chart that

280

00:10:37.520  -->  00:10:41.180
we want to create a fix-up basically the

281

00:10:41.180  -->  00:10:43.459
point so we had points in our data set

282

00:10:43.459  -->  00:10:45.560
we want to subtract free throws because

283

00:10:45.560  -->  00:10:47.510
every free-throw, every successful free-throw

284

00:10:47.510  -->  00:10:49.700
is one point so therefore it makes sense

285

00:10:49.700  -->  00:10:51.500
we don't need to multiply by any

286

00:10:51.500  -->  00:10:54.440
coefficient here just minus free throws so

287

00:10:54.440  -->  00:10:57.800
basically this gives us all of the

288

00:10:57.800  -->  00:11:00.800
points that a player earned in that

289

00:11:00.800  -->  00:11:03.740
specific season from just field goals

290

00:11:03.740  -->  00:11:04.370
not from

291

00:11:04.370  -->  00:11:07.430
free throws and then we divide by field goals

292

00:11:07.430  -->  00:11:09.140
right? So we want to see how many

293

00:11:09.140  -->  00:11:11.300
successful field goals that player had,

294

00:11:11.300  -->  00:11:14.360
so if we run this we'll get that matrix and

295

00:11:14.360  -->  00:11:17.570
this matrix represents the playing style

296

00:11:17.570  -->  00:11:19.310
so it's hard to see from the matrix

297

00:11:19.310  -->  00:11:22.880
that's plot this visualization and that

298

00:11:22.880  -->  00:11:25.010
will help us see everything much better.

299

00:11:25.010  -->  00:11:27.589
So there we go for all this relation we

300

00:11:27.589  -->  00:11:29.690
can see right away that. We are looking

301

00:11:29.690  -->  00:11:32.930
at what type of goals the players are

302

00:11:32.930  -->  00:11:33.890
aiming at?

303

00:11:33.890  -->  00:11:36.290
So we can confirm that our visualization is

304

00:11:36.290  -->  00:11:37.940
correct our calculations correct because

305

00:11:37.940  -->  00:11:40.670
now the visualization is between two and

306

00:11:40.670  -->  00:11:43.220
three. It's actually between 2 &amp; 2 3, 5 and

307

00:11:43.220  -->  00:11:44.779
make sense because in basketball if

308

00:11:44.779  -->  00:11:46.460
you're scoring a field goal which is not

309

00:11:46.460  -->  00:11:47.930
a free throw.

310

00:11:47.930  -->  00:11:49.940
You can only either get a two-pointer or

311

00:11:49.940  -->  00:11:51.410
a three-point we can't get anything else

312

00:11:51.410  -->  00:11:53.779
so obviously the average will be between

313

00:11:53.779  -->  00:11:56.240
two and three right and so here you can

314

00:11:56.240  -->  00:11:57.680
see how the playing styles have changed

315

00:11:57.680  -->  00:11:59.870
over the years for instance a very

316

00:11:59.870  -->  00:12:01.880
radical example is Joe Johnson. Right so

317

00:12:01.880  -->  00:12:04.820
he started 10 years ago with an average

318

00:12:04.820  -->  00:12:07.850
per in that season his average was to

319

00:12:07.850  -->  00:12:12.200
2.20 or 2.2 points per field goal

320

00:12:12.200  -->  00:12:14.720
then it went up so he started aiming for

321

00:12:14.720  -->  00:12:17.150
started scoring more three pointers are

322

00:12:17.150  -->  00:12:19.279
on average then it went down over the

323

00:12:19.279  -->  00:12:20.660
next four years and now it's gone

324

00:12:20.660  -->  00:12:23.000
drastically up so that has gone down in

325

00:12:23.000  -->  00:12:25.400
the past year but a year ago it was

326

00:12:25.400  -->  00:12:28.070
2.35 right. So he was scoring way

327

00:12:28.070  -->  00:12:30.800
more 3-pointers then he was five years

328

00:12:30.800  -->  00:12:33.020
ago and that just shows that his playing

329

00:12:33.020  -->  00:12:34.670
style has changed maybe it has something

330

00:12:34.670  -->  00:12:36.950
to do with his training maybe it has

331

00:12:36.950  -->  00:12:38.270
something to do with his coach, maybe

332

00:12:38.270  -->  00:12:40.339
it has something position on the field

333

00:12:40.339  -->  00:12:41.720
most of different factors can influence

334

00:12:41.720  -->  00:12:43.279
and but it's very interesting to observe

335

00:12:43.279  -->  00:12:45.589
how playing style has changed for

336

00:12:45.589  -->  00:12:48.080
instance Chris Bosh or he always was

337

00:12:48.080  -->  00:12:50.330
mostly aiming for two pointers just a

338

00:12:50.330  -->  00:12:53.120
few freedom 3-pointers at but recently

339

00:12:53.120  -->  00:12:55.850
in the past 2, 3 years he started to get

340

00:12:55.850  -->  00:12:57.950
more four three pointers right so and

341

00:12:57.950  -->  00:13:00.290
you can also see kind of interesting

342

00:13:00.290  -->  00:13:01.820
trends and a similar so for instance

343

00:13:01.820  -->  00:13:05.240
this red line went up, this blue line

344

00:13:05.240  -->  00:13:07.130
went up, this black line went up, the

345

00:13:07.130  -->  00:13:08.660
green line up so it looks like in the

346

00:13:08.660  -->  00:13:10.790
recent years most players are aiming for

347

00:13:10.790  -->  00:13:13.400
more 3-pointers but then there was this gal like

348

00:13:13.400  -->  00:13:16.190
drop off over here. So very interesting

349

00:13:16.190  -->  00:13:17.510
kind of patterns

350

00:13:17.510  -->  00:13:19.550
and if you're a fan of one of these

351

00:13:19.550  -->  00:13:22.160
players you can probably tell what was

352

00:13:22.160  -->  00:13:23.420
going on this is the most interesting

353

00:13:23.420  -->  00:13:25.790
part where you combine insights from

354

00:13:25.790  -->  00:13:27.110
your data with actual domain

355

00:13:27.110  -->  00:13:30.350
knowledge and your understanding of the

356

00:13:30.350  -->  00:13:32.450
the game itself so that that would be a

357

00:13:32.450  -->  00:13:34.730
most interesting part I think. What are

358

00:13:34.730  -->  00:13:35.900
you even if you're not a fan you can go

359

00:13:35.900  -->  00:13:37.760
ahead and just research what was going

360

00:13:37.760  -->  00:13:39.260
on with either of these players if

361

00:13:39.260  -->  00:13:40.880
you're interested to find out more

362

00:13:40.880  -->  00:13:43.640
insights. So that's number one but now let's

363

00:13:43.640  -->  00:13:46.100
go back to that conundrum or that

364

00:13:46.100  -->  00:13:49.040
question we had about who was it about

365

00:13:49.040  -->  00:13:52.700
Dwight Howard right. So Dwight Howard is

366

00:13:52.700  -->  00:13:55.040
very accurate when it comes two field

367

00:13:55.040  -->  00:13:57.650
goals. He is not accurate, he is the least

368

00:13:57.650  -->  00:13:58.910
accurate player when it comes to free

369

00:13:58.910  -->  00:13:59.630
throws.

370

00:13:59.630  -->  00:14:01.820
What is going on there? Well this chart

371

00:14:01.820  -->  00:14:03.680
if you look at this chart you will find

372

00:14:03.680  -->  00:14:05.630
the answer. I'll probably give you a

373

00:14:05.630  -->  00:14:07.550
second to think about that for a couple

374

00:14:07.550  -->  00:14:11.000
seconds and what I've found is that you

375

00:14:11.000  -->  00:14:12.500
can see that Dwight Howard is actually

376

00:14:12.500  -->  00:14:15.260
very very low over here consistently

377

00:14:15.260  -->  00:14:17.600
scoring only two points maybe

378

00:14:17.600  -->  00:14:20.390
occasionally he's got a few 3-pointers

379

00:14:20.390  -->  00:14:23.060
in but generally he's only aiming for

380

00:14:23.060  -->  00:14:25.610
two pointers right and that explains it

381

00:14:25.610  -->  00:14:26.180
all.

382

00:14:26.180  -->  00:14:28.250
That means that when it comes to field

383

00:14:28.250  -->  00:14:29.360
goals and we're talking about field

384

00:14:29.360  -->  00:14:31.460
goals here, he is always going to point

385

00:14:31.460  -->  00:14:32.930
and two-pointer means that you can be

386

00:14:32.930  -->  00:14:34.700
close to the net or in fact you might be

387

00:14:34.700  -->  00:14:36.920
even intact which might be, so close that

388

00:14:36.920  -->  00:14:39.740
your dunking the ball into the hoop or

389

00:14:39.740  -->  00:14:41.480
you just very close that you can

390

00:14:41.480  -->  00:14:43.910
basically just drop it into the net and

391

00:14:43.910  -->  00:14:45.680
even not knowing anything about Dwight

392

00:14:45.680  -->  00:14:48.230
Howard or his playing style I can

393

00:14:48.230  -->  00:14:49.790
already tell from the data that most

394

00:14:49.790  -->  00:14:52.100
likely he puts the ball in when he's

395

00:14:52.100  -->  00:14:54.500
very close to the net because that way

396

00:14:54.500  -->  00:14:56.780
it explains why his accuracy let's look

397

00:14:56.780  -->  00:14:59.090
at it again in field goals is very high

398

00:14:59.090  -->  00:15:00.740
right if you're so close to the net it's

399

00:15:00.740  -->  00:15:03.470
hard not to put in but and then he

400

00:15:03.470  -->  00:15:05.180
doesn't take shots he doesn't take shots

401

00:15:05.180  -->  00:15:06.800
from far and they don't drop his

402

00:15:06.800  -->  00:15:08.630
accuracy as opposed to other place but

403

00:15:08.630  -->  00:15:10.460
when it comes to free throws

404

00:15:10.460  -->  00:15:12.230
he's 's not that good right because you

405

00:15:12.230  -->  00:15:14.300
can't because the next you have to be 15

406

00:15:14.300  -->  00:15:16.580
feet away from the net just throw in a

407

00:15:16.580  -->  00:15:19.250
free throw and apparently his throwing

408

00:15:19.250  -->  00:15:21.590
accuracy is not that good and that

409

00:15:21.590  -->  00:15:24.200
explains all that end when I found these

410

00:15:24.200  -->  00:15:26.270
insights, it was very interesting and

411

00:15:26.270  -->  00:15:28.370
actually satisfying to finally find the

412

00:15:28.370  -->  00:15:30.180
answer and see how all of this comes

413

00:15:30.180  -->  00:15:32.040
the other that you need to look at these

414

00:15:32.040  -->  00:15:34.380
three tables or three visualizations to

415

00:15:34.380  -->  00:15:36.690
understand what exactly is going on.

416

00:15:36.690  -->  00:15:39.570
So there we go that's our three insights

417

00:15:39.570  -->  00:15:42.720
as requested by the challenge. I'm sure

418

00:15:42.720  -->  00:15:44.610
you had lots of fun creating these

419

00:15:44.610  -->  00:15:46.740
visualizations and investigating the

420

00:15:46.740  -->  00:15:48.990
basketball trends and moreover now you

421

00:15:48.990  -->  00:15:50.910
have two additional tables and you've

422

00:15:50.910  -->  00:15:53.790
got all this data. So feel free to play

423

00:15:53.790  -->  00:15:55.860
around and see what other instance you

424

00:15:55.860  -->  00:15:57.450
can find as you can see it's very

425

00:15:57.450  -->  00:15:59.490
interesting which you can tell from the

426

00:15:59.490  -->  00:16:01.620
data even not knowing anything about the

427

00:16:01.620  -->  00:16:03.330
game and I look forward to seeing you

428

00:16:03.330  -->  00:16:04.080
next time

429

00:16:04.080  -->  00:16:12.830
until then, happy coding.
