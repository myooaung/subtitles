00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.049
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07.049  -->  00:00:10.139
R programming and today we're moving back

3

00:00:10.139  -->  00:00:12.990
a step. We're going back to aesthetics

4

00:00:12.990  -->  00:00:15.240
and we'll be talking about this layer of

5

00:00:15.240  -->  00:00:17.760
our visualization process and that's

6

00:00:17.760  -->  00:00:18.990
because we want to learn about

7

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:21.990
overriding mystics right? Let's see how

8

00:00:21.990  -->  00:00:22.830
this works.

9

00:00:22.830  -->  00:00:25.080
So here we've got what we created

10

00:00:25.080  -->  00:00:27.330
last time that beautiful meaningless

11

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:30.029
visualization and what did we learn? We

12

00:00:30.029  -->  00:00:32.430
learned about applauding with flares so

13

00:00:32.430  -->  00:00:34.079
we learned that we're creating objects

14

00:00:34.079  -->  00:00:36.840
and that then we're adding layers and

15

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:38.100
layers and layers to create the

16

00:00:38.100  -->  00:00:40.079
visualization. So let's quickly recap on

17

00:00:40.079  -->  00:00:41.700
that, now let's create an object let's

18

00:00:41.700  -->  00:00:44.430
say Q so we'll just keep incrementing

19

00:00:44.430  -->  00:00:47.280
these numbers so that we use new ones

20

00:00:47.280  -->  00:00:49.500
all the time ggplot and data equals

21

00:00:49.500  -->  00:00:54.030
movies, aesthetics x equals critic,

22

00:00:54.030  -->  00:00:57.149
rating and then y equals audience

23

00:00:57.149  -->  00:01:00.329
rating. Then we want to color equals

24

00:01:00.329  -->  00:01:05.100
genre and then we want size equals budget

25

00:01:05.100  -->  00:01:06.720
millions.

26

00:01:06.720  -->  00:01:08.310
Alright so we've created, we're going to

27

00:01:08.310  -->  00:01:10.290
create the subject now and there we go

28

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:12.570
just added this Q object and now we're

29

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:16.170
going to say add job layer right? So

30

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:18.330
we're going to say Q plus geom

31

00:01:18.330  -->  00:01:22.020
underscore point. Run that, there we go so

32

00:01:22.020  -->  00:01:24.000
that's the visualization that we've seen

33

00:01:24.000  -->  00:01:24.689
before.

34

00:01:24.689  -->  00:01:26.790
Now what we're learning today is that

35

00:01:26.790  -->  00:01:30.090
well as you can see this visualization

36

00:01:30.090  -->  00:01:32.759
or the actually the geometry that we're

37

00:01:32.759  -->  00:01:35.939
using geom point, it's inheriting the

38

00:01:35.939  -->  00:01:39.150
aesthetic from this object from object

39

00:01:39.150  -->  00:01:42.630
Q right? So it's saying okay what what

40

00:01:42.630  -->  00:01:46.049
aesthetics does Q have, Q has XY

41

00:01:46.049  -->  00:01:48.570
color and size. I'm going to take all of

42

00:01:48.570  -->  00:01:50.579
those and I'm going to assume those

43

00:01:50.579  -->  00:01:53.250
aesthetics so that's why it is plotted

44

00:01:53.250  -->  00:01:55.649
at on this axis on this axis that's why

45

00:01:55.649  -->  00:01:57.570
these thoughts are plotted in the sports

46

00:01:57.570  -->  00:01:59.790
where they are then the colors are

47

00:01:59.790  -->  00:02:01.920
assigned to them like that and also the

48

00:02:01.920  -->  00:02:04.259
sizes. So but we can do is we can

49

00:02:04.259  -->  00:02:07.350
override aesthetics and so we can say in

50

00:02:07.350  -->  00:02:09.390
geom point, we want a specific aesthetic

51

00:02:09.390  -->  00:02:11.340
to be different to the one that you have

52

00:02:11.340  -->  00:02:12.200
here.

53

00:02:12.200  -->  00:02:14.360
In the base of this visualization, so let's

54

00:02:14.360  -->  00:02:17.750
look at that overriding. Writing

55

00:02:17.750  -->  00:02:21.440
aesthetics, alright how do we do that? We

56

00:02:21.440  -->  00:02:26.480
say Q plus geom point now instead of just

57

00:02:26.480  -->  00:02:28.849
running it inside these brackets you can

58

00:02:28.849  -->  00:02:31.310
specify it more aesthetics. So let's go

59

00:02:31.310  -->  00:02:33.230
ahead and do that, we'll say aesthetics so you

60

00:02:33.230  -->  00:02:35.420
can see actually mapping and that's what

61

00:02:35.420  -->  00:02:37.400
we're doing we're saying aesthetics in

62

00:02:37.400  -->  00:02:39.080
here we're going to say let's change the

63

00:02:39.080  -->  00:02:41.810
size. Let's say size, we don't want it to be

64

00:02:41.810  -->  00:02:44.150
budget million and you don't want it to

65

00:02:44.150  -->  00:02:46.340
be critic rating for instance because

66

00:02:46.340  -->  00:02:47.810
that's one of the variables we haven't

67

00:02:47.810  -->  00:02:49.370
and that's just what we want to plot so

68

00:02:49.370  -->  00:02:52.250
if we run that, you can see that now the

69

00:02:52.250  -->  00:02:54.980
visualization is different because the the

70

00:02:54.980  -->  00:02:57.200
size that we had in Q has been

71

00:02:57.200  -->  00:03:00.950
overridden by this new mapping of size.

72

00:03:00.950  -->  00:03:04.250
So this overrides what we had in there

73

00:03:04.250  -->  00:03:06.680
so it is specific to geom point. So all

74

00:03:06.680  -->  00:03:10.190
the points now are greater as you go to

75

00:03:10.190  -->  00:03:12.620
the right they're greater because that is a

76

00:03:12.620  -->  00:03:15.470
critic rating increasing and now you can

77

00:03:15.470  -->  00:03:17.180
see that the budget has no effect on the

78

00:03:17.180  -->  00:03:17.959
size.

79

00:03:17.959  -->  00:03:20.750
Ok so that's example one. I'm actually

80

00:03:20.750  -->  00:03:24.049
going to say here example one. Let's do

81

00:03:24.049  -->  00:03:27.650
another example. Let's say example 2 and

82

00:03:27.650  -->  00:03:29.989
let's say we want to override color. So Q

83

00:03:29.989  -->  00:03:33.200
plus, I don't just take this and inside

84

00:03:33.200  -->  00:03:36.049
here we want to say color and instead of

85

00:03:36.049  -->  00:03:38.600
color being genre, let's say budget

86

00:03:38.600  -->  00:03:42.769
millions. So if I run on this, you'll see now

87

00:03:42.769  -->  00:03:44.480
the color is different. The color is

88

00:03:44.480  -->  00:03:46.489
based on the budget rather than the

89

00:03:46.489  -->  00:03:49.280
genre so the color is similar to the

90

00:03:49.280  -->  00:03:51.560
size of the bubbles and by the way this

91

00:03:51.560  -->  00:03:53.870
which brings us to this point that I

92

00:03:53.870  -->  00:03:55.489
wanted to make is that if I just run

93

00:03:55.489  -->  00:03:58.340
Q plus geom point underscored by

94

00:03:58.340  -->  00:04:00.709
itself. Around like that, you'll see that

95

00:04:00.709  -->  00:04:03.079
we've got that original plot that we had.

96

00:04:03.079  -->  00:04:04.700
Why is that? Well because even though we

97

00:04:04.700  -->  00:04:07.459
are overriding, we're not modifying the

98

00:04:07.459  -->  00:04:09.829
object. We're not modifying Q in anyway. So

99

00:04:09.829  -->  00:04:12.470
Q still stays as it was.

100

00:04:12.470  -->  00:04:14.750
We're just for this specific plot, we're

101

00:04:14.750  -->  00:04:17.030
saying we want to override this static

102

00:04:17.030  -->  00:04:19.190
but then Q itself, it's not changing. So

103

00:04:19.190  -->  00:04:22.280
whenever we stop overriding the values

104

00:04:22.280  -->  00:04:24.470
then they revert back to the original. So

105

00:04:24.470  -->  00:04:25.790
let's say here,

106

00:04:25.790  -->  00:04:29.360
Q remains the same yep, so we're not

107

00:04:29.360  -->  00:04:31.370
changing the object itself.

108

00:04:31.370  -->  00:04:34.100
Alright, so what else can be alright here?

109

00:04:34.100  -->  00:04:37.190
I wanted to also show you that we can

110

00:04:37.190  -->  00:04:41.000
override even X&amp;Y, so some people get bit

111

00:04:41.000  -->  00:04:43.190
afraid like all oh wow. Those are you know

112

00:04:43.190  -->  00:04:45.560
framework of this visualization there

113

00:04:45.560  -->  00:04:47.660
are, the X&amp;Y coordinates but they are

114

00:04:47.660  -->  00:04:50.660
aesthetics just as color or as size and

115

00:04:50.660  -->  00:04:53.060
like in terms of in a data

116

00:04:53.060  -->  00:04:55.880
perspective X is no different to size or

117

00:04:55.880  -->  00:04:57.380
color it's always just conveying

118

00:04:57.380  -->  00:04:58.790
daughter in a different way. In a

119

00:04:58.790  -->  00:05:01.010
different shape or format. So we're

120

00:05:01.010  -->  00:05:03.620
going to say Q plus geom underscore

121

00:05:03.620  -->  00:05:05.450
point and we're going to override the

122

00:05:05.450  -->  00:05:09.410
x-axis. We're going to say x this time is

123

00:05:09.410  -->  00:05:12.320
going to be budget millions right? So if

124

00:05:12.320  -->  00:05:14.510
we run that, you can see that the plot is

125

00:05:14.510  -->  00:05:16.760
different. So you get to go to the right,

126

00:05:16.760  -->  00:05:19.580
the budget increases and here we've got

127

00:05:19.580  -->  00:05:21.200
the audience rating. So as you can see,

128

00:05:21.200  -->  00:05:23.480
audience rating doesn't really depend

129

00:05:23.480  -->  00:05:26.420
that much on budget maybe at the highest

130

00:05:26.420  -->  00:05:28.580
level of budget over here over 150

131

00:05:28.580  -->  00:05:31.130
million. Maybe they're you know it's very

132

00:05:31.130  -->  00:05:32.570
hard to get a poor rating from the

133

00:05:32.570  -->  00:05:34.970
audience but otherwise your audience

134

00:05:34.970  -->  00:05:38.060
audience doesn't discriminate and what

135

00:05:38.060  -->  00:05:39.350
you will notice is if you look very

136

00:05:39.350  -->  00:05:41.570
carefully and if we zoom in over here

137

00:05:41.570  -->  00:05:43.880
you'll see that it still says critic

138

00:05:43.880  -->  00:05:47.360
rating and that's kind of like a thing

139

00:05:47.360  -->  00:05:49.910
in GGplot that it will still even though

140

00:05:49.910  -->  00:05:51.230
we're over we have overridden the

141

00:05:51.230  -->  00:05:53.810
aesthetic it still keeps the old name. It's

142

00:05:53.810  -->  00:05:55.460
very easy to fix and we'll explore this

143

00:05:55.460  -->  00:05:57.860
further in the course, all you have to do

144

00:05:57.860  -->  00:06:00.740
is to say plus and then here say xlab

145

00:06:00.740  -->  00:06:02.600
before because it's the x-axis in here

146

00:06:02.600  -->  00:06:05.660
to save budget millions and you can

147

00:06:05.660  -->  00:06:07.700
see dollar dollar or something like that.

148

00:06:07.700  -->  00:06:10.610
So if you run that, you can see that the

149

00:06:10.610  -->  00:06:14.600
axis has been updated successfully. Ok

150

00:06:14.600  -->  00:06:17.450
and let's have a look at one more

151

00:06:17.450  -->  00:06:19.880
example. Remember the plot where we had

152

00:06:19.880  -->  00:06:23.120
four sorry we had example four, where we

153

00:06:23.120  -->  00:06:26.150
had two visualizations together. So this one,

154

00:06:26.150  -->  00:06:28.520
let's just take that one or let's take

155

00:06:28.520  -->  00:06:30.650
this one. This one looks a bit better. So if

156

00:06:30.650  -->  00:06:33.110
we take that one and we say instead of

157

00:06:33.110  -->  00:06:36.140
P, Q, if we run that then we've got that

158

00:06:36.140  -->  00:06:39.110
plot that were used to, but now what

159

00:06:39.110  -->  00:06:41.150
you want to do let's reduce the size of

160

00:06:41.150  -->  00:06:43.580
these lines because they are too thick

161

00:06:43.580  -->  00:06:47.600
we can't see the dots right? Reduce a line

162

00:06:47.600  -->  00:06:51.470
size and now let's say geom line and in

163

00:06:51.470  -->  00:06:53.600
here we'll just say size equals one.

164

00:06:53.600  -->  00:06:56.960
If we run that, you'll see that the sizes

165

00:06:56.960  -->  00:06:58.130
change, it's thiner.

166

00:06:58.130  -->  00:07:00.320
That's pretty good right and if you're

167

00:07:00.320  -->  00:07:02.120
very attentive, you're probably now

168

00:07:02.120  -->  00:07:04.130
saying Kirill what just happened?

169

00:07:04.130  -->  00:07:06.290
You forgot the static function and

170

00:07:06.290  -->  00:07:07.790
that's right over here

171

00:07:07.790  -->  00:07:09.590
I didn't type an aesthetic right? So I

172

00:07:09.590  -->  00:07:12.260
didn't aesthetic and something inside. I

173

00:07:12.260  -->  00:07:14.750
just said size equals one and that's

174

00:07:14.750  -->  00:07:16.400
that's a new thing that

175

00:07:16.400  -->  00:07:19.190
we're going to learn. It's called mapping

176

00:07:19.190  -->  00:07:22.550
versus setting and as you can see here we're

177

00:07:22.550  -->  00:07:25.850
mapping variables to aesthetics. Here

178

00:07:25.850  -->  00:07:28.850
we're actually just setting aesthetics and

179

00:07:28.850  -->  00:07:31.370
we'll talk more about mapping versus setting

180

00:07:31.370  -->  00:07:32.480
in the next tutorial. It's going to be a

181

00:07:32.480  -->  00:07:34.700
fun thing to learn and very powerful

182

00:07:34.700  -->  00:07:37.790
tool as well and for now I will leave

183

00:07:37.790  -->  00:07:40.580
you to play around with what we learned today and I

184

00:07:40.580  -->  00:07:48.550
look forward to seeing you next time. Until then, happy coding.
