00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.020
Hello and welcome to the homework

2

00:00:07.020  -->  00:00:09.540
exercise on the world trends. I hope you

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:11.280
enjoyed the section of the course on

4

00:00:11.280  -->  00:00:14.070
data frames and today we have a great

5

00:00:14.070  -->  00:00:15.780
opportunity to practice all of those

6

00:00:15.780  -->  00:00:17.880
skills that we learned and really let that

7

00:00:17.880  -->  00:00:20.039
knowledge sink in. So let's jump right

8

00:00:20.039  -->  00:00:23.010
into this challenge, the challenge is the

9

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:24.449
world bank was very impressed with your

10

00:00:24.449  -->  00:00:26.310
deliverables on the previous assignment

11

00:00:26.310  -->  00:00:28.140
and they have a new project for you. As

12

00:00:28.140  -->  00:00:30.090
it often is in data science. You are

13

00:00:30.090  -->  00:00:31.949
required to produce a scatterplot

14

00:00:31.949  -->  00:00:34.260
depicting a life expectancy on the

15

00:00:34.260  -->  00:00:37.230
y-axis and fertility rate on the x-axis

16

00:00:37.230  -->  00:00:40.290
statistics by country. The scatterplot

17

00:00:40.290  -->  00:00:42.120
needs to also be categorized by

18

00:00:42.120  -->  00:00:45.030
countries/regions next page, there's more

19

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:48.210
ok that's what's more here. You have been

20

00:00:48.210  -->  00:00:50.910
supplied with data for two years, 1960

21

00:00:50.910  -->  00:00:53.070
and 2013 and you're required to produce

22

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:55.530
a visualization for each of these years.

23

00:00:55.530  -->  00:00:58.109
Some data has been provided in a CSV

24

00:00:58.109  -->  00:01:01.050
files, some in R vectors. The CSV

25

00:01:01.050  -->  00:01:02.879
file contains combined data for both

26

00:01:02.879  -->  00:01:05.760
years, all data manipulations have to

27

00:01:05.760  -->  00:01:08.189
be performed in R, not in Excel because

28

00:01:08.189  -->  00:01:10.470
this project may be audited at a later

29

00:01:10.470  -->  00:01:12.840
stage. You have also been requested to

30

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:15.090
provide insight into how the two periods

31

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:17.490
compare very very interesting. So this

32

00:01:17.490  -->  00:01:19.110
time it's different so very similar to

33

00:01:19.110  -->  00:01:21.630
what we've done but different. Different

34

00:01:21.630  -->  00:01:22.080
how?

35

00:01:22.080  -->  00:01:23.729
Well first of all now we have two years

36

00:01:23.729  -->  00:01:25.740
right? Instead of just the one year we

37

00:01:25.740  -->  00:01:27.509
have two years so we'll have we'll have two

38

00:01:27.509  -->  00:01:30.150
visualizations and then also some

39

00:01:30.150  -->  00:01:32.280
data has been provided in CSV, some in R

40

00:01:32.280  -->  00:01:36.119
vectors. We know that but the CSV file

41

00:01:36.119  -->  00:01:38.490
contains combined data for both year. So

42

00:01:38.490  -->  00:01:42.270
both 1960 and 2013 are in one file, that's

43

00:01:42.270  -->  00:01:44.700
going to add a bit of complication to

44

00:01:44.700  -->  00:01:48.119
our work and all data manipulations have

45

00:01:48.119  -->  00:01:49.979
to be formed performed in R. So you can

46

00:01:49.979  -->  00:01:51.990
just go and fix up your data in

47

00:01:51.990  -->  00:01:54.119
Excel and then important to R and the

48

00:01:54.119  -->  00:01:55.259
reason why they saying that is because

49

00:01:55.259  -->  00:01:57.000
this project maybe order to add a later

50

00:01:57.000  -->  00:01:59.189
stage so basically your supply order and

51

00:01:59.189  -->  00:02:00.570
this is often the case in data science

52

00:02:00.570  -->  00:02:03.149
especially if you're in consulting but

53

00:02:03.149  -->  00:02:05.579
if you're even if you're not into

54

00:02:05.579  -->  00:02:06.930
consulting, so when I went into the

55

00:02:06.930  -->  00:02:08.849
industry and I was setting up a data

56

00:02:08.849  -->  00:02:10.950
science team for a large financial

57

00:02:10.950  -->  00:02:13.530
corporation still we always took

58

00:02:13.530  -->  00:02:15.390
care about these audit trails because

59

00:02:15.390  -->  00:02:17.550
all the things you do in Excel, you do

60

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:19.230
them and then nobody knows exactly what

61

00:02:19.230  -->  00:02:21.480
you did but if you ride up code in R

62

00:02:21.480  -->  00:02:24.270
or other programming language, then you

63

00:02:24.270  -->  00:02:26.640
can always traceback exactly what

64

00:02:26.640  -->  00:02:28.620
happened and how you got from point A to

65

00:02:28.620  -->  00:02:30.239
point B. So that's why they want

66

00:02:30.239  -->  00:02:32.250
everything from not and finally you're

67

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:33.840
required to provide insights to compare

68

00:02:33.840  -->  00:02:34.830
the two years. That's going to be

69

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:35.880
interesting as well,

70

00:02:35.880  -->  00:02:38.340
Alright so there's the challenge let's

71

00:02:38.340  -->  00:02:39.720
have a look at where to get the data set.

72

00:02:39.720  -->  00:02:41.730
If you go to superdatascience.com/rcourse

73

00:02:41.730  -->  00:02:44.069
and you scroll down

74

00:02:44.069  -->  00:02:47.280
to the section 5, data frames and

75

00:02:47.280  -->  00:02:49.110
it's growing very quickly. Here you can

76

00:02:49.110  -->  00:02:51.780
see homework challenge that's a PDF file

77

00:02:51.780  -->  00:02:53.370
and then this is what you're going to

78

00:02:53.370  -->  00:02:56.070
need homework data set and homework vector.

79

00:02:56.070  -->  00:02:58.530
So those are two files you need, if

80

00:02:58.530  -->  00:03:00.450
you're comfortable at attacking this

81

00:03:00.450  -->  00:03:02.160
challenge right away

82

00:03:02.160  -->  00:03:04.950
give it a go see how see how you can

83

00:03:04.950  -->  00:03:08.489
solve this problem and but now what I

84

00:03:08.489  -->  00:03:09.600
want to do is I want to give you two

85

00:03:09.600  -->  00:03:11.370
hints, as always. I want to give you to

86

00:03:11.370  -->  00:03:11.819
hints.

87

00:03:11.819  -->  00:03:13.980
So let's go back to the presentation,

88

00:03:13.980  -->  00:03:16.980
firsthand are you ready? For this number

89

00:03:16.980  -->  00:03:18.030
one,

90

00:03:18.030  -->  00:03:20.579
alright this is relating to the CSV file,

91

00:03:20.579  -->  00:03:23.610
after you import the csv file into R,

92

00:03:23.610  -->  00:03:25.799
the first step is to split the data

93

00:03:25.799  -->  00:03:28.799
frame into two. So you've got a data

94

00:03:28.799  -->  00:03:31.110
frame of two sets of data in it. While

95

00:03:31.110  -->  00:03:33.239
the first idea, the best approach would

96

00:03:33.239  -->  00:03:36.030
be to split the data into two data frames.

97

00:03:36.030  -->  00:03:38.910
In order to achieve this, use data frame

98

00:03:38.910  -->  00:03:40.500
filtering we discussed in this section

99

00:03:40.500  -->  00:03:42.420
so remember where you have like square

100

00:03:42.420  -->  00:03:46.290
brackets and then you say so let's say

101

00:03:46.290  -->  00:03:48.359
our data is data in the data frame

102

00:03:48.359  -->  00:03:50.340
called let's say DF for instance, when you

103

00:03:50.340  -->  00:03:53.100
say DF square brackets DF dollar sign,

104

00:03:53.100  -->  00:03:54.840
the column you want to filter on is

105

00:03:54.840  -->  00:03:57.000
greater or less than or equal to double

106

00:03:57.000  -->  00:03:58.769
equal sign then you put your condition

107

00:03:58.769  -->  00:04:00.540
and then you put on the comma and then

108

00:04:00.540  -->  00:04:02.459
nothing right? So that's the approach

109

00:04:02.459  -->  00:04:04.709
that you will probably you will need to

110

00:04:04.709  -->  00:04:07.980
use in order to filter out or split your

111

00:04:07.980  -->  00:04:09.870
data into two diagrams. And then from

112

00:04:09.870  -->  00:04:11.400
there it's pretty simple, it's from there you

113

00:04:11.400  -->  00:04:13.170
just do exactly what we did in this

114

00:04:13.170  -->  00:04:14.670
section so that way you get to practice

115

00:04:14.670  -->  00:04:17.070
both data filtering and visualization and

116

00:04:17.070  -->  00:04:18.840
all the other techniques, most of them

117

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:19.739
that we learn in this section.

118

00:04:19.739  -->  00:04:21.630
So there you go that's hint number one,

119

00:04:21.630  -->  00:04:23.460
and probably now you should be quite

120

00:04:23.460  -->  00:04:26.340
confident as the steps so I find the

121

00:04:26.340  -->  00:04:27.870
best way to attack a challenge is to

122

00:04:27.870  -->  00:04:30.060
break it down into steps and understand

123

00:04:30.060  -->  00:04:31.080
how you're going to approach it. So

124

00:04:31.080  -->  00:04:33.060
there's your first step and from there

125

00:04:33.060  -->  00:04:35.520
you probably already remember the steps

126

00:04:35.520  -->  00:04:38.370
that were taken before so give it a go

127

00:04:38.370  -->  00:04:41.910
and try and tempt this challenge and

128

00:04:41.910  -->  00:04:44.940
then come back and look at the solution

129

00:04:44.940  -->  00:04:47.310
will compare there otherwise, if you want

130

00:04:47.310  -->  00:04:49.110
hint number two, then I'm happy to give

131

00:04:49.110  -->  00:04:52.050
it to you, hint number two is of course

132

00:04:52.050  -->  00:04:54.990
the fill in the blanks exercise. So let's

133

00:04:54.990  -->  00:04:56.970
go and check it out,

134

00:04:56.970  -->  00:04:58.710
you can download it here fill in the

135

00:04:58.710  -->  00:05:01.259
blanks exercise , it's an R file. Well it's

136

00:05:01.259  -->  00:05:04.470
a zip file which is an R file, has R

137

00:05:04.470  -->  00:05:06.120
our file inside. So here I've got the

138

00:05:06.120  -->  00:05:07.680
fill in the blanks exercise which I've

139

00:05:07.680  -->  00:05:10.440
prepared for you and all you have to do

140

00:05:10.440  -->  00:05:12.030
is find everywhere where you see this

141

00:05:12.030  -->  00:05:13.710
underscore. Well actually if you highlight

142

00:05:13.710  -->  00:05:15.720
like that, you'll see it it's highlighted

143

00:05:15.720  -->  00:05:18.419
already for us that's great. You just have

144

00:05:18.419  -->  00:05:20.280
to replace it with some codes so here we

145

00:05:20.280  -->  00:05:21.539
set the work and I have put a lot

146

00:05:21.539  -->  00:05:23.220
of comments to explain the steps that

147

00:05:23.220  -->  00:05:25.289
we're taking. You import the data, you

148

00:05:25.289  -->  00:05:27.270
explore the data like with dance

149

00:05:27.270  -->  00:05:29.430
I've explained exactly what we're

150

00:05:29.430  -->  00:05:31.949
looking for here and so on. So go ahead

151

00:05:31.949  -->  00:05:35.280
and download this file and that way you

152

00:05:35.280  -->  00:05:36.810
already kind of have the step-by-step

153

00:05:36.810  -->  00:05:39.870
approach in the file prepared for you

154

00:05:39.870  -->  00:05:41.639
all you have to do is remember the bits

155

00:05:41.639  -->  00:05:43.440
and pieces of code that we've talked

156

00:05:43.440  -->  00:05:45.539
about maybe you know take a sneak peek

157

00:05:45.539  -->  00:05:47.759
into the tutorials that we've had and

158

00:05:47.759  -->  00:05:50.430
just populate that code instead of these

159

00:05:50.430  -->  00:05:51.990
underscores including these other

160

00:05:51.990  -->  00:05:52.800
scores over here.

161

00:05:52.800  -->  00:05:55.229
That way, you'll get to practice

162

00:05:55.229  -->  00:05:57.449
everything we learn today. Alright so

163

00:05:57.449  -->  00:05:58.080
that's it

164

00:05:58.080  -->  00:06:00.389
and after you're done, have a look at the

165

00:06:00.389  -->  00:06:02.250
solution I will post it at the very end

166

00:06:02.250  -->  00:06:04.650
of the course in a separate section with

167

00:06:04.650  -->  00:06:07.139
solutions and I wish you best of luck

168

00:06:07.139  -->  00:06:08.460
with this challenge.

169

00:06:08.460  -->  00:06:10.740
I look forward to seeing you next time, until then happy

170

00:06:10.740  -->  00:06:21.669
coding.
