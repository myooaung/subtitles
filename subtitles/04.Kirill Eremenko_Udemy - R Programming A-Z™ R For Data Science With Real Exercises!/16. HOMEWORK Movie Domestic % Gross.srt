00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,049
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,049  -->  00:00:09,150
R programming and today we've got another

3

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:11,219
exciting challenge to help us practice

4

00:00:11,219  -->  00:00:13,349
the skills that we've learned and once

5

00:00:13,349  -->  00:00:14,400
again we're going to be talking about

6

00:00:14,400  -->  00:00:15,630
movies.

7

00:00:15,630  -->  00:00:17,580
Alright so let's jump straight into it.

8

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:20,250
The movie reviews website was very happy

9

00:00:20,250  -->  00:00:21,960
with your deliverable for the previous

10

00:00:21,960  -->  00:00:23,340
assignment and now they have a new

11

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:24,390
request for you.

12

00:00:24,390  -->  00:00:25,800
The previous consultant had created

13

00:00:25,800  -->  00:00:27,720
chart for them which is illustrated on

14

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:28,980
the next slide.

15

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:31,320
However, the R code used to create the

16

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:33,719
diagram has since been lost and cannot

17

00:00:33,719  -->  00:00:35,700
be recovered. Your task is to come up

18

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:37,469
with the code that will recreate the

19

00:00:37,469  -->  00:00:39,840
same chart making it look as close as

20

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:41,940
possible to the original. A new data set

21

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:44,340
has been supplied. Alright so that

22

00:00:44,340  -->  00:00:46,020
sounds like an exciting challenge and

23

00:00:46,020  -->  00:00:47,969
before we move on to the actual

24

00:00:47,969  -->  00:00:49,680
visualization I'm going to create. I

25

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:51,360
would like to show you the data set

26

00:00:51,360  -->  00:00:52,890
first because that will help us

27

00:00:52,890  -->  00:00:54,360
understand what's going on.

28

00:00:54,360  -->  00:00:56,309
So in order to get the data set you need

29

00:00:56,309  -->  00:01:00,210
to go to www.superdatascience.com/rcourse,

30

00:01:00,210  -->  00:01:02,190
so R course is one word here

31

00:01:02,190  -->  00:01:04,799
and if on this website you scroll down

32

00:01:04,799  -->  00:01:08,549
to Section 6, then you will find the

33

00:01:08,549  -->  00:01:11,549
challenge which is the PDF file with the

34

00:01:11,549  -->  00:01:13,200
challenge which can download. So you can

35

00:01:13,200  -->  00:01:15,330
see the image right in front of you and

36

00:01:15,330  -->  00:01:16,950
also the homework data set which

37

00:01:16,950  -->  00:01:19,530
will go through right now. So here's the

38

00:01:19,530  -->  00:01:20,939
data set and as you can see there are

39

00:01:20,939  -->  00:01:23,580
many more columns then what we worked

40

00:01:23,580  -->  00:01:25,680
with in the previous challenge so let's

41

00:01:25,680  -->  00:01:27,330
have a look at them and go through them

42

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:29,520
one by one. The first column is day of the

43

00:01:29,520  -->  00:01:32,220
week and it tells us which day of the

44

00:01:32,220  -->  00:01:34,409
week the movie was released on. Then

45

00:01:34,409  -->  00:01:36,390
we've got the director's name, the genre

46

00:01:36,390  -->  00:01:38,610
of the movie, the title of the movie, the

47

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:41,520
release date, the studio that release the

48

00:01:41,520  -->  00:01:44,310
movie, so you've got studios like Sony,

49

00:01:44,310  -->  00:01:47,399
Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers and

50

00:01:47,399  -->  00:01:48,119
so on.

51

00:01:48,119  -->  00:01:50,610
You've got the adjusted gross so we've

52

00:01:50,610  -->  00:01:52,110
got the gross in millions of dollars

53

00:01:52,110  -->  00:01:54,479
here that's how much the movie grossed

54

00:01:54,479  -->  00:01:57,299
worldwide but the adjusted gross is the

55

00:01:57,299  -->  00:02:00,509
same number adjusted for inflation of

56

00:02:00,509  -->  00:02:03,030
ticket prices so because some of these

57

00:02:03,030  -->  00:02:05,729
movies were released long long time ago

58

00:02:05,729  -->  00:02:08,099
like back and all the way back to the

59

00:02:08,099  -->  00:02:10,410
nineteen-thirties obviously you have to

60

00:02:10,410  -->  00:02:13,500
adjust buy a ticket price inflation to

61

00:02:13,500  -->  00:02:16,200
get a comparable figure. However that

62

00:02:16,200  -->  00:02:18,450
won't really be impacting us in this

63

00:02:18,450  -->  00:02:20,220
specific challenge then we've got the

64

00:02:20,220  -->  00:02:22,380
budget of the movie then we've got the

65

00:02:22,380  -->  00:02:24,690
imdb rating the movie lens rating,

66

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:28,140
overseas so this is the overseas gross,

67

00:02:28,140  -->  00:02:30,390
how much the movie made not in the U.S.,

68

00:02:30,390  -->  00:02:32,459
overseas percentage so what percentage of

69

00:02:32,459  -->  00:02:34,740
the gross was made overseas as opposed to

70

00:02:34,740  -->  00:02:37,260
in the US. The profit in millions of

71

00:02:37,260  -->  00:02:39,510
dollars, the profit percentage so that's

72

00:02:39,510  -->  00:02:43,290
basically the profit divided by the

73

00:02:43,290  -->  00:02:45,209
budget of the movie which is over here

74

00:02:45,209  -->  00:02:48,480
and then we've got to the run time in

75

00:02:48,480  -->  00:02:50,520
minutes how long the movie was and

76

00:02:50,520  -->  00:02:53,040
finally we've got to the US gross, so

77

00:02:53,040  -->  00:02:55,290
how much did the movie make in the U.S.

78

00:02:55,290  -->  00:02:59,130
so U.S. gross and overseas gross over

79

00:02:59,130  -->  00:03:01,470
here, together make up the total gross

80

00:03:01,470  -->  00:03:03,209
and finally we've got the gross

81

00:03:03,209  -->  00:03:05,760
percentage in the U.S., so what

82

00:03:05,760  -->  00:03:08,640
percentage of the revenue was made just

83

00:03:08,640  -->  00:03:09,630
in the US.

84

00:03:09,630  -->  00:03:11,520
Alright so there we go, quite a lot of

85

00:03:11,520  -->  00:03:13,380
columns. I know it might feel overwhelming

86

00:03:13,380  -->  00:03:16,709
but let's now go on to the visualization

87

00:03:16,709  -->  00:03:18,269
and see what we're talking about there.

88

00:03:18,269  -->  00:03:20,850
So here's our visualization, it looks

89

00:03:20,850  -->  00:03:23,730
pretty neat and actually very similar to

90

00:03:23,730  -->  00:03:25,950
some of the visualization that we created

91

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:27,570
throughout the section. This is a boxplot

92

00:03:27,570  -->  00:03:31,049
with a jitter in the background and what

93

00:03:31,049  -->  00:03:32,459
is it visualizing? Well first of all

94

00:03:32,459  -->  00:03:35,489
we've got the genre on x axis and then

95

00:03:35,489  -->  00:03:38,910
we've got the gross on the vertical

96

00:03:38,910  -->  00:03:41,220
axis. It's actually gross percentage US

97

00:03:41,220  -->  00:03:43,980
which means it's that last column that

98

00:03:43,980  -->  00:03:46,440
we were looking at what percentage of

99

00:03:46,440  -->  00:03:50,040
the gross revenue was made in the US and

100

00:03:50,040  -->  00:03:51,840
as you can see here for instance

101

00:03:51,840  -->  00:03:54,750
adventure movies it's about just under

102

00:03:54,750  -->  00:03:57,750
forty percent whereas comedy movies over

103

00:03:57,750  -->  00:03:59,820
forty percent nearly fifty percent of

104

00:03:59,820  -->  00:04:03,180
revenue on average is made in the US by

105

00:04:03,180  -->  00:04:05,040
comedy movies. So that's what this plot's

106

00:04:05,040  -->  00:04:06,660
visualizing and then you've got the

107

00:04:06,660  -->  00:04:08,579
budget which is the size of the bubbles

108

00:04:08,579  -->  00:04:10,290
which makes sense and you've got the

109

00:04:10,290  -->  00:04:12,239
studio which is the color of the bubbles

110

00:04:12,239  -->  00:04:14,940
and if you think about it. It's actually

111

00:04:14,940  -->  00:04:16,769
just a combination of quite a few things

112

00:04:16,769  -->  00:04:19,049
that we learned, so some aesthetics over

113

00:04:19,049  -->  00:04:21,840
here and over here and over here and

114

00:04:21,840  -->  00:04:24,030
then we've got some we've got a box plot,

115

00:04:24,030  -->  00:04:25,349
we've got a jitter.

116

00:04:25,349  -->  00:04:27,070
What else do we have? We've got something

117

00:04:27,070  -->  00:04:28,390
theme so you can see that throughout

118

00:04:28,390  -->  00:04:32,620
this plot, the comic sans ms point has been

119

00:04:32,620  -->  00:04:34,900
used and then some of the font colors

120

00:04:34,900  -->  00:04:36,580
has been have been changed and the sizes

121

00:04:36,580  -->  00:04:38,320
have been adjusted so just the

122

00:04:38,320  -->  00:04:39,940
combination on all the things and it's

123

00:04:39,940  -->  00:04:43,210
simply a matter of going through the

124

00:04:43,210  -->  00:04:45,850
steps that we learned and creating this

125

00:04:45,850  -->  00:04:48,910
beautiful visualization. So there we go, if

126

00:04:48,910  -->  00:04:51,370
you're comfortable with this challenge

127

00:04:51,370  -->  00:04:52,990
if you feel comfortable to jump straight

128

00:04:52,990  -->  00:04:55,270
into then go ahead and stop this video

129

00:04:55,270  -->  00:04:57,700
and you can proceed with this homework

130

00:04:57,700  -->  00:05:00,550
exercise. However as always I would like

131

00:05:00,550  -->  00:05:02,560
to give you two hints, so the first hint

132

00:05:02,560  -->  00:05:05,230
is going to be just a slight hint so

133

00:05:05,230  -->  00:05:08,050
they feel free to listen through this

134

00:05:08,050  -->  00:05:11,620
one let's go into hint number one. Hint

135

00:05:11,620  -->  00:05:14,440
number one, is that you should notice

136

00:05:14,440  -->  00:05:17,410
that the studio here and the genre are

137

00:05:17,410  -->  00:05:19,870
not complete. So notice that not all

138

00:05:19,870  -->  00:05:21,940
genres and studios are used. You will

139

00:05:21,940  -->  00:05:23,860
need to filter your data frame after

140

00:05:23,860  -->  00:05:26,620
importing the csv file. In the csv file,

141

00:05:26,620  -->  00:05:28,900
we've got many more studios in that

142

00:05:28,900  -->  00:05:31,570
and many more genres in than that. So you

143

00:05:31,570  -->  00:05:33,760
will need to first filter your data

144

00:05:33,760  -->  00:05:36,370
frame after you've imported the actual

145

00:05:36,370  -->  00:05:38,050
data and then proceed with the

146

00:05:38,050  -->  00:05:39,820
visualization. Otherwise, you will end up

147

00:05:39,820  -->  00:05:41,710
with too many box plots and too many

148

00:05:41,710  -->  00:05:44,170
colors. So that's a simple hint, hint

149

00:05:44,170  -->  00:05:47,110
number one and as usual we're going to

150

00:05:47,110  -->  00:05:49,000
proceed to hit number two. Now

151

00:05:49,000  -->  00:05:51,910
hint number two is of course our fill in

152

00:05:51,910  -->  00:05:54,550
the blanks exercise. Let's go and have a

153

00:05:54,550  -->  00:05:55,360
look at that.

154

00:05:55,360  -->  00:05:59,230
So if on this page, you download the last

155

00:05:59,230  -->  00:06:01,210
file it'll be a zip file and inside

156

00:06:01,210  -->  00:06:04,150
you've got an R file with the fill in

157

00:06:04,150  -->  00:06:06,850
the blanks exercise and here I've got it

158

00:06:06,850  -->  00:06:10,450
brought up for us so once again you just

159

00:06:10,450  -->  00:06:13,450
need to look for the underscores and

160

00:06:13,450  -->  00:06:16,450
replace them with what should be in

161

00:06:16,450  -->  00:06:18,400
their place so here we've got all the

162

00:06:18,400  -->  00:06:20,290
steps, lots of comments on what we're

163

00:06:20,290  -->  00:06:23,320
doing and it should help you going to

164

00:06:23,320  -->  00:06:24,910
get through this exercise even if you're

165

00:06:24,910  -->  00:06:26,890
not entirely comfortable jumping into it

166

00:06:26,890  -->  00:06:29,560
by yourself you should be quite ok going

167

00:06:29,560  -->  00:06:31,330
through it with these fill-in-the-blank

168

00:06:31,330  -->  00:06:33,970
and if at any point you feel stuck,

169

00:06:33,970  -->  00:06:35,890
just refer back to the tutorials in this

170

00:06:35,890  -->  00:06:38,500
section and you will definitely find

171

00:06:38,500  -->  00:06:39,910
your way through

172

00:06:39,910  -->  00:06:42,610
this exercise. As you can see, it's it's a

173

00:06:42,610  -->  00:06:44,170
bit longer than usual but that's just

174

00:06:44,170  -->  00:06:45,730
because we're adding layers and layers

175

00:06:45,730  -->  00:06:48,550
and layers of visualization into R

176

00:06:48,550  -->  00:06:51,490
plot and there we go. That's the

177

00:06:51,490  -->  00:06:53,200
challenge for today, don't forget to

178

00:06:53,200  -->  00:06:55,270
check out the solution in the separate

179

00:06:55,270  -->  00:06:56,680
section at the end of the course and I

180

00:06:56,680  -->  00:06:58,570
wish you the best of luck and until next

181

00:06:58,570  -->  00:07:10,389
time, happy coding.
