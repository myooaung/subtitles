00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.200
Hello and welcome to the course on R

2

00:00:07.200  -->  00:00:09.510
programming. I'm super excited that you

3

00:00:09.510  -->  00:00:11.490
decided to join and I can promise you

4

00:00:11.490  -->  00:00:13.230
right now that in this course you will

5

00:00:13.230  -->  00:00:15.690
learn a lot and we will have tons of fun

6

00:00:15.690  -->  00:00:17.970
along the way and I have designed this

7

00:00:17.970  -->  00:00:20.310
course specifically to address a pain

8

00:00:20.310  -->  00:00:22.859
point that I personally had when I was

9

00:00:22.859  -->  00:00:25.050
studying R programming and that is the

10

00:00:25.050  -->  00:00:27.150
fact that this language has a very steep

11

00:00:27.150  -->  00:00:28.890
learning curve and the courses out there

12

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:30.810
just throw you in the deep end right

13

00:00:30.810  -->  00:00:33.480
away and it's very hard to actually sit

14

00:00:33.480  -->  00:00:36.809
down and get this language going and

15

00:00:36.809  -->  00:00:39.719
understand it very well so that you can

16

00:00:39.719  -->  00:00:41.370
apply it in your work.

17

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:42.719
So this course is structured differently,

18

00:00:42.719  -->  00:00:44.370
this course will take you step-by-step

19

00:00:44.370  -->  00:00:47.100
through everything in R and like all

20

00:00:47.100  -->  00:00:49.170
my other courses you will learn

21

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:51.899
gradually with lots of examples, with

22

00:00:51.899  -->  00:00:54.000
applying your knowledge to real-world

23

00:00:54.000  -->  00:00:56.489
problem and you will learn the spiral

24

00:00:56.489  -->  00:00:58.680
structure so everything you learn you

25

00:00:58.680  -->  00:01:00.750
won't just move away from that. In

26

00:01:00.750  -->  00:01:02.969
the coming tutorials after that, we will

27

00:01:02.969  -->  00:01:05.549
concrete that knowledge in because we'll

28

00:01:05.549  -->  00:01:07.950
practice and reiterate it and we will

29

00:01:07.950  -->  00:01:10.290
build on existing knowledge. So that way,

30

00:01:10.290  -->  00:01:12.119
everything you'll learn, you will get to

31

00:01:12.119  -->  00:01:14.790
keep and take away after this course and

32

00:01:14.790  -->  00:01:16.409
what I want to do in this tutorial is I

33

00:01:16.409  -->  00:01:18.060
just want to quickly show you around the

34

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:19.650
section of the course so you can

35

00:01:19.650  -->  00:01:21.869
navigate your way better and then we'll

36

00:01:21.869  -->  00:01:24.840
dive straight into installing R and

37

00:01:24.840  -->  00:01:28.200
let's jump to the presentation of the

38

00:01:28.200  -->  00:01:30.540
sections of the course now. Alright, so

39

00:01:30.540  -->  00:01:32.610
here's the course and now if I scroll a little bit

40

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:35.850
down to the sections we will see section

41

00:01:35.850  -->  00:01:38.040
one here. So section one hit the ground

42

00:01:38.040  -->  00:01:40.079
running, here we've got the lecture one

43

00:01:40.079  -->  00:01:42.000
which is the lecture we're in right now

44

00:01:42.000  -->  00:01:44.430
and then we're going to install R in

45

00:01:44.430  -->  00:01:46.110
our studio, and I'll show you how to do

46

00:01:46.110  -->  00:01:49.290
that both on mac and pc and finally

47

00:01:49.290  -->  00:01:51.119
we've got an exercise. A super quick

48

00:01:51.119  -->  00:01:53.040
exercise to get you excited about this

49

00:01:53.040  -->  00:01:55.950
course, to show you all of the powerful

50

00:01:55.950  -->  00:01:57.810
things you will learn towards the end of the

51

00:01:57.810  -->  00:01:58.259
course.

52

00:01:58.259  -->  00:01:59.790
Yes, you will be able to really perform

53

00:01:59.790  -->  00:02:01.500
there. I highly recommend doing this

54

00:02:01.500  -->  00:02:04.350
exercise. You will see how much power R

55

00:02:04.350  -->  00:02:05.610
has and then throughout the course

56

00:02:05.610  -->  00:02:07.950
you'll actually learn in detail exactly

57

00:02:07.950  -->  00:02:11.610
what you did in lecture 3. So pretty

58

00:02:11.610  -->  00:02:13.200
interesting lecture over there

59

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:15.300
and then we've got section two, core

60

00:02:15.300  -->  00:02:18.599
programming principles and here this

61

00:02:18.599  -->  00:02:21.209
section is designed to introduce you to

62

00:02:21.209  -->  00:02:22.709
programming if you've never programmed

63

00:02:22.709  -->  00:02:25.170
before. So feel free to skip it, if you

64

00:02:25.170  -->  00:02:27.209
have programmed before or maybe just

65

00:02:27.209  -->  00:02:29.430
proceed straight to the homework for

66

00:02:29.430  -->  00:02:32.069
this section because it's quite

67

00:02:32.069  -->  00:02:34.140
interesting. It's got some statistical

68

00:02:34.140  -->  00:02:35.790
knowledge combined with programming, if

69

00:02:35.790  -->  00:02:37.650
you haven't ever program before then no

70

00:02:37.650  -->  00:02:38.280
worries,

71

00:02:38.280  -->  00:02:39.930
this section will get you up to speed

72

00:02:39.930  -->  00:02:41.730
with everything you need to know to

73

00:02:41.730  -->  00:02:43.980
master the rest of the course and learn

74

00:02:43.980  -->  00:02:46.920
R. Then we're moving on to fundamentals

75

00:02:46.920  -->  00:02:49.319
of R, so R is a very specific type of

76

00:02:49.319  -->  00:02:51.390
programming language. It is all

77

00:02:51.390  -->  00:02:53.730
vectorized and here that's what we're

78

00:02:53.730  -->  00:02:54.840
going to talk about. We're going to talk

79

00:02:54.840  -->  00:02:58.590
about vectorized operations and how to

80

00:02:58.590  -->  00:03:01.860
access elements of vectors and functions

81

00:03:01.860  -->  00:03:04.590
packages and so on and basically that's

82

00:03:04.590  -->  00:03:06.690
what the sections about. It's about the

83

00:03:06.690  -->  00:03:08.970
specifics of this programming language.

84

00:03:08.970  -->  00:03:11.280
Alright, then we're moving onto

85

00:03:11.280  -->  00:03:14.730
matrices, so matrices are multi

86

00:03:14.730  -->  00:03:17.940
dimensional objects that might be

87

00:03:17.940  -->  00:03:20.160
something, a complicated topic but it's

88

00:03:20.160  -->  00:03:22.079
actually a very simple and more over

89

00:03:22.079  -->  00:03:23.850
here we've got a very interesting data

90

00:03:23.850  -->  00:03:26.010
set we talk about basketball trends so

91

00:03:26.010  -->  00:03:27.209
we're going to be looking at the top

92

00:03:27.209  -->  00:03:30.480
page players of the NBA and we're going

93

00:03:30.480  -->  00:03:31.739
to have a matrix, we are going to learn how

94

00:03:31.739  -->  00:03:33.269
to work with it at the same time we're

95

00:03:33.269  -->  00:03:35.250
already going to be deriving very

96

00:03:35.250  -->  00:03:36.959
valuable insights and we're going to

97

00:03:36.959  -->  00:03:39.090
have a lot of fun in this section. I

98

00:03:39.090  -->  00:03:40.650
can't wait for you to check it out

99

00:03:40.650  -->  00:03:43.380
actually, then a section 5 data frames

100

00:03:43.380  -->  00:03:44.549
and what are we talking about here?

101

00:03:44.549  -->  00:03:46.859
Well data frames are kind of a step up

102

00:03:46.859  -->  00:03:48.959
from matrices and this is the main

103

00:03:48.959  -->  00:03:52.950
section for data science. So every time

104

00:03:52.950  -->  00:03:54.420
you're going to be working with data

105

00:03:54.420  -->  00:03:56.459
it's like ninety-nine percent of times

106

00:03:56.459  -->  00:03:57.540
going to data from, so it's very

107

00:03:57.540  -->  00:04:00.989
important sections to know all this all

108

00:04:00.989  -->  00:04:02.280
these things and skills that we're

109

00:04:02.280  -->  00:04:03.090
talking about

110

00:04:03.090  -->  00:04:04.650
and again we're going to have a very

111

00:04:04.650  -->  00:04:06.900
interesting topic. We're going to be

112

00:04:06.900  -->  00:04:09.569
talking about demographic analysis. We're

113

00:04:09.569  -->  00:04:12.180
going to be working from with some data

114

00:04:12.180  -->  00:04:14.220
from the world bank, so that's going to

115

00:04:14.220  -->  00:04:16.260
be fun and then we've got advanced

116

00:04:16.260  -->  00:04:18.239
visualization. So here you will learn how

117

00:04:18.239  -->  00:04:22.150
to visualize your data sets and how to

118

00:04:22.150  -->  00:04:24.190
portray those inside that you want to

119

00:04:24.190  -->  00:04:25.930
convey to your audience in a very

120

00:04:25.930  -->  00:04:28.810
graphical manner so that it's easier to

121

00:04:28.810  -->  00:04:30.789
understand them and there's a very

122

00:04:30.789  -->  00:04:33.370
interesting concept about visualization in

123

00:04:33.370  -->  00:04:36.789
R. It's very layered type of

124

00:04:36.789  -->  00:04:38.380
visualization, so we'll be working

125

00:04:38.380  -->  00:04:40.720
with the GGPlot2 package and you'll

126

00:04:40.720  -->  00:04:43.120
learn all about it and also I'll shoot

127

00:04:43.120  -->  00:04:46.180
myriads of different visualizations that

128

00:04:46.180  -->  00:04:48.190
you can use and we will walk through

129

00:04:48.190  -->  00:04:49.780
them and again we're going to have a

130

00:04:49.780  -->  00:04:51.039
very interesting data sets, we're going

131

00:04:51.039  -->  00:04:53.320
to be talking about movie ratings and

132

00:04:53.320  -->  00:04:54.850
we're going to see how the audience

133

00:04:54.850  -->  00:04:56.770
rates movies, how critics make great

134

00:04:56.770  -->  00:04:58.840
movies, drive some insights that in fact

135

00:04:58.840  -->  00:05:00.910
when I was preparing this section, I

136

00:05:00.910  -->  00:05:02.590
found some things that I didn't know

137

00:05:02.590  -->  00:05:05.320
personally. I was like wow! That is so cool so

138

00:05:05.320  -->  00:05:07.060
you're going to have a lot of fun in

139

00:05:07.060  -->  00:05:08.830
this section. In fact, in any section of the

140

00:05:08.830  -->  00:05:10.180
course you're going to have a lot of fun

141

00:05:10.180  -->  00:05:11.860
and finally we've got the homework solutions,

142

00:05:11.860  -->  00:05:14.289
so in the section of the course,

143

00:05:14.289  -->  00:05:15.760
you'll find homework exercises so you

144

00:05:15.760  -->  00:05:17.410
can come here and then check the

145

00:05:17.410  -->  00:05:21.039
solutions of of the homework exercises

146

00:05:21.039  -->  00:05:21.940
when you're done.

147

00:05:21.940  -->  00:05:24.070
So there we go, that's how the course is

148

00:05:24.070  -->  00:05:25.479
structured don't forget that there are

149

00:05:25.479  -->  00:05:27.460
quizzes at the end of every section so

150

00:05:27.460  -->  00:05:30.400
look into those. Those will also help you keep

151

00:05:30.400  -->  00:05:32.199
on track and refresh knowledge that

152

00:05:32.199  -->  00:05:35.020
you just learned and I can't wait to see

153

00:05:35.020  -->  00:05:36.310
on the next tutorial.

154

00:05:36.310  -->  00:05:51.670
Until next time, happy coding.
