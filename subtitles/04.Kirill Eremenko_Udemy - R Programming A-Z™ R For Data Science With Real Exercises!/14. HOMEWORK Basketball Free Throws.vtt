00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course R

2

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:09.900
programming. We had a very exciting

3

00:00:09.900  -->  00:00:12.780
section just now on matrices and we

4

00:00:12.780  -->  00:00:14.700
talked about basketball and now we've got

5

00:00:14.700  -->  00:00:16.470
the homework exercise for the section

6

00:00:16.470  -->  00:00:18.570
where we will continue talking about

7

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:21.720
basketball. We will investigate free throws.

8

00:00:21.720  -->  00:00:23.490
Alright, so let's have a look. What is a

9

00:00:23.490  -->  00:00:25.109
free throw to start off with?

10

00:00:25.109  -->  00:00:27.000
Well a free throw is a bit different to

11

00:00:27.000  -->  00:00:29.880
a field goal or a field goal attempt in

12

00:00:29.880  -->  00:00:32.070
basketball. A free-throw, you can see an

13

00:00:32.070  -->  00:00:34.920
example here is when there's like a

14

00:00:34.920  -->  00:00:37.380
foul that happened during the play

15

00:00:37.380  -->  00:00:40.260
then that to team that was the victim

16

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:43.500
gets an opportunity to throw in a free

17

00:00:43.500  -->  00:00:45.840
throw or a couple of them and basically

18

00:00:45.840  -->  00:00:48.539
every free-throw in basketball is worth one

19

00:00:48.539  -->  00:00:51.090
point and the player has to stand where

20

00:00:51.090  -->  00:00:53.070
basically this player is standing in

21

00:00:53.070  -->  00:00:54.059
this example. That's pretty much

22

00:00:54.059  -->  00:00:56.760
everything we need to know. So they're

23

00:00:56.760  -->  00:00:59.219
kind of the additional types of goals

24

00:00:59.219  -->  00:01:01.829
that teams can score. They're not just

25

00:01:01.829  -->  00:01:03.660
field goals what that happened during

26

00:01:03.660  -->  00:01:05.549
the play, these are kind of like

27

00:01:05.549  -->  00:01:07.860
penalties and soccer something like that.

28

00:01:07.860  -->  00:01:11.430
Ok so now let's move on to the challenge,

29

00:01:11.430  -->  00:01:13.590
so you have been supplied data for two

30

00:01:13.590  -->  00:01:15.960
more additional in game statistics. Free

31

00:01:15.960  -->  00:01:18.479
throws and free throw attempts, you need

32

00:01:18.479  -->  00:01:20.580
to create three plots that portray the

33

00:01:20.580  -->  00:01:22.650
following insights. Free-throw attempts

34

00:01:22.650  -->  00:01:24.780
per game so how many free throws have

35

00:01:24.780  -->  00:01:26.729
the players been getting per each game

36

00:01:26.729  -->  00:01:29.070
we've been playing. Accuracy of free

37

00:01:29.070  -->  00:01:30.960
throws, so that is similar to the field

38

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:32.040
goal accuracy that we've been

39

00:01:32.040  -->  00:01:35.369
calculating and player playing style 2

40

00:01:35.369  -->  00:01:37.560
verses three-point preference excluding

41

00:01:37.560  -->  00:01:38.670
free throws.

42

00:01:38.670  -->  00:01:40.079
So remember we have already spoken about

43

00:01:40.079  -->  00:01:42.659
the playing style. We calculate the ratio

44

00:01:42.659  -->  00:01:46.170
of points, two field goals but then we

45

00:01:46.170  -->  00:01:49.500
said that it wasn't exactly the correct

46

00:01:49.500  -->  00:01:52.049
calculation because the point's still

47

00:01:52.049  -->  00:01:53.640
included free throws.

48

00:01:53.640  -->  00:01:55.140
Well now we have an opportunity to

49

00:01:55.140  -->  00:01:56.820
exclude free throws and that's exactly

50

00:01:56.820  -->  00:02:00.090
what is being asked of us in this third

51

00:02:00.090  -->  00:02:02.549
part of the challenge and the star here

52

00:02:02.549  -->  00:02:03.960
or the asterisk says that each

53

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:05.490
free-throws worth one point so that's

54

00:02:05.490  -->  00:02:08.399
important because then you don't need to

55

00:02:08.399  -->  00:02:10.500
multiply by anything so basically a

56

00:02:10.500  -->  00:02:13.290
successful free-throw is a point

57

00:02:13.290  -->  00:02:15.420
that needs to be subtracted and the

58

00:02:15.420  -->  00:02:17.400
data has been supplied in the form

59

00:02:17.400  -->  00:02:19.799
of vectors, you will have to create the

60

00:02:19.799  -->  00:02:21.750
two matrices before you proceed with the

61

00:02:21.750  -->  00:02:23.849
analysis. So previously we're supplied

62

00:02:23.849  -->  00:02:26.099
code that created the matrices for us.

63

00:02:26.099  -->  00:02:27.659
This time we're only gonna supply the vectors

64

00:02:27.659  -->  00:02:28.709
that will have to create the matrices

65

00:02:28.709  -->  00:02:30.209
and that's good because that will give

66

00:02:30.209  -->  00:02:32.700
us an opportunity to practice binding

67

00:02:32.700  -->  00:02:34.530
vectors in two matrices.

68

00:02:34.530  -->  00:02:36.629
Ok so that's the challenge, let's go have

69

00:02:36.629  -->  00:02:38.819
a look at where to get the data set. The

70

00:02:38.819  -->  00:02:41.939
data set is as usual at superdatascience.com/rcourse,

71

00:02:41.939  -->  00:02:44.340
so if you scroll

72

00:02:44.340  -->  00:02:47.549
down here to section 4 matrices, you'll

73

00:02:47.549  -->  00:02:50.129
see the homework data set that's the one

74

00:02:50.129  -->  00:02:52.079
we need also homework challenge is the

75

00:02:52.079  -->  00:02:53.879
document what that we just walked

76

00:02:53.879  -->  00:02:56.879
through. So now I'm going to go to R

77

00:02:56.879  -->  00:03:00.090
studio and this is the file once you

78

00:03:00.090  -->  00:03:01.739
unzip it and open it in R

79

00:03:01.739  -->  00:03:03.510
studio, this is what it looks like.

80

00:03:03.510  -->  00:03:05.310
So once again here it says that you have

81

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:06.989
been supplied the vectors you'll need to

82

00:03:06.989  -->  00:03:09.689
create the matrices, some copyright and

83

00:03:09.689  -->  00:03:11.519
some other information and then finally

84

00:03:11.519  -->  00:03:13.049
we've got to the vector. So we've got the

85

00:03:13.049  -->  00:03:15.269
seasons vectors, vector the players

86

00:03:15.269  -->  00:03:17.159
vector and then we get the free throws

87

00:03:17.159  -->  00:03:18.780
vectors and as you can see here there is

88

00:03:18.780  -->  00:03:20.669
no matrix, no code for the matrix. You

89

00:03:20.669  -->  00:03:22.709
need to populate this code on your own

90

00:03:22.709  -->  00:03:25.199
so basically you need to find a way to

91

00:03:25.199  -->  00:03:27.840
turn these vectors into a matrix and you

92

00:03:27.840  -->  00:03:31.049
probably going to need a function

93

00:03:31.049  -->  00:03:34.049
something like a bind function to bind

94

00:03:34.049  -->  00:03:37.079
these vectors into rows that's a little

95

00:03:37.079  -->  00:03:40.650
hint and also for the free-throw

96

00:03:40.650  -->  00:03:42.000
attempts. So once you have those two

97

00:03:42.000  -->  00:03:44.280
matrices then just quickly check them

98

00:03:44.280  -->  00:03:47.400
and then proceeded to calculating the

99

00:03:47.400  -->  00:03:50.129
desires statistics that we just talked

100

00:03:50.129  -->  00:03:51.659
about. So there we go, if you're

101

00:03:51.659  -->  00:03:53.489
comfortable with this challenge then

102

00:03:53.489  -->  00:03:55.799
please proceed with it. It's pretty

103

00:03:55.799  -->  00:03:57.599
straightforward very similar to what

104

00:03:57.599  -->  00:04:00.299
we've already done and at the same time

105

00:04:00.299  -->  00:04:02.609
you will find some very valuable and

106

00:04:02.609  -->  00:04:04.229
interesting insight.

107

00:04:04.229  -->  00:04:06.239
However, as always I would like to give

108

00:04:06.239  -->  00:04:08.760
you a hint if you would like some

109

00:04:08.760  -->  00:04:10.379
additional information on how to proceed

110

00:04:10.379  -->  00:04:12.870
then stick around and now I'm going to

111

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:14.519
bring up the hints.

112

00:04:14.519  -->  00:04:18.840
Ok so hint number one, very simple hint.

113

00:04:18.840  -->  00:04:21.150
The matrix calculation for part three

114

00:04:21.150  -->  00:04:25.530
is points minus free throws divided by field goals.

115

00:04:25.530  -->  00:04:28.260
So it's quite straightforward and what's

116

00:04:28.260  -->  00:04:30.000
going on here, we're taking previously

117

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:32.250
we just had points divided by field goals and that

118

00:04:32.250  -->  00:04:34.350
wasn't exactly correct but now we're

119

00:04:34.350  -->  00:04:36.180
just going to take points and subtract

120

00:04:36.180  -->  00:04:37.200
free throws because we know that

121

00:04:37.200  -->  00:04:39.870
free-throws attempts are the attempts that

122

00:04:39.870  -->  00:04:42.210
they made. Free throws are the successful

123

00:04:42.210  -->  00:04:44.430
free throws and every free throw is

124

00:04:44.430  -->  00:04:46.980
equal to one point. So if we subtract the

125

00:04:46.980  -->  00:04:48.900
number of points generated by free

126

00:04:48.900  -->  00:04:49.470
throws,

127

00:04:49.470  -->  00:04:51.660
this is this matrix over here. We

128

00:04:51.660  -->  00:04:54.660
subtract it from the actual point matrix

129

00:04:54.660  -->  00:04:57.570
and then what we have left will be the

130

00:04:57.570  -->  00:05:00.780
points generated only by field goals

131

00:05:00.780  -->  00:05:03.480
right? So only by two-point shots and

132

00:05:03.480  -->  00:05:05.460
three point shots and then if we divide

133

00:05:05.460  -->  00:05:07.380
that by the number of field goals and

134

00:05:07.380  -->  00:05:09.120
this matrix excuse us the number of

135

00:05:09.120  -->  00:05:11.310
successful field goals so if we divide

136

00:05:11.310  -->  00:05:13.350
the point generated by field goals by

137

00:05:13.350  -->  00:05:15.330
the number of field goals then we'll get

138

00:05:15.330  -->  00:05:17.760
the average points that the player got

139

00:05:17.760  -->  00:05:21.390
for their field goals in that year, right?

140

00:05:21.390  -->  00:05:22.950
And then we'll be able to observe the

141

00:05:22.950  -->  00:05:24.840
trends, so this is the matrix operation

142

00:05:24.840  -->  00:05:27.360
that you need for part three of the

143

00:05:27.360  -->  00:05:28.020
challenge.

144

00:05:28.020  -->  00:05:29.850
There we go that's there's a bit of

145

00:05:29.850  -->  00:05:32.700
guidance for this challenge and now if

146

00:05:32.700  -->  00:05:33.750
you're ready to proceed with challenge

147

00:05:33.750  -->  00:05:36.300
please go ahead and otherwise stick

148

00:05:36.300  -->  00:05:38.040
around and I'm going to show you where

149

00:05:38.040  -->  00:05:40.919
to get the fill in the blanks exercise

150

00:05:40.919  -->  00:05:43.890
as always so we're moving on to hint number

151

00:05:43.890  -->  00:05:46.890
two which is our fill in the blanks.

152

00:05:46.890  -->  00:05:49.830
Okay so we need to go to once again

153

00:05:49.830  -->  00:05:52.410
superdatascience.com/rcourse

154

00:05:52.410  -->  00:05:54.360
and here

155

00:05:54.360  -->  00:05:55.979
section 4, you'll see fill-in-the-blanks

156

00:05:55.979  -->  00:05:58.500
exercise. So if you open that up,

157

00:05:58.500  -->  00:06:00.570
unzip it, and open it in R studio. It

158

00:06:00.570  -->  00:06:02.370
looks like this, so here I've prepared

159

00:06:02.370  -->  00:06:04.740
some code which you can populate using

160

00:06:04.740  -->  00:06:06.870
what you've learned in this section and

161

00:06:06.870  -->  00:06:10.500
so this part creates the matrix. So this

162

00:06:10.500  -->  00:06:12.810
bit is basically what needs to actually

163

00:06:12.810  -->  00:06:15.780
go in here into where you're required to

164

00:06:15.780  -->  00:06:17.370
create the matrix. I'll just put in a separate

165

00:06:17.370  -->  00:06:20.160
file, so basically this is creating the

166

00:06:20.160  -->  00:06:21.930
matrix and it's got all the comments here

167

00:06:21.930  -->  00:06:23.520
then you check the matrix and you create

168

00:06:23.520  -->  00:06:25.650
other matrix for the free-throw attempts

169

00:06:25.650  -->  00:06:27.960
and then you check the matrix and then

170

00:06:27.960  -->  00:06:29.880
you need to recreate your plotting

171

00:06:29.880  -->  00:06:31.229
function because we'll be using that,

172

00:06:31.229  -->  00:06:33.599
then you can just visualize the matrices

173

00:06:33.599  -->  00:06:36.150
just quickly and then we've got the part

174

00:06:36.150  -->  00:06:37.979
1, part 2, part 3 and I've actually put in

175

00:06:37.979  -->  00:06:38.969
a lot of comments this

176

00:06:38.969  -->  00:06:41.219
