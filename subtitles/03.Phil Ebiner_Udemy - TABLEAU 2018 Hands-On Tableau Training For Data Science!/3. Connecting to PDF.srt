00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,940
Hello and welcome back to the course on tumblr in today's tutorial We'll look at how to connect to PTF

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,110
documents from within Tablo.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,480
I know the previous lectures were a lot of talking but today we actually get to doing.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,850
And I'm super excited about this topic because now we are able to connect to PDA documents and this

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,080
has been personally one of my challenges in the past.

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,280
Who gets provided a PDA of document and also to analyze it.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,370
All right but let's jump into Tablo and have a look at how this works.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,370
Now you'll notice the PTF file connection other than normal connection options.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,490
So we'll collect that and we will use our N.Y.C. Paul crime stats PTF fall.

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,030
Now immediately you'll notice something different as when we are connected to our previous falls it

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,720
provides.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,910
It opens up with a page picture.

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,340
Now this page because allows us to specify which single pages we want to use or a range of pages.

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,610
And in our case we will be using all but this is super handy if you remember the example we had of when

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,750
a table was on a specific table.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,970
Then we can specify that over there.

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,170
It's also very important to note that we may be working with page numbers in.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,400
And I'll just open up our PDA fall is that Tablo uses the absolute page number reference.

19
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,090
And that's what you'll find here in your PDA reader.

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,410
Do be careful when using the page number on the sheet as that might differ from the actual absolute

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,220
number of friends over there.

22
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,800
Because sometimes in reports you will find that the first few pages are just an introduction or some

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,320
images and the actual report only starts on later pages.

24
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,800
So do be careful and only focus on that.

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,470
This will save you a lot of time and problems going forward.

26
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,170
Trust me.

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,770
But back to Tablo So we will just be selecting all of the pages because all of our data is located on

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,000
all pages and immediately you'll see that Tablo has interpreted the PDA fall and created a whole number

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,290
of different tables.

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,950
But let's unpack that quickly.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,470
We can see that we've got each page one or two different tables and we'll have a closer look but that's

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,860
just to indicate that Tablo has interpreted the data on the table or the data on the page rather in

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,910
two different possible formats.

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,540
Let's take page one table 1 and have a look what that looks like.

35
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,020
And as you can see this looks familiar to what we had with Excel files earlier the way some of the data

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,960
is not properly orating it's also iterating some of the information and therefore quite a bit messy

37
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,560
at the moment.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
But just like we clean our Excel files we are able to use the data interpreter to clean the PTF document

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,860
or allow Tablo apply some logic to see if it can clean this fall for us so let's use that let's stick

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,760
the used data interpreter and as magic and as we've seen this for Excel falls Tablo is able to identify

41
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,770
it correctly and put the right names into the right columns with the right correct data.

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,590
Now what you'll see we've got all the parks running down we've got 14 records and this does look complete

43
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,570
but let's look at what is in table 2 then.

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,270
So if we go to table we have a look at Table 2 and still using the data interpreter.

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,820
You will see that we have much less records so tableaus only Intifadas nonrecourse to be ready and we

46
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,480
know for a fact when we look at our actual PTF fall.

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,470
There's more than nine lines.

48
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,200
They are actually 49 so you can count them by the way but Tablo has been saying all these things saying

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,490
that in this method number two it's needed to find nine lines so that different it does not look correct

50
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,200
and we won't be using the second interpretation that's at back.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,290
The first one.

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,440
And we're always using the interpreter.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,650
It's good to check your data quality or you can trace your data it's complete.

54
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,530
So let's click on the Revera results just to make sure there aren't any funnies that happened to him.

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,530
Tablo was in was interpreting this.

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,750
Now we've worked with us before so we'll skip that first part but what we can see is that tableaus correctly

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,270
identified the hidden in red and all of the lines correctly and you'll see there's nothing at the bottom

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,730
so it's connected to all the lines.

59
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,570
And as I mentioned to you they are basically 49 different lines in our data.

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,190
Perfect.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,580
So we know that is complete and correct.

62
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,290
But obviously we don't only want the first page we want all of the remaining pages as well.

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,380
So to do that we'll just hold down the control button and click on the first table only of each page.

64
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,120
So ignoring page 2 because we know that the first method of importing the data is correct.

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,150
And what you might want to do in the dead interpreter is also just to confirm that I have actually already

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,700
checked that.

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,870
And that is complete.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,690
But yes we want to add these different tables from these pages.

69
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,830
So how do we do that.

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,230
We don't want to join them so if we drag them straight into our area over there it would join them.

71
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,060
We actually just want to open them or rather a union name.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,560
So how you do that is once it's all selected you just drag it over into this pain and you hold it close

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,690
to the page one level one that's already there.

74
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,890
You'll see it opens up a and drop area for us an area to basically track the tables to union and make

75
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,450
sure that it turns orange so that it is actually dropping it in there and not next to it.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,620
So once you drop it in sublevel do a few calculations and it will actually add the number of records

77
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,170
you can see we've got a thousand.

78
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,250
We can just make it a bit more make the limit a bit more by just adding a few zeros.

79
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,380
And now we end up with 1155 rows so we think that this is all of the records.

80
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,710
But we will check that what has happened is that Tablo has added an A for one field and that might seem

81
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,380
strange because we know we didn't we didn't have that in the first page in first table.

82
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,980
But if we scroll down and have a look we can see that this is simply the POK name way in some cases

83
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,010
it didn't incorrectly or it didn't correctly identify that.

84
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:57,620
So we can fix that quite simply we just click on bauk it hole hold while holding control down click

85
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,270
on F1 and from the dropdown select may merge mismatched fields.

86
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,340
It would then throw the NOS away and populate them with the correct value.

87
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,060
That was actually used.

88
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,090
So you can see if we scroll through not all of the parks have names and if one has disappeared and was

89
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,740
merged in there I am actually just going to change this.

90
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,530
I just want to call it back and then clean up the fall a little bit because we don't want some of these

91
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,800
fields for instance sized We can hide.

92
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,650
We don't want any of these fields because we only work with a total so we can just hide them as well.

93
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,850
And I don't care about the table name.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,150
And let's give this a proper name let's call this incidence.

95
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,490
As the number of incidents reported.

96
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,880
So end up with three fields nicely cleaned file.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,460
However we did see that we've got a 1155 records.

98
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,380
And as we don't have a record count let me just get to that for once again if the fact that we don't

99
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,750
have the number of records in our fall but we do know we've got a total loss so we can consign back

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,250
to the total line.

101
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:09,340
So back to to our Tablo we could just open up a sheet and simply drag in the incidents into our area

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,340
over there and we can see that now at least 218 which does not seem correct at all.

103
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:23,440
So if you go back to our data source we know that Tablo might interpret this total line actually also

104
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,190
as a record.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,240
So let's see if it has done that right at the bottom you can see Tablo has seen that as a normal record.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,840
And we know that is not a balk that's just a total.

107
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,800
So we can add a datasource filter to remove that.

108
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,540
So we can just click add by the filters add another one and go box.

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:48,090
So we want to basically full to the total line of the line with the total in Pawk.

110
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,390
So we will just basically say we will look for the total we will select that and say excuse.

111
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,540
This is just if we do refresh our data with new information that we add a new box being added that we

112
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,160
don't include total or we don't specify specific box but we just exclude any totals from there.

113
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,500
So we can hit OK it's OK once again we can see a number of rows obviously changed one place.

114
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,300
And now if we go into our sheet you'll see that we've got 109 records which is or rather 109 incidence

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,850
which is correct as we know from our PTF.

116
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,670
So as you can see a bit of cleanup is required and a bit of quality checks also when working with pedia

117
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,500
files but actually quite an easy way to connect to the false.

118
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,120
And this is for me.

119
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,040
Excellent then two purposes of sum up.

120
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,700
It's important to note that each belief document that you'll work with will have different clean up

121
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,540
procedures.

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,210
They might be additional steps required or even less steps.

123
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,720
It's all about how the data is interpreted by tabla.

124
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:57,910
Also important to note that tableau will have issues importing hierarchies and hater's subtotals multiple

125
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:04,090
rows of content that should be interpreted as one or any color and shading on your PDAF document can

126
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,990
affect how Tablo interpret the data.

127
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,000
So do be careful with that in the next Tauriel we'll be looking at another fall top which we are able

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,070
to connect to in Tablo now with a new Tablo connector.

129
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,630
Also a very exciting one in my opinion in any case.

130
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,670
But we will have a look at the file type and how we can best make use of them in Tablo.

131
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,420
I look forward to seeing you next time.

132
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,230
Until then happy analyzing.
