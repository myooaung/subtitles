00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.300
This is Carol and a warm welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.520
Happy to see you here.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.430
Last time we left off after creating our first calculated field which is total sales and you can see

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.800
it here on the left.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.970
I just wanted to mention that creating a calculated field is a very important aspect of working with

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.670
Tablo because you will often find that the data that you have does not have the right level or it does

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.310
not have the right variables for you to work or if it does have the information there but its not in

8
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.870
the right format its not aggregated properly or correctly for your needs or doesn't have the right level

9
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.570
of detail or or other things so you will be inevitably working a lot of calculated fields and this was

10
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.220
a very simple example of a calculated field where we just multiply two values but Tablo has very vast

11
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.020
functionality in this space and allows it to create just insanely helpful calculated fields and we will

12
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.280
be working with them to go forward.

13
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.130
So thats why I kind of put it at the beginning of the course so you get used to it going as we go along.

14
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.590
All right so today we're talking about colors.

15
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.560
Colors are important because as you probably hear me say quite often Dahdah science is not just about

16
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.900
crunching numbers.

17
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880
It's a form of art.

18
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.540
It's a form of communication.

19
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.020
It's it's a very creative activity or profession.

20
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.840
So get get used to work or colors you will you will need the skill.

21
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.460
OK so let's get straight into it.

22
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.940
How can we color this chart.

23
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.730
Imagine that this picture has to go into a presentation for the executives of the company who will be

24
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.150
distributing these bonuses or maybe even this picture will be

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.520
hung up somewhere on a wall so that everybody can see so you don't want it to be plain like this you

26
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.170
want it to be colorful and bright.

27
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.120
So we need to use this color button over here and there are many different ways that we can do it.

28
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.520
First of all where we can do right away is just change the color.

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.850
We can change it to red we can change to green we can change to basically any color.

30
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.150
And that's kind of the basic thing that you can do here.

31
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.220
Or you can choose more colors and then you can choose.

32
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.540
You can choose even more colors.

33
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.720
It's all it's all under control here.

34
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.070
What else you can do is you can change the transparency but there's nothing behind it so there's not

35
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:54.510
much point you can at a border make that border thicker I think or make that change the color of the

36
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.290
border if you want but we won't be doing that right now as well.

37
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.080
What we want.

38
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.760
We want kind of the colors to differ from bar to bar.

39
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.080
So the first thing you can do is you can take your representative and let's say from here and drag them

40
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.940
onto the collar button.

41
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.000
And what that will do is we'll give each representative a unique color and he'll give you a legend over

42
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.010
here.

43
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.430
And so as you can see the color legend matches your column names.

44
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.680
And so Matthew is blue Mathieu's blue here Susan's light blue light blue here as well.

45
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.660
I want to show you a quick tip here as well.

46
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.650
So by the way going forward I'll be showing you quick tips along the way which I will be using just

47
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.900
kind the cars are kind of a habit and I think you should get into the habit of using them too so just

48
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.890
keep track of when when I give out these quick tips because they will be very helpful.

49
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.880
So let's take out the rep and instead of taking a prisoner from here and dragging him onto the collar

50
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.060
what we can do is take a representative from here whole hold him as you know if I just drag him onto

51
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.500
the call now then I'll screw up the visualization because now he's no longer this column or this dimension

52
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.570
is no longer in the columns so I'm going to press controls that now what you need to do is you hold

53
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.360
him or hold this dimension you drag him and you press control.

54
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.500
And as you can see this little plus sign appears Andriy Amal's And then when you let go you basically

55
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.000
copy that dimension onto this new role and it's still in the columns.

56
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.090
So that's an easy way especially when you have like a hundred or hundreds maybe too much like 30 or

57
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.360
four dimensions here might be hard looking for it when you know exactly what you want.

58
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440
It's already on on your chart.

59
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.200
You just drag it like that with control.

60
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.250
OK.

61
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.260
So we've got the representative here and now if you're not happy with the colors we can just click colors

62
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.360
added colors and choose a different color palette.

63
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.140
So it has a lot of different color palettes that are already built in.

64
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.960
Right now it's using tablet 20 so you can say how about we go for purple gray 12 you click assigned

65
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.790
palette and now it's a sign of purple gray palette that looks pretty cool doesn't it.

66
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.650
Now we can also.

67
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:19.570
Another good one is colorblind so just to be cautious of people who might be called Blind just click

68
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.700
a sign pad there.

69
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.740
It will tell you that your colors are being duplicated because you have less colors than people but

70
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.660
you know that might be OK for you as long as you want because you do have the names underneath so might

71
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.720
not be a problem anyway.

72
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.350
I don't think this is the best way to color this chart.

73
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.040
Let's have a look another one so I'm going to I'm going to actually leave rep in color for now.

74
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.600
And what we'll do is we'll take some of total sales we'll press control and we'll drag that into color

75
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.090
as you can see.

76
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.060
Representative has been replaced and now some of total sales is dictating the color analysis.

77
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.750
It's not discrete color.

78
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.690
It's a continuous color.

79
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.940
And so the more cells you've had the darker you color the less cells you've had the lighter your color.

80
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.250
Also quite useful but in our case it's not the best because we already see the size of the bar and it

81
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.050
tells us how much cells each person has had.

82
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.570
So maybe maybe a different approach.

83
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.860
My favorite one in this particular case will be if I take region and I drag region onto color by the

84
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.080
way I'll just contrails at that you will see that I can also drag region QUANTRILL it and then replace

85
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.060
this current dimension that's in color or not even dimension.

86
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.520
This is a mirror.

87
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.240
So replace that.

88
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.700
And now you can see that your bars have been colored by region.

89
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:51.060
And I think personally to me this appeals the most because I can write a way visually see that these

90
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.880
are three distinct regions or are three distinct elements.

91
00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:02.880
And that kind of also backs the idea behind why there's three bonuses and that these people don't have

92
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.990
to be compared to these people and these people don't have to be compared to the rest of them.

93
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.530
And so personally I'll leave it at that.

94
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.580
And that's how you work with colors in Tablo.

95
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.320
We will definitely be talking more about colors along the way in this course.

96
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.130
This is just the basics and how to play around with that see what personally appeals to you the most.

97
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.740
And it's you know it's very individual preference so find find your style and I look forward to talking

98
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:39.280
to you next time when we'll be discussing labels and formatting making our chart look really appealing

99
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.950
and until next time.

100
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.670
Have you analyzed.
