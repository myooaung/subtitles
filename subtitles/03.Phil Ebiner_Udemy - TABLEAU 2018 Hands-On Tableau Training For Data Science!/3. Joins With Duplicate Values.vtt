Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.260
And in today's tutorial we will be looking at duplicates and joins.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.180
And by that we mean what happens when the column that we're joining on has duplicate values in one of

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.580
the tables.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.550
In today's example we'll be looking at two tables table A and Table B Table A lists orders that are

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.380
conducted for us and show up.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.560
It specifies their region and their status so whether they were unpaid or whether they were paid.

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.940
Table B list the same orders but an itemized description of those orders so in a list the order number

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.940
the item that was sold within that order and the sales that were generated through the sale of that

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.720
item.

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.990
And as you can see orders in Table B can be duplicated because some orders consist of several items

12
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.170
for example Order Number One consists of a chair and a desk.

13
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.160
And so we're going to be looking at an example of an inner join between these two tables so basically

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:11.090
we want to take the order number from table A and use that to join table a table B also an order number.

15
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.010
So basically we want to connect the status of the order where there was paid on paid to the item and

16
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.520
the sales of the order.

17
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.550
And currently this information is contained within two separate tables.

18
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.800
We want to bring it together.

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.080
From this image you can see that when we join the two tables on the order number there will be two matches

20
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.260
in the second table to order number one.

21
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.460
There will be one match in the second table to order number two.

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.250
There will be three matches to order number three in the second table.

23
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.670
And there is no matches 4 or number four or so because this is an inner join.

24
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.420
This row will be discarded from the final result and what will happen now is as you can see there's

25
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.530
less rows in the table left than on the table in the right so every time there is a multiple match the

26
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.860
rows that have been matched multiple times will be replicated so duplicated triplicated and so on.

27
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.750
So in this particular case the final table will look like this.

28
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.170
And as you can see here some rows of the table on the left have been duplicated to match the number

29
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.150
of rows and the table on the right and is completely normal.

30
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.300
So this is the way the final table will look in our output.

31
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.730
So that's what happens when there are duplicate values in the column that we're joining on.

32
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.760
I hope you enjoy today sectorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.
