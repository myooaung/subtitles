00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,460
Hello this is curial from superdad assigns dot com.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,480
And welcome back to the course on Tablo.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,520
So what's up with the timer you ask.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,790
Well the thing is that I'm super excited about you taking this course.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,100
In fact I'm so excited that I really really want you to get to the end and get the maximum value out

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,760
of this course and learn how to use tabel like a pro.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:31,040
And so therefore I've challenged myself to get you enthusiastic about this course in under five minutes

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,060
and that's exactly what we're going to do today.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,910
And I'll just give you a quick overview.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,070
We're going to look at a massive data set.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,090
And I will show you what you can do using the power of Tablo in a very very short limited time and I

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,820
hope that'll get you excited.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,750
All right let's get started.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,060
First of all we'll need a browser.

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm going to use Chrome and at the top just type in the address bar.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,380
You need to go to super Dahdah science dot com slash Tablo and that's where all the data sets for this

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,730
course are located.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,360
And here you can get the one for today.

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,120
It's called the superstore Yes.

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,380
So just download that.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,130
I'm going to save that into my Tablo coarse folder.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,290
That's good.

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,580
And let's bring on that folder.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,690
So there is the data set.

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,940
You don't need the browser anymore and we still have three minutes 45 seconds let's open the data set

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,770
and have a look.

27
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:32,780
So what this data center presents is a list of transactions for a store for 2015 from the start of the

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,250
year until now.

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,140
So for the first half of 2015.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,160
And here you can see every single transaction the store has made for this year.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,140
Akron's every transaction is represented by a row here.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,820
So for instance the row IDs tells you the number of the transaction the discount unit price shipping

33
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,210
cost customarily a lot a lot of information.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,170
And at the end here it's got the profit for this specific transaction.

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:07,970
So here for instance it's $4000 or minus $53 and it's also broken down in by column it says this is

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,140
all United States and we go to region state or province city.

37
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:18,130
And if you look at this data it's actually quite massive is gotte 1953 arrows.

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,530
And the question has been asked is can you quickly tell us what are the most profitable and the least

39
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,020
profitable States according to this data set and also plot us a map right now.

40
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,620
Create a map that will show us very quickly how the states are performing.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,960
And you have to do that in a very limited time in fact in under two and a half minutes.

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,270
So let's get straight at it.

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,350
It is going to close the Excel spreadsheet here close this folder and now I'm going to open Tablo and

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,090
we'll see how quickly we can do this.

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Two minutes left continue.

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,150
OK so just follow my steps.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,100
I won't explain every single step but through this course you will learn all of this and even more so

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,800
now we can connect our data source over here on the left click Excel find your data set double click

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,270
on it.

50
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,220
It's opened up now.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,980
Now on the left choose the orders tab and dragged into this whitespace and right away you can see a

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,930
preview of the spreadsheet appear in front of you.

53
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,560
Next click this orange part on here which says sheet 1.

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,860
And here you've got to Tablo workspace which right now is empty.

55
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,050
We need to put some stuff in here.

56
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,810
How much time.

57
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,510
1 minute 40 seconds OK let's do this.

58
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,470
All right so what are we going to do is we're going to find country and we're going to drag it in the

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,910
middle of this white space here.

60
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,350
Oh look at a map here.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,760
Wow.

62
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,060
Tablo is quite smart.

63
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,510
OK.

64
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,580
So now we're going to look for state or province.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,010
And we are also going to drag it onto the map.

66
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,670
Oh well look at all these dots appeared in the different states of the US.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,180
OK.

68
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,180
So what are we going to do now we're going to take profit because we were asked about profitability.

69
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,020
And we going to drag it onto color.

70
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,220
And next we're going to take profit arrogant Dragon also onto label.

71
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,340
Now we're going to click label and we're going to click the font and we're going to change the font

72
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,600
size to 12 and that's it.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,870
How much time do we have.

74
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,210
We have 58 seconds so that was all under four minutes.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,350
And what can we see here.

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,500
We can see that right away just by looking at this map.

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,220
It's so intuitive we didn't have to specify any colors or anything.

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,170
Right away we can see the least profitable state that will the most losses were incurred in North Carolina

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,470
and the most profitable state is California right away.

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,280
You can tell those things and also you can even give more insights according to the map.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,290
These southern states are not doing well in this region except for maybe Georgia and the northern states.

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,690
And over here the West and the Western states are doing better except for Montana.

83
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,820
And all of that was done in under five minutes.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,860
Hope you're super pumped super excited.

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,020
We will learn all of this in this course and much much more and you will definitely have fun through

86
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,430
the way I look forward to seeing you in the next session.

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,610
And until next time happy analyzing.
