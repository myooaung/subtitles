1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,510
A lot.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,380
Welcome back to your favorite course on Tablo.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,760
And today we're finally creating our very first dashboard.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,550
Hooray.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,160
Congrats on getting this far.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,470
It's going to be super super fun and you will see exactly how to create your first dashboard.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,100
It's going to be epic.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's get straight to it here we've got two tabs We've got two worksheets that were created.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,630
We've got the customer scatterplot and we've got the map of Europe.

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:42,910
So now how do we put them both together onto one dashboard that when somebody is analyzing he can see

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,140
them together.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,950
So to create a dashboard you need to click the second button over here which says new dashboard.

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:56,760
So let's go ahead and do that and right away we've got a dashboard one created.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,400
And as you can see it looks a bit different to a worksheet.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,610
It doesn't have dimensions and measures it's rather got the different worksheets that we have in our

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,070
tablet workbook and it's got some layout specific issues that you can choose like you can add images

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,740
you can add web pages text different horizontal vertical layouts.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,670
It's got.

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:29,110
You can make objects floating or tiled and it's got some other width and height parameters so it's more

20
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,040
of a visual kind of representation.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,790
We're no longer doing Tata mining or dot investigation and analysis.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:48,640
We are creating a very pretty powerful tool for somebody to do dot investigation using the dashboards

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
that or the worksheets that we've created.

24
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,280
So let's go ahead and do that now.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,370
The first thing that we are going to do is we're going to drag our worksheets onto the dashboard.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,010
So let's take the map of Europe and all you do is just drag it on here and right away you can see it's

27
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,740
filling up most of the space.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,600
And basically this dashboard is pretty much identical to our map of Europe.

29
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,940
We can roll a scroll over different states and all show different information.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,170
Now what we're going to do is we're going to add the scatterplot to this dashboard as well and we're

31
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,070
going to drag it.

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,820
And as you can see Tablo is giving you some suggestions where you want to put it.

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,660
So what we're going to do is we're going to put it here underneath our map and there we go.

34
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,400
So Tablo has put this dashboard under all map.

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,010
Now we obviously don't like these scroll around buttons here because they shouldn't be there.

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,310
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the map and we'll make it a little bit smaller so

37
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,130
if you make your map just a bit smaller and you go back to your dashboard you will see that slowly you're

38
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,010
kind of getting rid of those things.

39
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:05,690
So we still got this vertical one so let's make this smaller and maybe this a bit wider.

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,440
And maybe one more time.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,660
So we've still got both that like that.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,050
Then you can just drag it in the dashboard to fix it up.

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,990
Finally And there we go.

44
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,990
So we've got the map of Europe and the customers scatterplot both in this dashboard.

45
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,930
So obviously this now we're going to decide on what we want to leave what we don't want to see the sales

46
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,420
kind of size of the bubble.

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,160
It doesn't really help us because visually it's very hard to compare this legend to what we actually

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,580
see so let's get rid of it.

49
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,450
It's no point in having the profit margin.

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:54,230
Well kind of it's more the red and blue is more to show us kind of positive negatives we don't really

51
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,480
care about how the different like how they compare that.

52
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:06,030
This blue is exactly zero point 9 and this blue is 0.09 5.

53
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,210
We won't be able to see that before.

54
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,940
And same thing here it's more of an historical thing in this case because we already know that anything

55
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,490
below the horizontal line is actually bad.

56
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:23,570
So in this case aesthetical thing in this case is just so that our eyes are our attention is drawn towards

57
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,630
the red or the blue so we can quickly separate the good versus the bad and versus like the neutral which

58
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,770
are these gray ones.

59
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,060
So in reality we don't really need this college and so let's get rid of it too.

60
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,930
Of course we do need a year of order date.

61
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,990
And now what I wanted to show you is how to add this filter in case it's not there.

62
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,760
So let's let's assume that the filter wasn't there.

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,980
So yeah that's OK.

64
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:02,990
What happened there was I removed a I removed one of these containers.

65
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,250
So I'll just put it back.

66
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,060
So yeah that's probably another thing that's good.

67
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,290
Good to know you can add these containers so horizontal or vertical and that will help you split up

68
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,640
your dashboard into segments.

69
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,230
So in this case I added a vertical containers so that now I can put things into the container.

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,330
So here we've got two dashboards but we don't have that filter.

71
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,200
How do we add that filter in.

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,300
Well what we can do is we look at this dropdown for this for the map and here it says quick filters

73
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,540
and you can add the filter we had on your order date and same thing you could have done it through this

74
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,950
way you can go here quick filters and you can just choose a quick filter if you want to add.

75
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,430
So just going to actually close this because it's already create a container for me.

76
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,780
And with this quick filter once again you need to format it.

77
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,920
So just go what did we have single values slider.

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,070
And obviously we don't need all customized show all value taken off.

79
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,030
And there you go.

80
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,530
So they have a quick filter.

81
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,800
And as you can see as as you remember because we said for this filter to be applied to all worksheets.

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,850
So here you go apply two worksheets all using this data source so it's basically the same as what we've

83
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,760
said on the map of Europe and it's applying it to all what she's using not a source.

84
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:33,330
So now when you click around you will see that both of these charts or both of these worksheets are

85
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,330
being affected by the filter which is good which is consistent which means that we know that in both

86
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,730
cases we're looking at the same year rather than not knowing what year we're looking at in which of

87
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,530
these two worksheets.

88
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,970
So that's how you create your first dashboard.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,840
That's the concept behind it so drag and drop kind of style of operating in the next tutorial.

90
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,140
We will learn how to reduce some really cool stuff.

91
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:08,550
We will start doing looking at action filters so how to make each of these dashboards clickable so that

92
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,030
they interact with each other.

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,260
I'm making a dashboard interactive and we'll look at some other stuff as well in the section of the

94
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,940
course.

95
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,250
I look forward to seeing you next time.

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,080
And until then happy analyzing.
