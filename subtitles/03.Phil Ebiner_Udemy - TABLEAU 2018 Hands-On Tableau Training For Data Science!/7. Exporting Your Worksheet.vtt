00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.560
This is cool.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.980
And welcome back to the course on Tablo.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.220
And in today's tutorial we will learn how to export our worksheets as images for other files.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.660
All right.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.370
So we've got this beautiful report that's ready to go.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.510
How do we put it into a document like a PowerPoint or a Word document and so on.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.020
So one way is to take a snapshot and I knew a friend of mine he didn't know how to explore and he kept

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.410
taking snapshots just take like a print screen of this report and then you stick it into your file.

9
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.590
Well that's not the proper way to do it.

10
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.620
There's definitely a way to export files directly from Tablo.

11
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150
And today we're going to learn how.

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.790
So right away.

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.700
This is a worksheet as we discussed So if you go into worksheet and you go to export you go image you

14
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.980
can copy the image.

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.910
So this is going to close the eye because there's no way another way of doing it a bit faster.

16
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.120
You don't have to move your mouse all the way up there.

17
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.790
This is one of those tips and tricks so if you right click and you go copy you go image you get the

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.160
same menu.

19
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.910
So there's there's two ways to export.

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.180
So we all we need right now is the view with the title and the legend.

21
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.100
So we don't need the caption because we don't actually have a caption.

22
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
We haven't created one for this chart.

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.490
We'll talk about captions further in the course.

24
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.860
They're pretty easy so we'll take it out and we'll talk about this menu in a second as well so just

25
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.160
good copy.

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.370
Now let's bring up the document.

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.150
So let's say I want to export this image into a Word document.

28
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.040
So here I've got a Word document prepared.

29
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.620
The annual bonus report.

30
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.860
And I want to put the image in here so what you need to do is obviously Kontrol be or just right click

31
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.430
and paste and there you go.

32
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.430
So there's your image here.

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.610
So this underline is because I had underlined it with it.

34
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.460
So that's the image that blends in really well.

35
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.190
But what do we see about this image that is all right away.

36
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.810
Not good.

37
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.460
Wrong.

38
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.730
Well we see this name over here.

39
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.380
So what went wrong.

40
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.540
Why where did it come from.

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.600
Let's go back to Tablo to find out.

42
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220
If I click on Tablo you can see that there's no name here but sheet one.

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.900
Sounds familiar doesn't it.

44
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840
That's the name of the tab here.

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.030
So that remember when we exported the image.

46
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.570
So if we go to Right-Click And then when we go to copy image here it says title and title because actually

47
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.900
the name of the tab.

48
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.410
So you either have to unclick title or just change the name of the tab.

49
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.750
And so let's do that so I'll go into the name of the sheet.

50
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:12.110
I'm going to call that annual bonus analysis.

51
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:23.890
And now I want to see it here as well so I'll go to worksheet and click Show title.

52
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.890
So here now I can see the no bonus analysis name.

53
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.740
And that also gives me a power to change and format it.

54
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.970
So if I click here and I click for my title as you remember formatting pane pops up on the left and

55
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:45.820
I can actually oh sorry this doesn't allow you to change the size of the text so we're going to have

56
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220
to work on this a bit.

57
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.060
You need to double click on the title to be able to format the size of the text.

58
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.750
In this case it's 12 as bold so it's all right.

59
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.200
It's the same as the rest that we have here.

60
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.220
So just if you do need to change the format that's how you do it.

61
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.760
So I'll just click that.

62
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:14.880
And now we can right click copy image view title college and copy.

63
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.420
Now let's go back to our document.

64
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.140
Delete that and paste in our report.

65
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.670
Once again this underline get rid of it.

66
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.180
OK so here now you can see annual bonus report analysis at the top.

67
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.490
And that's good.

68
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.640
So that's pretty much ready ready to go.

69
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.080
You add some text for the executives and it's ready to be presented.

70
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.060
The only thing is if you want a bit more space you want to start to be a bit bigger than you want region

71
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.750
at the bottom and that way your child can expand to the right.

72
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.130
And that's what we will try to do now.

73
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.220
Right click right click copy image and color legend.

74
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.840
So here we'll put the college in at the bottom.

75
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.390
We'll choose that one.

76
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.410
Go back here and paste.

77
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.550
And as you can see the college is at the bottom and the chart has a bit more space so that's the other

78
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.280
way you can do that.

79
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.120
So that's pretty much done.

80
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.030
And so that sums it up for us for today.

81
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.790
I just wanted to tell you that we still haven't saved all workbooks so make sure you do so you go to

82
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.850
File Save As and obviously you know for the workbook it's Section 1.

83
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.740
Just make sure we keep it safe because it doesn't actually auto save your work and you want to keep

84
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.360
it for yourself for the future.

85
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.440
And that is it for this section.

86
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.810
I hope you enjoyed it very easy introduction to Tablo that was an easy data set but it did help us get

87
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:55.580
our head around a lot of things and we talked about navigating Tablo creating first calculated field

88
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.120
adding colors labels doing formatting.

89
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.270
So all of that together that's our base.

90
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.160
We're going to take that forward in the course.

91
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.100
But before you do proceed with the next lecture Do not forget to do the quiz.

92
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.490
It's right under this one.

93
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.790
It will help you make sure that you've covered everything that we talked about in the section.

94
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.420
I look forward to seeing you in the next section.

95
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.530
And until next time happy analyzing.
