00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,780
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo in today's tutorial we will finally create awesome visualization

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,830
and get to that deriving those insights.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,070
But let's take a step back for a moment and look at what we've actually achieved.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,160
So firstly we have been able to connect to a PDA fall a read only static fall and extract the data from

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,060
that obtained from an open source data provider.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,510
We have been able to combine that with special data which is not available with Intel blood beach or

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,860
pox and get the proper light out of each of these parks in terms of the size they form and also the

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,280
distribution around the city.

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,910
We've also managed to iron out a couple of data integrity issues which is of paramount importance.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,840
And therefore this was no easy feat and such a valuable skill to have learned.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,360
But let's get back to solving the business case.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,080
All right.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,090
We already have geometry onto our sheet.

14
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,120
Next we'll take the Pawk name and put that into detail.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,920
And the reason for that is at the moment it is just showing one big polygon and we need to actually

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,860
break it up so we can see where each of the different shapes starts and end.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,790
So we can just do that by adding it to the detail tab.

18
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,550
Now next we can also just take the incidents and add that color and make sure that that's some of incidence.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,450
And we know we want to just make it give it a bit more punch to it and let's use temperature diverging

20
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,320
take from a green to a red and immediately we can see where the box or the more problematic box.

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,000
All I do think that the borders are creating a bit of a you know if effect here which we don't want.

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,690
So let's just take the borders off.

23
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,720
And that looks much neater now we could even see that much smaller parks as well.

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,970
What we also do is just to take the city of Daraa put that on two fold up and we want to select all

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,850
of them because this will allow us if we do show the photo.

26
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,940
And let's just bring it over here.

27
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:09,060
It's also selected as a single dropdown but this will also allow us to navigate the city borough by

28
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,530
borough.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,210
As you can see as we scroll through them we can see what they're look like now how it works in New York

30
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,250
is that each city borough is funny enough.

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,010
Also a county within the state.

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,210
So what we could do is we can just use the map layers and also just take the county borders and that

33
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,320
would actually break them up quite nicely into different boroughs.

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,500
And on top of that we can select the county names but the county names funny enough is not exactly the

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
same as the borough names.

36
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,050
So for that reason the bill actually just Antek them.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,870
For instance if you look at Richmond over there that in any case it's actually the Staten Island although

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,090
it's called an ADA Staten Island So what we'll do is we'll just to avoid any confusion we'll take off

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:01,470
the county names and we can then just rename these using an alias and we can just update these aliases.

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,970
So if we keep areas over there we can take the update to Brooklyn.

41
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,690
Then two men.

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,970
Q To Queens on Staten Island.

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,310
You know that refers to Richmond and then good old Bronx and hit enter.

44
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,080
OK.

45
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:27,010
Now we are able to navigate city Barnabei City bar to see which parks have the most incidents.

46
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,780
Now seeing as we are able to navigate to these areas some of these parks have you know obviously that

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,600
color is adapted to the number of incidents.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,560
And this is not correct.

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,060
We want to keep the same color writing across all of them.

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,560
So if we go into color and just edit this we can just fix the start and end because we know the maximum

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,250
is six and the minimums zero and we can just hits a plot.

52
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,930
Now if we do go in again you can see that it's not that dog afraid raid that he used to be when we did

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,300
it.

54
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,230
The that was updated the color rating was updated for this specific focus or falter.

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,460
Let's also just update our sheet them over yet because what we want to cool those is the New York City

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,150
parks and we just want to put the borrower name in there so we can just pick it up from there instead

57
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,960
insert option over there with the city borough.

58
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,700
And we can actually just make that bold and weakening to decrease the size to 24 both of these.

59
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,910
And just a plus.

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,870
So if we do navigate between now we are able to see which one we are working with to arrive in the title.

61
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,280
So handy stuff as well.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,470
But I also like to do is in our map if you go into map options you're able to see the scale and obviously

63
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,700
want to say this to us as we work in the US.

64
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,440
So now you get a scale over there.

65
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,810
So if you are focusing on a specific area and you can see our changes on Staten Island the scallies

66
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,100
one mile and in Queens It's two miles so obviously depends on the size of your visualization then you're

67
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,540
able to relate on how far and how close each of these sections are.

68
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,530
Each of these talks to each other now you can also navigate the city by not only looking at this specific

69
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,100
borough but but just by zooming in and then immediately you can see even the smaller parks where they

70
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,730
have more of a number of incidents.

71
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,640
So pretty handy stuff indeed.

72
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,990
So pretty cool way to navigate this as well.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,520
And this also answers our brief that we've set out to do and I'm sure Atlanta will be super happy with

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,250
what we are delivering now.

75
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,670
That is how you connect and combine PBS special falls in your data import your data ensure data integrity

76
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,530
create custom Geographic polygons using data sources from open source platforms.

77
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,010
Pretty awesome stuff indeed.

78
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,970
And you can be really proud of yourself not in the next tutorial.

79
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,150
We'll be looking at a brand new business case.

80
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,260
And look at some improvements in Tablo relating to how we use to stirps and even look at a brand new

81
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,200
chart type.

82
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,290
I look forward to seeing you next time.

83
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,260
Until then happy analyzing.
