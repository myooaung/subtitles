00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and in the previous sections of this course we created

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,870
the dashboard.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,380
It's all ready to go.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,150
Fired up.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,330
Let's have a look at it and analyze how the different regions.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,400
What's happening in the different regions of the U.K. for this.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,400
So to get into it right away this is our customer base line.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's have a look at it.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,520
We know that most of our customers are in England.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,050
Then second place is Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:43,460
Now if you look at the breakdown by balance you'll see that it's dropping off gradually as first slowly

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,290
and then quite quickly and that is something that you would expect that the lower the balance band the

13
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,480
more customers you will have in that band.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,850
So zero to 10000 10000 to 20 20 to 30000 all have about 15 percent of our customers which in total constitute

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,410
45 percent of our customers sit under thirty thousand dollars.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,660
Next the distribution by age is also quite interesting.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,080
Here you can see that most of our customers are in their 30s so early 30s and late 30s.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,100
And together that's 40 percent.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,400
So if I change this to age group by 10 years you'll see that 40 percent of our customers are in their

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
30s to in their 30s basically.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:34,010
And now if we go back here you can see the gender breakdown some a bit more males and females but not

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:40,610
that much of a difference because most of white collar only half and then a quarter each for blue collar

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,360
and other.

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,190
All right so now let's look at the regions and see how when we click on the regions they deviate from

25
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,700
the baseline because that is ultimately what we want to report how each region is different to the overall

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,640
average.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,880
So if we click on the United Kingdom you can see the distribution by balas doesn't change that much.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,900
Gender changes a little bit but also not that much so 5 percent change distribution by age changes so

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:13,340
here in our overall representation on our baseline you can see that this is a right skewed distribution

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,410
meaning that the this is the mean of this it looks like a normal distribution which is which is a natural.

31
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,130
So here you can see that the machine is sitting at somewhere about 35 years old and then is going along

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,850
right side tail.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,190
So that means that it is a right skewed distribution whereas when you clicked on England the distribution

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,370
is no longer right skewed.

35
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:45,670
What that is telling us is that the customers that are in their later age groups they are not predominantly

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,440
they're not in England they're somewhere else.

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,570
And now what we want to look at is the job because.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,050
So here you can see white collar 50 percent in England it's actually 70 percent so much more white collar

39
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,480
workers in England and perhaps that has something to do with London.

40
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:10,130
The economic hub of Europe being in this region and therefore perhaps a lot of the finance workers or

41
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,310
workers in the finance industry decide to bank before bank.

42
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,800
So they might find attractive and that's something you want to convey to the executives that when they

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:28,310
are advertising or working with customers in England perhaps it's a good idea to take as Jew care or

44
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,510
special care of the white collar workers and see how you can tailor the services to their needs in this

45
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,200
specific region.

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,180
So that's what we're going to be focusing on in our storyline that England is predominately white coworkers.

47
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,140
Next we'll move on to Scotland once again who will unclick the map so we have the baseline and now we

48
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,430
can on Scotland we can begin to compare.

49
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,290
You can see that the balance distribution changes a bit but not too much.

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,700
There's some anomalies but the rest of the charts change quite a lot.

51
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,890
So gender breakdown goes from 54 percent male all the way to 72 percent male white collar workers completely

52
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:13,340
disappear or there's a little bit of them here and mostly blue collar workers and other and also the

53
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,040
demographic age demographic is completely different.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:24,040
So now our customers are in their late 40s early 50s which is a very very interesting.

55
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,780
So what this is telling us is that if you're going to service this region or when you are servicing

56
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,230
this region creating promotions and different campaigns for this region you have to aim for a much older

57
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,390
demographic predominately male and more in the blue color space so if I click on blue color here you'll

58
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:48,200
see that 95 percent of the blue collar workers in this region are all male and if I click on other you'll

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,330
see that there's a different picture here.

60
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,170
More female So if you are going to aim for blue collar workers you want to expand the net or the bank

61
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:05,170
customer base in Scotland in the blue collar worker space then you should be targeting males in their

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,610
late 40s early 50s on the other hand if you want to target other kind of professions then you should

63
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,290
still take into consideration that there is a large female representation in even in this region where

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,610
overall there is predominately male representation.

65
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,520
So that's what we'll be focusing on in Scotland and our story line.

66
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,410
Let's move on to Wales What can we see in Wales.

67
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,040
Well the first thing that jumped into my attention is the balance so if you look at the overall distribution

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,940
of balances it gradually falls off in Wales.

69
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,390
It's staggering for a bit.

70
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:48,550
We can dig into this further by grouping these balance balances not into ten thousand dollar groups

71
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,000
or but into $15000 groups and here you can see a different picture.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,340
So for the overall base you can see it's still gradually falling off in these baluns groups.

73
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,640
For Wales it's actually first going up then it's staying above the original level of about 18 percent

74
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,140
and then it's dropping off.

75
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,550
So what that is telling us is that in Wales there is an abnormally large representation of average or

76
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,650
not average.

77
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:23,860
Normally large representation of mid size balances societ balances from zero from zero to $45000.

78
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,780
It is above average.

79
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,920
It's not consistent with the overall baseline.

80
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,760
And so that's something we want to report.

81
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,770
The other elements here they're not as significant Well there is quite a bit of a gender split a different

82
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,380
gender split a job classification changes a bit decision by age but probably what is the most interesting

83
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,920
part is this distribution by balance.

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,320
And finally we move on to Northern Ireland.

85
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Here you can see another completely different demographic again once again.

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,190
So I'm going to go back to balance group ten thousands.

87
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:08,410
And this is quite consistent with the baseline a bit of anomalies but has to do with the low sample

88
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:08,880
size.

89
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,830
But what we can see here is 74 percent are female and mostly this demographic is a younger demographic

90
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:25,330
so mostly these people are in their 20s late 20s early 30s as opposed to the baseline very early 30s

91
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,460
to late 30s.

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,130
So they're a bit younger and they're predominantly female.

93
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:36,070
Seventy four percent which is completely opposite to a baseline where their customers are predominantly

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,200
male.

95
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,230
And here the main job classification is other work.

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,220
And if you click on that you will see that they're predominately female.

97
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,080
So that is how to analyze a segmentation dashboard.

98
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,670
You can definitely look at additional insights and Drilon further so you can go here and then you could

99
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,850
try to analyze what's going on with the specific workers and derive more insights from this data and

100
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,130
that's different that you should say something you should do.

101
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,950
But for the storyline that is sufficient for us.

102
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:11,890
Those are like conversational topics something to get the storyline going and you'll see how this all

103
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,850
comes together in a storyline.

104
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,500
And also you can see now what's called the segmentation dashboard because it allows us to seek a mentor

105
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,200
a customer base and understand how to service them better.

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,120
I'll give you an example let's say you have your bank comes up with an insurance offering or some kind

107
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,790
of new product that involves insurance Well if your bank wants to market the insurance offering to your

108
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,080
existing customers then you would approach it differently in different regions.

109
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,420
For instance in Scotland you know that your customers just by looking at this picture right away you

110
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:53,110
know that your customers are in their late early or late 40s and early 50s are predominantly male and

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,050
mostly blue collar workers.

112
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,200
So you just keep that thought in mind for a second.

113
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,520
Now let's go to Northern Ireland.

114
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Here you can see a completely different picture.

115
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,970
You can see that they're predominately female in their early 30s late 20s early 30s so even if you're

116
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,800
marketing the same product you might want to position it differently.

117
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:19,690
So in Northern Ireland you might say that this insurance will allow you to you know take care of life

118
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,380
changing events.

119
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:28,420
For example purchasing homes or getting married or having children and so on because that's important

120
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,640
to take care of these events that are changing your life and so on.

121
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,330
And in Scotland these people have already had all of those events.

122
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,610
Most of these people so you would position it differently would say this insurance is important because

123
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,380
it will help you protect the people you love it will help you look after your families.

124
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,220
And we know you're you're in a high risk profession and you're doing a lot of manual labor so it is

125
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:01,240
important to have this insurance so that you are covered and the people that you love your are protected.

126
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,820
And so that way that is how businesses benefit from these type of segmentation dashboards because they

127
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,210
not only are able to sell their products are able to sell their products much more in a much more tailored

128
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:20,820
fashion much more making the offering more relevant to the people they're targeting and there's nothing

129
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,120
bad about it's actually a good thing that you're delivering a good customer experience.

130
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,830
You're showing your customers that you know who they are you know what what they care about and what

131
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,010
is important to them and that is very important in today's world where we have lots and lots of data

132
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,640
which you can use and you can analyze and you should businesses should take advantage of this that this

133
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,030
data to make the customer experience as great as possible.

134
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,250
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

135
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,820
Until then happy analyzing.
