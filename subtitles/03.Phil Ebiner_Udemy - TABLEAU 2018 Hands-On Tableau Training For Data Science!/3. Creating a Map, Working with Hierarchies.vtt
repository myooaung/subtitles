Hello welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.200
And in today's tutorial we will be creating a map and we will learn how to work with hierarchies.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.310
If you recall the first time we created a map was in the very first section of the Course that time

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.910
we created a map of the US and we kind of analyzed how a certain store was performing across the different

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.470
states of the US.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.720
Today we'll be working with a map of Europe and we will spend much more time on it so that we can understand

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.910
exactly how to work geographically daughter and tablet.

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.730
So let's get straight to it.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.580
First thing we're going to do is we're going to save a workbook because we didn't do that last time

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.640
so click save as Section 4.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.500
There we go.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.050
And now we're going to start by creating our first hierarchy and why do we need a hierarchy.

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.670
Well that is because we have certain elements of geographical information in our data that we need to

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.870
tell tabbouleh how they work together and let's have a look at that.

15
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.720
So here on the left and the dimensions you can see right away that some fields have been picked up as

16
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.510
geographical data and the globe represents that some fields have been picked up as text and some fields

17
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.150
have been picked up as date.

18
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.820
And so here we have three elements of geographical data that Tablo recognizes it's the city the country

19
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.020
and the state.

20
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.400
No region is also an element of geographical daughter it's North South Central or west or east Europe.

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.310
But in this case Tabeau doesn't have that geographical or the level of geographical information or that

22
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.950
layer.

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.390
So in this case Tablo doesn't recognize it and that's OK for us because it's sufficient for us to work

24
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.340
with these three.

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.080
Now at the same time these are all elements of geographical information but we also know that a city

26
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.900
can only be in one country a country can only be in one state.

27
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.880
So therefore there is a hierarchy and natural hierarchy there and we have to show Tablo how it works

28
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.920
and Trouble is already prompting us to create a hierarchy here and we can go ahead with that.

29
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.630
But for now we'll just delete this hierarchy that the table has prompted for us and we'll create all.

30
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.990
So we'll just click Remove hierarchic And now we will start recreating all.

31
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.610
The easiest way to do it is to take any of the elements let's say a city and drag it onto its apparent

32
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.150
element.

33
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.550
So in this case country.

34
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.850
And so now we will is tableaus prompting us to create a hierarchy called Country City but we'll just

35
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.450
call it geography because we know that we will add more into this hierarchy just now.

36
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.080
So if we do that right away you can see that country and city have been moved into this hierarchy separately

37
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.460
away from the rest of the dimensions.

38
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.070
So now if we take state and we also move it in here we can put them in between Put in between.

39
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.210
We can put it anywhere but we know that state goes between country and city.

40
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.800
So that's where we will put it.

41
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.530
And now we have create a natural hierarchy for us to work with going forward.

42
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.810
And so now what we can do is we can take country and we can drag it into our workspace and once we've

43
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.770
done that right away you can see a map of Europe has appeared.

44
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.190
So I'll just make this more so that we can zoom in a little bit so a map of Europe has appeared and

45
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.700
the dots represent the countries that are in our data set.

46
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.260
So there is United Kingdom Germany Norway and so on.

47
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.390
Now you can also see this little plus sign and the plus sign appears because there is a hierarchy that

48
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.770
Tablo knows about.

49
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.130
The one that we just created and it knows that it can drill into the data further.

50
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.650
And that's why it's allowing us to do it.

51
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.810
So if we click the plus sign right away you can see that instead of a dot for every country now we have

52
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.860
a dot for every state.

53
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.740
So let's zoom in to France for instance and you can see here that in every single state of France there

54
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.730
is a dot.

55
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.000
And that's because we are looking at the level of granularity of state.

56
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.040
And that's because we have state as you recall whatever dimensions are listed on our work sheet.

57
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.110
That's the level of granularity that Talos going to be looking at.

58
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.680
So once again we can click this plus sign on the state and that will drill in further into city.

59
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.720
So now we have every dot represents the city so we have a dot for every single city that our that is

60
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.850
present in our data set.

61
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:39.300
So there's a yeah there is this really my pronunciation might not be the best but as you can see there's

62
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.410
a lot more dots here right now.

63
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.120
And in fact you can keep track of the number of marks on your chart or map as we discussed in the bottom

64
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.080
left corner here.

65
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.860
Right now there's 1001 marks.

66
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.220
So that's quite a lot of data points.

67
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.700
And we can really start working with this.

68
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.760
In fact we're going to go back one step and we will leave the map at the level of granularity of a state.

69
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.360
So we'll just collapse that.

70
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.360
And now let's go ahead and start working with this.

71
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.400
So what are we going to do.

72
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.480
First things first.

73
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.790
Is is always important to know how many if you have more than one year in your data and you know because

74
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.300
you've got to be careful not to aggregate information from different ears.

75
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.340
If you don't need that.

76
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.020
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to take a date and drag it into filters and we already

77
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.340
know how to work the filters right.

78
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:40.920
So we're going to add it into filters here and we will just choose not to range of dates but we'll choose

79
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.560
years.

80
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.630
So next and let's say we want to look at 2012 to start with.

81
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.750
Okay.

82
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.160
And just as we did before what are we going to do is we're going to create a quick filter shock quick

83
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.310
filter.

84
00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.900
There it is our quick filter so I'll just make the Workbook a little bit smaller so we can fit our quick

85
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.750
filter in.

86
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.310
And in this case we obviously don't need oil.

87
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.980
So what are we going to do is customize show all value we don't need it and we will change this to a

88
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.250
single value slider so now you can slide along and you can see how the data change.

89
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.330
So that was the first thing that we wanted to do.

90
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.790
And now working with a single year what we're going to do is we're going to create some colors and some

91
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.900
sizes on our chart.

92
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.170
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to say that we want to look at how many sales were done

93
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.050
in every single of these.

94
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.950
Every single one of these regions so we're going to take sales and we'll drag it onto size and right

95
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.790
away we can see that the bubbles have changed size because now they represent cells and they look a

96
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.870
bit some Also let's increase the size a little bit.

97
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.370
Let's take it to this level for instance and then we'll go to colors and give it a border let's say

98
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.060
a black border to make it kind of stand out a little bit.

99
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.410
That's good.

100
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:04.680
Now what we're going to do is we're going to create a calculated field that what we want to do and what

101
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:13.980
was told in the challenge what we were told in the challenge is to look at the profit margin for every

102
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.180
single state.

103
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:22.800
So let's go ahead and do that we need to create a field that will take some of profit and divided by

104
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.790
the sum of sales and that will give us a profit margin.

105
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.580
So we're going to right click on profit here.

106
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:38.220
We will go to create a calculated field and here we'll call it profit margin.

107
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.710
We need some of profits.

108
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.870
So it's important to take the sum of all the profits for all the orders in that specific region first

109
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.550
and then divided by the sum of total sales for that region.

110
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.850
Rather than divide taking profit you about and then taking the sum so it's important here to first sum

111
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.570
up all the profits sum up all the sales and then divide one by the other.

112
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.430
Click Apply.

113
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.220
OK.

114
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.920
So we have profit margin now.

115
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:12.550
And now if we take profit margin and drag it on to color what you will see is that the field here is

116
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.580
called a G.G. profit margin which means aggregate of profit margin.

117
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:24.310
Basically it's telling us that this is already an aggregated field because profit margin is a calculated

118
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.580
field which takes which first takes the sum of profit and divide by the sum of so tablets telling us

119
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:37.090
that this is not just a single value field it's an action aggregated field and just kind of warning

120
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.120
us about that.

121
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.660
So what we're going to do is we're going to adjust the colors and we're going to take let's say in sort

122
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.970
of red green Let's go Red Blue.

123
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:55.090
We'll apply that and now we will say that we want a specific levels of profit margin.

124
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:02.140
So anything below 0.5 minus 0.5 is already very bad.

125
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.470
Anything over zero point five is great.

126
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.360
So for click Apply we'll get a chart like that.

127
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.990
And so that's that's pretty much it that's what we wanted from our map.

128
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:22.250
Now if we scroll around we can see how the profit margins and the sales changed over the years.

129
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.990
And once again if you put your mouse over any specific region or any specific state it will tell you

130
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:35.740
the country the state the sales and the profit margin for that specific period of time that you're looking

131
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.060
at.

132
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:45.730
So let's go up here because we can zoom out a bit because we've got Sweeden here still going which Finland

133
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.540
and so on.

134
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:53.940
So we can see how they're changing as well what else you can do is you can highlight highlight things

135
00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:01.800
here so that say you can do us where highlighting like that if you like but we'll talk more about this

136
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.690
a bit in a bit when we're working with our first dashboard.

137
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.280
So that's just the different types of highlighting you have and.

138
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.700
So have a play around with that see what else you can do maybe you want to not look at profit margin

139
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:24.000
but some other parameter or some other metric of how the regions or how the states are performing.

140
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:30.510
Maybe you want to drill down to city level so here right away you can see we have many many more circles

141
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.220
and this is showing the same thing.

142
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.150
So basically the profit margin for every city maybe don't want to see that.

143
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:42.130
Maybe you can go back to country and look at individual countries rather than States.

144
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.820
So lots of things you can do with this map here.

145
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.630
And so I'll leave it at that for now in the next tutorial.

146
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.720
We will create a scatterplot and then in that tutorial.

147
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.810
After that we will finally create our first dashboard where we will start combining worksheets.

148
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.780
So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

149
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.580
And until then happy analyzing.
