00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,540
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and I've got this feeling that by now you're probably

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,570
getting a bit tired of all of these Daughter prep tutorials.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,430
We've had a few in a row.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,120
And yeah definitely it is a bit tedious sometimes but it's a very important topic so I'm happy that

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,790
we carrying it off and also to spice things up.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,620
I promise you that at the end of this tutorial We'll look at some visuals and play around with the daughter

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,300
just to have a bit of fun.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,000
So today we're talking about the metadata grid.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,510
What is the metadata grid.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,970
It allows you to do is it allows you to look at all the columns separately before all this daughter

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,470
getting in your way and get some information and maybe do some work just with the column names and just

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,020
call them themselves.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,540
And that is a very handy thing to have especially if you have like 30 20 30 40 50 columns.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,360
It can be quite a challenge crawling around this place and finding the ones you need to do something

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,860
about.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,050
Whereas if you use a metadata grid right in front of you.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,870
All of them.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,420
So how do you get to the metadata grid.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Well like everything in Tablo It's very simple you just have to click this one little button over here

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,150
and once you're there.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,270
This is I think it's called managed metadata.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,440
Once you there you've got the grid in front of you.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,340
We only have four columns so it isn't that big.

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,200
But at the same time you can really see some how we can add some value to our dashboard through this

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,150
metadata grid.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,860
So here we've got the original name of the current name of the column.

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,500
Then we've got the table where it comes from and the remote field name.

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,240
So what was the original name of the column.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,550
So in our case we've got regions which came from our spreadsheet and it was also called the regions

30
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,400
countries.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,120
It came from a spreadsheet is called.

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,650
It's called countries pivot field names.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,570
In our case it came from the pivot and the it actually represents the years so because we pivoted on

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,300
the year you can see that pivot field names is a different years and pivot field values is the total

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,520
number of cars sold.

36
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,980
So how about we go ahead and make these adjustments here so instead of pivot field names we'll call

37
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:20,790
it year and pivot field value we'll call it maybe not cars that's called vehicles sold.

38
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,860
And I'm not specifically don't want to put vehicle sales because that might imply dollars and we don't

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,260
want to confuse the users so we'll just call it Pickle's sold maybe we'll put a space in between them

40
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,670
and countries we can put us like uncapitalized regions as well or just cold region.

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,040
And in this case country.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,690
So that allowed us to clean up a bit our spreadsheet or our daughter.

43
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,760
Now you can see it's a much better region country year vehicle sold and that is how you work with the

44
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,970
meter dot grid.

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,560
Once again very small number of fields for us in this case.

46
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:08,100
But if you do ever have more fields you can come here and work refit and it will be much more convenient

47
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,930
and much more handy for you.

48
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,890
So here you can also like look at other things like alias's for change names for countries or the different

49
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,880
values of fields like do some splits which we've already talked about and so on.

50
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,990
So let's have a look at some data as promised because we want to see some colors.

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,400
All right.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,150
So we're going to go to a sheet.

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,070
What are we going to look at vehicles sold and we'll look at it by year.

54
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,810
Right away we've got an interesting picture so the total number of vehicles sold globally has been growing

55
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,750
and it's currently sitting at 65 million vehicles sold in 2014.

56
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,870
What else could we add here let's add region.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,290
And now we've got a colorful chart so orange is Asia here and bulu Europe.

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:05,990
So we can see that Asia Oceania Middle East 34 and a half million vehicles were sold in 2014.

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,330
What do we want to do now.

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:15,790
Well perhaps we want to see how much what percentage of the global sales.

61
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,650
Was the were the sales in Asia so we can see here right away that it is quite a high portion.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,390
Based on the size of this bar bar we don't really see what percentage exactly it was.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,710
So how about we compare the percentages in sort of the total values.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,260
All right so we're creating a calculated fields table calculation and here will look for percent of

65
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,840
total but not across we want the percentage of total down because we want the percent of total for every

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,570
single year.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,340
Click Apply and then we go we can see that what what percentage exactly.

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,970
Each region is constituting for every single year.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Maybe it will just take this table allocation hold down control added into label maybe format our label

70
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:08,500
I by now I hope all of this is very straightforward what exactly we're doing because this must be very

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,090
easy stuff for you guys right now.

72
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,280
So just click Format this whole tab and make it bold.

73
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:24,280
And now if we format our label we just want to change it from one put a percentage with no decimals.

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,790
There we go.

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:30,670
So that's that's what we can see maybe we you might want to change an area chart but that label doesn't

76
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,570
look as good so maybe keep it a bar chart.

77
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:40,810
And so here we can see that in 2014 53 percent of the world's vehicles personal vehicles were sold in

78
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,680
Asia Oceania and Middle East.

79
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,370
19 percent were sold in Europe.

80
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,850
So Europe is in second place but far far behind Asia and the Middle East but fair enough because that

81
00:05:51,850 --> 00:06:00,490
is a very big region and US so the North American Free Trade Agreement that America us United States

82
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,850
Canada and Mexico 14 percent of the total vehicle sales.

83
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,800
Once again those are personal vehicles.

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,120
So there we go we had to play around with the daughters just to make a little bit more fun feel free

85
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,290
to explore further.

86
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,400
This is quite interesting to say maybe you look at your country see how the sales in your country have

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,670
been changing this is freely available on the net so it should be should be quite accurate.

88
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,040
Next what we're going to do in the next tutorial we will look at the errors that you can that can happen

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,270
when you're working with map so data errors.

90
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,480
When working with maps and we'll see how to fix them and that will be a very interesting or very useful

91
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,960
tutorial if you are planning on working with maps going forward.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,520
OK so that's it for today.

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,780
Thank you very much for attention.

94
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,180
I look forward to seeing you next time.

95
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,080
And until then happy analyzing.
