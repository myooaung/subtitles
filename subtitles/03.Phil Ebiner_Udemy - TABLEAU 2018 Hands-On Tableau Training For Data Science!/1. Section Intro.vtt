I guy's name is John Scott me and I am the tablet instructor here at supergoddess science.

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.730
I am super excited about this new section will be focusing some of the new features into low 2080 and

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.220
we don't really have one but we actually have two challenges that we will solve together.

4
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.900
Now we'll be tapping into some unconventional sources by clicking a PDA falls and some custom spatial

5
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.520
falls.

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.390
So getting with some real world data what else is real.

7
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.800
Well some of the problems we run into in using is there but they're afraid we will go through it step

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.510
by step to solve these problems together.

9
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.060
Now during the section you will learn how to use the filter and also how to apply this step and jump

10
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.180
off line in your work.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.130
That was enough talking.

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.080
Strap in and let's tackle the first challenge together.

13
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.670
Right.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.670
The business challenge.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.640
Let's have a quick look right.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.020
We are focusing on New York City parks and specifically safety.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.730
Now we have been hired by a community forum to analyze crime incidents occurring at New York City parks.

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.310
This is in support of their efforts to lobby for safer parks.

19
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.540
We need to design and attention grabbing visualization which they will use to motivate for more police

20
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.350
patrols in New York City public parks.

21
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.460
We are required to analyze the crime incidents reported to the New York Police Department which have

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
occurred at New York City parks during the first quarter of 2018.

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.670
We have been supplied the data.

24
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.090
But unfortunately the data is only available in pedia format next week.

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.880
Note also that Central Park is not included in the review.

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.410
Furthermore they have required the results to be displayed using a map and it needs to include the actual

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.540
park layout and size and distribution in the city.

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.870
We also also to ensure that we make use of proper tool tips and FULDE to include filtering for Barra.

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.340
And lastly we've got a little disclaimer just to mention that this study was developed for educational

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.660
purposes in reference to real facts or really veins is purely coincidental.

31
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.540
Now let's look at a way you can get the data for this case study.

32
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:15.690
Now normal you would go to w w w dot supergoddess signs dot com forward slash to blow then you just

33
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.600
scroll to the bottom and you look at Section 9 and in there you will find three files to be downloaded.

34
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.050
The first two are related to this specific business case and that is your PDA fall with the crime stats

35
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.500
and then also the special falls in his folder which will contain all of the files required for that.

36
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.610
And also lost the this years before.

37
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.340
But that's only for the second business case in the next tutorial.

38
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.180
We will look at what PDA falls are and also add some of its characteristics.

39
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.950
I look forward to seeing you next time.

40
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.810
Until then happy analyzing.
