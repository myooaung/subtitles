00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.600
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and the Prius tutorial we finished off with this beautiful

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.220
distribution of our customers by age.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.810
And today we're going to create an identical distribution but it will be of customers by balance.

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.200
So if you would like to perform an additional exercise and test your skills then you can pose as a Tauriel

5
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.440
right now and create a distribution for the customers by balance and then play the editorial and compare

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.530
and see how I did it and how you did it and see what the differences were and if you got the same result.

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.380
So now we're going to proceed to creating this distribution and the process is exactly the same as we

8
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.330
did with this distribution by a.

9
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.150
So let's go ahead and do that.

10
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.520
And you tab.

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.880
I'm going to call its distribution by balance by balance.

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.940
Okay.

13
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.600
And now as last time first we're going to create a balance create bins we'll make them 10000 units of

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.690
currency bins and now we will take the balance been a variable drag it in two columns will take number

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.150
of records and Toro's there is our distribution.

16
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.040
Now we will take some number of records control hold control and drag it into color.

17
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.470
There it is so maybe we can make it a bit smaller.

18
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.370
That's good.

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.940
Now we will change we will get rid of this header will change.

20
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.990
First of all we will change of course we will change quick tempo calculational change just 2 percent

21
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.300
of total.

22
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.540
And here we will also change to 2 percent or basically will just take this one and will drag it into

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.060
color doesn't really change the color but just for consistency one LOL here what that means is that

24
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.730
there is no values in the one hundred and fifty something's going to rotate these labels in the 150000

25
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.300
there's no values and you can filter data and exclude that.

26
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.520
No but I prefer to keep it.

27
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.240
So I'm just going to press controls.

28
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.580
And to remove this indicator from the churches right click it and click hide indicator.

29
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.230
OK.

30
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.600
So that's our charts.

31
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.760
And now we're going to quickly format it so I'll change the Xs here.

32
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.330
Total percent of customers.

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.590
And now we will format hear the whole chart bold OK.

34
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.080
So that's our charts maybe make some more space so that the columns or the names of the columns fit

35
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.130
in.

36
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.410
And now what we want to do is we want to learn how to work with parameters.

37
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.590
So at this stage we haven't touched on parameters yet but it is time for us to learn how to leverage

38
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.900
the true power of this tool and Tablo and use.

39
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.300
Todd Wantage in this dashboard so well how can we use parameters here and what are they.

40
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.020
Well imagine that you want to dynamically adjust this physical.

41
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.250
Let's say for instance you want to be able to change the size of the bins like right now you're not

42
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.570
happy with 10000 units of currency per been.

43
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.380
And you want to change it well you need to go to balance being right click it click Edit and you have

44
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.400
to change this to 5000 if you want 5000 or 20000 or whatever you want.

45
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.240
And every time doing that can be a bit tedious and especially in daughter exploration and data discovery.

46
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.630
You need to be agile you need to be able to quickly adjust these things because that can help you find

47
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.110
anomalies.

48
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.940
So for instance here it's a gradual drop off but when you change it to five thousand dollar bills you

49
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.550
can see this spike and it's quite anomalous and you might want to understand what exactly is going on

50
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.930
there.

51
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.050
So whereas you couldn't have you wouldn't have seen it from this chart and how quickly you can adjust

52
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.580
the size of the bins determines how many how much insights you can produce.

53
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.900
So we will create a parameter which will allow us to adjust these the size of these bins very quickly.

54
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.630
I'm going to write cookand measures and here I will say create a parameter the parameter we'll call

55
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:25.360
it let's call it balance balanced groups because we work here of balance it will be an integer parameter

56
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.140
and we will start off with ten thousand and we'll be working for a range so the minimum value of the

57
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.920
parameter.

58
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.680
Let's say there's no not much point going below $5000 buckets or $5000.

59
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.920
The maximum.

60
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.990
25000.

61
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.300
Sounds like a lot already.

62
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.630
And the step size can be 5000 as well.

63
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.110
So we've created a parameter.

64
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.130
Now we're right click the parameter and we click Show parameter control and it appears over here.

65
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.560
So now you can just change the parameter and.

66
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.230
Well right now nothing's happening of course of the chart.

67
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.210
And that's because we haven't linked the parameter to our balance bins.

68
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.140
So let's go ahead and do that.

69
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.050
We're going to look at it and here are size of bins.

70
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.020
It conveniently prompts you to select a parameter when you click the dropdown.

71
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.380
I already have a parameter has bounds group so select that click OK.

72
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.500
And now if we change the parameter around you can see that the size of the bins is changing and therefore

73
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.710
the number of columns is changing.

74
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:38.590
So you can see here that now I can very quickly dynamically adjust this chart and get to the insights

75
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.160
that I want and that is a lot of power is sort of.

76
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.560
That's not the only usage of parameters.

77
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:51.390
And now that you know that you have this option to create parameters which you can quickly just use

78
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.400
to have more control over your worksheets you will naturally come up with other ways to use them as

79
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.560
you create more visualizations.

80
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.640
But this is one of the good use cases.

81
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.230
So let's not go to distribution by age and do the same thing will create a parameter here and we will

82
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.820
call it age groups.

83
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.420
Parameter parameters all parameters to be an integer so a whole number.

84
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.230
This someone wants a list of values rather than a range.

85
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.070
We want a list.

86
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:28.500
Let's say we want to only 3 types of values for 1 5 and 10 click OK.

87
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.020
And now we have a parameter age groups we will show parameter control here.

88
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.280
Also we wanted to be a slider and of course we want to connect it to our chart.

89
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:48.950
So let's go right click Edit h bin and sort of this fixed value for the size of bins we can recreate

90
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.020
age or select age groups once we selected that well here you can see it's a bit.

91
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.270
It's extended out charred quite a lot but that doesn't really matter because the dashboard won't be

92
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:09.040
the case but we can always want to reduce the size of this data.

93
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.500
This is a worksheet even here if we wanted to but let's have a look at what happens when we change the

94
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.800
size of the been.

95
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.800
So if we click to the right now the size of business five years now the size of the business 10 years

96
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.640
and you can see that the chart is adjusting as we do that.

97
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:33.940
So that is the power of parameters have a play around with that and see how we think of other cases

98
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.020
where you might be able to use parameters in your work with Tablo.

99
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.780
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

100
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.410
And until then I'll be analyzing.
