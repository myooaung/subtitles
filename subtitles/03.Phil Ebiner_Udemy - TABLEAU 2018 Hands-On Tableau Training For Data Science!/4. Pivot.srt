00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello to welcome back to the course on Tablo in the previous tutorial we imported our personal vehicle

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,740
sales data into Tablo and we used the dot interpreter tool to help us out.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,610
And this is what the data looks like so it looks great.

4
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,890
It's it's clean it's all in the information that we need.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:32,480
But the problem here is that as we discussed this kind of format is still more oriented at humans because

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,640
it's got the years in separate columns whereas in a machine in a machine format the years would be in

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,790
their own column.

8
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,780
And then you would just have the values in another column.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,190
So ideally this data set should be presented before Kwame's region country year and total sales for

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,830
that year rather than this on pivoted view.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,490
So what are we going to do now is we're going to learn how to pivoted right here in tablet.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,220
And as you can imagine I'll just bring up the spreadsheet here which we work with before as you can

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,500
imagine to achieve what we want to achieve by adjusting this.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,910
It would take us quite some effort to move from this kind of format to a format where we just have a

15
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,090
cold for year and then a column for the value.

16
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,410
But the beauty of Tablo is that it can do all this for you and it's very simple.

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,830
Just observe how quickly this can be done.

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,080
We're just going to select the columns that we want to pivot.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,570
We select all of these columns and then you just select one or one of the dropdown and you click pivot

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,470
and there you go.

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,040
It's all done as easy as that.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:52,580
So now you've got region country pivot or the year and the value or the total sales total number of

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,900
cars sold for that year.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:01,340
So as you can see we can also just just to make sure we can compare to what we see in our spreadsheet.

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:11,090
So let's pick a random random row from this new table and say let's say somewhere Europe Europe Greece

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,150
2007.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Two hundred and seventy nine thousand cars.

28
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,010
So now I'm going to bring up the spreadsheet since I can find it here it is.

29
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,450
So Europe Greece.

30
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,440
Two thousand seven hundred seventy nine thousand cars.

31
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:26,930
Perfect.

32
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,680
So that means it's working.

33
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,310
And as expected and that is how you pivot Dadda in Tablo.

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,160
So we'll continue with our daughter preparation the next Tauriel and Alec Facinelli someone till then.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,870
Happy idolising.
