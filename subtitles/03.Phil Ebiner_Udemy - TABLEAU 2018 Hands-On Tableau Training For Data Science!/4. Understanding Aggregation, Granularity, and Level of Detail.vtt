00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.500
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.140
And today we're talking about aggregations and granularity.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.920
It's going to be a quite an important tutorial because the things that you'll learn today you will take

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.620
away and apply throughout this course and through out all of your work with Tablo because these things

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.520
govern how Tablo operates.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.790
So let's get straight into it here we've got the chart and the chart that we've created and it's showing

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.610
us unemployment in the U.S. a month to month from 2005 to 2015.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.420
Now the question that we have is how does Tablo know that we want to see it at the monthly level.

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.940
How does public know that this aggregation that is doing summing up the unemployed variable How does

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.210
it know that we want to see it at the month level how does it know that he needs to sum it up at the

11
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.940
month level.

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.740
So the answer is quite simple.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.090
Tablo will always aggregate measures at the level of granularity of your worksheet.

14
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.260
So in this case because we have this variable here month of period Tablo knows that we are intending

15
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.240
to see all of this data that we plotting at the level of one month or at the granularity of a month.

16
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.900
And so what that means is if I remove this if I just drag it out of the dashboard or the worksheet you

17
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.400
will see one single dot.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.190
So instead of lots of dots or a line Tablo has no.

19
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.430
Now tabel has no clue at which level granularity we want to see the worksheet and it assumes that we

20
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.540
just want to see it at the broadest level possible.

21
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.470
And that is at the level of the whole data set.

22
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.070
So it what it does is just sums up all of the values for this variable unemployed into one single value

23
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.480
and it plots it for you.

24
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.680
So I'm just going to control that and return month of period.

25
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.840
And so that's in this case month of period is the variable that governs granularity.

26
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.180
Normally what happens or quite like the concept behind Tablo is that measures get aggregated and dimensions

27
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.320
specify the level of granularity and we'll see how that works in a second.

28
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.420
In this case month of period even though it's recognized as a measure and it's green it is still the

29
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.000
variable that is specifying the level of granularity.

30
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.730
And that's because it introduces this access or a timeline at the bottom and it actually specifies that

31
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.650
we want to see it at the monthly level so it makes sense for Tablo to assume that we want to see this

32
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.010
chart at the level of particularity of a month.

33
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.830
So no what we can do to alter aggregation is we can go to analysis and we can actually switch it off.

34
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.630
So if you just check this box you'll see that you get this fuzzy chart and now we're just going to replace

35
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.860
it with a shape charge just to make it look better and you will see that now instead of aggregating

36
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.220
the data tablas just plodding unemployed.

37
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.170
So basically it's plotting every single row of our data set separately on this chart.

38
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.070
So you're going to have a lot of values for the same month in the same year and because because we have

39
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.400
two genders and we have a lot of different age groups.

40
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.180
And now if we look at the bottom we will see that there's a total of 1000 708 marks and that is the

41
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.720
total number of rows that we have in our data because our daughter is at monthly level.

42
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.120
So if we go back to our plus here which just going to switch aggregation back on and I'll show you another

43
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.440
way we can alter or aggregation.

44
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.710
Now what we can do is instead of switch aggregation off we can introduce a dimension which will change

45
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.670
the level of granularity of our dashboard and therefore it will affect the aggregation.

46
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.270
So we're going to take gender and we're going to drag it onto color and right away you can see here

47
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.210
that we have twice as many dots the blue dots for present mail and the orange dots represent female

48
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.450
unemployment for that specific month.

49
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.550
And now Tablo knows that because we have this variable here which is month of period and because we

50
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.850
have this dimension in our worksheet it knows that we want to see everything or we want to see all of

51
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.720
the measures aggregated at the level of granularity of month plus gender.

52
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:39.600
So if we look down here you'll see that this 244 marks that is twice as many marks as we had when we

53
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.290
had months so I'll just take gender out for a second and you'll see that we have 122 marks and so now

54
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:54.300
if we return gender back into color there is 244 marks and that is telling us that the level of granularity

55
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.990
has become even smaller or bigger actually.

56
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.470
So the chart has become more granular because we've been just as I mentioned what else can we do.

57
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.990
We can introduce more dimensions to increase granularity even further so let's take page and dragged

58
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.380
into shape.

59
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:23.300
So now you can see many more marks and you still see orange and blue orange represents gender and blue

60
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.940
order presents female and blue represent male.

61
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.060
But at the same time there's different shapes on the chart and other circles are squares as crosses

62
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.200
as pluses.

63
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.990
There's lots of different types of shapes and each shape represents a different group or a different

64
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:47.210
level kind of a different datapoint or a different point on our chart and tabel knows the level we want

65
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.100
to aggregate at because it can see all of the dimensions in a worksheet you can see that we have gender

66
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.700
or we can have age we have a month of period so it knows that this sum is now only had now has to be

67
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.580
calculated.

68
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.960
Having these this level of granular granularity in mind.

69
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:11.130
So that's how agregate that's how granularity works and aggregation works together of granularity granularity.

70
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.690
Let's have a look at different types of aggregations that are available.

71
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.960
So I'm just going to remove age so it's not too cluttered.

72
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.620
And now we're going to look at is not some of unemployed we're actually going to change it.

73
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.790
And if you click this drop down and go down to measure some here you can change what you want to see.

74
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.940
So let's say you want to see the average unemployment for that month.

75
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.980
If you click that you'll see the chart didn't change much but that access actually changed.

76
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:47.140
So when you had some it was the total unemployment for that gender for that month.

77
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.230
Now if you click measure average you will see that it is the average unemployment for that gender for

78
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.020
that month.

79
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.640
There's another one let's look at say median.

80
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.820
See now the chart changes because it's actually showing us and the access changes as well.

81
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.560
But now it's not proportional because it's media.

82
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:13.630
And now we can see that these marks are presenting the medium median unemployment at the level of granularity

83
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.100
of this worksheet and that level of granularity is month plus gender.

84
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.300
And so basically that's how granularity and aggregation work.

85
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.860
The only one more thing that I wanted to show you and this is important is detail.

86
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:39.040
So sometimes you might want to increase your level of granularity you want to make your dashboard more

87
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:48.610
detailed or more granular but you don't want to drag anything onto your eye color or shape you don't

88
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:55.660
want to affect the visual like coloring or other parts of the dashboard but you do want to increase

89
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.060
the level of granularity.

90
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.130
Will Tablo has a solution for that.

91
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:08.980
There is this option detail in detail doesn't actually mean like detail as an words or description.

92
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.000
It actually means that level of granularity of the chart.

93
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.900
So let's do that let's take a page and instead of dragging it on to shape like we did last time let's

94
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.450
put it on to detail and see what happens.

95
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.550
Now you can see that the shapes haven't changed but the granularity of the chart has changed.

96
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:32.470
So basically this is an option for you to add dimensions and measures to your dashboard without actually

97
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.240
affecting the visual representation.

98
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:41.350
But affecting the level of granularity and that's exactly why that is but in detail all this option

99
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:47.780
detail is here is for you to control at which level the aggregation is going to happen.

100
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:54.220
So just remember about that because we will be using that going further in the course and you will definitely

101
00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.550
find it helpful and handy when you're doing your own projects for work or at home.

102
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.200
So that's all for today.

103
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.580
I hope that was helpful.

104
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.390
And let me know if you have any questions whatsoever because these are important topics that we will

105
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.380
need going forward.

106
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:17.140
And in the next Tauriel we will start creating this awesome looking dashboard for unemployment worksheet

107
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.360
for important worksheet.

108
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.520
Diasporas will come.

109
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.060
All right.

110
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.470
Look for it.

111
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.230
See you next time.

112
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.900
And until then happy analyzing.
