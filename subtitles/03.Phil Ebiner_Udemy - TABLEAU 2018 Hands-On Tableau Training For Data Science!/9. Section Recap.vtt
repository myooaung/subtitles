00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.220
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.910
Today we take a look back at this jam packed section and revisit some of the most important aspects

3
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.930
which we've covered during this section.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.740
No we kicked it off with looking at the Falls and looking at different variations of what our PD False

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.750
be structured and potentially being used by us.

6
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.400
We looked at some report formats and then also some more straightforward formats where we can actually

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.790
extract the data directly from tables.

8
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.050
We actually proceeded and extracted debt using the Tablo PDAF connector extracted data from the New

9
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.550
York City Police Department.

10
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.240
We also stopped briefly and had a look at the absolute page numbers and how important is to use those

11
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.980
and not the actual page number printed on the PDAF as those those might sometimes be different.

12
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.310
And this will save you a lot of time if you make a note of this.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.500
We then further looked at the data interpreter and how that also not only works well for Excel files

14
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.380
but also in PTF but that we do need to make sure that our quality checks are being done properly to

15
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.600
ensure that we don't miss any data or it is incorrectly interpreted.

16
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.520
In addition to the data interpreter and working with pedia falls we saw that Tablo apply some logic

17
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.460
on each table or each page to see whether there are different ways of interpreting the tables.

18
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.310
And it gives us different variations to choose from when connecting to these falls.

19
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.770
We also then had a further look on how we can actually get data from different pages onto one.

20
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.110
And by using the Union and then we looked at different cleanups tapes using a PDA file.

21
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.350
It was also then very important to note that the cleanup steps that we perform may vary greatly from

22
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.270
any of the documents or every document will have a different process.

23
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.260
And that's also what makes it quite complex.

24
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.310
Working with PDA falls.

25
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.880
So it's not always it's not your preferred way of receiving data but if you have no other option this

26
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.980
can work as well.

27
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.410
Just be careful that your cleanup steps may vary greatly.

28
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.620
Then we also mentioned that there's a lot of factors that can influence how Tablo interprets your PDA.

29
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.870
Now those can range from hierarchy's or hitter's or sub tables and you can have multiple rows of content

30
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.950
that should be affected as one even color and shading can affect how Tablo interprets the data.

31
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.410
So do be careful when using PDA documents.

32
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.590
We then moved over onto spatial falls and we had look at four different special falls and what the monitory

33
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.730
files are that Tablo needs to use to connect to and will connect and display the data properly of your

34
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.190
spatial files.

35
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.990
We also stopped briefly and had a look at the different Matt types and had a look at how special files

36
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.240
can improve our maps how we using it.

37
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.870
When we do not have the normal geographies or the normal Geographic roles that are required for our

38
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.820
analysis and examples they were for instance school districts or parks and so forth.

39
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.240
Those are not native to tabla and we might have to consult other sources to obtain these special spatial

40
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.710
data.

41
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.020
We then connect it to our own spatial data that we are taking from the New York City Open data.

42
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.280
And we also extracted the data we further into to join this to the PDAF fall that we imported earlier

43
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.140
and we noticed some data quality issues and how to resolve them.

44
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.790
And most notably to watch out for our duplicate records as well as her records way.

45
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.610
You do not have joined necessarily so when you using in a joint that you might end up losing records.

46
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.540
Especially when working with two sources from two different open data platforms your data might have

47
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.460
some glitches.

48
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.150
We had a look at how to solve that so that was a very important one that's all so why be highlighting

49
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.370
it in this part.

50
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.730
We finish that off by looking at this step and jump line which is a variation of your line chart.

51
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:12.430
And quite handy to show specific differences in your garage off and quite handy to highlight some specific

52
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.730
changes over time in your time analysis.

53
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.370
And last we resolved our business goes loss business case by using the very intuitive function which

54
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.500
is super helpful when you don't want to create a dashboard but still allow the user to explore your

55
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.490
data by using multiple sheets.

56
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.460
And by basically adding sheets into your tooltip which gets filtered automatically.

57
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.410
So pretty awesome stuff.

58
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.420
I had a lot of fun preparing and presenting the same action and I hope you had just as much fun and

59
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.170
that you learned a range of new skills and features that you can use in Tablo 20:18.

60
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.200
I hope to see you now at Von's course and until next time.

61
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.410
Yes you've guessed it.

62
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.610
Happy analyzing.
