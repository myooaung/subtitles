Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video redefined and finished our

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.000
whole model for our deep Q network and in this video.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.090
Our goal is to build a trade function that takes a state as an input and spills out an action to perform

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.510
in the particular state we are going to define it as that trade.

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.450
That takes only one argument and that is our state for that state.

6
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.690
We need to determine whether should we use and the random generated action or should we use our model

7
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.370
to perform that action to do that right.

8
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.540
If random and that is our library dot random and if this random number is less than or equal to our

9
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.210
Epsilon in only that case we are going to return and a random action.

10
00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.250
So we have to return random and from this function and we will call Rand arrange the rand rage function

11
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.030
can take multiple arguments.

12
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.780
But in this case we are going to provide only stop point.

13
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.360
We are going to provide self-doubt action space and it will randomly select a number between zero and

14
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:23.400
free not including free so meaning 0 1 and 2 if this is not the case or the random generator number

15
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.340
is bigger than epsilon we are going to use our model to choose an action to perform so to do these right

16
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.970
actions is equal to self doubt model that we defined in the previous video and for the argument right

17
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
here we are going to provide our state we need to return a single number.

18
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.930
So we are going to use our empty dot our max to return only an action which has the highest probability

19
00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.450
as the argument for the ARG Max will put actions of zero because of the output shape and that's it.

20
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.160
We define our trade function rules repeat what this function does it takes the state as an input and

21
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.470
then generates a random number.

22
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.890
If that the generated number is less than or equal to epsilon at the very beginning it is going to be

23
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.440
always less than epsilon.

24
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.720
This function will return totally random they generated or truth in numbers between 0 or 2 and that

25
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.210
is our actions then.

26
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.550
If this is not the case this function will call our model and perform prediction based on the input

27
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.930
state and return only and the action that has the highest probability or the likelihood between those

28
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.100
free actions and that's it for now in the next video will define our custom train function.

29
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.950
If you have any questions or comments so far please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll

30
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.190
see you in the next tutorial.
