Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.010
In this video we are going to complete our data validation project by freezing our schema for later

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.940
use.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.720
This is very useful for other stages of end to end pipeline or just data validation.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.050
In the later process the most exciting part about this step is that we can complete it in single line

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.910
of code.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400
So let's do that right.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.870
Do you have DV dot right schema text and this function takes two arguments.

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.870
Our schema and output path for the first one we'll just write schema is equal to schema.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.060
The second one is the output path which represents the name of the file that is going to contain our

11
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.660
frozen schema in this case.

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.410
We are going to name it pollutions schema dot baby text and that is the extension of the file that this

13
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.690
library saves execute the cell.

14
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.860
And by doing that we saved our schema.

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.130
Let's check our files of the project to see if we have a new one.

16
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.190
And as you can see there is a new file called pollution scheme under the pretext we have everything

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.870
saved for later reuse.

18
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.880
If you have any questions or comments so far please buzz them in the comments section.

19
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.980
Otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
