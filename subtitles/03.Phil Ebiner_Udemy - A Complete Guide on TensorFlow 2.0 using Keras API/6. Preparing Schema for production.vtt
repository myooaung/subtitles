Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.400
In the previous video we explained what anomalies are and how to detect them using TV when we drop the

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.340
suit smooth column the t of the V.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.230
Recognize that as a missing column anomaly which is a typical case since we created a schema for the

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.540
whole dataset but in the serving time we wont have the column anymore since that is our target column

6
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.180
which we are trying to predict we can solve this very easily by using different environments in the

7
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.720
current schema one for the training time and other for the serving.

8
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.640
So let's create those environments in this video in the first free cell right schema the default environment

9
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.090
default environment is just a list of all environments that we can find in our schema to add the new

10
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.850
environment name to our schema just write append and now we need to specify environment name that we

11
00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.560
want to add I'll just add training let's copy this line and pasted below change training to serving

12
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.420
and execute the cell.

13
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.350
Now we have two environments currently unused but two environments one for training and other for serving

14
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.640
since you won't have the target column in The serving time.

15
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.820
We need to remove it from the schema using our environment.

16
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.920
We can easily modify the current schema in the way that suit column is expected in the training time

17
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.470
and not expected in the serving to do this.

18
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.720
Just right t DV don't get feature.

19
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.690
This function takes two arguments a schema and a feature that we want to retrieve.

20
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.460
So provide our schema is the first argument ensued as a second one to exclude the feature from our environment

21
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.470
just right but not the environment that depend in here.

22
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.620
We need to specify environment name so we are.

23
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.270
Case we want to specify serving with this very intuitive line of code.

24
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.500
The column named Sood will be expected in the training time and not expected in the serving to track

25
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.650
today so let's compare our environment with our test set copy that doesn't have the suit feature anymore

26
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.710
just write serving EMV anomalies is equal to TDB dot validate statistics just as before in this function

27
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.770
takes as the first argument our statistics.

28
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.490
That is our test set copy stats that we generated in the previous video and for the second argument

29
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.170
is our schema but in this case we are going to specify our per day argument as well our environment

30
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.160
so here we are going to say just serving and execute a cell remember last time that we compared our

31
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.710
test set of statistics.

32
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.410
We got an anomaly saying that our suit column is missing since we did expect it in the whole schema

33
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.890
with the whole dataset to display anomalies as before just right t the v dot these play anomalies and

34
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.960
provide serving EMV anomalies execute the cell as you can see we done have the anomaly anymore so we

35
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.530
did successfully excluded it from the serving time but we still have it in the training time and that's

36
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.460
it for now.

37
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
If you have any questions or comments please post them in the comments section.

38
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.430
Otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
