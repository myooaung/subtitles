Hello everyone and welcome to despite an editorial in this video we are going to start with our data

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,490
validation project.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,450
In the first step of our data validation project is to import all dependencies that we are going to

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,470
use.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,480
So let me walk you through them.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,710
The first dependency is pandas we'll be using this library to read and see as few files of our data

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,440
set then we have tens of flow in case we use any functions from it.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,490
Next up is our transit flow data validation package.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,550
Next up is our tens offload data validation package which we installed in the previous video because

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,920
I'm using Python 2 instead of Python free.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,330
I'm importing these brain function from the future so we can use the same brain function that we use

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,660
so far in Python free.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,870
Now we can start with inputting our data set and performing a simple data analysis before we start using

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,780
tens offload data validation package.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,370
The first step is to import the data set.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,750
Let's call it data set equal to be the shorter for pandas daughter read CSP.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,660
And now here we have to specify the name of our data set file in our case it is pollution small dots

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,560
he is fee execute the cell we imported the data set we can check in the shape of the data set to see

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,040
how many samples we have in it and because we have the data set of two thousand and almost two hundred

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,850
samples we are going to split in the training set and the test set it is not necessary for this section

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,670
but we are going to do this anyways since we want to demonstrate a few additional things that turns

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,710
the flow data validation can do right.

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,510
Training data is equal to data set and now we will see the first sixteen hundred samples are going to

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:58,750
be our training data then we will use the same technique for the test set but before we do that let

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,360
us describe our training data to see what statistics we have in our training data portion so to do that

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,140
right.

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:15,070
Training data that describe you can see that we have a few columns in our data set we will explain each

28
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,550
column in a second on the left side we have all statistics that our described function calculated for

29
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:30,750
us for example the standard deviation for each column demean the value minimum maximum and so on each

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,720
column in the data set is a type of particle in air that we are going to measure based on the volume

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,740
of each particle on a particular day we can determine if the air is good or bad let's do something more

32
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,580
interesting we will say that the suit the variable of our data set is our target variable we are going

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,740
to use m 10 and 0 2 and S.O. 2 to see how well we can perform prediction of the suit variable but just

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,500
keep this in mind since we are not going to dig into modelling or creating models for prediction we

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,170
are going to use this information to create environments for our data set later on in the last task

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:21,380
for our video is to create our test set so let's write test set is equal to data set and use this sixteen

37
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,470
hundred and arrest of the samples to be in the test set let us describe the test set as well to compare

38
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:37,700
statistics now we can see the statistics of the test set as you can see there as you can see there is

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,500
around 600 points in the test set also the standard deviation the mean and the minimum values are similar

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,370
to the ones in our training set and that's it for now in the next video we'll start with our analysis

41
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,820
and validation by using our Denzel flow data validation package if you have any questions or comments

42
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,980
so far please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
