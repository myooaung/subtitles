Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:11,080
In this video we are going to create our tensor flow light converter the converter is there to convert

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:21,270
saved model to tens of low light version of it so it can be loaded and served over a mobile device OK.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:30,820
Let's create it now right converter or you can name it whatever you want and equal to of the light which

5
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:40,500
is the API for our tens of low light dot of light converter and now we can choose what resources our

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,390
model comes from.

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,830
For example we have this frozen graph version or a session that are used for denser flow one models.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:57,190
In our case we have these tend to flow from Kara's model file this function takes one argument which

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,460
is the model name and in our case this is the string that has H5 extension.

10
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,810
You can copy it from the cell above and paste it inside the brackets execute a cell and this converter

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,070
is going to define all frozen variables and OBS that can be found in our model.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,940
And now we have officially created our converter for our specific model.

13
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,860
That's it for our video.

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,830
The only thing left to do is to call this converter and convert our model for now if you have any questions

15
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,580
or comments please post them in the comments section.

16
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,870
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
