00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,720
Hi guys and welcome to this very first practical section on tens of Flo 2.0.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,690
This is in this section that we will get introduced to censor flow 2.0.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,770
But before as you see we're just going to have a quick refresh on tons of floor one just so that we

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,890
can see the main difference and the main added value of 10th floor 2.0 with respect to tens of floor

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,700
one.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:31,400
So right now what we have in front of us is a Jupiter notebook environment on Google collaboratively.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,110
This is super practical you'll get many notebooks in this course where you will have basically all the

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,460
tents flow sin taxes that are used in general for several purposes whether it is to work with constants

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,060
and variables or to build neural networks or even to build convolution rule and recurrent neural networks.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,360
So you'll have several notebooks and this first notebook that we have right now contains the general

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,520
features and the general tools of tensor flow 2.0 with of course a little recap on tensor flow one.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,880
So you're going to see we're going to learn everything about the constants how to define a constant

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,410
how to get the values of a constant.

14
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,440
Same for the variables how to define a variable how to get the values of a variable how to change a

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:23,040
specific value in a variable will see all the different operations we have with dancers like in addition

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,130
multiplication how to use them by functions on since flow dancers and how to do a dot product between

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,740
two dancers and then we'll even study how to work with strings with Dancer flow.

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,310
So that's one notebook.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,530
And the approach we're going to take in this course is going to be quite different from our previous

20
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,720
courses because I'm not going to type in front of you all the different tense flow commands that we

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,130
have in each notebook.

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,790
And the reason for this is that I wanted to make this new course much more interactive than before.

23
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,490
In fact after each notebook that we're going to see in this course you're gonna have a series of practical

24
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,200
activities you know little exercises which will check your knowledge and skills on each notebook.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,060
So the way this is going to go is that I'm going to explain each notebook in each of the cells step

26
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,810
by step until the end after which you will get a series of exercises on the same notebook.

27
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,170
Explain me just before and actually these little exercises are a new feature of Udemy.

28
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,660
You know now you can make some video lectures but you can also make some coding exercises.

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,030
So this is going to be quite new.

30
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,440
The approach basically is in three phases.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,690
First we see the notebook together.

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,580
I'm going to explain each of the sales and I'm going to explain all the different concepts and techniques

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,800
and tools of tense flow 2.0.

34
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,820
Then second phase you'll get a series of exercises.

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,030
And finally third phase you'll get the solution.

36
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,850
So let's do this let's start with this first notebook just to get us introduced to tens of Luke 2.0

37
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,460
with the general features and then we'll move onto some more advanced features of tensor flow which

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,020
are of course you know to build artificial new one that works convolution on the one that works.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,110
Record new networks and actually much much more you're going to have a very broad course on tensor flow

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,860
2.0 covering basically all its techniques.

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,650
So let's do this let's first get the basics of tensor flow and as we said I just want to do this little

42
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,160
quick tour on 10th floor one for us because I want you to understand the main new features of tentacle

43
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,980
2.0 with respect to tens of flow one.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:36,890
So first of all the first cell here just installs denser flow one you know you install it with the pip

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:43,110
command preceded by an exclamation mark then you just click the play button here but by the way you

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,700
won't have to execute any of the cells even though you could you know if you want to execute them again

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,510
you can but what's good about a Jupiter notebook environment is that you can keep the output of each

48
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,460
cell and that's what I did for each of the notebook you were gonna have all the outputs that I executed

49
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,360
myself.

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,290
So this is the output of running this and indeed you install a series of dependencies after which you

51
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,050
install tensor flow GP you and that intensive low one.

52
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,560
Then of course after installing it you have to import it.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,980
And that's what this next cell is doing.

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
And then if you want you can get the version I give you the syntax for that.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,090
And indeed we're using tensor flow one point thirteen point one.

56
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,550
No worries we'll soon get to 10th floor 2.0 then let's see what we have.

57
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,010
So as you can see intensively one quick refresh that I want to do is only on constants and variables

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,470
because this is where we have a big difference.

59
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,290
Intensive load 2.0 and you can already suspect what this big difference is going to be.

60
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,000
It's actually about how to get the values of a constant and a variable.

61
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,610
So we'll get to that right now.

62
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,970
First how to define a constant.

63
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,870
Well that's really easy.

64
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,650
You do this thanks to the constant function which you take from tensor flow you know that's the shortcut

65
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,500
TAF we gave the of floor library.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,170
So this constant function takes as input a tensor because usually you know when you create a constant

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,120
or variable intense flow it is a tensor.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,940
You know most of its sense of flow variables and constants you create or tensor is because the whole

69
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,820
point of working with sense of flow is to use its advanced sensors because they have a lot of properties

70
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,280
and lot of tools that actually allow you to build for example advanced deep learning or aim or all such

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,860
as artificial neural networks or you networks.

72
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,900
So whenever you're going to create a sense of low constant or tense of a variable it will usually be

73
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,650
a tensor.

74
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,930
So that's why I called here the tensor flow constant tensor.

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,120
And so inside this constant function you're going to input Well the shape and the values of your tensor.

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,660
So here we have a double square brackets meaning it's a 2D tensor composed of two rows and two columns.

77
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:51,950
Okay.

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,260
So then after you define your tensor flow constant well you can call it but you won't get the values

79
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,710
actually you will just get the shape of it.

80
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,550
And indeed it's a two by two tensor and you will get the type of values inside.

81
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,830
And indeed they are integers but then.

82
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,340
And that's where we get to the main difference between sense for one intensive flow two if you want

83
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,460
to accept the values of your tensor you know twenty three for thirty two fifty one well you have this

84
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,890
method called a vowel you know the AVAiL method which you call from your tensor flow constant which

85
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:32,760
we call tensor but in order to call this a well function you know to get the values of this tensor Well

86
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,580
you have to initialize what we call a sense of flow session that was intensive low one whenever you

87
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,710
want to access the values of a constant and you will see that it will be the same for a tenth of the

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,410
variable Well you have to initialize a session first and that's why right now we haven't initialized

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,210
any session yet.

90
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,060
And therefore when we call the event method to get the values of this tensor Well we get value error

91
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:04,200
and it even explains why we get such an error this is because no default session is registered.

92
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,530
Right.

93
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,680
So you have to register a session you have to initialize a session and actually initialize all the variables

94
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,400
that are going to be in this session in order to access the values constant or variable.

95
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,180
And so now.

96
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,300
Well let's see in the next section how to get the values of a constant by therefore initializing a session.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,670
And that's why in the next section here in order to get the values of the constant the same constants

98
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:36,000
we introduced before while the first thing we do is we initialize a session and to do so well we introduce

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,020
a new variable that I chose to call session which is created as an instance of the session class the

100
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,010
session class which is a class by tensor flow so that initialize is your session.

101
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,840
But then as I told you you also need to initialize all the variables inside your session and you do

102
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,920
this with the run method to which input to the global variables initialized that's an initialized of

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,580
all the global variables in your session then you're going to connect your tensor to the initialize

104
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,000
session with the run method again and that will return a new variable which we called tensor value because

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,820
now indeed when we call tensor value well we're able to get the values inside this constant tensor right

106
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,670
this time since we have our registered session well we can access the values of the constant tensor.

107
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,960
All right.

108
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,950
So again I'm showing you this because you're going to see that it will be different with tensor flow

109
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,520
2.0 and actually a lot of people were so happy about this.

110
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,420
You're going to see that indeed with tens of Look 2.0 it is much easier to access the values of a constant

111
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,090
and a variable.

112
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,380
So speaking a variable Well now let's get a quick refresh on the variables intensive floor one how to

113
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,960
define first it turns a flow variable.

114
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,980
Well this time you're not gonna use a function here you're going to use a class which is the variable

115
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,970
class called from the tenth floor library of course.

116
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:08,430
Therefore your variable is actually an instance of that variable class but same inside this variable

117
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,410
class you're going to input the shape of your tensor with of course its values right.

118
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,190
Once again when defining intensity variable it's usually a tensor.

119
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:24,420
That's why I chose as an example to create a sense of variable then it's the same when you call your

120
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,630
variable this way without doing anything else.

121
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,450
Well you will only get the shape which is a two by two tensor with integers inside.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,730
Okay.

123
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,070
But you don't get any values and same again if a session is not initialized.

124
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,740
Well you can access the values of the variable indeed you know you accept the values of your variable

125
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,190
with the Val method which you call from your variable tensor but then you get this value error because

126
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,490
indeed no default session is registered.

127
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:53,840
All right.

128
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,840
So same in order to get the values of a variable while you first have to initialize a session would

129
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:07,170
you do the same way by creating a session object as an instance of the session class by tense of flow.

130
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,910
Then you initialize all the variables from the session with the run method that takes his input.

131
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,840
The initialize the tip that global variables initialized and then actually for a variable you can just

132
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,080
directly call the Val method from it.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,130
Because remember the difference with the constant is that you know your variable is an object you know

134
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,510
an instance of the variable class in the variable class has directly this evolved method that allows

135
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,140
you to access the values of the variable but only if the session is registered and that's why in the

136
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,840
event method you know as opposed to what we did here in the event method you have to input that session.

137
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,410
Here we did input any session so we had a value error but now we registered a session we input it in

138
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,480
the event method and there we go.

139
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,170
We get the values all right so that's it for potential flow 1.

140
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,120
Now we're not going to hear ever again about tensor floor 1.

141
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,800
We can move on to 10th flow 2.0 and you're going to see the main difference around the basics of tensor

142
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,990
flow which is of course how to get the values of a variable.

143
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,250
