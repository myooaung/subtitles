Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.950
In this video we will calculate statistics based on the test set.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.310
Let's do that right.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.870
Test the stats is equal to the DV Dodd generates statistics from data frame and then provide for a data

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.720
frame set to test set execute a cell.

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.640
And we successfully generated statistics based on the test set alone.

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.230
That's it for this video.
