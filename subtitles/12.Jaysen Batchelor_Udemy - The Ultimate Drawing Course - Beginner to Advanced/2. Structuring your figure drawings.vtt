00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.480
All right in this lecture I'm going to teach you how to break down the human form into simple geometric

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.480
shapes that you can then replicate to draw a human body in any pose that you like.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.220
So let's go ahead and get started so I'm here in Photoshop because this is the easiest place for me

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.640
to draw.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.100
On top of my image for you.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.760
So I usually like to break down the head into a simple circle so I can go ahead and draw a circle over

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.320
that.

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.760
And if you wanted to you can even add an A point for it in the chin.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.380
Next I like to go ahead and break down the chest and the pelvis area into two separate shapes.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.270
Now depending on whether it's a male or female the shapes are going to be different.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.580
So this is a male in this case.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.410
And so we're going to break down the chest into a rectangular cube shape just like so.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.110
And then the pelvis is also going to get broken down into a rectangular cube shape except this one is

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.210
actually twisting so the body is actually ingoing the bottom part of the pelvis like so that we can

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.120
go ahead and make that front face just like so.

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.630
Go ahead and add the side face to that rectangular cube and the top face.

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.640
So you can see there the bottom gets broken down into two very simple geometric three dimensional shapes.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.260
Next let's go ahead and add in the legs.

19
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.260
So the legs get broken down into very simple cylinders so the cylinder starts over here and it comes

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.320
all the way to here and we can go ahead and draw that end of the cylinder and then that side of it.

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.460
Then you can go ahead and break down this bottom part of the leg or the shin and the calf into its own

22
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.500
separate cylinder and then we can go ahead and break the foot down into its own shape and its shape

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.060
is going to kind of be like a triangle like so.

24
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.830
We can go ahead and get the side.

25
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.570
So I'm gonna start the cylinder right there and then I'm going to come all the way to the knee.

26
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.210
That's where your cylinder is going to end.

27
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.020
You get that side also.

28
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.170
And then will go ahead and continue the next cylinder which will be the calf and the shin just like

29
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.010
so at the end to that.

30
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.790
And then we can add that the foot in the foot can just be a basic shape like so.

31
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.250
And if you wanted to you could even add a little bit of a bottom surface to that and the arms are going

32
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.300
to be very similar to the legs they're going to be broken down into cylinders so you can start the cylinder

33
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.660
right there and it will continue all the way to our elbow.

34
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.490
Now we can at the end of our cylinder and then we'll go ahead and do the same thing for the fore arm.

35
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.690
Go ahead and create a cylinder and the cylinders on the form and the shin of the leg.

36
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.090
They tend to taper off.

37
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.920
So I like to make those get smaller towards the end towards the hand and the feet can go ahead and add

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.710
in the hand.

39
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.790
Now you can't see it very well in this drawing so will destroy on it as best we can.

40
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.200
And then we'll go ahead and move on to the other arm.

41
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.330
So add one cylinder right there.

42
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.960
And in some cases you're looking straight onto the cylinder and so you're not going to see the circular

43
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.200
face which is what's happening in this case.

44
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.760
Go ahead and extend that cylinder all the way no go ahead and add in our hand.

45
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.750
So my hand I also like to break it up into one simple sort of rectangular cube type shape.

46
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.720
And then I like to add the thumb and the other fingers to that like so and then if you wanted to you

47
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.940
could also add an a line for the neck.

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.820
So there is a neckline.

49
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.240
You can also add a line for the spine and that will tell you in which way the back is turning.

50
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.840
All right.

51
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.680
Let's try a another one.

52
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.140
So this is a female form and female forms have a little bit different shape than men.

53
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.740
So rather than having squared cube blocks for the torso and the pelvis it actually is more of a cone

54
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.100
shapes.

55
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.390
I get the tips cut off.

56
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.650
So let me show you what I mean.

57
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.250
So I'd like to start off by creating a circular or oval shape here at the top for the top of my cone

58
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.500
shape and then that comes down into sort of a trap is void type shape but it's actually three dimensional

59
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.150
so it's got a round edge on it down here at the bottom.

60
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.450
So that's our first shape for the torso part of our body.

61
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.410
Now we can go ahead and do the bottom side and it's going to be the same exact shape.

62
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.130
It's just going to be turned upside down.

63
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.470
So those are top face.

64
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.030
And rather than being bigger on the top and some are on the bottom it's smaller on the top and bigger

65
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.150
on the bottom so we come down here like so and then we can go ahead and drawn that curve just like so

66
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.780
unless the basic shape for the main part of the female body then next what we want to do is want to

67
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.610
go ahead and add in the legs and the arms.

68
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.720
And this is going to be done exactly like we would do on a guy.

69
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:32.130
So we start with the cylinder for the legs and then we go ahead and add in the cylinder for the calf

70
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.190
and the shin area which tapers off as we get down to the foot and then we'll go ahead and add in the

71
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.070
actual foot itself which is just sort of a box type of a shape like so then we could go ahead and do

72
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.770
the other leg.

73
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.060
And since this hand is in front of it I'm going to try to steer clear of that.

74
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.180
We can still get this edge of the cylinder and it can come behind that hand like so go ahead and get

75
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.710
that top side of the cylinder.

76
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.850
And I leave out the kneecaps you don't really have to add that in.

77
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.910
It's when you're drawing final drawing you want to add in that line that comes around your kneecap.

78
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.920
But in this case you don't really need that.

79
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.310
We're just trying to figure out what the basic geometrical shapes are.

80
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.370
And we can go ahead and add in this bottom cylinder which will also taper off towards the foot and then

81
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.080
we can go ahead and add in that foot shape and the bottom of it is going to have sort of a surface like

82
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.940
so and just get broken down into a very simple geometrical form.

83
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:36.090
Now let's go ahead and do the arm so the arms also get broken down into a cylinder shape's.

84
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.370
And then I like to break the hands down into basically a rectangular cube before the main part of the

85
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.380
hand and then the fingers are individually drawn in there.

86
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:52.110
So add in thumb and index finger like so and then I'll go ahead and move on to the other arm.

87
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.920
So that gets its own cylinder and then the seam with this one

88
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.350
then I'll go ahead and add and the rectangular cube before the hand just like so and then I'll add and

89
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.550
the fingers just like so.

90
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.760
And then we can go ahead and sketch in a circle for the head and we can even add a chin to that and

91
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.320
then I can go ahead and add in my next shape which is just two lines.

92
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.950
And then I can add in the curved line from my spine and that line just needs to go right through the

93
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.890
center of these two main shapes for the body and that will show you exactly where your spine is and

94
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.480
also where your body is curving and turn at.

95
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.210
Now I want to show you a second technique that I use for drawing body forms.

96
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.210
So this one is a little bit simpler and you can do it much quicker I think.

97
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.970
And so what you do is you basically start off with your head.

98
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.040
So let's go ahead and draw on top of this head.

99
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.790
So we at our circle can add that Chinen snow we ever had.

100
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.340
Next you want to go ahead and break the top part of the chest up into one shape so one oval like so.

101
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.870
And since we're actually looking at this from a down angle sort of because he's bending over this is

102
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.540
going to turn into almost a perfect circle.

103
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.790
But if you're drawing this from a standing up straight pose this would actually be more of an oval.

104
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.990
So I'd be much more stretched out and then down here at the bottom you get a circle so it'll be an oval

105
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.800
for the chest area and a circle for the pelvis area.

106
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.180
So let's go ahead and add in the circle like so and then next what you want to do is you want to go

107
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.820
ahead and find the way your center is for your spine and then you also want to create a line for your

108
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.280
shoulder.

109
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.210
So we create a line right across the top like so.

110
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.220
And then this is the fun part.

111
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.860
This is where you get to actually draw in a lightning bolt.

112
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.260
So the lightning bolt starts up here and it comes down like so down this side of the arm and then right

113
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.010
here at the elbow.

114
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.270
It's going to come back up and then come out like so.

115
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.710
So there's your lightning ball.

116
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.620
This is a really quick way to define where your muscles are.

117
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.950
So you get the top half of your muscles and then down here you get the bottom half.

118
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:56.730
So here you get your for our muscles and up here you get your bicep and your shoulder muscle.

119
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.170
So now we can go ahead and finish the line on the other side.

120
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.270
Same with this other side just like so and then we can go ahead and just add any sort of a circle for

121
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.260
the hands and then you can add the fingers on top of that circle.

122
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.770
We can do the same thing for the other side.

123
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.030
So we start the lightning bolt down this side.

124
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.580
Then at the elbow we go ahead and come back up and then come down and that creates that lightning bolt

125
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.380
shape.

126
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.190
And now we can go ahead and add in the other side of the arm to create that muscle.

127
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:25.390
Then we add a circle and then the fingers next we can go ahead and move on to the legs so the legs are

128
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.840
just like the arms.

129
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.900
So we use light nimble shapes to draw those out and we always start with the outside edge.

130
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.920
So we'll go ahead and draw the outside edge like so for the outside of our Lightning Bolt.

131
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.920
And then at the knee we'll go ahead and bring that back up and then we'll come back down and curve it

132
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.430
in the opposite direction for our calf and come all the way down into our ankle like so.

133
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.270
So there's a quick lightning bolt shape.

134
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.460
And then we can go ahead and do the other side.

135
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.840
So we'll add in a line right there and then we'll add in the line on this side.

136
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.980
Now generally your legs are going to be longer than the main part of your body so keep that in mind

137
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.570
if they are shorter.

138
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.960
It's going to look a little bit funny.

139
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.130
But that might be what you want your character to look like.

140
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.310
So that's OK.

141
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.270
Just make sure that you know you're breaking that rule.

142
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.170
Now go ahead and add in the feet and so for the feet I just like to add in sort of a really quick shape

143
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.930
for the feet like so.

144
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.020
And then I'll go ahead and do the other side so start on the outside edge.

145
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:27.040
Then we come back up and then we come down and create that calf and then come down into our goal and

146
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:34.540
we'll go ahead and get the other side like so we can go ahead and drill that foot in just a very simple

147
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.790
shape like so great.

148
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.020
Now let's go ahead and move on to a final form and try the same technique.

149
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.310
Now this is a little bit different because we're actually drawing her from the side but it'll still

150
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.930
work.

151
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.710
So we start with the head so we add in our circle for the head.

152
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:55.950
We can add in our chin if we'd like then we can go ahead and find the Center for our back or our spine.

153
00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.410
So we'll go ahead and draw right through like So next we want to do is we want to go ahead and find

154
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.380
that top oval shape for the chest area.

155
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.570
So we'll go ahead and draw that in like so and then we'll go ahead and draw and the bottom circle which

156
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:16.330
kind of falls right into the pelvis and also lines kind of right up with the but then we're going to

157
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.340
go ahead and add in the arms.

158
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.270
So just like we did with a guy the arms are exactly the same.

159
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.070
We create a lightning bolt like so then you come back.

160
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.320
And since her arm is bent instead of coming down like this to finish that lightning bolt the lightning

161
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.470
bolt just gets turned and warped a little bit.

162
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.080
So the lightning bolt comes like so then we'll go ahead and added the two other lines and then we can

163
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.500
go ahead and add in this leg right here.

164
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.650
So just the same we create a light bulb so light goes on the top side of the leg.

165
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:52.120
Then it comes right through there and this leg is bent also so we have come over like so so our light

166
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.400
and bone gets warped.

167
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.980
Now we can go ahead and add the other lines.

168
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.350
Then we can go ahead and add in the shape for the foot and then we'll go ahead and do the same thing

169
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.030
for the other side.

170
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.760
So the lightning bolt starts on this front side and I'm just going to draw right through leg just for

171
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.360
demonstration purposes.

172
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.810
So we come all the way through like so that we come back up and this leg you'll actually see the light

173
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.820
and pull a lot more because we're actually drawn it from a straight perspective and we can go ahead

174
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.920
and add the other side and add this line for the front of the shin and then we can go ahead and add

175
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.260
in the foot like so perfect.

176
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.640
All right.

177
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:37.180
Now let's go ahead and jump back in with our paper and draw some of these from scratch right soon.

178
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.020
Now let's go ahead and break up these drawings into their simple shape.

179
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.590
So now go ahead and switch this out with a blank piece of paper.

180
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.350
No we can go ahead and get started.

181
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.260
So I'm going to start with the female figure.

182
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:57.210
So if you remember the finger can be broken up into basically to trap as always or cylinder type trap

183
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.800
as void shapes.

184
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.540
So let's go out and start with the top half of it.

185
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.070
And so the top of it is going to actually get a straight edge on the bottom and it's going to get a

186
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.040
little bit of a rounded curve at the top.

187
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:14.320
We can go ahead and connect that like so and I'm looking at my reference still even though I'm drawing

188
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.260
out of shapes but I want to see how the lines are interacting with each other.

189
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.430
Next we can go ahead and do our bottom once at the bottom and we're going to see a little bit of that

190
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:27.200
top surface as this one is slanting a little bit more back than this one.

191
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:33.310
So we'll go ahead and add that in like so now I'm going to go ahead and round out the bottom just like

192
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.240
so then we can go ahead and add in our leagues.

193
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.830
So for this fight it's going to be one cylinder like so go ahead and round out that bottom and then

194
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.930
we'll do another solidary here for this part of the leg then go ahead and that in the foot which will

195
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.950
basically just be a block.

196
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.790
So let's go ahead and do the other one.

197
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:57.760
So go ahead and add this one in an almost straight down.

198
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.670
Go ahead and add in the bottom part.

199
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:07.210
Lay it all out in this foot which is also going to basically be a box and then we'll go ahead and add

200
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.630
in this arm so this arm is going to be one cylinder right there.

201
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.710
In the lab and a second cylinder and actually that cylinder is coming out a little bit too far.

202
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.060
My reference to arms comes straight down.

203
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:25.310
So many go ahead and add in that cylinder come straight down like so and I go ahead and around that

204
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.190
and I'll go ahead and do the second part.

205
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:34.440
So I had that cylinder in now and add in the hand which will basically just be a basic shape like cells

206
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.500
and I can go ahead and do it.

207
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.480
The other one.

208
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:46.100
So go ahead and drawn my cylinder for the first part of my arm and I'll draw on the second cylinder

209
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.110
so the second cylinder will be behind this one a little bit will come down like so then they can go

210
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.670
ahead and add in my hand and my hand going to break it up into one box like so and then I'll have each

211
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.400
one of my fingers so then I can go ahead and add in my head.

212
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.600
So my head is basically just going to be a sphere.

213
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.330
So if you wanted to you can go ahead and add in a little bit more detail a little bit more shape in

214
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.210
there and even at in the neck if you wanted to.

215
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.130
But for now that's good.

216
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.750
Now let's go ahead and try drawing this in my other technique.

217
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:27.630
So basically what we want to start off with is an oval for the chest area and then we want to do a second

218
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:37.140
Oval or circle for the bottom area like so then we can go ahead and add in the middle line for our spine

219
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.370
then that comes up into the neck and we can go ahead and add the head in like so.

220
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.660
Number we want to do is we want to add in those lightning bolts for the arms.

221
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.640
So first we want to find where that shoulder line is and then going to go ahead and add in the first

222
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:50.990
night.

223
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.400
Lightning bolts so it comes down like so to about there and it comes up and it comes down and we can

224
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.870
go ahead and fill that in further.

225
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.410
So and then I'll go ahead and do this one.

226
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.620
So the lighting ball comes out I remember it it starts on the top side of the arm.

227
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:09.700
Then it comes back in and then you get the inside of the other part of the arm the fore arm.

228
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:16.690
So that will go ahead at that and like so you can go and fill that in perfect.

229
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.730
Then what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and add in my legs so the legs are the same way so I

230
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.730
had my lightning bolt.

231
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.710
And the legs tend to be longer than the main part of the body or the chest and the pelvis.

232
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.580
So we want to make sure that we make these legs a little bit longer when we draw this.

233
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:38.760
So there is a first leg so we can go ahead and add in a simple shape for the foot and move to the other

234
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.030
side also.

235
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:46.950
So we'll come straight down like some of them come up and come down like that and we can go and fill

236
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.680
those in and drawn our foot.

237
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.960
And because a little funny looking for someone to go out and fix that that's very rough.

238
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.310
This is just your base for the actual finished drawn.

239
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:05.080
And we can go ahead and add in more detail on the hips.

240
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.400
So and maybe a little bit more detail on the hands.

241
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.700
So that's a very quick and basic way to draw the form.

242
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.080
Let's try doing the male form really quick with our three dimensional shapes.

243
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.740
So many go ahead and start by drawing the head.

244
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.580
I find that the head is usually the best thing to start drawing.

245
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.820
And then I like to move down the body.

246
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:31.140
So next about it is I'll go ahead and find my chest shape so my chest is just going to be a rectangular

247
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.280
shape.

248
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.580
So remember that men tend to be a lot more square than women.

249
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.060
And then he sort of turns.

250
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:46.600
So what we want to do is we want to add a little bit of a twist to this square right there like so now

251
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.560
we'll go ahead and add in this leg right here so go ahead.

252
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.710
Sketchiness cylinder do the same thing for down here for this part of the leg.

253
00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:00.310
The calf could sketch that shape and then I can go ahead and scratch in the foot

254
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.750
don't say go ahead and do this back legs so I'll go ahead and and that cylinder.

255
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:15.880
And then I can go in and finish it behind that's part of the leg and then only go ahead and add in the

256
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.810
calf part and then I'll add in that last foot which is basically a box.

257
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.750
I like to just break it up into a simple sort of body shape like so and then I'll go ahead and add in

258
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.380
the arm.

259
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.870
So at this cylinder right here

260
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.140
having this cylinder here.

261
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.050
And I can add in the hand.

262
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:42.770
And so the hand is just going to be a very basic little sketch of the thumb and the fingers.

263
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.530
You can spend more time on that and I'm trying to sketch this in really quickly.

264
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.230
And later you can come back and add more detail than I want to go ahead and add in the other arm.

265
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.330
So the other arm starts right there it's just a cylinder.

266
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.200
And then we'll go ahead and add the second part of the arm.

267
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.150
Now go ahead and add the hand.

268
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.320
So the hand is just going to be a basic box shaped like so in the morning go ahead and add in the thumb

269
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.340
and we can add in all the other fingers too.

270
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.840
We can actually just make that one sort of shape just like so and if you wanted to you can go ahead

271
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.440
and shape that head out a little bit more here and there.

272
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:25.470
But the idea behind this is you want to start looking at the body in the form as simple shapes.

273
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.820
And once you can start breaking them down into simple shapes drawing humans out of your head is going

274
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.570
to be much much easier.

275
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.040
You're going to have a much better understanding of human form.

276
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.360
Another thing is that if you don't understand human form it's going to be very difficult for you to

277
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.120
drop things like animated characters that still have bodies but they're going to be more exaggerated

278
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.120
skinnier in some areas more elongated in other areas.

279
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.150
And if you don't understand how the real body form works you're not going to be able to draw images

280
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.600
like that.

281
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.370
So it's really important that you study the body form.

282
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.570
So your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and find some reference images or use the ones that

283
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.510
you used in the previous lecture and go ahead and try to redraw those drawings.

284
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:14.100
But using these simple shapes so first do the one where you use actual three dimensional form the cylinders

285
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.000
and the square shapes and the cubes.

286
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:22.470
And then I want you to go ahead and try drawing a really quick figure using this technique where we

287
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:28.470
first find the chest and then the pelvis and I find that the spine.

288
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.240
And then we find the shoulders and then we add in the light in bolts for the arms and the legs.

289
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.890
And then we add in our head.

290
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.120
I want you to go ahead and experiment with that and practice and once you get one that you think looks

291
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:45.330
really good go ahead and post that to the Q and A section of the Course or the Facebook page.

292
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.660
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
