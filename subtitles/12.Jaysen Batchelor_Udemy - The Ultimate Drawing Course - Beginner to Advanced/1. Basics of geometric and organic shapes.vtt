00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.780
A write in this lecture we're going to go ahead and talk about shapes now what shapes are the second

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.050
most important thing when it comes to drawing next to lines.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.060
So what is a shape.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Well there's two different types of shapes.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
There's geometrical shapes and there's organic shapes.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
Now you're probably pretty familiar with both but you're probably more familiar with geometric shapes.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.240
These are the shapes that you grew up with and learned about in school.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.650
So the simple shapes that make up the basic geometric shapes are first the square which can also then

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.250
be turned on its side to make a diamond.

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.470
And then there's also the circle.

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.940
Then there's the triangle.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.740
Then there's the trap as a way

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.960
and then there's the practical.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.340
So these are the basic shapes that make up basically everything.

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.940
Now what are organic shapes well.

16
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.030
Or any sheet or anything that aren't geometrical geometrical means that it can be figured out using

17
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.860
math.

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.820
So a triangle you can create a triangle by using map but an organic shape.

19
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.700
Nowadays you can actually create organic shapes using math but it's a lot more technical So an organic

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.520
shape would be let's say the shape of a pumpkin.

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.110
So if I just drew the outline of a pumpkin like so that's an organic shape or an organic shape could

22
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.210
be something very scribbly like cell or another organic shape could be let's say a coffee mug so I can

23
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.170
draw me cause I'm like so.

24
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.840
And that is in organic shape it's not geometrical and geometrical also means that you can split it right

25
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.350
down the middle and it's the same on both sides.

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.370
These are organic because you can do this you kind of can't with a pumpkin but the pumpkin is still

27
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.510
considered more of an organic shape.

28
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.970
Now everything can be broken down into these basic shapes and from those basic shapes what you do next

29
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.220
is you create organic shapes.

30
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.490
So for example let's say we're drawing character and the character's head is going to be a circle.

31
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.040
OK.

32
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.910
So we're going to draw a circle like so and then they're going to have a bottom.

33
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.530
Let's say the body is a skinny rectangle like so.

34
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660
And then let's say we need to add some legs in there.

35
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.100
So we're just going to draw it in triangles for the legs for now and they're a little bit curved.

36
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.500
And then let's say the feet are rectangles like so and then you need some arms so will do triangles

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.140
for the arms long triangles.

38
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.080
And then we'll do circles for his hands and we can also add this arm behind his body like so what you'll

39
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.180
see is completely made out of simple shapes.

40
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.780
Let's try something else.

41
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.880
Let's say we want to draw a link up.

42
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
Well a lamp can also be broken down into simple shapes.

43
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.350
Now even though there's going to be some perspective involved with this lamp when you're first trying

44
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.070
to sketch out your images you want to start with simple shapes so for a lamp we might start with a lampshade

45
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.150
that will just be a simple trap as a way and then we're going to create the base.

46
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.190
Now the base can be any type of shape you want.

47
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.250
For me it's going to be an oval which that's also another thing is the circle can also is also considered

48
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.420
an ellipse and so ovals also apply to the simple shapes.

49
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.370
So let's go ahead and add that in so I added in like so.

50
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.420
And then we can go ahead and add an rectangle for the stem for the neck of our lamp.

51
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.050
And now we have a lot of very basic shapes.

52
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.350
Now once you get it to this point then you can go ahead and start turning these into more organic shapes.

53
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.820
And so you do that by let's say we add a little chin on our head on our head and then we can go ahead

54
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.420
and get our neck in.

55
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.420
Let's say we kind of curve this out a little bit more.

56
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.960
So it's not so rigid.

57
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.620
And then we can go ahead and also add some hair to our characters so I'm not sure how we want this hair

58
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.640
to look but maybe something like So

59
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.560
when our character has some hair.

60
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.990
And these are much more organic shapes and maybe we add a little bit more of a bend to his arm.

61
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.550
So it's not just such a curvy sort of neurally arm.

62
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.590
And now if we were to trace out the shape of our character it would be a lot more organic looking.

63
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.840
Let's try this with our Sophie move over to her land.

64
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.360
We might slice off this bottom here like so.

65
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.470
So it's nice and flat and we might make this more of an egg shape than an oval shape.

66
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.900
And then with this we might introduce a little bit more perspective.

67
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.540
And so we might add more curve along the bottom like so and then we might add sort of an oval up here

68
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.660
at the top so that we can see sort of down into the top of our lampshade.

69
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.230
And now we have a much more organic shape.

70
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.950
Another thing to understand about shapes is that they create empty spaces.

71
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.020
So for example this is considered an empty space right here or a negative space negative space is very

72
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.360
important when you're drawn.

73
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.340
So you want to keep track of all your negative spaces down here between his legs.

74
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.450
You could also consider this area right here.

75
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.340
Negative Space as well as sort of here where some other places you see negative space.

76
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.710
But let's say that we have a guy sitting on a bench.

77
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.170
And this guy's going to be thinking he's going to have his head down like so and he's going to have

78
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.990
his arm out like this and that's going to be propping his head up in his other arm will just be sitting

79
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.980
next to him like so

80
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.450
so and then ever done.

81
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.140
Now where is the empty space in this.

82
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.880
Well the empty space is going to be right here in this area and right here in this area that's empty

83
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.730
space.

84
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.100
You want to make sure that you have empty space in your artwork because it makes the artwork look a

85
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.700
lot better.

86
00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.610
So when ever you can add the empty space and do it now I'm going to go ahead and jump into Photoshop

87
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.720
and demonstrate to you how images can be broken down into simple shapes.

88
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.070
You want to start looking at the world as simple shapes and not as images.

89
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.810
All right.

90
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.550
So here we are in Photoshop.

91
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.170
Now the reason why I'm doing this in Photoshop is because this is the easiest way for me to draw on

92
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.050
top of an image and demonstrate this to you guys.

93
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.090
So let's go ahead and get started.

94
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.340
If you want to do this also you can just draw on top of a printed off picture or if you have Photoshop

95
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.420
you can do the same way I'm doing it.

96
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.340
So what I'm going to do is I use my brush tool and I'm just going to draw on top of us.

97
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.010
So we have a Mickey-Mouse here.

98
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.770
I'm just going to start breaking them down into a simple shapes.

99
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.110
So first starting with his head his head is just a simple circle and then his nose is an oval.

100
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.750
His tip of his nose also an oval.

101
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.810
His bottom part is an oval.

102
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.300
His ears are circles.

103
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.960
We have a rectangle right here and then two ovals for the hat.

104
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.190
And then we have circles for the hands and then rectangles for the arms.

105
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.640
And then we have sort of a trap is void or rectangle shape for the body.

106
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.580
And then we have basically a circle for the torso.

107
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.400
And then we have little rectangles for these bottom parts or as pant legs.

108
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.680
And then we have rectangles for his legs.

109
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:30.700
And then for the feet I'm just going to break them down into simple blocks like so.

110
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.390
So now we have the simple shapes laid out of Mickey-Mouse Let's go ahead and turn off our image so we

111
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.630
can see those shapes.

112
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.590
So you can see the entire Mickey-Mouse is made out of very simple shapes and just an interesting fact

113
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:48.110
when Walt Disney first designed Mickey Mouse he wanted them to be made out of extremely simple shapes

114
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.230
so that any animator could replicate them and animate them extremely easily just by tracing pennies

115
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.780
and other objects.

116
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:01.040
So this is why I started out with Mickey Mouse because I knew that he's created out of very very simple

117
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.130
shapes.

118
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.580
Now how can we turn these simple shapes into more of an organic shape.

119
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.500
Well that's where we start refining things like the feet.

120
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:15.380
So if we turn the drawing back on we can go ahead and add a new layer above this and we can start refining

121
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.810
this block into more of the shape of his foot.

122
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:25.790
So something like so and his legs kind of have more of a bend to him.

123
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.360
You can start working on this foot.

124
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.540
So if we turn our drawing layer off and we turn off our background image you'll see we search to get

125
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.500
something that's certain to resemble something a lot more like Mickey Mouse.

126
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.590
Now the point of doing this is you lay out your shapes like so and then you want to do another layer

127
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.280
on top of that.

128
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.900
Or if you're drawn with paper and pencil then you want to lightly draw your shapes out and then on top

129
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.650
of that you start actually refining it into your organic shapes.

130
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.770
This is how professionals do their art work.

131
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.870
So a lot of people just want to go straight in and start drawing image.

132
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.420
But you need to work from the basics and move all the way up to the more intricate details of your artwork.

133
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.160
Let's go ahead and break another image down into its shapes.

134
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.180
So here we have a landscape.

135
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.530
So I use my brush again.

136
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.950
I'm going to go ahead and break this down into simple shapes.

137
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.860
So starting with my horizon line I'm just going to go ahead and create a line going crosslink so and

138
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.430
so that's our first basic shape.

139
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.590
It's just sort of this rectangle down here.

140
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.960
Next is the tree.

141
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.040
So the trees kind of a line with a circle on top of it.

142
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.410
And then our mountains can be broken down into two triangles.

143
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.460
So one like so and then the other one in front of it

144
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.340
and then this other mountain back here can be more of a trap Zoid.

145
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.970
So it's got a flat top and those are the basic shapes if you wanted to you can even include this cloud

146
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.160
back here it's kind of a triangle shape.

147
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.240
And let's go and turn on that background image off so I can see even this image can be broken down into

148
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.290
basic shapes.

149
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.030
And once you get it broken down into basic shapes then you can go in and add detail like more of a curve

150
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.040
along the bottom edge of the mountain.

151
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.310
Same with over here you can add a little bit more there.

152
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.270
Your tree might have a couple of branches sticking off in certain areas.

153
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:23.330
Your horizon line might not be a completely straight line it might have more of a zigzag effect to it

154
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.860
because there's little trees and plants and all kinds of things along the edge maybe even some bushes

155
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.650
out there.

156
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.820
Let's try one more image.

157
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.020
So this is going to be a more complicated image of a girl or a ballerina to be more exact.

158
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.430
And we're going to break her down into her basic images and we're going to break her down into her basic

159
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.950
shapes.

160
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.610
So let's start with her head.

161
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.360
So her head is basically a circle.

162
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.130
I don't bring my bra size up so you can see that a little bit better.

163
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.220
So her head is basically a circle and then it has a triangle attached to it.

164
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.950
So it kind of creates a raindrop sort of a shape then she's got her bone on the back of her head and

165
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.620
then she's got her neck which is a rectangle.

166
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.450
And then her body is couldn't be thought of as two different shapes.

167
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.890
It can be thought of as either a rectangle or can be thought of as a trap as a way to trap Zoids actually.

168
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.680
So we've got a trap isn't there.

169
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:21.110
And then we've got a trap is always here that kind of comes down more into the waist and then her arm

170
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.940
can be broken down into two rectangles So there's a rectangle there and then there's a rectangle there

171
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.180
and then her hand can just be broken down into one rectangle there one there and one triangle for her

172
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.160
thumb.

173
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.550
Let's break down her other arm so we're seeing sort of the edge of that rectangle and then we're going

174
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.170
to see the edge of this rectangle and it's almost more of a trap as always since it's tapering and more

175
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:49.010
towards one end and then over here we can break this down into a rectangle and then a triangle for the

176
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:54.980
thumb and sort of a trap so wide for those that bunch of fingers right there and then her Too-Too can

177
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.980
be broken down into a trap as a way she.

178
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.380
So as you can see even though her tutu is curving around here we're going to leave that out for now.

179
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.770
So we just want to break it into its separate individual basic shapes.

180
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.030
Then her leg is a trap is void and then we have another trap as we've gone down here.

181
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.160
That's making up the calf.

182
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.550
And so the calf is made out to trap as always like so or you could even think about that as a diamond

183
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.280
if you wanted to.

184
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.590
To simplify it even further.

185
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:29.520
And then we have her foot which is kind of a triangle shape and then we do her back legs so Another

186
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:36.650
trap is always back here and then we can create another trap there and we can even make this a triangle.

187
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.460
And then this foot can also be broken down into a simple triangle like so.

188
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.460
Now like I said shapes are going to be the most important part when it comes to your drawings.

189
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.660
If you don't get your shapes right nothing else is going to look correct.

190
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:55.170
So you want to make sure that you really study shapes and images and objects and really start to understand

191
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.010
how they play with each other and play off of each other.

192
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.750
So your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and take a bunch of images and break them down into

193
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.100
their separate shapes.

194
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:11.190
Once you've done that then I want you to draw a picture of something let's say a lamp or even a character

195
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.020
that you want to design.

196
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.380
But I only want you to draw the simple shapes once you've done that.

197
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:20.460
Go ahead and post that to the Q&amp;A section of the Course or the Facebook group so we can all see your

198
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.440
work and your progress.

199
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.460
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
