00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.920
In this lecture we're going to be doing a still life drawing of a city street.

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.500
Now I really highly recommend that when you do your still lifes of landscapes and cityscapes that you

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.590
actually go to location it's actually pretty fun and exciting to sit down on a bench and sketch whatever

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.280
it is you see in front of yourself.

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.650
You'll actually probably get a lot of people sitting down and talking to you and asking to see your

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.450
artwork.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.960
So let's go ahead and get started.

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.070
So the first thing I like to do when I'm drawing my cityscapes is I like to break down my image into

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.570
sections into fourths thirds and tense.

10
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.810
So let me show you what I mean.

11
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.170
So first we're going to break this down into thirds.

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.070
So this large building right here that takes up the bulk of my image takes up about two thirds of my

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.490
image.

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.750
So I can go ahead and add that in to my drawing.

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.550
So I'm starting just by lightly sketching it in and I'm just doing a large block so I'm not adding any

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.730
detail not adding any perspective yet.

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.970
I just want to do something very simple.

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.120
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in this building next to it and if we have a look at our reference

19
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.760
you'll see I can break this down and it's about one tenth of the way or maybe one sixth of the way into

20
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.610
our image.

21
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.770
So let's go ahead and draw that in.

22
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.920
And just copying the lines in the perspective that I see my image and I'm keeping this very rough and

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.460
very light because I can always come back and change it.

24
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.340
I just really want to start putting marks down because otherwise you're going to be too afraid to do

25
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.890
anything.

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.900
So you need to just start putting marks down as quickly as possible and don't worry about it too much.

27
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.250
Then I'm going to go ahead and add this building in and then I'm making sure that the sidewalk on the

28
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.140
other side of the street is following that same perspective.

29
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.440
And the further down the street we get it starts to curve around that I'm going to start blocking.

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.370
In this building right here and a that a little bit more detail with more perspective and I'll add that

31
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.490
perspective right there also on that side of the building to

32
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.660
and I can't stress enough how important it is to make sure that you keep everything very light in this

33
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.660
first phase because it's very hard to just go straight into drawing a perfect drawing of architecture.

34
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.600
And so by drawing it in very lightly you're going to be able to go in there and keep reworking it and

35
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.570
reworking it erasing areas and just making sure that all looks correct.

36
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.540
Now I'm going to go ahead and start adding in more detail.

37
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.450
I'm going to start by adding this doorway and then this window and you'll see I keep coming back to

38
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.860
that point over there towards the right side of my image and that's my vanishing point.

39
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.910
So this is a one point perspective drawing and I don't have an exact vanishing point but I'm just eyeballing

40
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.160
it so that everything is leading to the same vanishing point or the same area at least

41
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.540
then I'm blocking in sort of a truck back there and the lines for my windows.

42
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.590
And again it's not even close to perfect.

43
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.780
I'm just blocking it in at this point.

44
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.670
I can go in and add detail make it look more realistic later.

45
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
This is all about quickly getting those shapes in there and all you really want is you just want your

46
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.720
viewer to be able to understand what they're looking at.

47
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.910
At this point so just minimal detail is all you need.

48
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.910
I'm going to start blocking in this doorway a block in the window above it.

49
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.970
And I'm noticing that it's incorrect.

50
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.110
It's too tall and the door is too short.

51
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.280
So I had to fix that and still I'm keeping everything very very light.

52
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.610
We won't start adding darker detail in until later.

53
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.890
Then there is a lamp post right there so I'll add that in.

54
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.290
And then I saw that I was a bit shorter so I could go ahead.

55
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.390
Any race that and fix it and then I'll add in the detail for the top part of the window.

56
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.900
Go ahead and add in the bottom part of this doorway

57
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.700
important to remember that this doesn't have to be perfect especially in this phase.

58
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.160
It can be as rough as you need it to be and you really just want to get the lay out in there.

59
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.430
That's all this phase is about is about creating a lay out for you to follow later in your drawing.

60
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.900
So then you can start adding in your shadows or highlights and all of your detail numbness or adding

61
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.590
in a few little people just for scale so that we can understand how big these buildings are.

62
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.830
A few people back here and even these people are extremely rough.

63
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.010
They don't need to be perfect yet.

64
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.820
Now I'm laying down a piece of paper so I don't see much my drawing and now I'm going to start really

65
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.360
detailing in all of my stuff.

66
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.330
So starting with this lamp I darkened it in and I'm going to start turning in this doorway

67
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.920
and the point of this drawing is not to make it as realistic and detailed as possible.

68
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.460
It's just to understand the shapes the perspective the values and the highlights and shadows.

69
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.780
That's what this is all about.

70
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.760
It's about understanding and learning.

71
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.930
It's not about making a perfect product.

72
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.490
You'll see here that as I fill in these windows I'm not making it perfect I just want to get the idea

73
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.150
across that there are black windows and they have white frames around them

74
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.240
I'm going to add a little bit of shading in there some cast shadow and all darken in and out a little

75
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.140
bit of text there and you can't even see what it says because the point of this like I said is not to

76
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.750
make it perfect and exactly as you see it is just to study it and understand what's going on in this

77
00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.420
image.

78
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.320
Go ahead and Durkee this parking meter.

79
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.640
And then there's sort of a pole sticking off right there and another one right there too.

80
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.160
And it has a flag hanging off of it.

81
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.500
So add in that flag

82
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.740
and then start detailing this molding on the building and I'm just jumping around from thing to thing

83
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.480
because I don't want to overwork an area

84
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.800
and I'll go ahead and start adding in the ledge on the window way or window opening and then I can start

85
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:48.260
adding in those window panes just by adding dark squares of value like so then I'll have some shadow

86
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.240
to that side.

87
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.260
Might add and this molding on my building

88
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.650
and then I'm going to start breaking this up for the pattern that's going to be applied to it because

89
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.150
it's kind of a stone stacked brick type of building.

90
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.110
So I'll go ahead and Aben that detail

91
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.050
and I'll add in the shadow underneath that bottom edge.

92
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.400
And so what I really want you to understand from watching me do this is that it doesn't have to be perfect.

93
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.910
The main idea is that you get your viewers to understand what they're looking at understand what the

94
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.220
object is and how the light is playing off of it.

95
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.380
Nothing has to be perfect.

96
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.490
This isn't a final fully rendered finished drawing.

97
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.860
It's just a study.

98
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.280
Then it must start darkening the sidewalk area and then move on to this doorway.

99
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:15.350
So when to start by darkening this area down here and detailing my guy out a little bit more then I'll

100
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.730
add a hard edge to that.

101
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.770
And now I want to Abyan the detail that I see within this doorway.

102
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.690
So there's sort of a dark alleyway going down that direction.

103
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.200
And then I notice there's some shadow up there.

104
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.920
Now I'm going to break it up and to the individual windowpanes like so

105
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.350
that I'm going to go ahead and start working on this door in the doorway.

106
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.110
And just like with her banana drawn I'm just trying to draw exactly what I see the same values the same

107
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:54.780
shapes and I'm just trying to understand how this image is working and how the light is playing off

108
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.140
of each object.

109
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.280
That's all I want to do.

110
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.940
Next I'm going to we're adding sort of that tone stone texture along the side of this building.

111
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.790
I will break it up in two separate areas.

112
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.350
Then I'm going to bring this crown molding across the top of this building right here.

113
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:24.410
And I had that same edge to my building so I can add in those lines crossed.

114
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.920
So those are kind of individual stone slabs going across there.

115
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.760
Them I'll start adding the end to this side of the building.

116
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:47.850
Next most are adding the detail on the top of this doorway or the top of this arch.

117
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.130
Make sure that you're looking back at your image or the still life that's actually in front of you and

118
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.040
always be looking back at it for reference.

119
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.360
All that information you need is right there in front of you.

120
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.150
You just have to look at it and find it.

121
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.090
So if you don't know if there should be a shadow in a certain area or you have to do is look at your

122
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.440
reference look at the still life in front of you.

123
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:15.140
And that will tell you exactly where to put that chateau and Mr. adding this balcony up here.

124
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.010
And again I'm not getting into too much detail I'm just adding enough detail that you get the idea that

125
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.470
there's sort of a cast iron balcony right there

126
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.460
just adding a dark shadow edge to that and then adding the molding that goes across that edge of the

127
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.290
building.

128
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.410
And then start adding in the grid system right here for my window panes.

129
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.270
And then I can start filling those in individually like I did with the window panes beneath it.

130
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:19.330
So even though these aren't perfect black squares they get the idea across that there are window panes

131
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.390
in this window and that's all we need is we just need to get the idea crossed.

132
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.880
I need to get the idea across through highlights and shadows values and lines.

133
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.890
Then I would go ahead and continue those lines across that side of the building.

134
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.470
Now add that Legin and then I'm going to go ahead and add in these windows on the second story and the

135
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.580
third story.

136
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.030
So then I'll add the detail on top of that window

137
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.640
and I'll add in this sludge and I kind of added a round curve to it because that's what I'm picking

138
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.400
up from my reference.

139
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:41.380
It's sort of rounded balcony and I can go ahead and continue these lines across here.

140
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.020
So

141
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:05.240
then I'm dividing the subsecond fill in each individual window pane.

142
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.830
All right.

143
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.720
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

144
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.380
So I don't want this to go on for too long so I'm not going to finish the entire drawing but you should

145
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:20.500
get the idea of how to create a still life drawing of a landscape or a cityscape.

146
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.840
This is really important if you want to create environmental designs to understand how objects play

147
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.210
off of each other on a large scale such as buildings mountains trees whatever it may be.

148
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.560
It's really important to do studies of this and you're going to really start discovering things that

149
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.260
you didn't understand about the world that you'll start to understand through value highlights and shadows

150
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.380
and shape perspective and many other things.

151
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.900
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
