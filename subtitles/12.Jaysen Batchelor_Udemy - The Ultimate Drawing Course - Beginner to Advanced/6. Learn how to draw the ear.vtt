00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.880
All right in this lecture we're going to learn how to draw the human ear.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.480
Now I know the human ear can be very complicated and really hard to understand.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
But in this lecture I'm going to show you how to look at the ear in simple shapes that way.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.840
Drawing is very easy for you.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890
So the first thing I like to do is I like to think about that ear in its biggest shape which is sort

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.670
of an ache like shape.

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.770
Now depending on your year that might be a little bit smaller it might be a little bit bigger.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.480
It might be a little bit different in shape.

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.990
But for the most part it's sort of an egg like shape.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.590
So it's smaller at one end and larger at the other.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.990
Yet it's a very rounded shape.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.790
Next you need to break it up into three separate shapes.

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.870
So the first one is your curved shape.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.970
So there's going to be a shape that comes around like so and that's your first shape.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.200
So it's very simple to think about.

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.870
Men on the bottom edge you're going to add a little bit of some form to it like so.

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.460
But then it's going to get a lot smaller.

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.370
The more you get around this curve shape the next shape you need to think about is the why.

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.250
So there's sort of a letter Y within this ear.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.550
So if we go ahead and draw that in but this is a curved letter Y and so it's going to have the top hurt

21
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.560
like so.

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.850
And then that's going to curve around right in here.

23
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.050
Like so at the end of this why there's is going to be sort of a bell shape.

24
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.460
But you have the letter Y in there and now we also have this curved shape right here.

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.980
The last shape you have is a sort of a bump.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.910
So there's going to be a little bit of a bump and it's going to start right at the seam line that this

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.100
circle is on on the end of our Y.

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.790
And it basically just bumps off like so.

29
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.500
Once you have your basic shape like this drawn out it's pretty simple to fine the rest of your ear.

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.440
So basically if we go ahead and erase this away just a little bit so it's a little bit lighter.

31
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.440
And I want to erase it completely away.

32
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.100
So I want to see a little bit.

33
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.720
Well now we can go ahead and draw our ear.

34
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.800
So first we're going to start with the lobe.

35
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.820
So there's two different types of lobes there's a dangling lobe and then there's also a connected lobe

36
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.490
so connected lobe is when you see the lobe and it connects like so and it Dingding lobe is when it comes

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.270
up and then it comes back down and the lobe kind of Dingell's there.

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.060
In this case we're going to create a dangling lobe.

39
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.300
So there's our low grade there then that year is going to come out.

40
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.540
And then it's going to come back in just a little bit about here in the middle of our ear shape and

41
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.800
that's going to come back up and then we're going to get a little bit of a straight line right there

42
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.260
and then that's going to curve all the way back around into our head like so.

43
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.320
So there's the basic contouring line of our ear.

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.030
Now we can move on to the inside of the ear.

45
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.000
So first off are going to start off with the outside shape.

46
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.790
So we have our curved shape that we drew in here and we're going to use that as a guide.

47
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.370
So starting right here we're going to go ahead and start to introduce a second line that kind of follows

48
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.380
this one on the outside pretty closely.

49
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.380
So we'll go ahead and draw that in as we get up here.

50
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.750
It kind of dips down just a little bit and then we go ahead and we curve all the way back over and then

51
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.660
this is going to come down into our ear itself onto the inside of it.

52
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.670
So like our shape it curves in like so next let's go ahead and work on the Y-shaped.

53
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.310
So first off the Y at the bottom has this little circle that's going to turn into its own shape like

54
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.410
so and then that is going to turn into this shape right here which is following our Y-shaped.

55
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.330
And then we're going to go ahead and use that same shape right over here to create the inside of our

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.950
ear and then we have another shape coming off over here another line from our.

57
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.530
But rather than just drawing that in we're going to go ahead and shade in the space in between this

58
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.370
line and that line and then we're going to go ahead and shade in the space.

59
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.250
On the other side as well.

60
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.140
So that way we're still using that shape of the Y.

61
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.150
It's just not being drawn necessarily.

62
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.700
Next we're going to come over to her bump and the bump is basically where it's covering the ear hole

63
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.110
so we can go ahead and sort of sketch in that hole a little bit darker.

64
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.050
And then this shape right here curves into this one right here which this one starts to curve in that

65
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.000
direction and they start to curve together till they taper off and sort of disappear.

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:32.010
Then we can go ahead and Durkan in this area of our ear and then right here these two shapes or bump.

67
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.480
And in this little circle right here they connect like so that we can go ahead and shape that in.

68
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.930
All right.

69
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.310
Perfect.

70
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.790
Now let's go ahead and start shading in our entire years.

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.200
So generally this area in here is going to be darker and the areas that are really dark are just areas

72
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.320
that are further back and are deeper into the nooks and crannies of the ear.

73
00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.810
And so they're getting shadows cast on them or in them and we'll go ahead and shade this area.

74
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.170
Now we can go ahead and start shading up here.

75
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.310
Also add a little bit of shading on the bottom side every year like so go ahead and also shade on this

76
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.180
bottom side because as occurs down into here it's going to get some shadow on it.

77
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.540
We're also going to get a little bit a shadow on this underside of the outside of the year can also

78
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.590
go ahead and Durkan this outer area a little bit more.

79
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.880
Also since the light is coming down from the top we're going to get a little bit of a cast shadow being

80
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.650
cast from this ledge right here.

81
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.530
So let's go ahead and add that in.

82
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.020
So I'm going to have it come to you about there.

83
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.540
I'm also have a cast on this part of the year to go ahead and darken in these darker areas that are

84
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.090
within our cast shadow.

85
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.960
All right.

86
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.660
Great.

87
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.500
So now we have an ear from a side view.

88
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.150
Now what does it look like from a front view.

89
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.610
Well let's go ahead and draw.

90
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.020
So basically we're going to take this year and we're going to turn it on its side.

91
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.680
So we're looking at it from a front view of the human face.

92
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.240
So first we're going to go ahead and start by drawing a squished sort of a shape like so.

93
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.400
And then what we do is we first driver's top area so the top area comes out like so then it comes down

94
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.500
and we don't want to continue that because what happens is a way shape or white shape sort of Patroons

95
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.040
out like so and then it comes back in to the globe.

96
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.150
So then we can go ahead and draw in our ear lobe down there and not go ahead and draw on our bump which

97
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.860
we'll be right here now.

98
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.930
Bumba is going to connect into this curved shape.

99
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.460
So it's going to curve around like so

100
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.570
and then we're going to go ahead and draw on the rest of our Y-shaped so we get this side of our wire

101
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.140
right there.

102
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.270
We can go and shoot that in that area.

103
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.970
And then we go ahead and we get this bottom side of the Y shape and that curves all the way over into

104
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.440
here and then that comes all the way back into shape here.

105
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.040
And then that will connect right there.

106
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.820
Now we can go ahead and shade in here and we can also shade in on this side where your hole is going

107
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.370
to be.

108
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.050
And that's the side view of an here.

109
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.560
We can also add a little bit more shading on this side like so.

110
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.840
And now let's go ahead and move on to drawn the ear from the backside because sometimes you might be

111
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.980
drawing the back of a character's head and you won't know how to draw an ear from the back.

112
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.240
So let's learn how to do that right now.

113
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.290
So basically we're going to draw the same shape first.

114
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.260
So sort of this squished egg shape where it's small on one end and larger on the other.

115
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.150
And then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and draw this outside edge only.

116
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.430
We're only going to see the edge.

117
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.940
We're not going to see any of this detail on the inside of the ear since we're looking at the back of

118
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.500
it and it's basically going to be a little lip that's on the edge of the main shape of our ear so there

119
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.350
it is of the left of our ear.

120
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.730
So and then that's going to connect back to the head almost with a straight line just like so and then

121
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.150
that's the edge of our head right there.

122
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.650
So that's what the ear looks like from behind.

123
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:36.370
We can go ahead and add some more shading and thereby darkening this underside can also Durkan with

124
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.980
in here on this shape

125
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.010
we can also extend this without a little bit more on the top side.

126
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.660
But there you have it.

127
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.420
That's the ear from the backside.

128
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.710
It's the simplest part.

129
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.780
You're on the air.

130
00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:58.480
All right.

131
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.090
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

132
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:07.920
So in this lecture you learn how to draw the ear from the side view the front of you and the back of

133
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.420
you.

134
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.120
Remember that when you're drawn your ear you want to break it up into these four simple shapes.

135
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.710
So first we break it up into the egg shape which is the main shape of our ear.

136
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.920
Then we want to break that up into the curved line that comes around like so and almost starts to turn

137
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.340
into a swirl.

138
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.660
But we don't go that far.

139
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.330
But we want to make this curved line like so and then we also want to add a little bit of a fat area

140
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:39.190
down here to our shape and then you want to add the letter Y so the letter y goes in just like so and

141
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.500
then it connects like so.

142
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.140
So now we have a letter Y and then we got a little ball to the end of that.

143
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:51.580
Next we go ahead and add and this little bump right here and that will set you up to draw a very realistic

144
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.440
and well rendered ear.

145
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.660
I really hope you enjoy this lecture and your assignment for it is to go ahead and draw that your from

146
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.440
the side.

147
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.840
And then I want you to go ahead and post that either to the Q&amp;A section of the Course or the Facebook

148
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.890
group.

149
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.920
Thanks for watching this lecture and I'm really look forward to seeing you in the next one.

150
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.760
We're we're going to learn how to draw hair in it's form and also how to add in the highlights to make

151
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.450
it look very realistic.
