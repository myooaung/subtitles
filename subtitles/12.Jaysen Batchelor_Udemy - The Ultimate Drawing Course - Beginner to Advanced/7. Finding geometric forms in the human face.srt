1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,010
All right in this lecture we're going to break the face down into simple geometrical forms.

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:13,410
So just like all images can be broken down into simple 2-D shapes like we saw in previous lectures.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,520
We can also break everything down into simple geometrical forms.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,460
So let's go ahead and try this.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,800
So first off we're going to start off with the nose so the nose is basically a number seven.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,170
A lot of people like to think of it that way from the side.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,420
But there's a lot more to it than that.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,760
So first let's go ahead and create sort of a cube shape that will represent our nose.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
So this is the first shape that the nose can be broken down into.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,370
So we got one point right there.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,180
Another one right here which kind of tapers off as you get to the top.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,190
And then this one right here.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,980
So it's sort of a cube shape but it has more rounded edges and it has some more tape and so tapers off

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,240
towards the top here and tapers off towards the top here and also tapers off.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,170
On this plane towards the top.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,870
Now you may not see where the form of the nose is right here but we're going to take it a step further

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,250
and add that form.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,600
So from here you could go ahead and draw your nose.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,190
So you'd put one nostril where here let's say and then you could put another nostril right here.

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,780
So maybe like so.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,470
All right.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
So there are nostrils.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,460
You can go ahead and fill those in with some shadow and then next you can go ahead and add the top part

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,140
of the nostrils so they'd be top hurried here.

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,860
And then you'd add the tip of your nose right here

26
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,060
and then you can go ahead and add a little bit more of a shape to your nose.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,340
And more of the rounded bottom here.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,900
All right.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,690
So now we have a lot more form in our nose a lot more organic form.

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,090
And now we can go ahead and add some highlights and shadows to that.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,010
Take it a step further.

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,920
So on this bottom area we would have a shadow so let's go ahead and add in that shadow.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,040
And this is this is saying that our light source come from the top and hitting it coming down like so.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,240
So we can go ahead and added shadow there and then this round area of the nose is going to be where

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,130
our shadow starts to soften into our highlight.

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,670
Now we can also add shadow on this side or this plane of our nose.

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
And then since this is the top area of that part of the nose it's probably gonna be getting hit by a

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
little bit of light also.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,450
And then we can go ahead and add in a little bit darker shadows in there too.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,500
So don't go ahead and hide in the dark shadow right there in a darker shadow here.

41
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,880
Sake's so I'm going to stretch that nostril out a little bit more.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Same with this one.

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,560
And stretch it over a little bit more.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,330
You can add a little bit more shadow over here.

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,260
All right.

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,240
Perfect.

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,330
Then like we said before I explain how News Craig cast shadows.

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,290
So we want to make sure that we add a cast shadow to this so we're going to go ahead and add that cache

49
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,800
right there.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,080
And just to keep this simple for now I'm going to only do the nose and to leave the lips out.

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:42,260
But really there should be lips underneath this nose that the cash out has been cast onto.

52
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,020
All right.

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,610
Great.

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,540
So now we have a nose.

55
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,530
Now that's not a perfect nose by any means but I just wanted to get the point across that there is form

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,500
in everything including the human face.

57
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,310
Now let's try something else.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,360
So if we go back to our drawing if you remember we had her eye sir.

59
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,370
I was something like so and obviously there is a sphere and so you can basically add a shadow in like

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,300
a sphere.

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,590
But what I want to show you is I want to show you the form on this eyebrow piece above the eye.

62
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,260
So we would have her eyebrow probably somewhere about here.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,290
All right.

64
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,600
But then this brow piece it also has some form.

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,760
So basically a brow piece comes out.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,570
If we're looking at it from the side it comes out like so and then it goes back into the cavernous part

67
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,850
of the eye where the eyeball is held and then we have the cheek bone.

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,720
And so we need to create this form up here right here.

69
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,020
So what does that look like.

70
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,030
In simple geometrical form.

71
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,730
Well it's basically a shape like this so we have one plane like this and it kind of curves around like

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,200
so.

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,530
That's her eyelid right there.

74
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,800
And then we have a plane like this no draw this really lightly.

75
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,660
And then we have in another plane like that and then that whole sort of smooths out like so let me have

76
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,820
a top surface like this.

77
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,780
So I'm going to go ahead and erase away my eyebrows.

78
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,490
You can see what's going on here a little bit better.

79
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:13,820
But basically this area right here is going to get filled in with shadow now depending on the person.

80
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,500
This shape can be different but basically this is the basic overall idea of the form of the borowe piece

81
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,000
and this area tends to get a little bit darker depending on where your light source is coming from and

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,660
in this case the light source is coming from the top.

83
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,190
In this area will get a little bit lighter

84
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,610
then this surface is going to be our highlight area.

85
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,300
And so we're going to leave that highlight it but then we can go ahead and start planning this all in

86
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,840
together.

87
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,840
So it has a nice nice smooth transition.

88
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,410
And then we can go ahead and just add in our eyelid really quick.

89
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,260
And you see how you can take a organic form and then you can see how you can take a geometric form and

90
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,510
then take it into more of an organic shape which is very important when you're creating artwork if you

91
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,920
don't understand how to do that.

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,310
It's going to be very difficult for you to create things out of your head.

93
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,180
We want to get back into how to draw the human eye.

94
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,340
We'll just stick with the brown for now.

95
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,910
But you can see we just created that brow from that geometrical form.

96
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,750
Now let's try one more thing.

97
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,940
Let's try it.

98
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,170
The human head itself.

99
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,620
So the human head can be broken down into a very basic shape.

100
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:47,270
So first it's broken down into a sphere but then on that sphere you have the front flap part of the

101
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,780
face.

102
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:55,240
So we can go ahead and abat sheep in like so and it basically smooths into the actual sphere.

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,550
So now we can go ahead and erase away that area.

104
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,640
But then we want to connect in this area which is going to be the jaw line into here like so then we

105
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,260
can go ahead and erase that.

106
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,200
And so basically we have a shape like this that's connecting into our sphere and that makes up the basic

107
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,140
human shape of the head.

108
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,700
So let's go ahead and add in some highlight and shadow to this.

109
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:27,020
So if I have a light right here and it's shutting down like so I can go ahead and add in my core Shanno

110
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,730
so going out and core shadow on this side and right along the edge.

111
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,380
That can be a little bit more of a harder edge but as we get up to our actual sphere we want that to

112
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,540
begin to soften a lot.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,870
So it's going to soften into our mid-tone chateau

114
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,710
like so

115
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,080
but now we have the basic shape of the human form.

116
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,960
You can even add a neck in there if you want two sets of really skinny neck will do that.

117
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,940
So you could add a neck in there.

118
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:25,260
You could even add the chest area which would basically be a rectangular cube in which then you could

119
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,520
round off and add more form to it to create the correct human form.

120
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,610
But basically what I want you to see is that everything can be broken down into basic geometrical shapes

121
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,130
and usually just like when you're drawing an image where you start with your basic shapes then I want

122
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,390
you to break it down into more of geometrical forms.

123
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,530
So let's say this is our character.

124
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,470
OK.

125
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,560
Well now I want you to break that down into more geometrical forms.

126
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,470
And so what you would do is you would turn the square into more of a cube let's say.

127
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,990
So it's more three dimensional and you can turn this into a cube to

128
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,230
and then let's say his hands were down here and you could turn those into more spheres and add the shadow

129
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,660
into it depending on where the light was coming from.

130
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,290
But I want you to start viewing things as geometrical forms.

131
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,930
So once he starts seeing things as shapes the next step is to start seeing things as geometrical forms.

132
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,540
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

133
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,820
So in this lecture you learn how to break the human face down in a geometrical forms in the next one

134
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,210
we're going to go ahead and create a landscape drawing out a geometrical forms.

135
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,480
So you just have one more example of how to break things down into geometrical forms and start from

136
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,620
geometrical forms.

137
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,480
When you began your drawings.

138
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,130
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
