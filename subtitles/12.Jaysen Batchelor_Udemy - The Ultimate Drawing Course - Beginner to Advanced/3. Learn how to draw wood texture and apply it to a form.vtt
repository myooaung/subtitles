00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.450
Aren't in this lecture we're going to be creating a growing texture and we're going to take that texture

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.070
and apply it to a 3-D form.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.360
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.150
So first off I just want to sketch out mine would texture.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw a very simple box right here that we can create a

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.430
wood texture with an.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.150
And then we can go ahead and get started.

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.220
So first what I want to do is I want to figure out how I'm going to create this texture.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.100
Now once again it's very important to look at reference to create your texture.

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.960
So I have some reference sitting off to the side of me that I'm looking at on my computer screen and

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.560
I'm using that to guide me in how to create my texture.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.800
So the first thing I notice is that it's all pretty dark.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.440
There aren't really any highlights on it.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.990
The are completely white so long ago had an ad in a very light gray value on top of my entire square.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in all the cracks I see.

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.970
So what I see a lot of cracks and so on going to do is just slightly sketch those in work think I want

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.800
them to be.

18
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.000
And again I'm doing this very lightly so that if I need to erase anything I can always come back and

19
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.980
eat roots

20
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.950
and I also see a whole right here.

21
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:49.580
Go ahead and add that in.

22
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.930
Perfect.

23
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.600
So I think that's about where I want all of my cracks to be.

24
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.180
Now I can go ahead and Durkan those in so I can keep them pretty thin.

25
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.770
But make them as dark as possible.

26
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.960
And as we get to the end of these cracks right here we're going to have them sort of fade out and get

27
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:21.770
really thin.

28
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.690
And on this one right here we're going to have it fade out and get thin on both ends of the crack since

29
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380
it doesn't connect back to the end of would.

30
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.360
And just a very early quality I mean go ahead and make this one have a little bit of a wider area right

31
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.350
there.

32
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.490
And go ahead and add in this last crack.

33
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.630
Chris now can work on the the texture of our contouring line.

34
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.110
So I'm to go ahead and pull these edges out just a little bit and really enhance those cracks by changing

35
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.640
the outline shape of my wood.

36
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.410
So and I'll go ahead and do the same thing on this bottom area.

37
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.490
And I want to leave this site a little bit lighter since this is where the light is coming down from

38
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.850
that side next to it I'm going to do is I'm a go ahead and start adding in some of my woodgrain texture.

39
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.090
So the way I'm going to do this is I'm just going to first off turn my paper like so because it will

40
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.470
be easier to draw this way and then I'm just going to lightly draw in some straight lines like so.

41
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.140
And these are going to make up my woodgrain.

42
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.490
So there's different things we can do.

43
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.400
We can add in a knot which is basically just a swirly or a couple of circles within each other a bunch

44
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.560
of rings like so.

45
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.430
And then we can just continue to add in that grain around it.

46
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:34.650
So the grain generally tries to steer clear of knots and so it'll just go round that not right there.

47
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.090
And again I'm looking back at my reference just to make sure that things look correct.

48
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.090
And when you're creating your texture it's not like drawing is still life drawing you don't have to

49
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.130
follow it exactly.

50
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.570
You just want to look at it to get some ideas and also to understand the way the light and the shadow

51
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.800
plays off of it.

52
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.110
And we can never win green cross over these cracks because they're just cracks they're not stopping

53
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.940
the wood grain where it is.

54
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.340
It's just a crack in the wood.

55
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.310
All right.

56
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.690
Great.

57
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.460
So now we have a wood green Textron they might go ahead and go back in there and darken all of my crack

58
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:45.180
lines because they've gone a little bit lighter after I added in all that wood grain.

59
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.090
All right.

60
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.720
Perfect.

61
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.940
Now I'm going to go ahead and add in my mid-tone And just like when we did our breaks we don't leave

62
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.580
out this upper edge or the bottom edge of my wood for a highlight on my cracks.

63
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.600
And on the top of the wood.

64
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.080
So let me show you what I mean.

65
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.180
And I switch over to a sharpened pencil.

66
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.910
And so we want to add up our mid-tone right up to this edge

67
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.770
just like so.

68
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.370
And then when we get to our cracks we only want to add it up right up to that edge also.

69
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:27.850
So we want to add a little bit of a white space underneath each one of our cracks so we create that

70
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.640
third dimension by adding a highlight on that edge.

71
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:43.710
And come all the way over here and do the same.

72
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.700
We'll add it right up to this edge

73
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:57.070
so we're just going to continue to do that all the way through our work we can even sort of Durkan these

74
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.860
edges in a little bit more just to create some more contrast and shadow just like so.

75
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.520
So I'm going to go ahead and do that throughout my entire texture.

76
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.320
Great.

77
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.810
So now we have in that mid-tone shadow.

78
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:13.190
Now real quick I'm going to go ahead and read Durkan in all of my cracks.

79
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.080
And then I'm going to go ahead and read and some of my woodgrain so especially on this.

80
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.610
I just want that to stand out a little bit more.

81
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.940
Perfect.

82
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.580
So now we have our wood grain texture.

83
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.470
I'm also going to add in a dark shadow on this bottom edge since this is the opposite side of a light

84
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.830
source.

85
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.980
We can go ahead and do that a little bit of the same thing on the side.

86
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.550
All right.

87
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.590
Great.

88
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.890
So how do we apply this to a 3D form.

89
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.970
Well let's start off by drawing a box.

90
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:14.440
So this is going to be a wooden box.

91
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.500
Now I'm not really worried about creating a perfect perspective right now just going to quickly sketch

92
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.740
that in like so now what we want to do is we want to go ahead and apply this to our form.

93
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.890
And so our woodgrain needs to be running in this direction on this face and on the surface it needs

94
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.290
to be running in this direction.

95
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:40.020
And then we're going to see inside our box and so we need our texture to be running in this direction

96
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.930
on that face.

97
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.340
And in this direction on that face.

98
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.230
So let's go ahead and get started.

99
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.130
So the first thing we'll do is we're going to go ahead and add in those cracks so I'll decide where

100
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.410
I want those to be.

101
00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:03.900
Again don't forget to have your cracks running in the same direction as your woodgrain.

102
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.100
I'm going to see the edge of this wood right here and then we can go ahead and begin the next piece

103
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.610
of wood right here.

104
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.480
Go ahead and come into this inside area of our box and we'll go ahead and add in that little bit there

105
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:35.000
also with our little cracks a little to the side.

106
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:44.360
Then we want to decide where our highly shadow and our mid-tone Chatto intercourse chÃ¢teaux are going

107
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.200
to be.

108
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.150
So I'm going to make this side of our box or highlight side.

109
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.390
So that means this side of me here is going to be our mid-tone so we can go ahead and fill that in with

110
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:59.540
a mid-tone value and we want to start out by filling these in with our mid tones and our core shadows.

111
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:05.090
That way when we add detail on it doesn't get wiped out later by adding in our values.

112
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.900
So go ahead fill that area in and then it sends the highlight is on this side for a box that means this

113
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.870
in sidewall is also going to be a highlight except there's probably going to be a cast shadow being

114
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.100
cast by this wall right here on our rocks.

115
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.260
So that means we can go ahead and add in the cache on the inside.

116
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.900
So I'm going to go ahead and first fill this site in with another mid-tone shadow since it's on the

117
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.210
same plane as this one.

118
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.120
And then I'm going to go ahead and add in that cash and so the cash it is going to be cast off down

119
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.890
at this angle like so.

120
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.730
And then once it hits this wall it's just going to go straight across like this.

121
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:49.850
Now we can go ahead and fill that in with a darker value and our core shadow is going to be on the other

122
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.460
side of this war here.

123
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.210
And so we're not actually going to see our core shadow.

124
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.380
Now I'm not going to worry about putting the cash out on our surface for now.

125
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.320
Let's just add in the texture.

126
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:05.050
So what we want to do first is we want to really break this up into different sections.

127
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.780
So let's start with this first one the highlighted area.

128
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.980
So let's start by adding in a little bit of a darker line along this bottom so we can really start getting

129
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.990
some definition.

130
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.310
And also we want to see this edge of the box.

131
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.800
So we need to really draw that out.

132
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.340
Also

133
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:26.120
like so now we're also going to want to see this top edge of the box

134
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.330
and then we're going to darken this edge in just a little bit more next.

135
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.760
Let's go ahead and add simple and green texture in there.

136
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.850
So just very lightly and with a new sharpened pencil I'm going to go ahead and add in some interesting

137
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.850
wood grain in there and also make sure that you're going with the direction of your box.

138
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.850
That I'm going to go ahead and return these cracks.

139
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.180
All right.

140
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.540
Great.

141
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.550
Now let's go ahead and move on to another side of our box and I'm going to leave some of the detail

142
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.330
out because this box is so small it would be really hard to get in there and add in our mid-tone shadow.

143
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.760
So I'm just going to leave it like this for now and then I'm going to come over to this side which is

144
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:36.450
my mid-tone shadow side and I'll go ahead and add in a top edge to this wall of our box going to go

145
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.740
had that edge to that.

146
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.130
And same with this side.

147
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.030
And then I can go ahead and start adding in some woodgrain in there.

148
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.070
So this shirt.

149
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.720
Right over here.

150
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.360
I'll just quickly sketch that in.

151
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.420
Doesn't have to be perfect.

152
00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.760
Great.

153
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.730
Now I want to go ahead and add in my darker shadow on top of this so I can create a highlight underneath

154
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.700
these edges of my crack.

155
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:18.170
So real quick let me read Durkan in those cracks so it nor those are.

156
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.070
And then I can go ahead and start adding in that shadow that will be a little bit darker than what I

157
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.190
already have there.

158
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.700
And then I'm going to leave out that tiny little ledge underneath my crack so that way we create that

159
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.010
three dimensional form.

160
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.990
Great.

161
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.320
Now I get a really quick just adding a little bit more of that woodgrain back in there.

162
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.340
Because we've kind of lost it in that dark value.

163
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.270
Perfect.

164
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.810
Now let's go ahead and move on to these inside walls.

165
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.960
So I'm going to go ahead and first off Durkin my cast shadow a little bit more and maybe even soften

166
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.850
the edge just a little bit.

167
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:35.140
So and then it side of my cash it was actually going to be very dark darker than this cash story here

168
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.330
on this wall because it's already in shadow.

169
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:46.350
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in a top ledge to the side of my box.

170
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.770
So and the same with this side.

171
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:55.550
So I have that connected were like this then come all the way over.

172
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.890
Perfect.

173
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.910
So now what we want to do is we just want to copy the same thing we did on this wall over to this one.

174
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.540
So I go ahead and add in some simple wood texture woodgrain

175
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:15.360
grit and then to add the same dark shadow on this side of my box so really quick them to Durkan those

176
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.690
cracks back in.

177
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.170
And then I'm going to go ahead and add in some shadowing so we can get that three dimensional form by

178
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.300
adding a highlight right underneath our crack

179
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.280
and then I'm just going to go ahead and Durcan these bottom edges of my box.

180
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:40.820
So it's a bit more rounded and also stands out a little bit more from my background.

181
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.660
All right.

182
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.450
Great.

183
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.530
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

184
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:49.140
So in this lecture you learn how to create a realistic wood texture.

185
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.580
Then we took that wood texture and we learned how to apply that to a 3D form so we can create actual

186
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.870
realistic Fromm's the art just texture by our actual objects.

187
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.180
I really hope you enjoyed this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

188
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.160
Thanks for watching.
