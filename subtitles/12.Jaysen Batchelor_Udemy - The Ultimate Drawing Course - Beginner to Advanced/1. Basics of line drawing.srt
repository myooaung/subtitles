1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,390
This lecture we're going to go ahead and talk about lines.

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,110
Kate O-lines are the first fundamental of drawing.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,520
It's the most important part that you need to understand next to shape but you can't create shapes unless

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,770
you understand how to make laws.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,580
So the first thing to understand about lines is there's obviously all different types of landscape.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,400
So we have straight lines.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,500
We have curved lines we have lines we have swirly lines.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,810
We have random organic squiggly lines.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,050
We have all different types of lines k we have lightning bolt lines.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,400
There are all different types lines.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,430
Now what I want you to do is I want you to go ahead and practice some lines just draw all the different

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,220
types of lines that you can think of K and there's different things you can do to make your lines look

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,670
different.

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,070
So first off you can draw a dark going by pushing really hard with your pencil or you can draw a light

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,210
one by drawing softly or you can draw one in between.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:15,480
So you can also create very thick lines by drawing lots of lines together or you can draw the edge of

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:22,990
a pencil like so and you can also combine the lines so I can draw a line like that and then I can draw

18
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,040
another one like that that connects like so and then that creates a shape.

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:33,100
So I want you to play around with this and try to create as many lines as possible and as many variations

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,690
of those lines as you can think of the next thing we're going to go over is contour lines.

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,050
So what is a quarter a line.

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,390
Well a contour line are the lines that make up an object or an image.

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,570
So for example with an eye let's redraw I really quick.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,330
So there's the basic shape.

25
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,980
Now I know this isn't going to be perfect.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,360
But I'm creating contour lines right now.

27
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,720
So the first phase of drawing a picture is creating the contour lines you want to create those lines

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,530
of where your object is and where it ends.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,220
So the top part of the island is right there the bottom eyelet is there the colored part of the I's

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,140
right there.

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,700
And my eyebrow shape is right there.

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,870
So these are contrat lines.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,110
Let's have a look at another example.

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,730
So let's see I were drawing this pen.

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,330
I want to go ahead and set that right there well where my contour lines.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,590
Well first off we have the top part of the pen the clicker.

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,550
So we'll draw that.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,570
So those are contour lines for that.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,250
Now I know this isn't going to be perfect.

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,550
I just want to quickly demonstrate for you what the contour lines are.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,560
The next part is going to be this ring rectangular purry there so I'll draw that the next part is going

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,820
to be this middle piece.

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,770
So we'll draw that the next part is going to be this rebel rubber finger holding part.

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,430
So we'll draw that kind of has a little bit of wiggle to it.

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,960
And then the last part is going to be this right here.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,670
So go ahead and draw that.

47
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:07,070
And then if we want to we could go ahead and add in this clip so draw that.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,200
So these are the contouring lines of our pen now the next thing to take into consideration when you're

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,670
drawing line art is the line quality.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,370
Now the quality is is it's just the thinness or thickness of your lawn.

51
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,940
This can be used to make your artwork look a lot more interesting especially if it's more of a graphic

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,590
design type of piece of artwork.

53
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,760
And if you're creating more realistic type of artwork it can be used to create more of a realistic look

54
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,620
because it will create more of an illusion of shadow.

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,290
So for example on our eye we could change the line quality of our eye from being very thin like it is

56
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,880
now to being very thick.

57
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,540
So if I add in a thicker line appear at the top you'll see that changes that line quality and it differentiates

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,730
it from all the other lines.

59
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,570
And what we can do is we can even go ahead and add in there sort of an animator type eyelash like so

60
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,110
and now we have that nice line quality in there.

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,240
And the reason why it looks so nice is because now there's contrast not just in values but there's contrast

62
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,160
in the wine quality.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,870
This is one of the biggest things when it comes to creating good looking artwork is you want to have

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,400
contrast in everything in your values and your colors and your lying quality and your textures.

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,390
If there's no value your artwork is not going to look good.

66
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,130
So make sure you have different types of quality in your artwork and that's going to create that contrast

67
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,160
for.

68
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,230
Now let's go ahead and look open and see where we can add the line quality.

69
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,560
So let's say our pen is more of a graphic type of piece of artwork.

70
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,480
And it's not going to look so realistic.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,110
We can still add line quality in there to make it look a lot more interesting.

72
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,660
So for example on this curve we can make the curve a lot fatter.

73
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,620
And then as it gets to this part it can get a lot thinner.

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,760
Same with over here.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,520
And then we can also do the same here so maybe we add a derk edge along that edge and then add a dirt

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,830
edge along that edge but we leave that thinner and we can add this edge to be a little bit darker.

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,370
Can add a darker edge on this curve.

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,760
And same with this curve.

79
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,950
And we can do the same thing on the top part.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,790
So this is just creating different types of wine quality cake.

81
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,430
So like I said this is very important.

82
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,380
Pay attention to your life quality and make sure that it has a lot of variety that when you're creating

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,280
that contrast in your life quality.

84
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,120
Next we're going to go ahead and practice drawing contour lines just by studying them.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,650
So I have my boo right here and it doesn't really fit into the whole shop but what I'm going to do is

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm going go ahead and set that up here and I'm just going to look at my boot the whole time while I'm

87
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,800
drawing the contour lines.

88
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,660
So remember the quarter lines are just the outside lines that make up shapes.

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,690
So I'm just going to look at my boot and I'm not even going to look at what I'm doing here.

90
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,500
And so it's going to look very sloppy.

91
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,730
But the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm trying to learn how to study an image and only pay

92
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,850
attention to that.

93
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,030
If you can study an image and then copy it that's what's going to be a great artist.

94
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,980
So let's go ahead and get started.

95
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,560
So I'm first going to start with this bottom area.

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,200
And like I said I'm not looking at my drawing at all.

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm only looking at the boob.

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,910
And this is going to allow me to really study those contour lines.

99
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,540
But it's also probably going to make my drawing look pretty sloppy since I can't see what I'm doing

100
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,550
but I'm just trying to create those contour lines and even better practice is to do it in one continuous

101
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,670
line without changing at all.

102
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,870
So I went with my pencil up all.

103
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,830
All right.

104
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,850
So then we kind of have a boot now.

105
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,690
I wasn't looking at all this is just because I've been studying contour lines for a really long time.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,200
And so I can really draw something that resembles a boot.

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,830
And I understand where my hand is about on the paper.

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,850
So you really want to practice this a lot.

109
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,350
All right.

110
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,980
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,790
So in this lecture you learn about lines you learn how there's all different types of lines and you

112
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,730
also practice a bunch of different lines and created a whole bunch of your own.

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,570
You also learn about wine quality.

114
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,700
You learn about how the thicker the line is and the thinner a line is the more contrast you'll have

115
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,490
in your image and the more contrast you have the better your artwork is going to look.

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,170
You also learn about contouring lines which are just the lines that make up shapes the outside edges

117
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:37,370
of those shapes and you learned how to draw a continuous contour and line drawing without even looking

118
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,420
at your drawing.

119
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:44,030
So your assignment for this lecture is to find an object in your house or apartment and you're just

120
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,200
going to do what I just did.

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,850
You're going to draw a contouring line drawing that is continuous.

122
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,410
So never lift up your pencil.

123
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,900
Maybe you can lift it up once.

124
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,260
It's not a big deal if you do but just make sure that you don't look at what you're doing.

125
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,330
You just want to make sure that you're studying your object following the line of your object and then

126
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,890
drawing it.

127
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,220
I'd recommend that you do this with a few different objects.

128
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,750
Now I know this can seem silly but trust me if you keep doing this over and over again you're going

129
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,270
to get really good at understanding shapes and lines in an object and you're going to become very observant

130
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,910
by becoming observant you're going to be able to become a great artist that observing observing from

131
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,820
real life you're never going to be able to create amazing artwork that looks realistic or even caricature

132
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,560
type artwork that is from another world.

133
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,080
You still need to understand the real world to create your own worlds.

134
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,050
So thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
