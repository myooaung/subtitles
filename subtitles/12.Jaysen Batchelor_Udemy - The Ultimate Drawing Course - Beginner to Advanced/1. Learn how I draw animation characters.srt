1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,300
All right in today's lecture I have a special treat for you guys.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,330
I'm going to be teaching you how to draw animation styled artwork.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,460
Now a lot of you have asked me how to create this self artwork and that's why I've included this lecture

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,500
in the course.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,660
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,870
First what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and just sketch a character for you guys and sort

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,580
of walk you through what I'm doing.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,860
Then we're going to go ahead and break it down and we're going to draw second character and we're actually

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,780
going to look at how it's drawn in detail and how we can change different things to make it look like

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,690
a different character.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,400
So when I draw my characters I always start off with a circle for the head and then I go ahead and I

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,650
added my chin.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,510
Now depending on where I want my character looking that's going to determine where my chin and the centerline

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,650
of my face is going to be.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,680
So in this case my character is going to be looking more in this direction and a little downwards.

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,090
So my center line is going to come right down like so.

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,700
And the chin is going to come down like here and there's my jaw line.

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,070
So now I have a chin jaw line and the shape of my head.

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:15,130
Next I'll let you go ahead and add in my neck so I'm going to go ahead and add in a neck in there and

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,830
then I can go ahead and bring that into my shoulders.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,160
And I'm not going to worry too much about the shoulders for now we're only going to focus on the head.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,640
So next one I'd like to do is I like to go ahead and figure out where my ears are going to be so I'm

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,740
a placement years probably right about there and there is going to be basic egg shapes or upside down

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,640
egg shapes.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,750
So there's my ear.

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,700
The other one can't be seen because it's behind the head.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,300
Next I like to do as I like to find my center line for my eyes and since my character's looking downwards

28
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,550
that means this line instead of being horizontal it's going to be slanted just a bit.

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,650
And it's also going to be circular so I like to draw an oval star to create that form through my character's

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,300
head like so and so.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,530
Right now at this point we can kind of see through that character's head.

32
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,210
Now also I'd like to note that I'm using a blue colored pencil because this is what animators used to

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,010
draw her under sketches which are under sketch will go ahead and go in there with either a darker pencil

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,400
or a red pencil to add in the final lines.

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,560
So now that I have the eyeline in there I'm going to go ahead and find where my nose will be so my nose

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,350
will be a little bit further than one third of the way down from that line to my chin.

37
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,000
So to put my nose right about there and then I'm going to go ahead and add my mouth and right there

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,560
between those two lines and my chin then when I go out and add in my eyes.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,900
So for my eyes I usually like to start off with basic circles and this one right here is going to be

40
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,300
a perfect circle.

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,890
And this one is going to be more of an oval because we're seeing more of that side of the next what

42
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,920
I like to do is I like to go ahead and shape my eyelids.

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,630
So since we're looking at this at an angle we're going to go ahead and shape this in a different way

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,910
than this is going to be shape.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,730
So this I get shaped like so and then this right here is going to be shaped just a little bit different

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,730
just because of the perspective we're seeing them in.

47
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,020
All right.

48
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,020
Great.

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,430
Next one I like to do is it like to go ahead and draw in a little oval for my nose so one at an oval

50
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,130
from a nose just like so and I'm drawing that and pretty lightly but in my estimation style I really

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,710
like to use ovals as the base for my nose's then I can go ahead and sort of Durkan in where I want my

52
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,630
lips to be.

53
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,710
And I think my character's going to be smiling just a little bit.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,090
All right.

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,990
Great.

56
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,590
Next we want to do is I want to add in a little bit more of a cheek bone there.

57
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,120
Go ahead and curve that back in.

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,490
And then I'm going go ahead and add in a little bit more of a brow and a little bit more of a forehead

59
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,060
just like so and I can also add in a little bit more of a cheek bone.

60
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,920
And next one I want to do is I want to add in my eyes are the pupils and the iris.

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,430
So in this case my character's going to be looking straight at the camera and a little bit up because

62
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,240
she's looking down.

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,650
So we're going to go ahead and it in

64
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,370
just like so now your iris placement on your characters is something that we're going to have to practice

65
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,230
and work on.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,140
So they look like they're looking in the direction that you want them to.

67
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,030
So now let's go ahead and move on to this one.

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,740
And in this case she's going to have a little bit of her Iris covered by this eyelid.

69
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,460
And I can go ahead and add in

70
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,010
my eyebrows.

71
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,020
So go ahead and first add in sort of a rectangular box like so then a line that comes off like that.

72
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,370
And I want to add some expression into her face.

73
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,220
So I want to bring this eyebrow down just like so now she has a lot more expression.

74
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,110
The next thing I like to do is to add in my character's hair.

75
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,400
So you have her jawline right there and then we have her ear.

76
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,280
And so then sitting there we're going to her sideburn and I like to just sketch out the hairline first

77
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,700
off and this line up here is going to be a little bit curved.

78
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:58,250
Now that we have the hair line we can go ahead and decide what type of hair want our character to have.

79
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,560
So in this case I think my character is going to have relatively long hair and I think I'm going to

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,740
put a part right about there.

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,640
And I'm going to go ahead and start sketching in some really light lines because I'm not sure how I

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,590
want this to go.

83
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,730
But what you can do is you can start sketching in some really light lines and just plain with some curves

84
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,660
and whatever you want is trying to figure out how you want the hair to flow.

85
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,020
Then I'll go ahead and add the other side of the purse.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,850
All right.

87
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm kind of liking the shape of that hair.

88
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,090
So now what I'm going to do some to go ahead and start Durcan in a little bit more where I want the

89
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,400
hair form to be.

90
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,420
And this Haret here is actually going to come behind that ear and then we'll go ahead and add some more

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,400
of this here.

92
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,380
You can go ahead and do this site.

93
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:12,440
Also you'll notice that I'm really playing with the shape of the hair so it really comes down to the

94
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,030
shape of the hair being the most important part not the actual individual lives.

95
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,980
So as you can see or hear rather than just having the hair coming over like so in a round shape actually

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,750
comes up and then occurs in the opposite direction and then it starts to smooth back out and then it

97
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,300
comes almost straight down.

98
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,550
And that creates a very interesting shape for us.

99
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,640
So now what we can do is we can go ahead and start adding in some more detail with our darker pencil.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,100
Real quick.

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,680
I'm to go ahead and sketch in a little bit more of her body.

102
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,550
So adding some arms in there maybe a little bit of shoulder

103
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,910
going to go ahead and add a little bit of a collar bone so neck muscles.

104
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,430
Perfect.

105
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,570
Now let's go ahead and grab our red colored pencil.

106
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,240
And I like to use red because I just think it looks interesting.

107
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,330
If you want it you can go ahead and use a normal dark pencil.

108
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,630
But in this case I'm going to go ahead and use my red colored pencil and I'm going to go ahead and start

109
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,430
turning into areas I know dark and so I usually like to start with the eyes because I want that to be

110
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,100
the focal point and I make that the DERKS area by adding in some really dark and thick eyelashes.

111
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,420
So even if this is a guy I always add in really dirt and thick eyelashes

112
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,060
then I'll go ahead and start to Durkan in it the iris of the eye.

113
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,890
And I want to make sure that I leave out an area for a highlight.

114
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,780
So there's a highlight right there.

115
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,840
I'll go ahead and fill in around that.

116
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,760
He didn't seem besides going to get a little bit of a highlight there.

117
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,900
6 so and I can add a little bit more of a Swoope off the edge of that eyelash.

118
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,200
And I'm also fatten up a little bit more and connect it.

119
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,810
All right.

120
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,150
Great.

121
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,320
Now let's go ahead and move on to the eyebrows.

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,130
I'm going to go ahead and Durkan those eyebrows in

123
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,550
and then I'm to go ahead and Durkan in her forehead.

124
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,980
No this is a good time to reshape things the way you want them so like that forehead.

125
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,700
I brought that in just a tiny bit more.

126
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,560
Go ahead.

127
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,030
Adding this cheekbone that comes all the way down to the chin.

128
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,740
We can go ahead and that and the jaw line and generally girl characters are going to have much pointy

129
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,680
or chins than many characters.

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,060
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in the detail on my nose.

131
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,610
So first off I like to start off with the nostrils of the nostrils just a small little line like so

132
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,200
and then I add the bottom part of the nose and at the edge of the nostril and then I like to draw in

133
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,510
that Oval just a little bit darker with my red.

134
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,620
And then I like to add a shadow on the bottom of that nose just like so and then I can go ahead and

135
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,930
connect from this eyebrowed all the way down to my nose with a little bit of a curved line just like

136
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,520
that.

137
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,380
I'd like to add a little bit of shadow in there also.

138
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,940
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in my lips so these lips are going to be very similar to drawing

139
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,280
realistic human lips which this is why I say it's important to understand how to draw realistically

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,690
if you want to draw it like an animation artist because you need to understand how real life works.

141
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,910
If you don't know how to draw humans in real life you're going to have a really hard time drawing an

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,930
animation character because you're not going to understand how each part of the human face works that

143
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,130
I'm going to go ahead and add in a little bit of blush in there.

144
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,210
I like to add this in because I think it makes my characters look a little bit more interesting and

145
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,790
charming.

146
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,980
So even if I'm doing the guy I usually add a little bit of blush in their own cheeks and sometimes they

147
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,020
have to come across the nose and onto the other cheek just like so you can also go ahead and add some

148
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,800
freckles in there.

149
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,360
I think that adds a little bit of character to your character but you don't have to add that in.

150
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,270
And you got to add that in every character.

151
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,950
But I generally like to add in freckles because I just like them.

152
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm a go ahead and add in the ear.

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,190
And if you remember how we drew a realistic here we can go ahead and sort of copy that but we want to

154
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,260
simplify it in this case because it's an animation character.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,640
So that's pretty simple.

156
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,570
That I'm going go ahead and start to add it in my hair.

157
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,220
So starting with right here or adding in hair and I can add a little bit more detail there so maybe

158
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,600
a little bit more on the sideburn

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,200
I'll just continue these lines down and try to keep them as nice and smooth and flowing as possible.

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,970
And I want to make it too dark as I'm trying to keep those eyes the focal point in the sketch and can

161
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:14,420
go ahead and my shoulder and her neck and in the background areas of her hair we can go and darken man

162
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,180
since and be quite a bit shadow back there

163
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,050
and her collarbone and her collarbone is just a basic little sort of U-shape.

164
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:35,010
And then the line coming off that is that arm and we can go ahead and add this side of her hair.

165
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,030
Now if you want to get really good animation are what I recommend you do is find a ton of pictures of

166
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,470
other artists animation art and copy it.

167
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,780
You can even copy mine if you will.

168
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,750
I don't care.

169
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,200
But don't take credit for other artists artwork but just copy it to understand how they draw their pictures

170
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,660
and how they use sheep to create their artwork.

171
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,050
This is going to help you out immensely.

172
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,000
When I first wanted to learn how to draw animation artwork this is what I did.

173
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,140
I spent about four months just sketching out tons of other artists drawings.

174
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,420
And from that I picked up how to create like the eyes the nose.

175
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,730
And I learned a ton of different styles.

176
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,910
And then I sort of matched those styles together and then incorporated my own little flavor.

177
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,740
And now I have a little bit of my own style of animation artwork.

178
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,510
All right.

179
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,350
So now we've created our character and I want to break this down a little bit further for you and take

180
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,880
it a bit slower because that was a little bit quick.

181
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,970
So when I draw my animation characters like I said I like to start off with the hand.

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,480
So the head like we said is just a very basic circle so we draw a circle in and in this case we're going

183
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,660
to draw our character from the front.

184
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,520
So next one I like to do as I like to go ahead and add in my chin.

185
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,590
So it's basically going to be like drawing a real sick human head.

186
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,380
So we add in sort of the arrow takes shape at the bottom of our circle.

187
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,280
Next what we want to do is we want to go ahead and find the middle of our line or the middle overhead

188
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,290
horizontal vertically and then we want to find the horizontal ones so horizontal one is about there.

189
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,810
You a little bit lower or.

190
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,590
Perfect.

191
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,570
So now we have a set up for our head.

192
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,570
We can also add in the detail for next.

193
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,450
So the next line should be a little bit further in from the edge of the head.

194
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,850
And we don't want the next to be too long.

195
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,240
That's something that a lot of people make in mistake about is making the next too long.

196
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,890
Now this is a style choice that's totally OK.

197
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,610
But in most cases you want your neck to be relatively shorter than you would probably make it normally.

198
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,050
All right so now we have her neck and her shoulders next.

199
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,490
Let's go ahead and add in the eyes now the eyes are very important when it comes to your character.

200
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,340
And it's mostly the shape that matters.

201
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,210
So how do we create different shape eyes.

202
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,450
Well let's come over here to the side real quick and let's try sketching out a few different eyes.

203
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,280
So the kind of eyes we did on this girl was sort of an upturned.

204
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:08,480
So if you watched the lecture on how to draw eyes he saw we went over five different styles of eyes.

205
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,460
So we're going to do the upturned eyes.

206
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,790
So if you remember the upturn I is basically comes up blank so when it comes back down like so and so

207
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:23,320
we have a line going through the two corners of her eye but rather than being straight and horizontal

208
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,060
they actually go diagonally.

209
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,500
And that's the device we have on this girl.

210
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,880
Now a lot of the times this would create a more attractive type character but not always but in most

211
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,950
cases if you want a really attractive type looking looking character you're going to want to add in

212
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,200
an apt turn on like this.

213
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,890
Now what other kind of eyes can we do.

214
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:51,580
Well we can also do eyes that have a large top like so and have a large bottom like so we can also do

215
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,800
other types of eyes where they're almost just like an oval with a little bit of a tear duck there.

216
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,630
And then we can add in a pupil like so

217
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,830
that a pupil to this one so that I'm like so

218
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,420
then let's go ahead and have people this one

219
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,740
also.

220
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,050
Another thing to take nude on is that the eyelashes and the eyebrows are very important on an animation

221
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,580
character.

222
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,950
So if there are no eyelashes it's going to look really boring and bland.

223
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,490
So let's go ahead and add that in.

224
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,930
So generally I just like to lump it up into one basic shape.

225
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,270
So I like to have a curve off the edge a little bit like so and then I like to draw a line right across

226
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,570
the top like this.

227
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,170
And then I just go ahead and fill that shape in.

228
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,810
And so not to every individual actual eyelash.

229
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,970
I'm just doing one basic shape.

230
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,740
Then on the bottom I like to add a little bit of a dark line like so but I don't continue that all the

231
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,340
way around.

232
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,420
I just want a little area that's darker.

233
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,930
You continue it all the way around.

234
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,760
It's going to look like too much.

235
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:08,180
Let's go ahead and try to on this one so we can go ahead and add in our eyelash shape so we can go ahead

236
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,600
and fill that in and Durcan a pupil a little bit more.

237
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,400
Now we can go ahead and add a little bit of a darker area on the spot my lash.

238
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,390
And in some cases you don't even have to add a Derline you can just leave that out completely.

239
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,990
So let's try that on this.

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,240
So if I go ahead and add in my flashlight so and then I'll just leave out that bottom area and sometimes

241
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,910
that looks really good too.

242
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,440
So now let's go ahead and add in the eyes on our character.

243
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,990
So what we want to do is we want to make our eyes a little bit larger than they would normally be.

244
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,000
Now you can create whatever style of animation artwork we want but in this case I'm teaching you how

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,460
I like to draw my style of animation artwork.

246
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,270
And I like to make my eyes bigger.

247
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,050
So whether it's a guy or a girl my eyes tend to be bigger.

248
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,980
So I'm to go ahead and start by drawing a circle like so seam on this side and then I like to find where

249
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,790
my eyelids are.

250
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,230
So in this case I'm going to be using this type of an eye.

251
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,910
So I'm going to go ahead and draw that up like so and so I like to start the corner where my tear duct

252
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,630
would be on the straight horizontal line.

253
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,180
And then I like to end this corner just a little bit above that.

254
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,830
And then we can go ahead and bring that back down.

255
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,760
So same with this side.

256
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,930
So we're good at that and just like so go ahead and bring that back down.

257
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,890
So now we have the basic shape for eyes.

258
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,410
We can also add in the iris.

259
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,520
And we can have the iris looking wherever we want we can have it looking forward or we can have it looking

260
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,900
off in this direction.

261
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,090
In this case have a looking off in this direction because I want to demonstrate to you how the iris

262
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,960
changes as it curves or turns around the eyeball.

263
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,050
So we have it looking up here.

264
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,770
It's actually going to turn into more of an oval shape because it's in perspective.

265
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,920
And so as that circle curves around that silhouette or not so under that sphere you actually get more

266
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,840
of an oval shape.

267
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,430
So let's go ahead and add that in on the other side too you go ahead and Durkan in the eyelashes just

268
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,540
a little bit more.

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,440
And the bottom eyelashes next I like to add in the nose so the nose is going to be a little bit around

270
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,750
half way between this line and this line.

271
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,790
You can actually bring that down even just a little bit more if you want.

272
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,440
But then like I said I like to use an oval as my nose and depending on what kind of character you're

273
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,210
doing if you're doing a guy it will probably be a much bigger nose but if it's a girl I like to keep

274
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,360
it pretty small.

275
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,410
Somewhere between these two lines and if it's a guy you can do a really big circle.

276
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,910
It just depends on what you want to do.

277
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,610
You can play around with it.

278
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,860
So then I get that oval in there and next I like to add in my lips.

279
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,150
Now from my lips I usually like to start off with just shading a little bit of an area kind of the shape

280
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,390
of my lips and try to play with where want those lips to be.

281
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,040
So in this case I think that's pretty good.

282
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,050
But I'm actually going to bring it up just a little bit so it looks like she's sort of smirking and

283
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,130
it can go ahead and have a little wine like so then it can go ahead and detail those lips and just a

284
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,110
little bit further.

285
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,500
So I like to just add in the top part of the lip which is darker because the light source comes from

286
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:03,940
the top.

287
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,750
So it's getting a nice cash shadow.

288
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,330
And in this case we can actually add in some teeth in there to make her look like she's smiling now.

289
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,370
Her teeth are going to stay in the same position and her mouth is going to be a little bit lopsided

290
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,890
because she's smirking or smiling.

291
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,500
But in this case her teeth are actually going to start right there.

292
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,670
And then her other teeth are going to come all the way over here and we'll go ahead and add in the bottom

293
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,040
lips.

294
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:36,080
So we need to add in the bottom line first and we add in the shadow underneath those lips like so so

295
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,020
now we have some lips and some teeth also next.

296
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,720
Let's go ahead and add in our ears so our ears need to be lined up with the eyes.

297
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,000
So basically the ear starts at the top of the eyes and ends down by the bottom of the nose.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,380
Now she would have some huge years if we did that.

299
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,610
So you can always break rules when you create an animation or work.

300
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,830
So I'm going to go ahead and make my ears half that size.

301
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,000
Her is going to be like so that I have the other ear right over here.

302
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,110
Next we can go ahead and reshape the jaw if we want because I don't really like the way her jaw shape.

303
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,460
So what I'm going to do is I'm a go ahead and round that out a little bit more and then I'm going to

304
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,700
go ahead and round her cheeks out a little bit more holes.

305
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,260
So it's just going to turn into one big round shape.

306
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,410
Then we can go ahead and find where eyebrows are.

307
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,120
So I'm trying to decide what kind of an expression I want this girl have.

308
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,290
And I think in this case we're going to go ahead and have a relatively surprised look.

309
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:36,440
So I'm going to lift up her eyebrows pretty high so I'll go ahead and do the same thing.

310
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,460
On the other side

311
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,040
gripped.

312
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,640
Then just go ahead and find the hairline.

313
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,430
So I'm going to go ahead and first the curved line like so for the top hairline and then I go ahead

314
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,100
and add in the sides that go all the way down to the sideburns and then we can go ahead and add in whatever

315
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
type of hair stout you want.

316
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,370
Now in this case I think I'm actually going to give her an afro.

317
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,360
So I actually want to add a headband in there something to draw a curved line that goes all the way

318
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,800
around the head like so.

319
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,540
And then I'm going to go ahead and draw that headband in there.

320
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,220
So then we can go ahead and at her afro so her Afro was going to be a basic shape that comes around

321
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,220
like this.

322
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,790
And I recommend that you look at reference for your hairstyle that will really help you because I know

323
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,170
I had a really hard time drawing here when I first started drawing animation art.

324
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,620
But once I drew a lot of different characters with a lot of different hairstyles I started to build

325
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,120
up a visual library of hairstyles.

326
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,470
So now we have this hair.

327
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:52,470
We can go ahead and detail the texture out so we can add a nice textured concrete line for her afro.

328
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,240
All right.

329
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,920
Great.

330
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,630
Go ahead and darken in those ears to maybe add a little bit more detail.

331
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,120
So a little bit of a bump in the curve around.

332
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,620
Perfect.

333
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:04,990
All right.

334
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,360
So next what we can do is we can go ahead and grab our red and we're going to go ahead and detail that

335
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,990
and further.

336
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,420
But before I do that I actually want to Durkan in this hair because I want to create that contrast between

337
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,160
each part of her character so there's Derocher

338
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,710
so

339
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,810
that we can grab a red one or we can.

340
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,540
In this case I actually use a dark colored pencils only use this one.

341
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,540
It's an eight beat pencil.

342
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,330
So it's relatively darker and then going to go ahead and detail this character in.

343
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,080
So I'd like to start with the eyes.

344
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:50,970
Like I said before so many go ahead and first draw an oval around those two shapes.

345
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,490
And sometimes I like to leave the actual dirt part of the eyes white because I think it looks really

346
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,210
interesting.

347
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,790
I'm not sure why but it's just sort of my style choice.

348
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,670
And then I like to go ahead and add in those dark eyelashes and in some cases you don't have to have

349
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,440
this curving off sort of a shape you can just add in a dirt line.

350
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,200
Not only could appear like they're not wearing so much makeup or possibly like they're not wearing any

351
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,580
makeup at all depending on how long and thick their natural eyelashes are.

352
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,420
You don't go ahead and add in this other bottom line like so.

353
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,290
And I like to bring this shape down a little bit further all the way to the till.

354
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,060
Then I'm going to go ahead and add and eyebrows.

355
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,750
Now these eyebrows are a little bit off because if you look here this eyebrow is coming a little bit

356
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,980
further than that corner of the eye.

357
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,770
And this one is a little bit further back than that.

358
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,620
When are the eye.

359
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,690
So I want to go ahead and bring this eyebrow back just a little bit like so and then I can go ahead

360
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,130
and finish drawing those in

361
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,230
the same with this one

362
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,580
perfect.

363
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,550
Now let's go ahead and add in the nose.

364
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,740
So for the nose from a front view of what we want is we want to go ahead and first add in a little line

365
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,850
for Nasra on that side and the line for nostril on that side.

366
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,770
And I like to draw two lines coming off like so and then I like to add it in sort of a triangle shape

367
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,430
so to shape the kind of moves up like so.

368
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,140
And then I like to shape that in them what I like to do is I like to go ahead and connect a line from

369
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,900
my eyebrow all the way down to my nose.

370
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,150
But you don't want to add that in.

371
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,220
But if you want you can.

372
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,280
Next let's go ahead and do the math.

373
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,600
So I had in that darker shadow on top lip.

374
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,470
Now I'm going to go ahead and add that dark shadow within the mouth because there aren't any teeth right

375
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,380
there the teeth are only right there.

376
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,850
And then I go ahead and Durkan in the bottom shadow on that lip.

377
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,850
And also the bottom line on the left.

378
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,440
And we could go ahead and further sheep out this head so I'm going to go ahead and Durkan in these lines

379
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,300
like so seam with that side.

380
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,190
And the simpler you can make your shapes generally the better it's going to be.

381
00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:00,390
So if you can round your whole face on in one shape it's going to look a lot better and simpler.

382
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,930
Next I want to go ahead and Durkan in that headband

383
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,590
if we want.

384
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,000
We can even add some detail.

385
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,340
There's a sort of a design so I'm going to add in some sort of interesting stuff on that headband

386
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,640
and then we can go ahead and detail out the next so Durkan those lines in and no shoulders we can get

387
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,750
in a little line for her neck muscles so like so.

388
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,990
And then we can go ahead and Durkan in this country line for our Afro

389
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,640
now real quick before we end this lecture I want to demonstrate to you some different styles of noses

390
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,020
mouths and eyebrows.

391
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,490
So we went over a couple of different styles of eyes but let's go over a couple of different styles

392
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,930
with other parts of the face.

393
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,100
So let's start with the nose.

394
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,920
So like I said I like to generally do a small oval for the girl's nose and then I like to add edges

395
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,170
for the nostrils and then a little hole at the bottom or a little line for the nostrils.

396
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,210
And then I like to add sort of a dark triangle in there and fill that in.

397
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,720
And then I'd like to go ahead and curve that out like so.

398
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,440
So that's a girl knows that I like to create.

399
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,750
But let's say or do any guy.

400
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,980
Well we can go ahead and draw in a large circle like so minute two similar circles begin at the edges

401
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,800
for the nostrils and we can go ahead and add in the nostril holes now we can go ahead and add in the

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,990
bottom of the nostril like so that we can go ahead and choose our shape that we want the bottom to look

403
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:53,340
like so we can go ahead and fill that in like soap with chateau and you wind up there like so maybe

404
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,550
a little bit of lying there.

405
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,510
So there's like in nails type of nose but there's all different types of noses so you can really play

406
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,820
around with this.

407
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,860
And what about the mouth.

408
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,940
Well the mouth you can increase the size of the mouse mouth and you can increase the size of the lips.

409
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,190
You can change the way the mouth is shaped or whether it's smiling or not.

410
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,740
So let's say that we wanted to do a mouth that was completely smiling.

411
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,630
Well what we do is we start off with a straight line like so and a lot of people think that smiles are

412
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,610
curved lines like so but they're not they're actually straight lines are crossed at the top and then

413
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,410
the bottom is curved.

414
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,630
You know we're going to go ahead and add in the shape of our lips.

415
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,770
So we start with top lips.

416
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,820
So

417
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,550
you know we'll go ahead and add the bottom part of the lip.

418
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,480
So the bottom part gets a little bit of some sheep in there.

419
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,160
And then they can out in the bottom lip

420
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,150
size so we can having those teeth.

421
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,720
So generally the further towards the corner of the mouth you get the darker it is going to become and

422
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,980
it can slowly fade into the white teeth.

423
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,650
So and then I like to add.

424
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,980
And the bottom line for the bottom teeth.

425
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,260
And then you can either just shave this in for the back teeth because usually your bottom teeth are

426
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,410
behind your front teeth or you can go ahead and do that and all the way I like to Durkan and all the

427
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,160
way because I feel like it makes it look simpler.

428
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:23,730
You can also add a little bit of shadow underneath this edge and then you can go ahead and Durgan and

429
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:29,940
the top part of your lips like sound and you can have a little bit more shading down here on the bottom.

430
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,090
But that would be some smiling lips or a smiling mouth.

431
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,610
Now let's have a look at eyebrows are really quick now with eyebrows.

432
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,200
You can add an all different types.

433
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,090
So we have these really skinny thin ones.

434
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,810
But you can also add in ones that are let's say a lot thicker.

435
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:53,740
So in this case we can add some thicker ones concur those over like so many fill that in and you can

436
00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:00,760
also add in really thin ones you can almost just do lines like so or if you're doing a guy you can make

437
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,660
them really bushy.

438
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:07,810
So let's say that this is a guys I know I know the eyelashes are really thick on it but can go ahead

439
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,470
and add in some really bushy eyebrows like so.

440
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,650
And we don't want to taper it off like we did with these ones with Guy ones.

441
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:20,870
I usually like to just cut it off at a straight line or have a very small taper and then draw some lines

442
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,030
from the bottom.

443
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,540
And I like to just draw those in with really thick dark lines like so now might be a guy's eyebrow.

444
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,460
All right.

445
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,250
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

446
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:38,040
So in this lecture I shared with you how I create my animation style styled characters.

447
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,840
So first off I'd like to break it down into the basic shapes and then I like to go in there and add

448
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,940
in detail like the eyes the nose the mouth then the eyebrows.

449
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,890
And then I add in the hairstyle usually last.

450
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,420
And I also like to draw with a blue color pencil and then add a darker colored pencil or a red colored

451
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,230
pencil on top of that to solidify all of my lines.

452
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,020
All right.

453
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,920
Your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw your own animation style character if you need

454
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,260
to look at somebody else's and use as reference.

455
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,120
That's fine.

456
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,770
Definitely use mine as a reference if you need to.

457
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,750
Then I want you to go ahead and post that to either the Q and A section of the Course or the Facebook

458
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,330
group and let us all see what you've created.

459
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,690
Thanks for watching this lecture.
