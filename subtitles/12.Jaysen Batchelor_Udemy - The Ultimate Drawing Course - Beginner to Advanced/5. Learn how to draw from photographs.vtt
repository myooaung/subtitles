00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.800
All right in this lecture I'm going to teach you how to draw from photographs using a very simple grid

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.400
system technique that will allow you to transfer an image over onto your paper almost exactly as you

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.350
see it.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.580
So let's go ahead and get started.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.110
So the first thing you need to do is you need to find a photograph that you want to copy.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.360
Once you find that photograph you're going to go ahead and create a grid system on it like you see here

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.730
on this Parakey and now I created this grid system in Photoshop.

8
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.150
But now I'm going to show you how you can do this on your own drawing or a picture that you've printed

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.930
off.

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.340
So the first thing you're going to want to do is going to want to grab your image then you're going

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.490
to want to grab a ruler and decide how you want to divide it your image up.

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.640
So in this case I'm going to divide it up by inches.

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.300
So to go ahead and come down to the bottom of my page and it's about 11 inches.

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.420
I'm going to go ahead and put them work every one inch.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.820
I want to go ahead and do the same thing for the top side.

16
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.850
Perfect.

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.080
You don't go ahead and do the science and then going to go ahead and connect all these lines to create

18
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.990
our grid system

19
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.070
correct.

20
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.770
Perfect.

21
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.040
So now we've created a grid system that's one inch by one edge.

22
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.200
The next thing you do is you're going to transfer each one of these squares on to your other paper.

23
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.060
So let's go ahead and create Gert's system on a blank piece of paper.

24
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.470
Now in this case we're not going to be transferring this image we're going to be transferring the Parakey

25
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.640
image onto our blank piece of paper.

26
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.320
So it's one paper is a different size.

27
00:02:36.550 --> 00:03:00.390
It is seven inches by 10 inches so I'm going to go ahead and divide that up by inches.

28
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.080
It's important to make sure that you create your lines very lightly on your blank piece paper.

29
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.580
That way you can always come back in.

30
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.380
You bring it

31
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.130
aren't.

32
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.950
So now that you have your grid system drawn onto your blank piece of paper we can begin drawing into

33
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.970
each square.

34
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.270
So the way this works is you break down each square of your image into a single area that you need to

35
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.860
recreate.

36
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.110
So let's go ahead and start with an area.

37
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.530
So let's start with the odd.

38
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.920
So we need to locate where the eye is.

39
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.580
It's three down and five in.

40
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.840
So let's go ahead and recreate this Square right here.

41
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.340
So go ahead and find that on my grid system.

42
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.290
So three down and five.

43
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.340
So the eye needs to be right there.

44
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.120
And what I'm going to do is just read replicate exactly what I see in that square and pay attention

45
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.660
to where it's position and where the lines are.

46
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.250
This makes it very easy to break it down into very small squares and areas because that's a lot easier

47
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.690
to recreate than the entire image itself and try to keep everything in the correct proportion in the

48
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.530
correct relationship.

49
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.110
So let's go out and get started.

50
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.760
So I want to go ahead and draw it in the circle for the main part of the I want to go ahead and draw

51
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.540
an the shape of the eye.

52
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.580
And I'm paying attention to how close the edge of the eye comes to each edge of my box.

53
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:30.200
Not going to go ahead and draw the under part of the pie or the great part of the skin.

54
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.230
And then I can go ahead and move on to the box next to it so strong drawn out in I'll make sure that

55
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:50.680
you're drawing it lightly so you can always come back and erase.

56
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.010
Right now let's try moving on to a different square because you don't want to move from square to square

57
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.920
next to each other.

58
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.000
You can start on whatever square you like.

59
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.200
So let's go ahead and move on to the big square.

60
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.850
So the main part of the big this one right here.

61
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.620
So we're going to go out and find where that one is.

62
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:14.970
So it's two down from the I and then we come over one two three fourths or one two three four.

63
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.850
So we want to right there and then we can go ahead and draw that square and

64
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.610
perfect.

65
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.430
So now what you want to do is just want to go ahead and do this with each and every square.

66
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.910
Now this shouldn't take too long.

67
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.100
I'm going to go ahead and speed it up and you're trying to draw all the contrary lines.

68
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.750
You don't want to add in any of the highlights or shadows yet you just want to draw on those conference

69
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.160
lines so you have a guide to draw on.

70
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.980
So let's go ahead and get started.

71
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.000
Gripped.

72
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.010
So now we've created the country line drawing of our parents and in the next lecture we're going to

73
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.010
go ahead and begin to erase these borderline so they can no longer be seen.

74
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.130
And they're going to go in there and start adding in our values to make us look like a realistic drawing

75
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.110
then watching this lecture in.

76
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.400
I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
