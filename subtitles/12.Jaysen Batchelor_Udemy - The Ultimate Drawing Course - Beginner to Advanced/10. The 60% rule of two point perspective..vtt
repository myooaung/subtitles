00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.940
All right in this lecture we're going to be going over something called the rule of 60 percent.

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.940
Now the rule of 60 percent is not going to be taught to you almost anywhere.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.910
I've run into very few people that actually know about the rule of 60 percent and I learned this when

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.580
I was interning at the animation studio when I was 17 and I learned it from a really good artist friend

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.510
of mine.

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.980
Now what is the rule of 60 percent.

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.680
Well the rule of 60 percent helps your perspective drawings from becoming distorted looking and what

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.070
it is is it's the role that you can only show 60 percent of your horizon line.

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.400
So from one vanishing point to another you can only show 60 percent of what's within that space otherwise

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.940
everything outside of that space becomes very distorted.

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.360
So let me show you what I mean.

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.570
So if I grab my ruler right here I have one vanishing point right here and I have another one right

13
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.510
over here.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.310
And the distance between those two vanishing points is 10 inches.

15
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.520
So 60 percent of that would be six inches.

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.790
So that means four of those inches are extra that I don't want to show.

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.090
So what I would do is I would come in two inches from both sides so I'd come in two inches from this

18
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.340
vanishing point and then I would come in two inches from this vanishing point so too right there.

19
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.050
And so now I can only show within that space.

20
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.790
Otherwise everything outside that space looks too distorted and it doesn't look realistic.

21
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.900
You'd never see something that distorted in perspective.

22
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.260
But you would see that type of perspective right there.

23
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.250
So we can go ahead and now draw vertical lines coming up from each one of those points.

24
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.890
So

25
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.060
and now that's our composition right there.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.750
That is our workspace to work in.

27
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.620
Now this is the reason why a lot of people get really frustrated with perspective drawing is because

28
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.290
their perspective drawings don't look very realistic because they're seeing really exaggerated lines.

29
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.060
Now you have the space that you can make a drawing within which you need to do next is you need to make

30
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.490
the same measurement but vertically.

31
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.330
And so we have six inches from here to there.

32
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.960
And so we need three inches on this side bottom side of our horizon line and three inches on the top

33
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.540
side.

34
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.060
So let's go ahead and do that.

35
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.520
So we'll go right there on our three and then we'll go ahead and add in a mark up here and that will

36
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.530
have a mark here.

37
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.860
And then we can go ahead and draw a line for our bottom horizontal line and want to for the top

38
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.290
like so and so now we have a guy we have a guide for where our picture can be.

39
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.530
So anything on the outside of this square we don't want to use now.

40
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.070
You can cut these edges off so that this is your only workspace.

41
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.240
But I recommend you don't do that till the very end of your drawing because you still need to know where

42
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.650
your vanishing points are.

43
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.870
So now if we wanted to continue drawing images in here we know where we want to put our objects.

44
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.090
So let's say that we wanted to add another box in here and we wanted to add it in.

45
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.780
Underneath all of these ones of all we know we need to keep it in this area and it can't be over here.

46
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.670
It can't be out of here.

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.560
We need to keep it within this area right here because if we leave the space of this box it's going

48
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.420
to become too distorted.

49
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.240
Now you don't have to use this entire box if you want.

50
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.740
You can bring this line up so that the bottom of your page goes right there and you can bring this lying

51
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.160
down or you can bring these lines in whatever you want to do.

52
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.250
You just need to make sure that you stay within this 60 percent box which is the 60 percent ratio between

53
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.280
your two vanishing points.

54
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.060
Really quick.

55
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.940
Let's go ahead and look at an example of this distortion.

56
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.940
So earlier we drew this picture of this house and this building which are incorrect perspective.

57
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.370
But you would never see this type of exaggeration in perspective.

58
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.630
So what we're doing wrong here is we're not applying the 60 percent rule.

59
00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.210
So the 60 percent rule says we can only show 60 percent of our image and then we need to take that same

60
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.960
distance.

61
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.450
And we need to put it vertically.

62
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.200
And so really honestly probably this house will be getting cut off right about there if we were following

63
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.930
that rule and that's why that corner looks so strange and exaggerated is because it's out-of-bounds.

64
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in tomorrow's lecture where

65
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.750
I'm going to draw for you guys a picture that is well rendered and uses to point perspective and then

66
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.930
we're going to apply it highlights and shadows to that as well as cast shadows so that you can see what

67
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.000
it looks like to draw an actual really well rendered drawing using all the techniques I've taught you

68
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
up to this point.
