00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.000
In today's lecture we're going to learn how to draw the human face.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.520
Now I'm going to break this down into very simple steps for you.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.490
So the first thing we need to understand is that the human head is basically broken up into two shapes.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.110
The first shape is a circle.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.960
So we can go ahead and draw a circle on our paper.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.680
Like so

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.350
then the second shape is going to be the job one and the jaw line is basically made out of a square

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.850
and a triangle.

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.350
The square tapers off a little bit like so and then there's a pointy triangle and to this square just

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.720
like so and depending on the person you're drawn to jostling might be different.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.190
So if you're drawing more of a masculine type character you might extend this jaw line further out and

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.720
make it more square.

13
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.230
If you draw more of a girl or someone with more feminine facial features you're going to also want to

14
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.980
change the jaw line or maybe keep it like this.

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.020
It just depends on what kind of character.

16
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.450
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and draw a line right through the middle

17
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.340
of our head vertically and then we're going to drop one horizontally.

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.810
You're going to try to find the middle of this line right here.

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.710
And generally it tends to be towards the bottom of this circle.

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.010
So it's going to be about one fourth of the way down from this circle.

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.420
Now that looks a little bit too low is going to bring that up just a little bit more to about there

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.170
and then I'll go ahead.

23
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.030
Any race this bottom line is next you're going to want to find the two thirds and the one third spot

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.340
between this line right here and this bottom of your chin.

25
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.750
So first there's about one third right there.

26
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.560
And then about another one third up one third to third and three thirds next what we're going to do

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.420
is we're going to go ahead and add the Aizen.

28
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.450
So this one right here.

29
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.770
That's the line that your eyes are going to be on now generally your eyes are going to fit on your head

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.840
five across.

31
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.100
So you're going to start off of one basically eyeball in the center of your face and then you have another

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.880
eyeball right there and then another one right there and then you'll have another one that goes all

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.730
the way up to the outer edge of your head.

34
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.910
But we only want these two right here that are in the middle.

35
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.620
So all the other circles we can go ahead and erase those.

36
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.270
We just wanted to draw them to find the placement of our eyes.

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.210
So that means we're going to have an eye on this circle here and I'm in this circle right here next

38
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.310
need to go out and draw the shape of the eye.

39
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.810
Now at the beginning of this course we drew an eye as our first project and we didn't go into too much

40
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.630
explanation of how the eye works.

41
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.150
And then so am I going to go into too much explanation.

42
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.940
I'm going to explain how to draw the eye in the next few lectures.

43
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.870
But for now we're just going to go ahead and draw the shape of our eye.

44
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.450
And so we want it to fit within that circle and then we want to copy that over as best we can onto the

45
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.670
other circle only.

46
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.870
We want the shape of the eye to be flipped.

47
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.050
Next we're going to go ahead and draw the nose so the nose is going to be down here at this next line

48
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.140
that we created or we can even come down a little bit further depending on how we want our face to look

49
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.040
if we want to have a very long big nose.

50
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.970
We would come down a little bit further from that line if we wanted it to be average we'd stay at that

51
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.570
line.

52
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.190
And if we wanted them to have a very small short nose we would come up just a little bit.

53
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.870
But in this case we're going to make it about an average nose.

54
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.850
So we're going to go ahead and start to draw in the shape of the nose and don't worry if you don't know

55
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.350
how to draw the nose because just like the i in later lectures I'm going to teach you how to draw the

56
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.250
nose.

57
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.430
For now we'll just go ahead and drop it in and try to copy what I'm doing as best as possible.

58
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.260
Now a good way to make sure that your nose is a good size is you can draw a line comes straight down

59
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.910
from that corner the inside corner of your eye on both eyes like so.

60
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.790
And that's about the average size of a nose.

61
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.630
So use as a guide so if you want a bigger nose make it bigger than these two lines.

62
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.590
And if you want it to be smaller than the average nose to make it smaller than these two lines next.

63
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.370
Let's go ahead and add in the lips so lips generally are going to be on average straight down from the

64
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.170
middle of the eye and that's going to give you the width of where your lips should be.

65
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.100
So we can go ahead and add in our lips on this line right here.

66
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.010
Know we're going to go ahead and just draw that in like so

67
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.660
drop the top part of the lip

68
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.830
draw the bottom part of it

69
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.170
then I can continue to work shape till I get it looking the way I want.

70
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.650
And again depending on how big you want the lips to be if you want them to be bigger than average lips

71
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.730
extend them further than this line.

72
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.370
And if you want them to be smaller than make them smaller than these two lines so in this case only

73
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.010
be a little bit smaller.

74
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.430
This is going to be a girl and girls lips tend to be a little bit smaller in with.

75
00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.410
All right.

76
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.660
Next what we want to do is we want to add in the years so that years generally are going to be on this

77
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.280
line that your eyes are on.

78
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.350
So the ears are going come a little bit above that.

79
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.030
So and it will extend off the head.

80
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.530
And then it's going to line up with the line for the nose the nose line is about there.

81
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.530
So that's going to be about the bottom of our ears.

82
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.120
And just like everything else if you want your ears to be larger than extended past those two guidelines

83
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.100
if you want them to be smaller make them smaller than those two guidelines.

84
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.660
Next we need to find our hairline.

85
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.900
So depending on what kind of hairline your character has they might be balding.

86
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.980
They might have a widow's peak but generally the average is going to be right about here about two thirds

87
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.910
away from the top of your head if they have a bigger forehead than that can come up even further.

88
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.460
They have a smaller forehead and that can come down even more.

89
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.160
So we're going to go ahead and draw a line across like so and we wanted to be just a little bit curved

90
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.230
and then we're going to come down like this into the sideburns.

91
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.250
So and so that's her basic general hairline.

92
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.080
And then if you had to speak you could go ahead and add in a widow's peak there.

93
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.440
But for this character we're not going to have any type of a widow's peak and then we can go ahead and

94
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.330
sketch in what ever type of hair we want.

95
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.420
So in this case I'm going to make it a girl and I want her hair to kind of swoosh over like so and then

96
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.910
hang down the side of her neck.

97
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.210
All right great.

98
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.850
Now lastly we want to go ahead and add in the neck for a character so I'm going to go ahead and drive

99
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.400
it back in like so and it starts a little bit further in from the size of the head and then it sort

100
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.110
of curves in and then curves back just like so then we also want to go ahead and add in the eyebrows.

101
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.200
So this also depends on the character.

102
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.570
If it's a guy they're probably going to be a lot more bigger and square.

103
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.410
And if it's a girl they're going to be more thin and have a lot more shape to them.

104
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.970
So since this is a girl we're going to bring the eyebrows to about straight up from the corner of the

105
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.040
inside of their eyes starting about there and them are going to bring them over like so just like a

106
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.650
thin square box and then they're going to taper off in the other direction like so much do the same

107
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.920
thing for the other eye.

108
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.780
So starting about there at the same level make this thin box a rectangle type of shape and no taper

109
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:17.050
off like so now a thing to note is when you're creating your characters the bigger their forehead looks

110
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.970
the younger they're going to look and it with their eyes the bigger their eyes the younger they'll look.

111
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.830
So if you're drawing let's say a baby character you're going to want their eyes to be really big and

112
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.190
you're going to want their forehead to be really big.

113
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.460
Also the smaller the mouth the more young they look.

114
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.610
And so if you're drawing a baby you want them out to be very very small.

115
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.530
Now let's go ahead and start adding detail to our character.

116
00:08:39.700 --> 00:09:13.620
So first off I'm going to start with the eyes so I want to go ahead and add in my pupils.

117
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.030
And then we can go ahead and add in the eyelashes.

118
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.180
And then we're going to go ahead and add in the eyelids so just right on the top of that a thin line

119
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.840
like so soon with this side

120
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.690
you can have a little bit of shadowing underneath this.

121
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.850
I would for that I

122
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.900
next we can go ahead and turn in those eyebrows and smooth them out a bit more.

123
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.770
Go ahead and move on to the nose so the nose is basically already drawn that way we want it.

124
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.680
We just want to add in some more shading there.

125
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.780
So along the bottom edge we want that to be shaded in and maybe a little bit more shape to the nose

126
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.820
here and we can also add a little bit of shadowing along this edge of the nose as it comes down on both

127
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.870
sides of the nose.

128
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:41.170
Coming from the top of the eye all the way down to this part of the nose and then I get to go ahead

129
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.460
and start to erase away some of these guidelines that we have here.

130
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:55.750
Now let's go ahead and move on to the lips so the lips are two different planes so the top plane is

131
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.820
facing downwards.

132
00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.510
So if our light is coming from the top that means that the top part of lips is going to be getting the

133
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.070
shadow.

134
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.420
So let's go ahead and fill that in with a darker shadow color.

135
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.790
And then we're going to go ahead and do the bottom part of the lips and the bottom part we want to be

136
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.540
really soft so we don't just want to draw a hard edge for that bottom shape.

137
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.820
We only want to add a shadow underneath that.

138
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:25.500
So we'll just go ahead and add in a darker area underneath the lips right there like so and then we

139
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.070
can go ahead and move on to the shape of the head.

140
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.550
So starting with right here we can go ahead and straighten that out a little bit more and then we can

141
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.030
add a little bit more of a cheekbone in there.

142
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.790
And then let's go ahead and shape out that jaw line further.

143
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.910
So it's going to curve out of this part of the jaw and then start to curve back and towards the chin.

144
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.310
And then we'll go ahead and add a nice chin in there we'll do the same thing on the other side so it's

145
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.860
going to curve more in down here than curve out a little bit more towards the end of our job line then

146
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.160
we can go ahead and work on these years.

147
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:03.480
Now I don't want to get too much into that ears right now because they get really complicated but in

148
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.020
one of these lectures I'm going to teach you how to drive a year exactly.

149
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.550
Because I know that years can be extremely complicated when you try and draw them.

150
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.860
But for now we're just going to draw in a basic shape for them.

151
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.370
Just we get the idea across their ears right there on her head.

152
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.560
Right.

153
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.210
Perfect next.

154
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.050
Let's go ahead and move on to shading her face.

155
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.490
So first off we're going to have a little bit of a shadow coming from the top part of her hair and right

156
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.700
over here.

157
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.880
And then we're going to add a little bit of shading along this edge of the brow area and see with this

158
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.830
side will be a little bit of a shifting on this edge to make so.

159
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:47.730
And then we can go ahead and add a little bit of shading and for the cheekbones since that will also

160
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.830
be creating a little bit of a shadow.

161
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:56.350
And then we want to add a little bit of shadow along the bottom edge of the jaw as it curves underneath.

162
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.960
There's going to be that even a shadow and then down here on the neck we're going to get a little bit

163
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.770
of a cast shadow from that.

164
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:09.210
So we're going to go ahead and add in that cash that I would just like soome and we can soften that

165
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.110
a little bit more so it's not such a hard edge.

166
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.080
We can also add a little bit of cash coming from the nose.

167
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.020
Like I said perfect.

168
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.520
Next let's go ahead and detail the hair and just a little bit further.

169
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.410
So I'm going to go ahead and draw this around so

170
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.870
the really hair is just the idea of movement.

171
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.590
It's the idea of lines flowing.

172
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.510
And so if you don't do really long broad strokes the hair's not going to look right so you want to make

173
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.850
sure that you're drawing a long broad strokes.

174
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.670
They go for a long distance.

175
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.720
So if I were to go like this it just doesn't work.

176
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.680
We want to make sure that they're long broad strokes and we don't stop them.

177
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.760
Now this takes practice to be able to just draw longer strokes and know exactly where they need to go.

178
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:12.780
But you'll get the hang of it with practice.

179
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.840
Now we're not going to go into too much detail with the hair but I will do a lecture on how to draw

180
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.730
realistic hair.

181
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.560
But for now this will do wear out.

182
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.760
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

183
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.700
So in this lecture you'll learn how to draw the front view of the human face.

184
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.770
So just remember first off you want to create a circle for the head.

185
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:38.380
Once you do that you're going to create the chin shape or the jaw line and then you want to find the

186
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.650
middle of that in both directions horizontally and vertically.

187
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.590
And then you want to find where your five circles are to represent your eyes and then you want to draw

188
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:53.740
your eyes in on the two middle ones leaving out the one in the very center and then from there you can

189
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.510
use that to guide yourself to find where the nose should be where the mouth should be and your hairline

190
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:04.180
and then you can go ahead and start adding in all your detail and drawing the whole in in the next lecture.

191
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.300
We're going to go ahead and learn how to draw the human head but from a profile view.

192
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.410
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
