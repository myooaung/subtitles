1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,470
All right in this lecture we're going to go over something called space.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,200
So what is space.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,470
Well space is just creating the illusion of a third dimension on a 2D surface.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,290
Now let's go over the six different ways that you can create space in your drawings.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,610
Now you don't have to use each one of these individually.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,130
You can use different ones together you can use a combination or you can even use them all together

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,520
at the same time which is actually the best way to create realistic drawings.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,670
So let's start with the first one overlapping.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,100
So this is just let's say we have our character.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,400
So get it quickly draw my character here.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,140
I know it's a work of art.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,470
And then let's say we have a house and we put the house behind them.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,680
So let's put the house edge right there.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,000
We'll put the roof here and I'll come off the page like so.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:08,100
And then we can even put a door right here and a window there and we can put a window on the other side.

16
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,110
But the guy is going to be covering it.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,150
So this is the first way to create space and your drawing is by overlapping one object with another.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,900
And that tells you which one is in front and which one is behind the next one is size.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,110
So let's say we take the same example.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,790
But let's say we want to make that house further away.

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,390
Well what we can do is we can redraw our character.

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,660
So here's our character

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,560
and we know that a house is bigger than a human.

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:46,030
So if we take this house and we go ahead and put it next to him and we shrink down really small put

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,150
a chimney on that.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,100
Well now we know that most likely this house is further away because generally houses tend to be larger.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,050
So unless it's a small miniature house which is probably not.

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,220
We know that this house is far away because the man is almost as big as the house.

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,310
The next one is placement.

30
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,820
So let's say that we have a cactus

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,750
right here like so.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,070
And then let's see if we have a character up here towards the top.

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:28,280
So if we put our character right here and we make them whoops sounds selfish and we make them really

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
small.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,550
Yeah.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,110
OK.

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,070
So let's just pretend like I didn't make the extra arm there but let's say that that's a character right

38
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,460
there.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,910
And he's really small and the cactus is very large.

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
So we already have the size thing going on.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,680
But then we also have the fact that our character is higher up than our cactus.

42
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,670
Now if we go ahead and add in a horizon line which is just the line between the Earth and the sky.

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,740
Well now we get some really good space because our character appears to be further away because he's

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,210
higher up towards our horizon than the next one is detail.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,310
So let's see that we have a character and his face is really close up to our camera lens.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So we're going to see a lot of detail on his face so we're going to see his eyebrows really well.

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,610
We're going to see his eyes.

48
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:32,270
I'm going to see his nose and we're going to see his lips.

49
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,120
So there's our character.

50
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,400
We can even give him a neck if we wanted to.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,710
Now if there was another character standing off in the background so let's say there's another character

52
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:47,270
over here and he's further away so he's a lot smaller and higher up because of placement he's going

53
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:53,650
to have a lot less detail in his face because he's so far away so his hair is going to have less detail.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,850
His eyes are almost just going to be dark sockets.

55
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,300
His nose is going to be dirt little thing like that and then maybe another little one for his mouth.

56
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,460
But you can see this guy's detail in his face is a lot less than the detail on this face because he's

57
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,300
further away.

58
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,620
Now this is really going to apply if you have a depth of focus applied to your drawing.

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,640
So that means let's say for example when you take a picture of your cat with your camera usually whatever's

60
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,750
in the background is a little bit out of focus.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,270
Meaning that it's sort of blurry which really gets rid of a lot of the detail and so that means that

62
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,940
this character's face would be very blurry when you drew it.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,720
And that's why there would be less detail on it.

64
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,970
Now the next one is down.

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,530
So you can create distance by using value.

66
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,840
Like I said before in an earlier lecture things that are further away tend to be lighter because of

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,600
the atmosphere meaning the pollution whatever is in the air at the time usually causes things that are

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,810
really far away to appear whiter.

69
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,870
So let's look at an example.

70
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,310
So let's say that we're taking a picture from inside the woods and we're looking out on a meadow.

71
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,620
So the things that are closer to us let's say the trees and their branches and other leaves so matter

72
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:11,550
all of those and really quick that and either leaves hanging down like so you're going to be the closest

73
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,820
things the next closest thing is going to be the meadow itself.

74
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,090
So the meadow is out here and that's a horizon line too.

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,990
So there is a meadow and then way far off in the distance we're going to have our mountains so very

76
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,440
lightly.

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,290
I'm just going to draw the silhouette of some mountains like so and then what we want to do is we want

78
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,440
to change the values of each one of these.

79
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,770
So the mountains are the furthest away so they're going to be the lightest so get really lightly add

80
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:45,940
in some value like so then the next closest thing is going to be the grass in the meadow.

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,880
So that's going to be the next darkest thing.

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,750
So fill that in with a darker value and we can probably you can go darker than that.

83
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,540
So we get some differentiation between our meadow and our mountains.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,820
The next thing that's the closest are the truth.

85
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,310
So the trees we can go ahead and fill those in with the darkest possible value.

86
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,150
Perfect.

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,820
So now this creates a lot more depth in our image which creates space because of the different values.

88
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,720
So the further something away is the lighter it needs to be.

89
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,350
Now if you have mountains around you or you're in the city or on a really long street or you can see

90
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,990
really far away from yourself.

91
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,190
I want you to go outside and look at the furthest object that you can see.

92
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,710
So if it's a mountain if it's a building it doesn't matter.

93
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,370
But notice how it gets a lot wider the further away an object is.

94
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,800
All right.

95
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,010
The last one is perspective.

96
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Now we haven't gotten our perspective yet but we will in the next few lectures.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,390
So all perspective is is it's just basically the lines that you use to guide you in how far away something

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,620
is.

99
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,840
So let's say we have our point right there.

100
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,170
Now we can draw a line coming off like this and all come off like that.

101
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:40,160
And then we can draw vertical lines coming up like this and we can use that to guide ourselves on creating

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,490
a rectangular cube like so we could add shadow on the side if we wanted to.

103
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,420
So now we have perspective but how do we get space involved in that.

104
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,150
Well these lines are here.

105
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,990
That's creating space because it's telling you where the perspective is happening in your drawing.

106
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,740
So if we wanted to shrink this guy down we could just draw two more vertical lines further down these

107
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,250
lines fill those in with our shadow create this plane right there.

108
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,600
And now we have the same exact rectangle.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,920
It's just further away because it's further down these perspective lines and it shrinks it down automatically.

110
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,390
All right.

111
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,610
That brings us to the end of this election.

112
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,110
So in this lecture we learn about six different types of ways that we can create space in our drawings.

113
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's go over again really quick.

114
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,040
So we have overlapping which is just when you put one object in front of another then we have size which

115
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,540
is just when you change the size of an object so that you can compare two objects together and tell

116
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,170
how far away the other is that we went over placement which just shows how far away something is depending

117
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,440
on how close to the horizon line it's placed.

118
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,560
Then we went over detail which is just how much detail is shown in the drawing.

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,160
And that will help determine how far away it is especially if you have depth of focus applied to your

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,510
drawing.

121
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,310
Then we went over value which is just the rule that the further away something is the lighter the value

122
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,140
is going to become and then we went over perspective which we'll learn about later in the course in

123
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,980
the next lecture.

124
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,550
We're going to go into real depth with each one of these types of ways to create space in your drawings.

125
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,070
And we're going to go into examples and a lot more realistic details also.

126
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,230
So I really look forward to seeing you in the next lectures and thanks for watching.
