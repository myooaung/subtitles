1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,010
All right in this lecture we're going to go over how to add contrast Sheir drawings.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,070
So we know that contrast is use to create highlights and shadows but it's also used to create contrasts

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,840
just to make your images visually pleasing.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,340
And the way you do this is by making sure that you have darker things next to lighter things.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,040
So right now we're going to go ahead and add contrast to this character by adding values.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,460
So I've drawn this character up and I drew him up really quick here.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,480
He wasn't very well thought out but I thought it was kind of a little funny idea that a futuristic boy

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,660
on a hovering platform.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,990
And so we're going to go ahead and add some contrast to this.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,850
So we're going to start off with his hair so I know I want his hair to be darker and that means that

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,490
his skin should probably be lighter not in every case but just for demonstration purposes we want to

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,790
try to create as much contrast in this drawing as possible.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,930
So starting with his hair going to go ahead and fill that and darker

14
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,110
like so and then I can go ahead and re draw those contouring lines back in just so we can see him a

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,460
little bit better.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,730
Perfect.

17
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,050
Then we know that since this is darker we want to make as much contrast as possible so whatever is next

18
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,280
to it needs to be light.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,480
So we're going to keep his skin pretty light we might add a little bit of shading in there on the side

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,710
of him and underneath his neck.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,570
And then we might even add sort of some rosy cheeks in there like so maybe even as sort of a rosy nose.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:35,960
All right.

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,940
Perfect.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,010
Now let's go ahead and move on to the shirt.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,420
So sensus skin is lighter.

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,940
We know that we want his shirt to be darker.

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,130
So we're going to go ahead and fill this all in with a darker color but then that brings us to the graphic

28
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,500
on his t.

29
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,520
So we want more contrast here.

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:02:28,500
And so the graphic want to see he is going to be a lighter color so we're going to leave that point.

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,890
You had and add those contouring lines back in.

32
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,200
But even darker so that we can see them

33
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,250
perfect.

34
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,590
And then with his arms there going to be the same color as the skin on his face.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,500
So he can go ahead and add just a little bit of sheeting underneath this underside.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,990
So let's go ahead and move onto the paint.

37
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:03,050
So since the shirt is pretty dark we want to make sure that our pants are pretty light so they don't

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,340
have to be super light.

39
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,880
We just want a contrast between this edge and that edge.

40
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,690
So let's go ahead and fill us in with a light grey.

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,020
So go ahead and add in that country line so it's much darker

42
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,890
you know when we get down here to where his his pant legs are rolled up we're going to leave those completely

43
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,600
white because we want to make contrasts between this area and the pants.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,950
And then when we get to the shoes we want contrast between this white area and the shoes.

45
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,490
So let's go ahead and fill those in with a black.

46
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,530
Same with the shoe.

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,470
Just like so.

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,070
And now I'm noticing we're creating too much contrast down here.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,510
And this is becoming the focal point.

50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,190
And so what we want to do is we want to make his face the focal points we need to make more contrast

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,880
up there.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,220
The way we'll do that is by adding Durka shadow up here.

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,760
Like so.

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,370
So now we have a lot of contrast between the bottom edge of his hair and his skin and then down here

55
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,840
we can actually go ahead and fill these in with a light gray because it's better that there's no contrast

56
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,880
between this and that and this not become the focal point.

57
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,410
Then this not being the focal point and that being white.

58
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,890
So you want to make sure that you're thinking about what you want your focal point to be.

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,190
And that's really the main thing that matters.

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,860
Next let's move onto this platform.

61
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,870
So the top surface of this platform can have a little bit of shadow on it from the boy standing on it.

62
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,570
And then this other underside is going to be filled in with a light gray

63
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,410
and then this under here can be filled in with a darker gray

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,030
then we can go ahead and add in those contrarian lines.

65
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,750
All right.

66
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,210
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,700
So the main takeaway I want you to have from this lecture is that any time you can put contrasting values

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,430
next to each other do it.

69
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,210
So basically you need to pick something on your drawing that you know what you want the value to be

70
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,160
and then base everything else off of that.

71
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,610
So for example we knew we wanted his hair to be black.

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,330
So we knew that a skin should most likely be lighter.

73
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,160
Now we knew because of that his shirt should most likely be darker because it's right next to his skin.

74
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,220
And then we knew that because his shirt was darker that his pants needed to be lighter and because his

75
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,850
pants were lighter we knew that his shoes needed to be darker.

76
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,890
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're

77
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,000
going to be talking about space.

78
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,230
Space is super important when you're trying to create drawings and atmospheres.

79
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,520
So I look forward to seeing you in that lecture.
