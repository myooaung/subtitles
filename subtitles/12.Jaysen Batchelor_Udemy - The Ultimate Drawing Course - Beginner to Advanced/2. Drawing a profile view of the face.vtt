00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.300
In this lecture we're going to learn how to draw the human head in a profile view.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.010
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.420
So the first thing I'd like to do when I'm drawing ahead is I always start off with the circle because

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.200
that's the basic shape of the human head.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.900
So I want to go ahead and draw that in like So next we're going to do is I'm going to go ahead and added

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.300
my jaw lines so my jaw line is going to be down here about like so and so then we're going to bring

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.790
it up like this and we're going to go ahead and bring that across the front like so and sort of curve

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.940
it.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.360
So we need to draw this basic shape with a circle and then sort of a curved trap Azcue type of shape

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.210
down here at the bottom for my jawline and my chin next I'm going to go ahead and add in my neck so

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.310
the neck is going to come in just a little bit underneath this curve right here on the back of the head.

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.530
Go ahead and add that in like so.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.910
And then this part is going to start about there.

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.900
And depending on whether you're doing a guy or girl or how muscular your character is that's going to

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.710
determine how thick your neck will be.

16
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.940
Next we're going to go ahead and find out where the middle of this face is so we know where to put our

17
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.830
eyes.

18
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
So I'm thinking right about here is where my eye should be.

19
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.660
All right.

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.660
Perfect.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.180
Next I'm going to go ahead and find my two thirds point.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.430
So we're going to go ahead and find the two thirds point down here and then find the ONE-THIRD point

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.240
right about there.

24
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.870
Maybe a little bit lower just like so.

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.530
So now I know my nose and my lips are going to go and my eyes next.

26
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.950
We want to go ahead and draw the profile contouring line shape of the head.

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.940
So starting right here we're going to start with the brows.

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.740
So we want to come in just a little bit from this line we've already drawn and then we're going to pop

29
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.550
that out like so.

30
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.940
And depending on what your character looks like that's going to determine how that Brown needs to be

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.350
shaped.

32
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.160
If it's a guy the brow might be a little bit bigger and protrude a little bit more meaning it'll come

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.050
out a little bit more.

34
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.570
And if it's a girl I might be less strong.

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.470
So let's go ahead and draw that in.

36
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.210
And then it's going to come up and curve up into the top of the head like so.

37
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150
So now we have our borowe next.

38
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.440
Let's go ahead and add the nose so the nose is going to just come off like so.

39
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.470
And a lot of people have the misconception that it's like the number seven.

40
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.810
And that's because the number seven is kind of the basic shape of a nose you can actually sketch in

41
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.490
the number seven upside down.

42
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.830
If you want to and use that as a base but then you want to take that a little bit further.

43
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.880
So you have the top off of the nose and then you want to go ahead and add in this face right here which

44
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
is sort of the not the bottom face but it's sort of an under face of the nose.

45
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.060
And then that needs to come around and curve in to the lips like so and then we can go ahead and add

46
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.640
in those nostrils so I'm going to go ahead and add in a curved line underneath there like so.

47
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.270
And then you can at the top of the nostril just like this.

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.490
And then let's go ahead and add in the lips so the lips start at the top of the nose and then they're

49
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.060
going to go ahead and just come down and curve like so down to where your lips need to be.

50
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.200
And since this is a guy we're going to make his chin a little bit bigger by bringing his lips up just

51
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.680
a little bit.

52
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.330
So we're going to start at the top of lips right here and we'll go ahead and add the bottom part of

53
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.030
the lips right there in the bottom part of the lips are basically just going to be almost like a raindrop

54
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.860
shape.

55
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.420
Then the top of them are going to be sort of like a triangle like so.

56
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.220
And then we can go ahead and add in that shin.

57
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.180
So there's the other part of the mouth that comes in like so and then the bottom part of the chin is

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.390
going to go ahead and protrude out like this.

59
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.630
And then we can go ahead and finish drawing in our jaw line.

60
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.330
So it's going to come all the way across like so so the bottom part is a straight part and then it curves

61
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.160
as it gets underneath the ear.

62
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.570
And then we're going to go ahead and bring that up into the ear which then we need to find out where

63
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.870
that needs to be placed so that it needs to be placed a little bit over from the middle of the head.

64
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.340
So probably right about here is where we need to place it and then we can go ahead and draw that ear

65
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.730
in.

66
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.410
So it's going to be on that line

67
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.690
and we want to make sure that it's just lined up with the the top of the ice at the top of the eye will

68
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.610
be about there.

69
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.950
So that needs to stop about there.

70
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.820
So now we can go ahead and draw that in.

71
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.020
And at the bottom of that it needs to line up with the bottom of the nose.

72
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.960
So I apologize for not marking those before we got started but the ear needs to start.

73
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.920
Some are about done here and some are up here.

74
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.070
So now we can go ahead and draw that in

75
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:54.940
then we can go ahead and add in some of the detail for that ear.

76
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.750
All right.

77
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.180
Great.

78
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.670
So now we have your let's go ahead and move on to adding the OB Now the I from a side view is different

79
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.410
from an eye from the front view.

80
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
Basically you slice your eye in half with a curved line.

81
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.730
So if this is or regular I like so let me have the cornea and the pupil.

82
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.800
Well if you're looking at this from the side you'd basically slice it with a curved line.

83
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.130
Now this isn't exact but that's basically what we're doing.

84
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.720
So let me show you what I mean.

85
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.760
So the eye needs to come in just a little bit further just barely past this edge of the nose so we can

86
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.040
sort of I'm right about there and we're going to go ahead and try a curved line like this and then we're

87
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.470
going to go ahead and start drawing in the shape of our eyes.

88
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.170
So the shape of our eyes is going to start at the same level at the top of our ear is on and we're going

89
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.810
to go ahead and draw it in like so.

90
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.910
So there's a top of our eye that we need to do.

91
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.520
The bottom of our eye which is basically going to be a straight line coming off and it might be a little

92
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.730
bit slanted and then we can go ahead and draw the colored part of our eye.

93
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.810
So that's going to be an oval basically like so that we're going to go ahead and add in our eyebrows

94
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.030
so I'm going to add in my eyebrow right about there.

95
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:18.780
And since this is going to be a guy the eyebrow is going to be a lot bigger and thicker so and then

96
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.230
I'm going to go ahead and add in my hair.

97
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.680
So the hairline is going to start about there on this character and then it's going to come down like

98
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.120
so.

99
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.810
And if we're looking at the hairline from side view this is what it does.

100
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.260
He comes back like this.

101
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.150
And then there's sort of a rectangle right here.

102
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:46.530
And then that rectangle turns into her sideburns like so and then this comes around behind the head

103
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.280
and then comes down the neck and then that's our hairline.

104
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.400
Now we can go ahead and create what ever type of shape we want for the hair.

105
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.050
So I'm going to go ahead and create sort of a slicked back hair type of look.

106
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.490
She's like so and the hair isn't always pressed right up against the school so you can have this come

107
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.310
out quite a bit away from the school shape.

108
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.240
And because this is a meal we can go ahead and add in a pretty strong Adam's apple.

109
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.370
So first off are going to have a line that kind of comes off her jawline like so and then it's going

110
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.690
to turn into our Adam's apple so adding that Adam's apple right there.

111
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.210
And then we're going to go ahead and have that come down.

112
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.630
Now we also want to add a little bit of muscle into the neck.

113
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:36.750
And so there's a very large muscle that goes right here that extends across the whole neck and we can

114
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:42.820
even thicken our neck like so because I think this guy should be a little bit bigger.

115
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.060
All right.

116
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.690
Great.

117
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.750
Now we can go ahead and erase away some of these guidelines and then we can start adding in some highlights

118
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.820
and shadows and more detail to make us look more realistic.

119
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.160
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

120
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.780
So first off I'm going to Durkan in my eye and it might even reshape it just a little bit.

121
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.690
It was coming off a little bit straighter and then I'm going to go ahead and answer shadow underneath

122
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.000
the eye because this is a format and the light is coming from the top so it's going to be creating some

123
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.350
shadow underneath there.

124
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.530
And I'm going to go ahead and start adding some detail for the cheek bone.

125
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.160
So the guy a cheek bone is very prominent on the front side like so there's going to be a little bit

126
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.950
of prominence on the side of the cheek bone but most of it is going to be right here in the front.

127
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.550
And I might have that little bit too dark.

128
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.680
Go ahead and move on to the nose.

129
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.290
We want to had some shadow on the bottom side of the nose and then we can go ahead and add some darkening

130
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.870
into the eyebrows just like so

131
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.630
and we can also add a little bit more of an eyelid on the bottom side of his eye.

132
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.120
So so and maybe a little bit more shadow underneath here and then that.

133
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.490
Also we want to make sure that we add in some more form on the edge of his head.

134
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.840
And then let's go ahead and move on to the lips so the top of the lips are going to get so shallow that

135
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.570
we're going to see a little bit of this edge right here from the side of the mouth.

136
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.090
And then I can also add shadow on the underside of the bottom lip just like so

137
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.960
and I'm going to go ahead and add some shadow to the bottom side of this jaw line because as a Curves

138
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.220
underneath there's going to be some shadow

139
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.540
side.

140
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:48.120
So then we can bring this shadow from his cheekbone further down into his face all the way down into

141
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.870
here.

142
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:59.080
Then we can go ahead and draw his ear in just a little bit darker and some more detail in there.

143
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.470
And then ran out of shadow underneath this year.

144
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:11.670
So you also have some shadowing on his neck muscle and underneath his Adam's apple a little bit of shadow

145
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.350
here.

146
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.190
Also want to keep that pretty light without very hard edges.

147
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.990
And now we can go ahead and detail in his hair.

148
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:28.660
So I'm just going to quickly add in some minds for his hair slicked back.

149
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.170
So it's pretty simple.

150
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.350
Then on his sideburns it might be a lot shorter hair something to add those short hairs.

151
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.630
Continue to sweat his hair back all the way to the back of his head or his hair might get a little bit

152
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.970
shorter.

153
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.320
Perfect.

154
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:20.700
So now drawn a male face from the profile of you hope you really learned something from this lecture.

155
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.020
And I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

156
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.270
We're we're going to go ahead and learn how to draw each individual part of the face.
