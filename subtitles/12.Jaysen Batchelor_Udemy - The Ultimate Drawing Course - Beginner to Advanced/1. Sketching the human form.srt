1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,590
All right in this lecture we're going to be learning how to draw the human form.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,560
Now the first thing you need to do if you want to draw the human form is you need to find some reference

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,660
and then you need to study that before we can get into how to break it down into separate shapes you

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,510
need at least have a very basic understanding of what the human form is made out of.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,600
And the only way you can do that is by actually looking at photographs or still lifes of real people

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,640
and drawing them.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,940
So in this lecture we're going to be drawing some photographs of some female forms and some male forms.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,730
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,750
So looking at my reference right now and the first thing I always like to do is I always like to do

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,780
a really rough quick sketch that takes about 30 seconds.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,010
So I don't want to spend a lot of time on it.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,060
I just want to really quick put down those lines and try to get the best representation of my pose as

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,620
I can get.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,410
So let's go ahead and get started.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270
So go ahead and start by drawing the torso.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,730
I'm just trying to draw exactly what I see and this doesn't have to be perfect.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,800
You're just trying to quickly get down that pose so you can start to understand it.

18
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:17,190
And then after we do this one we're going to go ahead and jump in and do some more advanced stuff and

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:02:28,940
spend a lot more time studying the pose.

20
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,540
All right.

21
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,020
Great.

22
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,350
So now I have a very basic rough sketch of my pose what I'm going to do now is I'm going to spend a

23
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,780
lot more time doing my second sketch.

24
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,640
So it's going to be the same exact pose from the same photograph except this time I'm going to spend

25
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,570
a lot more time studying the photograph and making sure that I get it looking correct.

26
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,930
So let's go ahead and start doing it.

27
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,860
Some paying attention to which direction each line is going whether it's a little bit horizontal or

28
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,730
if it's completely horizontal or a little bit vertical or or diagonal you really want to pay attention

29
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,580
to the angles and make sure that you're getting them all down exactly as you see them all the information

30
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,340
you need is right there in your reference.

31
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,590
So go ahead and use it.

32
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,870
Now this lady is a little bit off.

33
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:09,700
So many go ahead in every set and move it over a little bit because in my reference image this is actually

34
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,260
a little bit more towards the side.

35
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,850
So when you go ahead and fix that now

36
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,580
all right great.

37
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,430
Now I didn't really do very much explaining with this because there's not really much to explain.

38
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:32,090
It's just like do any still life you're just going to copy the post exactly as you see it and try to

39
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,280
copy it as best as possible.

40
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,220
I know it's going to be really difficult because drawing human form can be very difficult.

41
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,620
But don't worry in the next few lectures we're going to go into a little bit more explanation of how

42
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,980
the human body works and how to draw the pose and break it up into simple shapes.

43
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,350
But for now you need to have a really good understanding of all the parts of the body.

44
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,940
So like each part of the arm the torso the chest the pelvis the legs.

45
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,190
You need to really start to study that and understand how it's working.

46
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,390
Now the reason why we did this really quick rough sketch was to basically warmer selves up.

47
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,870
So it's just like when you're working out before you start lifting weights you want to warm up so you

48
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,870
can lift more.

49
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,890
And so by doing a really quick rough sketch of our pose before we did the second one that warms us up

50
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,900
to draw something really good.

51
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,620
And you'll be able to do a lot better work if you warm up first.

52
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,860
Now let's go ahead and try one more of these.

53
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,350
But this time it's going to be a sketch of a male figure.

54
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,430
All right.

55
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,240
Great.

56
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,810
So now we've done two sketches of a female form animal form.

57
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,790
Now if any of you're are really skilled at drawing the human form you can probably already tell that

58
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,490
these are not perfect.

59
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,960
And the reason why is because I haven't actually laid out my structure and so I've just been drawing

60
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,090
these straight off of my reference image without actually drawn any shapes or structure making sure

61
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,850
that I have the correct proportions in the next lecture.

62
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,860
We're going to go ahead and learn how to break the human form up into simple shapes that we can then

63
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,730
replicate to draw really quick and accurate forms.

64
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,970
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.

65
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:05,260
Your assignment for this lecture is to draw at least one human form from a photograph and then go ahead

66
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,500
and post that to the Q&amp;A section of the Course or the Facebook group.
