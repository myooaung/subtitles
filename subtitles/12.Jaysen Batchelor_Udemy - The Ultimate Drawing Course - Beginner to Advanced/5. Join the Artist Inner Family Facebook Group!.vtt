00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.740
What is the artist Facebook interfamily group well it's something that you're going to want to join.

2
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.350
So what it is is it's a Facebook group that I've created for all my students that are enrolled in an

3
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.380
art course on this page.

4
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.550
You're going to be able to share your artwork as well as ask questions.

5
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.930
It's a very very useful tool.

6
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.780
And in my other game design courses I have another Facebook page for them and they've found the page

7
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.800
to be very useful and they get lots and lots of insight from the page.

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.800
So what are the benefits of joining the Facebook page.

9
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.470
Well first off it's a support group.

10
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.120
So if you're having a hard time sticking to your routine and making sure that you get your assignments

11
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.900
done it's a really good place to get support.

12
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.440
Let everybody know that you're having a hard time and I'm sure everybody would love to give you some

13
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.260
moral support.

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.940
Which brings me to the second point.

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.820
You can use it for motivation not just by getting moral support but also you can post your artwork.

16
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.670
Which brings me to my second point.

17
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.020
Motivation you can use the Facebook group to create motivation for yourself not just by having moral

18
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.690
support from everybody but also you can post your artwork in there and here all the great reviews from

19
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.900
people that like your artwork and it will really motivate you to create more and keep going.

20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.520
You can also use the Facebook group to ask any questions you have and to get help.

21
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.570
So if there's anything you need help with.

22
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.290
Go ahead and post it in the Facebook group and either me or another student can definitely try to help

23
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.610
you.

24
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.760
You can also use it to get critiques if you want to become a great artist.

25
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.180
You definitely want to get critiques on your art work.

26
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.220
You'll never grow if you don't.

27
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.120
If you want a critique of your drawing.

28
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.250
All you have to do is type in your post that you want me to critique it and then I'll go through the

29
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780
Facebook page and critique all the artwork that wants to be critiqued.

30
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.800
You can also use the Facebook group to make connections.

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.010
It's going to be a huge family of a bunch of other artists that are on the same path as you.

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.830
We're pretty close to the same path so take advantage of that and make some connections.

33
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.750
That's the way you network and get jobs in the industry.

34
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.520
Next you also get free content.

35
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.920
So what do I mean by this.

36
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.860
I mean if I have a run contest you're going to see it in the Facebook group.

37
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.410
If I create free content on my YouTube channel you're going to see it in the Facebook group if I create

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.170
any other type of free content such as drawing books or anything like that.

39
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.450
You're going to see it in the Facebook group.

40
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.250
So that is definitely why you should be joining the Facebook group and I really hope to see you there.

41
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.320
So how do you join.
