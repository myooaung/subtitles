00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,920
A wrapped in this lecture we're going to go over contouring lines even further.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,220
So like a said observation is one of the most important person when it comes to drawing.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,590
You need to learn to observe things.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,570
Now we're going to draw my book from life.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,930
But the thing is that most people make a mistake on is they usually look at their drawing too much and

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,330
they don't look at the object enough.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,330
You should be spending more time looking at the object than you do looking at your drawing.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,100
You need to be studying every tiny little thing.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,830
So for example me grab my booth.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,240
You'll see right here we have this corner and then we have the single right now.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,180
If I were drawing it if I spent all my time looking at my drawing and 10 percent of the time looking

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,490
at this angle I'd probably get the incorrect angle.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,620
But by looking at this angle over and over again and then looking at my drawing for a little while and

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,850
then looking back at this angle and studying it and trying to figure out what angle that is I'll be

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,590
able to draw that a lot better.

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,290
Same with everything else on the spool.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,130
So you want to spend most of your time looking at the object and hardly any time looking at your artwork.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,250
Trust me this sounds counterintuitive but believe me this will make your art look way better.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,850
The more you start observing from real life.

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,440
So let's go ahead and get started.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,200
So with this I'm going to spend about 50 percent of my time looking at my drawing and about 50 percent

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,330
of the time looking at my boot.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,310
So I'm going to go ahead and start drawing.

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,850
Now this is not going to be an endless line contouring drawing.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,860
I just want to actually draw the lines in the shapes that I see in my boots there.

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,430
So I'm going to do as I'm just going to look at my boots and then I'm going to draw the line that I

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:39,730
see.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,490
So that's the outer edge of my boot on the sole of my boot at least.

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,050
Here's the bottom part of my boot.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:02:01,730
There's that so comes over like so.

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,410
So for example I wanna make sure that I get the sheet correct so I'm spending a lot of time looking

32
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,910
at my boot.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,900
But then as I draw this line I want to make sure that I'm looking at my drawing.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,030
That way I create that the correct thickness of the sole of my boot.

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,220
Otherwise it's going to look off and even right here I sort of look away.

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,820
And that's why it's off.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,860
So I'm going to take my eraser and I'm going to go ahead and erase that

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,830
and then I'm going to go out and sort of redraw that in

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,910
like so and then I can finish the sole my boot and I can work on the next shape that I see which is

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,100
this back part of the boot which kind of curves up like so.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,450
And then I can start on the tip of the boot or the toe of the boot.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,490
And then I also kind of see the shape right here.

43
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:12,020
And I also see sheep like sell them that kind of curves around like that and this back area is a little

44
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,190
off so I want to go ahead and erase that

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,860
now pressing a little bit hard with my pencils.

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,540
So you want to make sure that if you want to race you're not pressing too hard you can always go back

47
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,820
and press harder.

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,330
So going to redraw this.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,220
It's not so curved.

50
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,290
And then we'll have a little bit more area for the foot to fit into that boot.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,970
And then I'm also seeing sort of the shape right here for the bill.

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,660
My boot and that's basically the basic shape that I've seen for my boot.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,330
Now we can go a little bit further and add some more detail.

54
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,180
So if I wanted to I can end this back area and add more of a curve there and then I can also add in

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,370
this back piece I can add more of this loop that I have on the back of my boot.

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,390
They use for pulling your boots on.

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,800
Let's see if we can add in each individual little hole.

58
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,940
Now the point of this is not to drive perfect drawing.

59
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,370
It's to try to get the lines as perfect as possible when it comes to resembling the lines on your actual

60
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,770
object.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,890
And so then we can even add in those shoelaces.

62
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,520
So there's one shoe lace coming over like so.

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,080
And there's another one coming up like so.

64
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,070
And another one come over like so.

65
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,580
And while I'm drawing this I'm really paying attention to everything about this and paying attention

66
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,270
to which shoe lace goes over what shoe lace.

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,890
So like over here for example this shoe lace is going to be underneath this shoe lace.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,510
So I'm gonna leave that area out and then I can go ahead and get that one in and I can add that one

69
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,010
in.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,670
And I'm also paying attention to how the shoe laces are curvy and so as we get up here to the top we're

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,990
going to get a little bit more of a curve.

72
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,410
And I missed the shoelace hole but we're going to get a little bit more of a curve.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,590
So it's going to curve more up like so.

74
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,990
Same with the other side.

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,790
So we're going to get more curve toward shoelace just like so and then we can also go ahead and add

76
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:21,100
in those stitches and we see them making sure that I had the same exact curve that my shoe has.

77
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,910
And then I can even go a little bit further and add some of the wrinkling that I see on the top area

78
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,700
of the boot.

79
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,430
And so I'm kind of seeing a wrinkle here.

80
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,440
So now even on life these lines don't appear.

81
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:43,980
It's good.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,590
So for you to draw them any ways that we start to get familiar with observing objects.

83
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,910
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

84
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,190
So in this lecture we learn how to draw conjuring lines and we also learned that we need to spend most

85
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,520
of our time observing the object that we're trying to draw.

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Now eventually you're going to be drawn out of your head but until you understand how real life works

87
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,600
and how real objects and real light works you're not going to be able to draw them.

88
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,140
So you need to make sure that you're studying from life objects and you need to learn how to observe

89
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,080
those in great detail.

90
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,570
So spend most of your time observing those objects and spend less time actually looking at your drawing.

91
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,370
You're watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
