1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,930
It in this lecture we're going to go ahead and draw on.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,670
Now the reason why we're going to start off with something so advanced is because we want to test out

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,470
your drawing skills.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,790
The reason why we're doing this is because I want you to draw the eye now before you've gone through

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,600
the course and then at the end of the Course what I want you to do is I want you to draw the same line

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,670
and you're going to find that your drawing skills go up by a lot.

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,630
As long as you do all the assignments and go through the entire course.

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,670
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,290
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start by drawing the shapes and lines that will

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,670
make up our on now any piece of artwork in any painting or digital piece of artwork.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,660
It always starts out with the drawing that's the base and if the drawing is good then the rest of the

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,770
artwork is not going to matter and it's not going to look good at all.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,750
So we want to make sure that we focus really well on the eye before we start adding in all of our detail.

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,710
So let's start with the main shape of the eye which is sort of the football shape.

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,210
Now it's not cheap exactly like a football but it's pretty similar.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,890
The thing you want to take into account is that it's usually more angled so rather than having a football

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,440
where one corner to the other corner of the football shape is on a horizontal line.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,820
It's going to be more at a diagonal line.

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:35,750
So it might be something like so and then we can maybe bring that side down a little bit more than down

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,870
here.

21
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,900
We're going to have the cornea.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,860
All right so now we have sort of the basic shape for the next thing we want to do is we want to add

23
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,190
in the basic shape for the actual colored part of the eye.

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,900
So let's go ahead and draw that in.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,700
It's basically just going to be a circle right in the center of our eye.

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,140
And you'll notice too that I'm drawing very lightly the way I do that is just by not pressing very hard

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,100
with my pencil.

28
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:10,520
But this way I can always go back and erase if I make something up and I can also do a build up of highlights

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,250
and values on top of this by doing it lightly the next shape we want to add in there is we want to add

30
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,560
in our eyebrow.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:24,250
So I'm going to start it right about there and then to go ahead and bring it over like so.

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,190
And then it's going to taper off in a down direction.

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,670
Just like so perfect.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,840
Now I want to play with the shape of my eye just a little bit more so I might bring that up to there

35
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,900
bring that down a little bit more and I might start this a little bit further out.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,260
So like I said making sure that you have your shape right is very important when youre creating your

37
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,780
drawings so you can also use the eraser.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,090
Like I said to a raceway err is that you don't want any longer perfect.

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,550
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in the eyelid.

40
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,450
So that's just going to be a line that starts out like so.

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,160
So there's a straight line at the top a little curved.

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,690
And then it's going to come down like so and follow the shape of my eye.

43
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,400
And then over here it's going to taper a little bit towards the edge of my eyelid.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,930
The next thing we want to do is we want to add in our pupils so the pupils just the black hole in the

45
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,080
center of your eye.

46
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,070
So we want to sketch that in.

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,140
We're going to make her pupil pretty small

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,690
or something like that should be good.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,390
Next let's go ahead and Emerton where we want the bottom eyelash to be and the edge of our eyelid.

50
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,810
So on this top area we're looking straight onto the eyelid.

51
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,840
And so we're not going to see the actual edge of the island but down here we're going to actually see

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,720
the top part of the island so we want to mark where we want that to be and where we want it to start.

53
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,440
So that's going to be the top surface of our eyelid and this will be the actual bottom part underneath

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,840
the eye.

55
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,630
Now let's go ahead and start adding in some detail.

56
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,230
So the way we want to add in detail is we want to start out by shading very lightly.

57
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,210
So I'm going to start with this top part of the eye so slowly I'm just going to darken it and thicken

58
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,120
the line.

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,060
And because this is a girl I I'm going to add a little bit of an eyelash off that edge.

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,250
Remember don't push too hard the further you get into the drawing the more refined it will become and

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,590
towards the end of your drawing you'll be able to add in some really dark lines.

62
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,950
But for now you want to make sure that you're staying very light.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:48,000
Then I'm going to sort of blend this into this edge like so so that way it's not such a hard line and

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,190
it will be look more like a soft shadow on the top of our

65
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:04,130
then I'm bringing in some light shadow onto the white of my own eye about their.

66
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,510
And then I'm going to add a little bit of shadow along this edge just like so.

67
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,640
Now this area right here has been left Weider because it's cold that bounce light.

68
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,030
Now I won't explain too much about it but it gives our eye more of a wet look when we leave that highlight

69
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,280
on that edge.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,860
Now we can add a little bit more of a dark edge along this edge.

71
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,650
You don't want it to be too dark but we want it to be dark enough that it stands out.

72
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,910
And then I'm just going to continue to thicken this line.

73
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,920
Now I want the top edge of my line to be pretty hard.

74
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:57,380
But this bottom edge can stay pretty soft.

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,130
I'm going to go ahead and add in a little bit of shadow into the corner of my

76
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,040
and then we can also add some darker shadow along the edge of our eyelid since that's where eyelashes

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,300
are going to begin.

78
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,110
And we can also add a little bit of shadow underneath this edge because this top part of the eyelet

79
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,200
is actually going to be hanging over this bottom part.

80
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,720
And so there's going to be a little bit of a shadow being cast over that.

81
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,650
So we'll add that shadow right now.

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,250
And I'm just going to continue to layer in my shadows.

83
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,820
Now you may be a little bit confused of why these shadows are being cast where they are.

84
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,590
Don't worry too much later in the course.

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,230
We're going to go ahead and learn all about this shadowing and highlight and values.

86
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,940
But for now just follow along and try to do exactly what I'm doing next.

87
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,690
Let's go ahead and start adding a darker edge around our eye shape.

88
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,850
Then we can start working this part of the pupil and we want to kind of leave this top edge out because

89
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,160
we're going to put a highlight over that or a reflection if you want to call it.

90
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,530
But we're going to go ahead and start darkening that in and then we can certainly in this outer edge

91
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,690
a little bit more.

92
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,190
Then let's go ahead and start adding some shadow and highlight to our Eilidh.

93
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,970
So this topper is going to be getting hit by the most lights so we're going to leave that bright white.

94
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,730
And then on the edges we're going to Durkan it just a little bit on this edge.

95
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,290
And then we want to add a dark shadow along this edge of the island so that way it stands out.

96
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,540
Now this is being this dark edge of being created by shadow and it's very thin because you're barely

97
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,760
seen into that shadowed area between the Eilidh and the top part of the eye.

98
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,300
The brow area but it's still creating that tiny little crease and crevice.

99
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,720
And that's where we're adding in that dirt edged shadow next.

100
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,970
Let's go ahead and start adding in some more sheeting up into this area.

101
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,630
And this is going to start adding form into the brow of our eye.

102
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,350
So we want to make sure that we add in this edge over here so that it adds some form over here and then

103
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,340
we're also going to add a little bit of form over here.

104
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,350
And what we want is we want this edge to be a hard edge and the edge on top we want it to be a soft

105
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,160
edge that slowly blends in to the top of the brow.

106
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,530
Next we can go ahead and search shading a little bit more on the top area.

107
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,400
As you're working on your artwork you want to make sure that you move around very quickly from place

108
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,680
to place because if you spend too much time working on one area you're going to overwork that area and

109
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,710
you're going to forget about everything else.

110
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,840
And then next thing you know your piece is not going to look correct.

111
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,530
So you want to make sure that you are jumping from place to place so as you're working up here if you

112
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,500
see something down here that needs to be fixed come down and fix it.

113
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,570
Drawing is not necessarily about focusing on one area it's about focusing on everything at the same

114
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,410
time.

115
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,950
Now this can be a little bit difficult.

116
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,500
But the more you practice drawing the easier this is going to become and eventually it's going to become

117
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,550
second nature and you won't even have to think about it next.

118
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,710
I'm going to go ahead and start adding in some darker shadow along this top area.

119
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,290
And I'm going to leave out an area up here because this is going to be my highlight or my reflection

120
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,400
on my own and I can sort of start to sketch that out a little bit.

121
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,750
I can also start to add a little bit of detail onto the eye.

122
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,160
So this part of the eye is an actual muscle that pulls your pupil open and closes it.

123
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,850
And so that's what these lines are is it's just part of the muscle.

124
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,400
Now I'm going to get too detailed with this muscle area but we can add a few lines in there just to

125
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,310
make it look a little bit more realistic.

126
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,470
And we'll come back later and even more detail to that to make it look better next.

127
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,760
Let's go ahead and add in a little bit of detail onto the eyebrowed.

128
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,050
So um OLman to do is I'm just going to darken that area that we have there.

129
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,680
So that's all I'm going to do for later we'll come back and add a lot more detail.

130
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,610
Now I'm noticing that it's not very dark great here so I want to darken out a little bit more because

131
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,550
I'd be a lot more châteaux there.

132
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,580
And I'm also going to blend it in a little bit more on that edge.

133
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,340
And then we can go ahead and add a little bit of shadow along this.

134
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:38,020
Now we can also add some shadow along the bottom edge because our eye is on top of this plane surface.

135
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,510
And so it's going to be casting a shadow down here.

136
00:11:43,280 --> 00:12:14,480
So we'll just add that in like so the dirt in this area a little bit more.

137
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,160
All right.

138
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,200
So it's looking pretty good in the next lecture.

139
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,990
We're going to go ahead and we're going to further detail this.

140
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,940
Make it look really realistic and also add a lot more value in there.

141
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,710
Add those little details like the hairs on the eyebrows the eyelashes and more detail into the cornea

142
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,340
of the eye.
