00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.200
All right in today's lecture we're going to be going over 2. perspective now to point perspective is

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.480
very similar to one point perspective.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.760
Really the only difference is that there are two vanishing points on a horizon line and those vanishing

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.010
points eventually connect.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.570
Now let me show you what I mean.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.340
So the first thing we always want to do when we're drawing perspective if you want to create a horizon

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.690
line and so remember the higher up your horizon line is the more it's going to look like you're looking

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.430
down on your objects and the lower It is the more it's going to look like you're looking up at your

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.360
objects.

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.470
So for example we're going to put it right in the middle so we're about eye level with our objects.

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.150
The next thing we want to do is you want to decide where are vanishing points are going to be.

12
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.620
So we're going to put one at both ends of our horizon line so one there and one there.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.010
Generally you want to keep your vanishing points as far apart as possible on your horizon line.

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.800
The closer they get the more distorted your image is going to look.

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.670
So we're going to put them on the foreigns And now we can go ahead and get started.

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160
The first thing you want to do is you want to create a vertical line.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.690
And this is going to be the corner of our object.

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.190
So create one vertical line like so.

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.840
And then what we want to do is we want to create the first face of our objects so we're going to create

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.760
the right side face of what's going to be a cube.

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.030
So all we do is we connect this edge or this end of our vertical line to this vanishing point.

22
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.210
So let's go ahead and lightly draw that in and then we do the same thing for the top

23
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.470
and we go ahead and do the same for our third one.

24
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.290
Go ahead and connect this Glasman.

25
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.100
So rather than looking down at one single vanishing point now we have two vanishing points on her page.

26
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.760
And so at this point it vanishes into that point.

27
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.530
And this plane vanishes into that point.

28
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.970
The next thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and create the other edges of our box so I'm going

29
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:21.370
to put another vertical line right there and then I'll put one more right over here on this edge.

30
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.910
Next.

31
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.030
Let's go ahead and drop in our bottom vertical lines and are top ones.

32
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.500
So they're more solidified.

33
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.350
So we'll draw from right there too right there.

34
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.280
Do the same thing for up here.

35
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.210
All right so now we have our cube into perspective.

36
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.980
So as you can see like I said each plane goes off to its own vanishing point.

37
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.420
Now let's go ahead and try another type of box.

38
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.000
So let's put a box in a different position so we'll put a box right here.

39
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.340
So go ahead and draw a vanishing line like so.

40
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.520
And that can be where my vertical line begins.

41
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.940
You can start off by drawing the center vertical line or you can start off by drawing where you want

42
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.330
the edges of your box to be.

43
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.510
So let's go ahead and draw this vertical line right here and I'll have it cover in this one.

44
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.910
Then we'll go ahead and draw from that vanishing point to this top edge of the line.

45
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.000
And we'll do the same thing for this side.

46
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.910
Whoops that was a little bit off but it will be fine.

47
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.590
Make sure they double check make sure you're on the vanishing point before you draw your line.

48
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.310
All right.

49
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.070
Perfect.

50
00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.300
So now what we want to do is we want to decide where are edges will be on the other side so I'll put

51
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.670
one edge right here and then I'll put another edge right here.

52
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.920
Now that we know where those edges are we can go ahead and create our top surface for our box.

53
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.120
So I'm going to come from this vanishing point to this edge of my box.

54
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.210
So go ahead and lightly draw that in Ixo and then go ahead and do the same thing for the other side.

55
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.260
So from this edge right here when I draw back to my vanishing point

56
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.790
and then we can go ahead and solidify all these lines and erase anything that we don't want to see.

57
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.710
So for example we don't want to see this line right here.

58
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.930
And I drew it in pretty dark so it's going to be kind of hard to erase.

59
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.220
That's why I always say that you need to draw lightly until you know exactly what you're doing.

60
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.380
Then we can go ahead and solidify these lines so we're going to start with this one word here.

61
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.050
Is just go all the way around and make sure that all her lines are really dark so we can really see

62
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:43.760
where this box is.

63
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.510
All right so now we've created a second box that is a little bit lower than this box so it appears to

64
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.360
be a little bit closer to us because it's in front of this one in its lower from the horizon line.

65
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.270
Let's try another one that's higher up so let's put one up here.

66
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.050
So let's go ahead and start by creating our vertical line.

67
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.990
Next let's go ahead and draw our vanishing point lines.

68
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.360
Draw from there to there from the top edge to our vanishing point do the same thing on this side.

69
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.180
And once you start feeling comfortable you don't even have to draw all the way back to your vanishing

70
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.660
point.

71
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.310
You can just draw right along this edge here to about the point where you think you're going to end

72
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.370
your box next.

73
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.800
Let's go ahead and draw our other vertical line so we'll draw one right here.

74
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.930
Draw a second one right here.

75
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.530
And then let's go ahead and draw our second Vanishing Point lines from this edge corner all the way

76
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.750
back turning machine points will draw a line there.

77
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.170
Number two the same thing for the other edge

78
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.100
and we want to make sure that they cross right there.

79
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.130
That's where we know we can stop them.

80
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.550
Let's go ahead and solidify these lines by drawing them in darker

81
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.240
All right great.

82
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.210
Now one more thing I want to show you is how to connect a box into one perspective so let's say we wanted

83
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.760
a smaller box right here ad that's touching this box or connected to this box or this is how you do

84
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.000
it.

85
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.080
First you want to start a vertical line starting on your actual box.

86
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:07.140
So let's go ahead and grab our ruler and draw a vertical line like so.

87
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.630
And however you want your box that's how tall this needs to be.

88
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:17.360
Next quote We're going to do is we're going to go ahead and draw a line from this vanishing point to

89
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.310
that edge.

90
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.650
So but we don't have to draw all the way across here.

91
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.540
We just want to start it right here so we can go ahead and draw a dark line like so next to what we

92
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.740
need to do is we need to draw a line from our vanishing point down to this point right here.

93
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:39.580
So we can go ahead and draw that in and just eyeballing about where that would be coming straight down

94
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.690
from that point.

95
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:49.000
So now you go ahead and draw in our vertical line from there to there so and then we want to connect

96
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.210
this quarterback to that vanishing point and this back to that vanishing point.

97
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.880
So let's go ahead and do that

98
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.720
and then let's go ahead and connect the top on

99
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.640
and again I'm just eyeballing about where that is coming straight down from there.

100
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.850
So then we can go ahead and try and come down like so.

101
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.850
And then we want to create that top line for this box.

102
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.050
So let's go ahead and create that.

103
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.830
So all we have to do to do that is draw a line from our vanishing point to that top corner here.

104
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.870
So go ahead and draw that in.

105
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.570
And then we have to connect it from this side to that point.

106
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.160
Also

107
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.660
go ahead and connect that.

108
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.000
So now I have a top line.

109
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.390
Now all we have to do is just go ahead and erase away area of the box.

110
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.580
We don't want to see because it's behind the transparent box.

111
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.540
You can leave that there.

112
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.930
All right.

113
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.360
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

114
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.370
So in this lecture we learn about 2 point perspective and how it works.

115
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.590
We learned that you have to have two vanishing points on your horizon line and those are vanishing points

116
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.680
have to connect at some point to create your object such as this cube right here.

117
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.040
We also learned that the lower your object is on your page the more you're going to see the top surface

118
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.610
and the higher it is the more eager to see its bottom surface.

119
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.350
We also learn how to connect one object to another and in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and

120
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.970
actually draw a picture using two point perspective.

121
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:27.410
Now with your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and create two point perspectives so you can

122
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.580
draw the same exact picture I drew right here.

123
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.250
Or if you want you can go ahead and experiment and try placing the cubes in different areas in different

124
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.180
sizes and shapes of cubes.

125
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.280
And go ahead and create that 2 point perspective.

126
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.860
Don't worry about making shapes like circles or triangles or anything right now because that's a little

127
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.920
bit more complicated and we'll get into that later.

128
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.620
For now just practice creating cubes in 2 point perspective.

129
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.870
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
