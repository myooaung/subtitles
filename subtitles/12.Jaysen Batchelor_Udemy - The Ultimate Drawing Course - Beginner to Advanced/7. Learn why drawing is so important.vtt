In this lecture I wanted to talk about why drawing is so important.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.030
Drawing is extremely important in all aspects of life not just in art.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.730
And remember drawing is all about fundamentals.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460
So why is drawing so important.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.780
Well first off it's the building block of all art.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.000
Now there are for sure artists out there that don't draw at all but for the most part the majority of

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.570
all great art starts out with drawn.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.280
And if you don't know how to draw.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.010
Everything else is just going to crumble around.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.390
So all of your painting techniques and whatever techniques that you want to use are going to crumble

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.970
to the ground because you don't have the fundamentals of drawing.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.940
Another big reason why drawing is so important is because studios will take you if you can draw if you

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.380
can paint but you can't draw then they're not going to take you.

14
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.100
They need people that can draw.

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.460
And I'm talking about any type of studio an animation studio a videogame studio all different types

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.390
of studios.

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.750
They want you to be able to draw more than anything.

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.600
Let me share a story about this.

19
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.110
So as many of you know I got an internship with an animation studio when I was only 17 and I had no

20
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.020
idea how to use Photoshop which was the primary program that they used to do basically everything in

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.410
the studio.

22
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.860
Now how did I get an internship with them.

23
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.090
If I had no idea how to use Photoshop it was because I knew how to draw.

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.760
I walked into the studio with my sketchbook and it only had drawings in it.

25
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.470
I didn't know how to use Photoshop.

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.750
I didn't know anything else except for drawing and so they gave me an internship because they knew they

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.210
could teach me the techniques that are on top of drawing but remember drawing is the fundamental.

28
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.380
Another reason why drawn is important is because drawing skills can help you get jobs not just with

29
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.920
studios but in a lot of different places.

30
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.260
If you can be that guy in the meeting that can sketch out what they're talking about or it can sketch

31
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.290
out the product you're going to be a lot more valuable to a company.

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.730
Which brings me to my last point which is drawn is the easiest way to convey an idea.

33
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.880
You can talk about an idea you can explain it all you want but at the end of the day the best way to

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.080
show an idea is to draw it.

35
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.070
So I just wanted to quickly go over these reasons with you so that you had a better understanding of

36
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.160
why drawing is so important in society.

37
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.910
And I also wanted you to understand that you are gaining a very valuable skill that can be used in many

38
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.480
many many different industries.

39
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.430
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
