00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.180
All right in this lecture we're going to go over how to use detail and in value to create space in your

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.200
drawings.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
So we're going to be drawing a picture of a mountain range with a forest in front of it.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.670
So let's go ahead and get started.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.600
The first thing we want to do is we want to sketch out where we want our mountain range to be.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:26.030
So I want it to go about in the middle of my composition so I don't have one mountain right there and

7
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.990
I have another one to come through here.

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.090
So and then I'm to have a second mountain range behind that.

9
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.490
So go ahead and create another mountain range back here.

10
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.080
So and then I want to go ahead and draw in where my trees are going to be.

11
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.150
So basically they're going to be pine trees and so they're basically going to be tall skinny triangles

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:25.940
so I'm going to skip those and just by sketching in some basic triangles.

13
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.680
All right.

14
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.230
So next we're on want to do is I want to start with my foreground so my foreground is whatever is closest

15
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.970
to me.

16
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.130
And this is going to be the darkest thing on my image because it's the closest the further away things

17
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.820
get Remember they get lighter.

18
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.080
And so this will be our tree line right here.

19
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.330
So we're going to go ahead and fill these in really dark.

20
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.180
And I'm going to speed this section up because this is going to take a little while.

21
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.770
So let's go ahead and get started.

22
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.140
All right.

23
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.030
So now that we have our tree line put it in and this is the darkest part of our whole entire image we're

24
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.010
going to go ahead and move on to the second layer of our mountain range.

25
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.640
So like I said there's two layers.

26
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.670
There's this first one and then there's this one behind it.

27
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.900
So this first one is going to be lighter than these trees but it's going to be darker than these back

28
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.110
mountains.

29
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.130
This first layer of mountains is also going to have more detail than this back layer of mountains.

30
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.480
So let's go ahead and get started.

31
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.300
So first off I'm going to go ahead and decide where the edges of my mountains are.

32
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.280
So we need to divide this so we can add in some highlights and values in there.

33
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.870
All right.

34
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.770
Now let's go ahead and let's start adding in some highlights and shadows.

35
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.070
So I want to go ahead and start with this side and I'm just going to slowly start shitting at them and

36
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.690
don't forget we want it to be lighter than our tree layer.

37
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.940
Right now I'm going to go ahead and Durcan these edges just a little bit more.

38
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.260
We have a little bit more definition.

39
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.370
I'm going to go ahead and add a layer of that value over the top of all this.

40
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.710
A darker value.

41
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.000
So that way we have from Derocher mountains so that these mountains back here can stand out a little

42
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.390
bit more.

43
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.440
Then just really quick we'll go back over all these chateaus on a mountain just to darken them.

44
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.050
So they sent out a bit more also also

45
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.350
and then I'm just going to add a little bit of a darker contrarian line across the top of this mountain

46
00:07:41.350 --> 00:08:07.630
range so I have that right there that right there.

47
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.600
Perfect.

48
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.130
Now let's go ahead and move on to these background mountains so I'm just going to go ahead and very

49
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.810
very lightly fill those in

50
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.970
aren't.

51
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.170
Now this drawing is basically done.

52
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.330
Now if you wanted to spend hours and hours making a drawing like this look amazing you wouldn't necessarily

53
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.540
have these contour lines along these edges and you wouldn't you would have a lot more detail on it.

54
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.510
But for now we're just going to leave it like this because I just wanted to demonstrate to you how you

55
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.370
use value in detail to create depth and space in your image.

56
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.790
So first off let's talk about how we used the values in our drawing.

57
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.610
So we started with our troops which are the closest things and the closer things are at the darker we

58
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.850
want the value to be.

59
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.950
So the trees are the darkest part because they are the closest.

60
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.210
Then the next darkest part is this First a mountain range.

61
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.410
It has the most value compared to this Bakra mountain.

62
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:14.230
And this Bakare mountain has almost no value at all in anything that has the least value is a sky.

63
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.350
Now in every case it's not going to be exactly the same.

64
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.720
You can have something white in your foreground or background sky might actually be dark Greys because

65
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.780
it's a cloudy stormy day.

66
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.860
But generally the further something is away the lighter it's going to be.

67
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.640
And then let's talk about details.

68
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.140
So our trees have some detail but not too much because they're really dark.

69
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.550
And then we look at a mountain range.

70
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.750
The first layer of mountain range has a lot of detail you can see all the shallowing on it.

71
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.320
You can see where the edge of the mountain is on each one of these peaks.

72
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.630
But then if we have a look at these mountains that are further away there's really no detail on it at

73
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.810
all.

74
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:55.660
We just see the the contouring line on top of them and then we just have a value that filled them all

75
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.850
completely and with the same exact value.

76
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.180
So there's not really any detail because of how far away they are.

77
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.120
Now if you wanted to take it a step further you could also blend this value into your sky just slightly

78
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.740
so it would just be a very light blend of so.

79
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:17.190
So and that way it would sort of soften that edge and make it look a little bit out of focus.

80
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.660
All right.

81
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.780
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

82
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:25.360
So in this lecture you learn how to use value in detail to create space in your drawings.

83
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.370
So what I want you to do now is I want you to redraw this image or you can even go outside and find

84
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:35.950
something to draw such as a car with a building behind it whatever you want and try to apply this to

85
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.120
it.

86
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:42.010
So make whatever is closest have darker values and whatever is further away have lighter values also

87
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:48.340
make things that are close up have more detail in the things that are further away give them less detail.

88
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.630
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
