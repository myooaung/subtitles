00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,320
Art in today's lecture we're going to create a drawing using one point perspective.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,670
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,590
So if you remember from yesterday what you need to do first is you need to create your horizon line.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,880
So we're going to put our horizon line a little bit more towards the bottom of our page.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,930
So not quite all the way at the bottom but a little bit past the middle.

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,240
So let's go ahead and create that line.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,610
Remember you want to keep it pretty light.

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,010
Next let's go ahead and decide where one point is going to be.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,500
So I'm going to put it off to this side this time.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,760
Next let's go ahead and decide what we want our picture to be.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,040
So I'm thinking that we want it to be a farm.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,440
So let's go ahead and start drawing our farm.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,720
So the first thing you need to have on your farm is you need to have a barn.

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,990
So I'm going to draw that barn in right now.

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:01,640
So we start off by drawing the front face of our barn so barn tends to be shaped like a square and then

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,110
we have sort of half a hexagon on top.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:13,510
Like so and then we can go ahead and solidify that shape by drawing it in even darker.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,870
And if you want you can use your ruler to do this.

19
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,100
Next we want to go ahead and add in our vanishing point lines.

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,160
So we're going to draw one from each corner.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,620
Remember to keep these really light so that you can erase them.

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,860
And then this one is basically the horizon line itself.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,940
So we don't actually have to draw a line for that next.

24
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,180
Let's go ahead and let's add in the other edge of our barn.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,700
So we'll draw that line right there and then we'll draw this one right here.

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,600
Perfect.

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:02:01,030
Then we can go ahead and solidify these lines like so that we want to go ahead and erase away machine

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,240
point lines.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,580
The next thing you might have at a barn or a farm is a road.

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,190
So let's go ahead and create a road going along the side of our barn.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,770
So what we're going to do is we basically just create one vanishing point line like so and then we create

32
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,560
another one like so.

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,770
And now we have a road we can go ahead and add detail to this if we want so we can add stuff like grass

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,130
to the side of our road.

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,210
So there might be some grassing you know over the edge

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,740
and the further away it gets.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,770
But remember the last detail we're going to have.

38
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,920
And so that grass texture is going to slowly dissipate.

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,830
And then this road is probably going to be a dirt road so we can go ahead and sort of a dirt type of

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,560
texture to us.

41
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,260
So I'm just going to draw in some lines like so and these might be tire marks

42
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,910
and the further down they go they're going to start to disappear.

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,690
Smith over here will do the same thing so sort of creating some tire marks in the dirt.

44
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,750
And then we can go ahead and add in some rocks in there too.

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,150
So we might have some tiny little rocks on our road

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,660
and the further away they get they're going to get smaller until you finally can't even see them anymore.

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:36,860
All right.

48
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,360
Perfect next.

49
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,910
Let's go ahead and actually add some more detail to this barn.

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,700
So first off I'm going to go ahead and add in a door so I'm just going to draw a rectangle like so and

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,290
then the barn doors usually tend to have a frame around them.

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,970
Then they usually have an axe going through.

53
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,230
So to go ahead and draw in those x clinks

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,360
Ixo.

55
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,600
And then there's usually a loft up here at the top.

56
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,640
I want to go ahead and draw that waft in.

57
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:13,480
So I'm just going to draw a window like so and then I can add the shutters onto that and I'm going to

58
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,580
add in two diagonal pieces of wood like so on the bottom pieces for my shutters.

59
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,780
And then I can go ahead and fill in this window with a Durka value since it's looking into a dark barn.

60
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,660
Perfect.

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,970
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in some windows on this side of my barn.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,330
Now since it's in perspective we're going to do something a little bit different.

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,220
So first off we need to draw our vanishing point lines for the bottom and the top of our windows.

64
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,710
So then we need to decide where windows are going to be.

65
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,330
So we're in have two windows on the side so the first one is going to go right here.

66
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,680
So we draw two vertical lines like so and then we can go ahead and feel that in the next window is going

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,410
to be next to it except the thing with this window is it's going to get a little bit skinnier because

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,520
it's further away.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,430
So we're going to go ahead and add that in like so as you can see I've made that one a little bit thinner

70
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,690
than the one next to it and it would continue to do this all the way back to the vanishing point.

71
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,470
So if we had another window next to that it would get even thinner.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,580
Or it's next let's go ahead and add in a fence to our barn.

73
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:32,870
So I'm going to go ahead and draw one of my vanishing point lines like so now will be the bottom of

74
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,710
my fence and then I'll drive the next one over.

75
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,630
Like sir.

76
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,920
Now this is going to be a wooden fence.

77
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,220
And so it's going to be made out of slots of wood.

78
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:52,940
So my first lots of wood are going to be vertical and they're going to be about that far apart.

79
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,280
Now for the next little while they're going to appear like they're the same distance apart and eyeball

80
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,530
this as best you can.

81
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,260
But the closer towards the vanishing point we get the closer they're going to get

82
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,260
sooner.

83
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,840
Notice here that they are very very slightly getting closer together.

84
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,440
And then as we get to the other side of a barn so back behind this barn they're getting closer together.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,680
And then when we get to here they're going to be really close together and I'm just going to drive it

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
in by hand.

87
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,880
They're going to get to the point where you can't even see them anymore.

88
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,020
So there's a fence.

89
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,290
Now let's also go ahead and add in perhaps.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,900
So a lot of farms have house so the farmer can live there.

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,790
And so we're going to start off by drawing the bottom vanishing point line for House and then we'll

92
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:53,150
add the top per So and this house is going to be a little bit closer to the camera.

93
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:02,660
So let's go ahead and add in that one right there and then we can create the side view of our barn or

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,080
house.

95
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,820
Sorry.

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,340
So there's a side view of her house.

97
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,340
Then we can go ahead and add this edge in next to what we want to do is we want to add a roof on this

98
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,660
house.

99
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,560
So I get to go ahead and draw a roof shape like so.

100
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,290
And then we also want to add a roof for porch so I'm going to have another shape coming off like this

101
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,300
and we're going to have that on the other side too for this edge.

102
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Then we can go ahead and connect the top of our roof.

103
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,540
So and then we can go ahead and connect these two lines.

104
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,900
So we have the edge of our roof for a porch.

105
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:45,960
Great.

106
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,640
Now let's go ahead and solidify those lines so go ahead and Durkan all of these lines in much more

107
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,350
power.

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,430
Next we need to go ahead and add in some posts that are holding up this porch.

109
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,000
So what we need to do first is we need to find where the bottom of those lines is going to be.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,660
So we're going to come down from each corner like so that will come down from this corner also.

111
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:35,210
And then we need to connect this line with that one or there's Go ahead and use our ruler to connect

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,450
that just like so.

113
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,160
So now we know that's the point where we need to connect this all the way back to our vanishing point.

114
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,060
So let's go ahead and connect that back

115
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,620
so now we know where this point is for the bottom of our other post also.

116
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,940
So now we can go ahead and draw those posts.

117
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,330
We'll go ahead and use my ruler to draw those.

118
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,680
And a lot more darker and then all added this side of the post.

119
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,120
Can also add in the other side of the post.

120
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,660
Now we're going to want to go ahead and erase away this line that's behind the post.

121
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,100
So it looks like a solid object.

122
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,310
Go and draw those lines back in.

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,920
Then let's go ahead and do this post also.

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,370
So we'll go ahead and we'll draw this line in.

125
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:37,440
And in this case we're actually only going to see this sign.

126
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,490
All right great.

127
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,340
Now really quick.

128
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,840
Let's go ahead and add in a window on this side of our barn.

129
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,680
And then let's go ahead and add a door on the front of our house.

130
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,440
So we need to go ahead and draw a vertical line like so.

131
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,720
And then we need to take that vertical line back to our vanishing point so we get the top part of our

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
door.

133
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,470
And then we need to go ahead and draw a vertical line coming down from that point mixer.

134
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,510
So now have a door.

135
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,050
And if we wanted to we could even add an edge to that door by coming in horizontally like that and coming

136
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,800
up vertically and then connecting this like so.

137
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,610
And now we have a door there we can even put a door handle on that.

138
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,260
All right.

139
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,910
So now we just drawn a picture using one perspective and we can go ahead and erase away all these vanishing

140
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,160
point lines because we don't need them anymore.

141
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,680
And our horizon line is really flat.

142
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,060
Usually your horizon line is not going to be flat like that in a drawing or when you look at things

143
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,780
in real life.

144
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,600
So what we can do is we can change that up by church changing the horizon line into more hills.

145
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,540
So I want to go ahead and draw out the shape that I want.

146
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,350
My horizon line to be so.

147
00:10:48,530 --> 00:11:04,920
And then we can go ahead and erase away our straight horizon line.

148
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,090
All right.

149
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,980
So there is a one point perspective drop.

150
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,290
Now you can really take your time on this and spend hours on end you really should.

151
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,440
I just don't want to spend too much of your time each day doing these lectures.

152
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,000
And so I want to try to make this as quick as possible.

153
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,430
But this is the basic idea of drawing a picture with one perspective.

154
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,730
Now your assignment for today is to go ahead and draw a one point perspective drawing and it can be

155
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,720
whatever you want.

156
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,530
It can be a house it can be of a bus it can be of train tracks whatever you want.

157
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,500
Just try to incorporate onepoint perspective into Draw on your picture and then go ahead and take a

158
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,060
picture of that and posted to either the Kewney section of the Course or the Facebook group.

159
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,150
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in tomorrow's lecture where

160
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,600
we're going to talk about two point perspective which is even way cooler than onepoint perspective.
