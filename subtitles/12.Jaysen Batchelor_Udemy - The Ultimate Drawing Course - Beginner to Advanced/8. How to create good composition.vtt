00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.450
Aren't in this lecture we're going to be going over composition.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.250
So what is composition.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.510
Well composition just comes down to basically where you place your objects in your image as well as

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.300
what kind of contrast in values your image has and that all create creates your composition.

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.530
So I like to break down composition into five basic rules for composition.

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.490
Now you don't always have to follow these rules.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
In fact I highly encourage that you break them sometimes just so you can experiment.

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
Now a lot of people will tell you that these rules cannot be broken if you want to create good artwork

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.400
but if you talk to any really good artists almost all of them will tell you that you can break these

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.250
rules whenever you feel like it but they're really good to understand and use as a guide for creating

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.350
your compositions in your art.

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.250
So the first one is central composition so central composition is just when it says that there is an

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.660
object in the center of your image and that's going to be your focal point.

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.840
And just by putting it in the center that makes it your focal point.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.580
So for example let's say that we draw a building right here in the middle of her image.

16
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.240
OK.

17
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.580
So those are building now a lot of the time in central compositions.

18
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.380
You're going to have your vanishing point in one point perspective right in the center along with your

19
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.720
object so if we put a vanishing point right there will have vanishing lines coming off like so are perspective

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.390
lines.

21
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.200
And then what we can do is we could go ahead and align these perspective lines with trees.

22
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.800
So let's say we have a tree right here.

23
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.570
And then as it comes down to the next area of the vanishing line we're going to go ahead and have another

24
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.920
tree.

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.870
But this tree will be a little bit taller because of perspective.

26
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.440
And we'll just continue to do that all the way down.

27
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.020
We'll do the same thing on the other side.

28
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.810
I'll have one more for you right here.

29
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.300
But even though once we race away these are vanishing lines they're still going to be there.

30
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.770
Subconsciously you're going to know that there are vanishing lines going off to this vanishing point

31
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.290
and all that points to the center.

32
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.080
Plus her object is in the center.

33
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.490
Plus we can also Durkan our object so that it's more of the focal point because it'll stand out more

34
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.880
because there's more contrast between our object and our background now.

35
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.810
But that is central composition.

36
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.400
The next one is called the rule of 30.

37
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.280
So the rule of thirds says that if you break up your image into thirds you can use this as a guide to

38
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.810
create a good composition.

39
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.770
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw two lines like so and make sure that the distance

40
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.130
between each line and the edges of my page are about a third apart.

41
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.180
And so now I know that anything that I put on these lines are probably going to be a good bet for where

42
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.710
I'm going to position an object in my drawing.

43
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.790
Then you can also go ahead and operate the horizontal lines of your page up into thirds.

44
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.210
Also like so now generally this top line or the bottom line are the best place to put your horizon line.

45
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.510
So most of the time people put their horizon line down you're at the bottom so let's say that we make

46
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.660
this bottom area our horizon line and then let's say is that we want to add it in an object.

47
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.210
So let's say we want to add in a person.

48
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.810
Well we probably want to put a person right here on this line because this is the rule of thirds is

49
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.060
saying that you want to put things on these lines and that will help your image look really good.

50
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920
So there's one person right there on that third line.

51
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.770
We have a horizon line on this third line and then we can even fill up a whole third of an area with

52
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.140
an object too.

53
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.070
So let's say this whole area is here we want to fill that most of that in was something.

54
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:06.100
So I'm going to add it in a house that basically takes up the entire third of my image so I can go ahead

55
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:15.050
and add and a window right there and even a door.

56
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.020
So now that takes about 30.

57
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.730
Now the next rule is called focal point contrast.

58
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.290
Now what this is it's just contrast within your focal point.

59
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.240
So like we've gone over before it's basically just drawing the viewers idea into whatever you want by

60
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.940
creating as much contrast as possible and contrast can be created in many different ways through line

61
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.170
quality through values.

62
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.020
So we can put contrasting values next to each other.

63
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.410
You can also do it with color if you're using color and your drawings and you can also use it by doing

64
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.860
texture in your drawings by having contrasting textures.

65
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.510
So let's try an example.

66
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.800
So let's say that we have an object right here in our drawing.

67
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.680
What say that it's an apple.

68
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.100
K

69
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.610
so those are Apple.

70
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.700
Now we're going to make this apple a white glowing Apple.

71
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.040
So by adding in a glow around the edge of our apple and making our dark brown black it's going to create

72
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.690
that focal point contrast.

73
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.330
So let's go ahead and fill her background with a turkey color.

74
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:28.380
And as we get closer up to the edge of her apple we're going to feed that in to the White value around

75
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.500
it.

76
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.990
So it looks like the apple is actually going

77
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.600
great.

78
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.610
Now another thing like I said we can do is we can add some contrast in texture.

79
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.520
So for example let's say that our background is a really rough texture and then we're going to leave

80
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.490
our Apple a very smooth texture so we're not even to add any texture to our Apple but we might add some

81
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.030
really harsh texture to our background.

82
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.490
And as we get up to the edge of her apple we're going to leave that texture out.

83
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.400
And we can go ahead and Durcan these edges just a little bit more.

84
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.960
Also

85
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.510
and so now we've really created some focal point contrast by creating two different textures.

86
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.160
One is the apple which is very smooth and has no teacher at all.

87
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.280
And then a really rough background texture that we also created focal point contrast by adding in a

88
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.620
darker background and then leaving that really bright around the apple and leaving the Apple completely

89
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.010
white.

90
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.760
So we have that contrast in values that creates a focal point.

91
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.810
So as soon as we look at this drawing your eye goes directly to the apple.

92
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.000
All right the next composition type is depth of field.

93
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.980
So we've already kind of gone over this with detail when we went over how to create space in your drawings

94
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.730
but depth of field is basically just blurring one layer of your image and keeping another layer in focus.

95
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.730
So for example let me draw a little diagram really quick so let's say that we have a person right here

96
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:29.240
and then further up we have some trees in our composition like so you can see the tops of those branches.

97
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.160
And then let's say that we have our background

98
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.810
which has some mountains on it.

99
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.090
Well if you're taking a picture of this with a camera what your camera is going to do is it's going

100
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.780
to focus on one of these layers because there are different distances.

101
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.250
So if you wanted to focus on this character right here then this character would be really sharp and

102
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.680
have hard edges and lots of detail.

103
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.370
Then the next layer would be a little bit out of focus meaning it would be a little bit blurry.

104
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.700
And then by the time you got to this Bakare an area because it's the furthest away would be very blurry.

105
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.910
Now you can change the depth of field by focusing on this middle layer.

106
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.910
And so now that would be really sharp and have a lot of detail.

107
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.850
And then this character would be blurry and this background would be blurry.

108
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.270
So when you're creating a depth of field with drawing it can be a little bit difficult but it can still

109
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.920
be done.

110
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.920
But it's something you definitely want to understand when it comes to creating artwork.

111
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.260
So let's say we're going to recreate this image right here.

112
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.300
But rather than having these trees here we're just going to go ahead and at the background in.

113
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.480
So first off I'm insert off by sketching out a really light character so we're just going to show the

114
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.400
shoulders up.

115
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.070
So there's my character.

116
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.170
Next I'm going to go ahead and add in my background so in his background we're going to have some mountains

117
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.950
just like so and maybe there's going to be a few trees down here at the bottom.

118
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:12.370
Like so then we might add a little bit more detail onto this mountain.

119
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.130
Perfect.

120
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.240
So our background is going to be in focus and our character is going to be out of focus.

121
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.580
So that means we want the edges of our character to be very blurry so we're going to start off kind

122
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.980
of lighter and then we'll work our way to darker colors.

123
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.480
But we want to make sure that the edge of this character is blurred so it's out of focus.

124
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:18.090
And so now just by creating that gradual gradient from my dark value to the lighter value of my background

125
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.200
I created the illusion that my character is blurry and out of focus.

126
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.430
But now I've created that depth of field so it looks like you're looking past the character and to the

127
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.270
background.

128
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:33.450
And that really creates a focal point by making whatever you want your viewer to look at in focus and

129
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.970
making other things out of focus.

130
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.370
Now let's go over the last one.

131
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.600
Symmetry and balance.

132
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:46.020
So asymmetry basically means that your object is the opposite of symmetrical meaning that the things

133
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.710
on both sides of your lines.

134
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.810
If we divide our drawing up into the middle things on both sides of that line do not match up.

135
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.540
They don't reflect each other.

136
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.360
So let's so let me show you what I mean.

137
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.840
So we have a bottle right here.

138
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.810
If this was symmetrical we would add another bottle in the same exact spot on the other side.

139
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.560
But we want this to be asymmetrical because it makes our composition much more interesting.

140
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.130
So over here we might add a book

141
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.290
like so go ahead and add some pages to that book.

142
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.460
Durkan in the cover.

143
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.190
So this is a symmetry.

144
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.480
So this makes your drawings much more interesting if they're completely symmetrical.

145
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.160
They're going to look really boring.

146
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.890
But you also want to keep in mind that you want to create something called balance and balance just

147
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.170
means that your image is filled on both sides.

148
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.230
Now like I said sometimes you can break composition rules and so sometimes you don't want your image

149
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:56.110
to be balanced meaning that one side might have an object and the other side has nothing on it that

150
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.270
would create an imbalance in your drawing.

151
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.100
Right now our drawing is pretty balanced because we have an object that is relatively the same size

152
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.340
on both sides of our drawing.

153
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:14.260
If we were to add a pumpkin on this side behinder bottle like so and then we were at a bowl over here.

154
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.680
I'm going to go ahead and outline my composition so we can see where we are a little bit more.

155
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.090
Well now it's out of balance.

156
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:28.030
This doesn't look right because this site has much more stuff but if I were to go ahead and add in a

157
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.460
few more things on this side I don't really know what just a ball and whatever else I want to do maybe

158
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.920
another bottle back here.

159
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.190
Well that kind of balances it out a little bit more.

160
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.530
The middle of her composition is looking a little bit better so I'm going to add an object right there

161
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.840
too.

162
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.230
But now our image is looking much more balanced.

163
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:54.040
Now let's look at an example of something being in balance so if we were to draw an image like so

164
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:03.960
and not say we had a horizon line like this and then let's say we had a character that we're here standing

165
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.120
on our horizon line and that was the entire image just the foreground the sky and our character.

166
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.930
Well this is empowerments because there is only one object on this side and there's nothing on this

167
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.520
side.

168
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.720
Now something we could do to make this more balanced is we could go ahead and add a hill on this side

169
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.150
of our horizon line like so.

170
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.180
And that kind of balances out our entire image.

171
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.160
So it's almost like you have to imagine that each object and thing that you add to one side of your

172
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.330
image whether it's the sides of your image or the top in the bottom are kind of like a weight.

173
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.260
And so if it's in balance it's going to topple over.

174
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.770
But also keep in mind like I said you can always break these rules.

175
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.010
So just because you have a character on a flat rising line.

176
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:52.800
So let's go ahead and erase this hill just because you have a character on a flat horizon line and it's

177
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.200
imbalance does not mean there's anything wrong with that.

178
00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.300
Sometimes that works and sometimes you want to do that because it makes your viewer feel uncomfortable

179
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:06.240
and that might be what you're trying to create with your viewer or right that brings us to the end of

180
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.280
this lecture.

181
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.880
So in this lecture we learned five basic composition rules.

182
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:15.330
So the first one we learn is Central which is where you put your focal point in the center of your image

183
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.300
and then you have lines pointing to that center image.

184
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.100
If we wanted to we could also add in other lines in here that are in perspective that would also point

185
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.470
to our center image.

186
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.210
Next is the rule of thirds.

187
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.520
So the rule of thirds says that if you break your image up into thirds wherever those lines are if you

188
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.490
put your objects on those lines or fill those areas in that you're going to create a nice looking composition

189
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:45.200
the next one is focal point contrast so focal point contrast says that whatever you create contrasts

190
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:51.390
between is going to be your focal point whatever has the most contrast meaning and value in texture

191
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.000
and in line that's going to be your focal point.

192
00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:01.320
Then the next one was depth the field depth the field is just where you blur one layer of your image

193
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:06.110
in order to create a focal point on another area of your image.

194
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.520
And the last one is it's asymmetry and imbalance.

195
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.630
So you want to keep things asymmetrical that way your image still looks interesting.

196
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.640
So like here we have all kinds of different objects.

197
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.760
It's not copied onto this other side of our symmetrical line.

198
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.670
And so it makes it look much more interesting but then you also want to keep in mind that you want your

199
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.520
composition to stay relatively balanced.

200
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.470
But then we also learned that sometimes it's OK to create imbalance especially if you want your viewer

201
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.900
to feel a little uncomfortable and it's not always that they'll feel uncomfortable.

202
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.180
Sometimes you can just break this rule and it's fun.

203
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.670
It just makes for an interesting looking composition.

204
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.200
All right.

205
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.410
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
