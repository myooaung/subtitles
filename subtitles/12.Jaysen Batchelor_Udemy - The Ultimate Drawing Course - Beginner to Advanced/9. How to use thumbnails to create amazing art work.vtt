00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.340
Or out in today's lecture we're going to be going over the importance of creating thumbnails when you're

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.640
doing your drawings.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.040
Now what is a thumbnail.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.280
Well a thumbnail is basically just a very simple almost crude sketch and generally you want them to

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.650
be pretty small.

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.480
The point of a thumbnail is to figure out your shapes your values and your composition.

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.610
So let's go over a few examples of when you might want to use a thumbnail.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.620
So let's say that you're doing a character design well before you get started with that character design.

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.120
You should really start doing thumbnails of what you want that character to look like.

10
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.020
Starting with the pose and the shape of the bottom.

11
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.120
So if we were doing a character with a square head we would stirred up by doing some nails of characters

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.550
with square heads and we could try out different sized bodies give her poses for what it is that we're

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.960
trying to create.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.880
We can try another one right here so maybe the head will be a little bit bigger and the body will be

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.140
really small and have really long legs and then have arms like so.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.880
And then we can even try one with a small head like so and then maybe a big round body and then maybe

17
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.490
some fat legs like so and then some feet and then we can have some arms coming off like so

18
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.500
now we can try even one more.

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.210
So let's say that we just wanted an average size head with an average sized body maybe a little bit

20
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.100
longer narrower and then we could go ahead and add in some legs for that character.

21
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.240
And we can go ahead and create some hands and arms for that character and this and now these are considered

22
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.810
thumbnails.

23
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.900
They're very simple crude sketches.

24
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.550
Once you decide which pose or shape you want to use then you can take that in further detail.

25
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.390
So let's say that we want to take this character here so I'm going to do is I'm in a lightly re sketch

26
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.930
that

27
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.890
I'll add in those arms.

28
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.820
And now on top of this I can start adding details so let's say that we want this to be a girl so we're

29
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.540
going to add some eyelashes for the eyes and then we can start some mailing ideas for the hair.

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.670
So maybe she could have a big afro and she'd have ears

31
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.710
just go ahead and detail this out and then we can also do a bunch of thumbnails over hairstyle because

32
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.280
maybe we don't want this hairstyle or maybe want to try some different things.

33
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.900
And so we can draw a bunch of thumbnails of hairstyles.

34
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.470
We can just redraw her head and we don't even have to draw a face.

35
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.200
We can just do her basic sheet of her head and then try tried different hairstyle so we can try another

36
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.890
one that's really cool and squiggly like so and then maybe we can try one more over here.

37
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.580
And this one might be more of a long wavy hair so it might hang down like this

38
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.150
but that's the point of a thumbnail.

39
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.090
So you can start really sketching out ideas really quickly and not worry about them looking really good.

40
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.640
You're just trying to get some ideas.

41
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.090
And then once you get your idea down you're going to take this and go ahead and refine it even further

42
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.880
and run with it until you create your final piece of artwork.

43
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.080
Now what if you wanted to use this to decide what your values are going to be.

44
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.840
Well if we have a character right here we can just quickly sketch out how our values are going to work

45
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.530
on our character.

46
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.800
So if I just finished drawing this character real quick.

47
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.940
Well now I can go ahead and add some value in there.

48
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.400
So when it comes to doing my drawing my final one I already know what values I want.

49
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.490
So let's say that we want our hair to be darker

50
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.870
and then let's say that we want her skin to be dark too.

51
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.880
But we still want it to be pretty light.

52
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.640
That way it's contrasting with her hair.

53
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.250
And then go ahead and add in her shirt so her shirt is probably going to be either lighter or darker

54
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.420
color or we can do both.

55
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.040
So don't go ahead and add in some DERKS sleeves on this character but leave the main body of her shirt

56
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.480
white.

57
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.790
Now we can come down to her pants where we can make those darker because we're trying to create contrast

58
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.700
between each part of her body.

59
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.860
And so now we already know how the contrast and the values are going to work on her character.

60
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.820
So when we go to draw the actual final drawing of this character we already know how you want her to

61
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.160
look now.

62
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.860
How do you lay out compositions.

63
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.490
Well you basically just need to sketch out really quick rectangular boxes or whatever the size of your

64
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.180
drawing is going to be.

65
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.120
And then you could just do a quick drawings or sketches of where you want things to be placed.

66
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.620
So let's say we're creating thumbnails for a landscape so we could go ahead and career horizon line

67
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.530
and then we can go ahead and add a mountain or here in the foreground.

68
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.340
And we can add mountain back here in the background and get out a tree right here.

69
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.150
Now we have a very simple composition drawing and if we don't like that we can change things up by creating

70
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.470
a second composition drawing.

71
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.180
And this time we can actually move the horizon line up higher and that can be our only change or only

72
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.710
difference.

73
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.320
So it's going to be the same thing.

74
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.400
It's just everything is going to be moved up higher.

75
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.070
So we will be right here.

76
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.880
And it's also going to be cut it off because of where horizon line is we can go ahead and end those

77
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.780
background mountains and then you can try other things where you completely change your composition

78
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.400
by let's say we put our horizon line back down here at the bottom below to say we want this mountain

79
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.700
to be on the other side.

80
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.830
So we'll go ahead and the mountain in there.

81
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.500
Now I must say that we want this tree behind the mountain even though that doesn't make any sense and

82
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.050
that's one giant tree.

83
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.340
But that's all right.

84
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.950
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.950
Here we want to add a character

86
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.900
and so the reason we want to do this is because you want to try to create as many ideas for your art

87
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.790
work as possible.

88
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.800
Now I know this can be really time consuming but trust me the more thumbnails you create the better

89
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.180
ideas you're going to have and then you're going to be able to use ideas from one thumbnail and atom

90
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.230
to a second thumbnail and you'll be able to build on top of that until you have a final product that

91
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.550
looks really good.

92
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.440
So I highly recommend that you use thumbnails when you're creating your drawings.

93
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.790
So your assignment for this lecture is to pick an idea that you want to draw.

94
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.700
Whether it's a character an animal an environment drawing or landscape drawing and I want you to go

95
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.690
ahead and create 100 different thumbnails for that.

96
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.480
Now these thumbnails can take as little as 10 seconds to create maybe even five seconds for you.

97
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.020
Or you can spend a little bit more time on them but I'd really recommend you try to do them in about

98
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.340
10 seconds each.

99
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.620
So you're not spending a whole bunch of time doing this.

100
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.750
The point of thumbnails is not to create a masterpiece is to really lay out those ideas and try different

101
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.840
things until you get something that works.

102
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.340
Now every professional artist out there uses thumbnails.

103
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.690
I guarantee it if you ask any of them they'll all say that they go through hundreds of thumbnails for

104
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.860
each project.

105
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.810
I know I do.

106
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.640
So definitely do this assignment.

107
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.120
And also definitely do this before you create any of your artwork.

108
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.880
Try to do at least 20 different thumbnails for each piece of artwork that you're going to create to

109
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.880
watch in this lecture.

110
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.130
And I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
