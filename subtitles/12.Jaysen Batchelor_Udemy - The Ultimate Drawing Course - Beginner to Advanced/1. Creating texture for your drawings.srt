1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,060
Or not in today's lecture we're going to be going over texture now texture is very important for creating

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,280
realistic artwork and even nonrealistic artwork texture is what makes her artwork look interesting.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,600
So once you get down the fundamentals such as shape and form value and contrast Well then you need to

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,840
add another layer of some interesting detail on there to really make your artwork pop.

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,270
So today we're going to be going over how to create texture.

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,050
The first type of texture you can create is with contouring lines.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:39,500
So I'm going to quickly draw four circles like so and these are actually going to be spheres.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,560
And what we're going to do with them is we're going to add some conjuring line texture to it.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,780
So how do you do that.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Well let's start with this first one.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,480
So the way I'm going to add in that texture is just like so it's going to be a fur texture and so on

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,270
I to do is I'm going to add in some contouring lines in the shape of my fur and some really randomise

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,970
knit some of them are a little bit curvier but they're just very short simple lines that give the idea

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,930
that this sphere has some fur texture.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,680
You'll also notice that my fur up here at the top is a lot flatter than down here.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,500
Down here it's almost hanging because of gravity.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,150
Now we can go ahead and add in some more fur texturing on the inside of our sphere.

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,060
Just like so.

19
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,280
So now that looks like fur even though there's no highlights or shadows but it still gives us the idea

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,140
that there's further.

21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,260
Let's try another one.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,070
So the second one we're going to make sort of a chipped away rock type of texture.

23
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:50,660
So I'm going to start by creating the outline contour line of my sphere and it's going to be a little

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,280
bit rocky and jagged.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,380
Rather than being a perfect sphere.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,380
Like so next I'm going go ahead and start adding in that texture.

27
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,970
So I'm going to do is a master of making some geometrical forms mostly trap a woods and a rectangular

28
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,850
type shapes and maybe a triangle or two in there but I'm just going to start connecting these to create

29
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:21,500
the texture of sort of a chipped away type of rock texture.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:28,160
Now as we get towards the edge of our shape these shapes are going to be a lot thinner because they

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,740
are curving around or object.

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,520
And so you're going to see them in perspective.

33
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:54,210
And then as they start to come around towards the middle they're going to get a little bit wider.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,890
Perfect So now we have a really cool texture on that.

35
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,730
Let's try another one.

36
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:05,160
So the next one we're going to do is going to be sort of a holy type asteroid type of a rock.

37
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,430
So let's start with the outside contouring line.

38
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,900
So first off I want to add in some holes on the outside of my rock and these holes look like ovals because

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,980
they're on the very edge of them.

40
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,370
And so if I take a circle and turn it sideways you're going to see an oval because of that perspective.

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,660
So let's go ahead and start sketching that in.

42
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,890
So we want a very rocky Jagadish type of feel to the outside contouring it line.

43
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,790
Sync so and then we can go ahead and start adding some whole textures in there.

44
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,360
Ruthe perfect.

45
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,970
So now we have that really cool type of asteroid rock texture on that sphere.

46
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,110
Now let's try one more.

47
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,300
This last one is going to be sort of a rock texture that's nice and cracked and has a couple of little

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,160
small dots and holes in it.

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,540
So first off I'm going to add in those cracks.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,140
Now you want to keep in mind that these cracks are being projected onto this round surface.

51
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,320
So you need to take that into account when you're drawing your crack so you'll see this one right here

52
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,990
kind of comes around in a curve.

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,480
Although it can still be a little bit random just because it is a crack.

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,840
Right.

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,210
Great.

56
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,270
Now let's go ahead and draw our outside countering line.

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,200
I mean they have these overlap just a little bit because I think it makes it look interesting.

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,120
So you'll see I kind of created a little edge at each one of these cracks and then we can go ahead and

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,080
add in some more texture and thereby drawing some really white holes in the spots.

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,410
And sometimes texture is just as simple as that.

61
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,750
Just adding little dots and spots onto your object to really break it up.

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,410
Sometimes when I'm doing a portrait drawing I like to add little spots and dots in random places in

63
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,770
my background just to add some extra texture to my background.

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,230
It just makes it look really nice.

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,780
All right.

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,400
Perfect.

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,230
So now we've created four different textures by using contouring lines now to really make your textures

68
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,940
look realistic.

69
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,340
You need to be using highlights and shadows.

70
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,400
So now we're going to start working with highlights and shadows to create texture.

71
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,470
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a fur ball like we did before but this time we're

72
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,220
going to use highlights and shadows to make that look a lot more realistic.

73
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:38,590
So first off I'm going to go ahead create my circle like so next I'm going to go ahead and add in my

74
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,660
shadow and I don't want it to be too dark.

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,880
I just want to start a base shadow in there and then we'll go ahead and have the rest of the shuttle

76
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:53,440
and when we add in the fir.

77
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,870
So now we're ready to start adding in her fur.

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,750
So the way we're going to add an R for is we want to make sure we first have a nice chirp in pencil

79
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,880
and then we're going to go ahead and start at the top.

80
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,710
And like I said before because of gravity it's going to be pulling our hair down.

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,860
So this hair is going to be gone sideways as we get to this point.

82
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,380
It's going to be going diagonally and by how we get down to this bottom it's just going to be hanging

83
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,530
straight down.

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,990
So let's go ahead and get started.

85
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:23,790
So what we want to do is we just want to start adding in random lines like so coming off of our ball.

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,930
And remember to keep those angles in mind because of that gravity.

87
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,320
That's really what's going to make your fur look real is how it hangs.

88
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,700
And then the light and shadow

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,630
we've got to start off by getting the outside of our ball

90
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,690
some curved ones in there we can add some straight ones.

91
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,520
We want to make it look really random.

92
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,130
The more random the more realistic it will look.

93
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,490
And up here we can have a few that are sticking straight off and more at an angle.

94
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,750
But for the most part want him to be hanging down because of gravity.

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,590
And then we can go ahead and start adding more to this inside area.

96
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,460
So go ahead and start adding more random lines and you'll see creating this texture is really just as

97
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,250
simple as adding in simple lines.

98
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,820
Now up here I'm trying to keep my lines a little bit lighter.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,890
And as I get into the shadow area I want to start darkening those lines.

100
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,860
So once I start getting over here on the surface making it darker

101
00:07:50,220 --> 00:08:37,990
and that way we can start introducing the shadow and highlight to our firm.

102
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,600
Next what we want to do is I want to start adding some overlapping shower or some cast shadow coming

103
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,620
from some of these pieces of hair.

104
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,680
So I'm going to start lumping them into kind of large groups of hair so certain that like for example

105
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,900
right here we're going to go ahead and start adding some darker shadow and underneath the hair like

106
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,980
so.

107
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,010
And then that slowly going to fade off into the fur underneath it and we go ahead and start adding that

108
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,450
throughout our entire sketch.

109
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,140
Great.

110
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,030
So no we just created a realistic texture which was for texture by using the highlights and shadows

111
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,760
as well as our contouring lines.

112
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,850
Thanks for watching and I really look forward to seeing you in tomorrow's lecture.
