00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.760
Art How can you get a guaranteed win out of this course.

2
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.990
One of my biggest pet peeves when I'm taking a course online is when the instructor just hands me their

3
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.970
course and they don't give me any further assistance.

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.840
I can't ask them questions.

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.630
If something's not working or something has changed in the program there's nothing I can do about it.

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.620
And so that's why I want to offer to you guys one on one.

7
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.710
So make sure you take advantage of that.

8
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.350
But the first thing you need to do to get a win out of this course is you need to take the first step

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.870
and get started.

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.860
You're already watching this lecture.

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.960
But you need to continue forward until you get to your first project lecture where you can create your

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.520
first project and have something tangible that you can see that you've drawn.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.310
The second thing is you need to finish the course.

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.860
Make sure you go all the way through and do each lecture and do all the assignments in making sure that

15
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.660
you do all the assignments is very important.

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.350
There are no great artists out there that got there by not practicing.

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.930
And that's why it's so important to make sure you do all the assignments because the point of them is

18
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.900
so that they can practice and the assignments are specifically designed to take you from the beginnings

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.330
of drawing all the way to an expert level of drawing.

20
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.070
Also remember take it one step at a time.

21
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.950
You don't have to look at the whole course and think oh I have to take all of this all at once.

22
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.110
Think of it as each lecture equals one day.

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.920
Which brings me to my third point.

24
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.470
Make sure that you practice every day.

25
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.610
Make sure you're either doing a sketch or doing one of the assignments or make sure that you're watching

26
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.140
a lecture every single day.

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.460
The next thing you need to do to get a guaranteed win out of this course is participate.

28
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.420
When I say participate what this means is first off you need to ask questions.

29
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.150
If you don't ask questions you're just never going to have your questions answered.

30
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.220
So make sure that you take advantage of the fact that I answer all your questions and ask all the questions

31
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.120
that you have.

32
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.210
You can post your questions in the Q&amp;A section of the course which I'll show you how to do here in a

33
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.390
second.

34
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.700
Also make sure you join the Facebook interfamily group this group is a great place to ask questions.

35
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.910
Post your artwork and get feedback from everybody else.

36
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.630
Also if there's anything you need you can go ahead and ask an inner circle family and see if anybody

37
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.010
can help you out in any way.

38
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.430
Now how do you post a question on you to the course all the way you do it is first you need to come

39
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.130
to your course dashboard.

40
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.260
Once you're here you need to come over to where it says Q&amp;A and then you're going to go ahead and search

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.660
for your question.

42
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.400
So I might have already answered the question to another student.

43
00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.120
And so all you have to do is search right here in this bar and your question actually might come up

44
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.670
and it might already be answered.

45
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.700
So make sure you do that before you ask your question.

46
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.200
If you don't see your question answered then what you want to do is want to come over to ask a new question

47
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.420
and you'll go and click that and then all you have to do is title your question and then add your description

48
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.370
which is basically a question.

49
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.910
Now if you have to add any links you can go ahead and use this linking icon right here.

50
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.130
And if you need to add any images to show me what you're talking about go ahead and use this image insertion.

51
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.040
Now to get you into the habit of sharing and participating in the course.

52
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.090
What I really want you to do is I want you to create a new question and I want you to do this right

53
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.010
now.

54
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.550
Now you're not going to ask a question what I want you to do is I want you to type your name in the

55
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.690
question title and then down here in the description.

56
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.840
I just want you to type out a description of who you are.

57
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.310
What are you working on right now.

58
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.300
You can even include some artwork that you've already done in the past and let us see who you are and

59
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.470
what you're doing.

60
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.230
I'm super interested personally in my students and I'd love to see what you guys are doing and learn

61
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.970
about what it is that you guys want to learn.

62
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.880
So go ahead and share that with us and I super appreciate that.

63
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.920
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

64
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.450
So in this lecture I took you through how to get a guaranteed win out of this course.

65
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.200
So the number one thing is to get started.

66
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.750
Next you need to participate by asking questions and posting in the Facebook group.

67
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.120
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you throughout the course.
