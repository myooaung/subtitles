1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,530
All right in this lecture we're going to talk about contrast.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,240
Now contrast is very important in treating artwork into songs that contrast you wouldn't see the difference

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,320
between things and that also would not look as appealing if you didn't have contrast in your drawings.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,400
Now what is contrast contrast is just the difference between values so something that has really high

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,170
contrast would be black and white.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:34,670
So if I do a black box right here and I do that right next to a white box.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,650
Well there is a lot of contrast between those two colors.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,280
And so that's all contrast is the more contrast there is the more distance there is between the values.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,300
So for example if I took this mid value between our mid-tone and our darker color and I went ahead and

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,580
I put that right here

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,500
and then what say I took this light gray wrote here that's in the middle of my white and my midterm

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,510
and I added that and right next to it

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,370
like so well there's less contrast between these two colors.

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,340
So even though there's still contrasts between them and you can tell the difference between the two.

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,780
There's a lot more contrast between this White and black.

16
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,960
Now in some cases you might have no contrast at all.

17
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,210
So it might just be one solid color.

18
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,020
And in other cases you might not even be able to see the contrast because it's so subtle.

19
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,710
So let's go for an example of this.

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,530
So let's say I took a gray from right here and that was the side.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,080
So go ahead.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,850
So that in

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,910
and the say I took a break from this side.

24
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,300
So right next to that green and it's almost going to be in the same color just barely barely whiter

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,650
like so.

26
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,340
So you can barely see that difference between those two colors yet it's still contrast but not very

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,160
much.

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,660
Now this can be applied to any area of the spectrum of contrast.

29
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,320
So it's not just in the middle.

30
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,030
If we came up here to the top and we had white

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,170
and white was next to let's say a really light gray

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,520
so there's not very much contrast between those two colors and yet it's still up here at the top side

33
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,460
of our chart.

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,820
Now what about down here.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,920
It can be the same way.

36
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,340
So if we had black

37
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:53,230
and we put that next to another color such as this one right here that's right next to it.

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,520
So again there's still a contrast there.

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,760
You can just barely see it because the two volumes are so close to each other on the value chart.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,080
And so when you're trying to create contrast you want to make sure that your values are far apart on

41
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,970
the contrast chart.

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,200
The closer they are the less contrast there will be.

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,650
So let's try some more examples of this.

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,830
So let's say that I have a gray background.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,370
And let's see.

46
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,620
I want to create a lot of contrast between my background and my foreground objects.

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,000
Well the most contrast I can create between a great background and my foreground is by using the color

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,390
black.

49
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,450
So let's say we had a black circle here

50
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,090
well that's the most contrast I can create between my object and my background.

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,930
Now what if I didn't want very much contrast what I could do it was I could go ahead and create my gray

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,870
background like so.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,660
And then I could add in another bowl.

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,760
But this one would be a little bit lighter like so it's another less contrast between the background

55
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,400
and my goal now one could also do this with a what.

56
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,530
So let's say we had a white board here and then we had our gray background.

57
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,410
And now that still contrast.

58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,240
So there are many different reasons why we want contrasts but the thing to note is the more contrast

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,500
that you have between an object the more it's going to draw in the viewers eyes in.

60
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,900
So let's say for example we are drawing the eyes of a woman.

61
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,020
Now I know these eyes are not perfect at all but I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes.

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,190
So why are women's eyes supposedly so print.

63
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,270
Well the reason is because they put a lot of contrast in their eyes by adding eyeliner and mascara.

64
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,670
And so for example if we just have it like the normal and let's say that they're not really wearing

65
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,950
any makeup at all.

66
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,700
No I'm not saying that older men have to wear makeup.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm just seeing why make it look so good on some women.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,130
But the reason why is because they're creating contrast so their eyes are very white the white of their

69
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,580
eyes.

70
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,360
And then this And then their eyelashes are very dark.

71
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,150
And so by adding in those dirt eyelashes against the white of their eye.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,010
Go ahead Phil in covert part of their eye the dark ash eyelashes against the white of the eye makes

73
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,250
a lot of contrast and humans like contrast.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,610
That's why the more contrast you can incorporate into your irk the better it will look.

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,370
But getting back to my point.

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,550
Your your eyes are drawn straight into her eyes because they have the most contrast and that's a really

77
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,870
important thing that we're going to go over later is finding a focal point for your drawing.

78
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,460
You need to find one focal point and there's many different ways that you can make people's eyes drawn

79
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,640
to that area and focus on it.

80
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,630
And one of those is to create contrasts whatever area has the most contrast and the drawing is where

81
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,830
the viewers eyes are going to be drawn to first really quick.

82
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,140
I wanted to show you a few examples of really good use of contrast.

83
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,990
So first off we're going to have a look at the Mona Lisa.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,170
Now all of you should be familiar with this painting.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,920
It's probably the most famous painting ever created.

86
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,390
Now with Mona Lisa it very well utilizes the use of contrast.

87
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,590
Now the first way that it utilizes it is first off.

88
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,370
It draws you into the focal point.

89
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,300
And if you haven't guessed yet it's her eyes why her eyes the focal point.

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,560
They have the most contrast so her eyes the white of her eyes are probably the widest part on the entire

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,160
painting and the darkest part on the entire painting are her eyes themselves.

92
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,980
It's darker than any of these other dark colors down here or at least it appears it appears like it

93
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,950
is because it's next to such a bright color.

94
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,950
And remember the more contrast between two colors the lighter or darker color will seem the next way

95
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,750
that it strongly utilizes the use of contrast is by differentiating between different parts of the Mona

96
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,440
Lisa.

97
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,290
So for example we know that this is her face and then we know that this is her neck and chest area because

98
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,600
it's separated by the shadow which is more contrast.

99
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,630
And then we know that this area is her hair because it's the darker area.

100
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:17,010
And so by making our hair dark and then making the face area lighter and then making her clothing darker.

101
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,490
She differentiates between each separate thing and then her hands are in this dark area but they're

102
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,210
lighter and so they stand out because of the contrast.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,350
And it's the same thing with the background.

104
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,030
So her head of really stands out because this area of the background is lighter.

105
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,350
And then as it starts to get closer down towards her body where he doesn't want you to focus too much

106
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,920
it becomes darker.

107
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,720
And so there's less contrast between her body and that the background.

108
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,420
And so it doesn't stand out as much.

109
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,820
Now let's have a look at another example.

110
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,670
So here's a character design I've done in one of my courses and I've taken all the color out of it so

111
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,370
we can only see the values.

112
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,150
Now you'll notice that it's the same with the Mona Lisa as it is with my character that the eyes are

113
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,210
the focal point because the eyes are the darkest part of the entire picture and the white of the eyes

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
are the lightest part.

115
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,970
And so we're creating the most contrast right there.

116
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,810
Then the next thing I want you to notice is how every single object of my character is placed next to

117
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,720
a value that is contrast with it.

118
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,920
So we start with the hair.

119
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,170
The hairs are really light great and then that's touching this dark gray end of the sword.

120
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,130
And it's also touching these goggles.

121
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,920
And then these goggles are touching the light skin.

122
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,940
And then this light skin is touching the dark eyes.

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,790
And then if we move down to the scarf the DERKS scarf is touching the light skin.

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,630
And then if we move down to the shirt the shirt is mainly a dark gray.

125
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,860
And it's darker than the scurf right here and so it's making a contrast.

126
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,580
And I even created more contrast by adding a drop shadow underneath the scarf.

127
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,150
So that way there's even more contrast between this scarf right here and the shirt.

128
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,340
And then we have contrast between the shirt and the gloves.

129
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,850
And then we have contrast between the glove and the sword handle.

130
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,100
And then to make sure that there is still contrast between the sword handle and the blade even though

131
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,930
it's darker down here I created a gradient so the blade starts out lighter.

132
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,570
Since it's a reflective metal we can do this.

133
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,680
And so the blade starts out lighter down here and slowly turns into a darker gray towards the end.

134
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,460
That way we still get contrast with the hair and the skin and we still get contrast with our sword blade.

135
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,850
If we come down to the pants.

136
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,300
There's contrasts between the shirt and the pants.

137
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,730
And then there's contrast between the pants and the boot.

138
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,320
And so what I'm trying to show you here is that when you're creating contrasts in your image not only

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,130
do you want to create a focal point but you want to create contrast between every object that you can.

140
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,920
The more contrast you have the better it will look.

141
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,260
If all of these were the same color or all of them were dark Grays it would not look as good.

142
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,090
Let's go ahead and move on to our last example.

143
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,780
So our last example is a drawing of Davy Jones that I did.

144
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,390
And once again the eyes are the focal point because those are the darkest part.

145
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,940
Next to the lightest part and so it stands out the most.

146
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,190
The next thing I wanted to point out is how we differentiate each part of Davy Jones by having contrast.

147
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,590
So first off let's point out how there's contrasts between his face and its tentacles and his hat so

148
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,010
his hat is a much darker value than his skin.

149
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,910
And then his skin is a much lighter value than his jacket and his vest.

150
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,680
And so we're creating a differentiating contrast between those two objects to help us understand what's

151
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,930
going on in the picture.

152
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,680
And then if we keep moving down we create contrasts between his hand and his clothes.

153
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,820
And then we even create contrasts between the belt and his shirt or vest if you want to call it.

154
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,960
And that helps us differentiate the difference between the vest and the belt itself.

155
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,340
So contrast is extremely important in creating good artwork.

156
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,570
And the last thing I'll point out is that we have a lot of contrast between David Jones and the actual

157
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,290
background.

158
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,250
So he sticks out completely.

159
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,130
If we had all other types of things going on in the background that were the same values it would it

160
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,300
would completely distract you from the drawing of David Jones.

161
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,130
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

162
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,120
So in this lecture we learned about contrast we learned that the further apart values are on the value

163
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,570
spectrum the more contrast is going to be and the closer they are the less contrast.

164
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,690
We also learn that if you want to make your artwork look good you need to have a focal point and you

165
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,040
need to create that by using contrast.

166
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,520
Then we learned that if we want to create a differentiation between two objects we can do that by using

167
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,260
contrast.

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,730
So if you have a bowl sitting on a table and the ball is a light gray color then you probably want to

169
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,110
make the table a dark gray color.

170
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,980
That way you create as much contrast as possible because you're watching this lecture.

171
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,010
And I really look forward to seeing you in the next run or we're going to delve a little bit deeper

172
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,330
into contrast.
