00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:10.240
All right in this book aren't in this lecture we're going to take this image of these two apples and

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.060
we're going to draw them using only values.

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.510
So we'll draw a really outline which will be our contouring lines.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.970
But then after that everything else is just going to be straight up that you know contour lines or anything

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.230
else.

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.820
We just want to use complete street value so that we can start to learn how to observe from real life

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.220
and copy it the way exactly how we see it.

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.700
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.870
Now we're only going to be doing one of these apples.

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.260
It's going to be the one on the left and only this image after this lecture and the next lecture.

11
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.050
You'll be able to download it for your own use.

12
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.750
So let's go ahead and get started.

13
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.400
So like I said the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the conter in line.

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.850
And by the way this is sped up by two times just so it doesn't take as long

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.050
and you want to keep your contour line really light that way you can go back and erase areas if you

16
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.120
need to.

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.700
And you just want to sketch in that basic form in there and then start adding in shadow and highlight

18
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.090
so the right here you see I'm adding in the contour line for my stem and this edge right here was a

19
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.450
little bit too small so I had to erase it and bring it out a little bit further.

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.940
And then I need to decide where my cast shadows going to be.

21
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.800
So I first start off by really lightly adding in where the bulk of my shadow is going to be.

22
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.120
And you always want to make sure that you start off lightly and then progressively get darker and darker

23
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090
as you go along.

24
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.990
This way if you need to make changes along the way you can always erase.

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.820
But if you push too hard at beginning it's going to be really hard to erase later

26
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.430
and like I said in the very beginning of this course you always want to be looking at your reference

27
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.240
more than you look at your actual drawing.

28
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.360
So you can actually see where my head is looking but probably more than about 50 percent of the time

29
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.520
I'm actually looking at my image of the Apple rather than my drawing because all that information you

30
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.480
need is on the apple.

31
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.540
It's not on your drawing.

32
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.320
It's on the apples so if you don't know how dark it is in a certain area you just look up and look at

33
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.000
your picture of the apple and then you do the same thing you see in that image.

34
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.790
It's all about observation.

35
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.390
So now I basically have all my shadows blocked in there.

36
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.880
The next step is to really start solidifying that and adding in more detail with my values.

37
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.520
And you'll notice that I'm leaving out these two light spots in the center of my apple and those are

38
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.420
reflections

39
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.080
and then add a dark line on the edge and this edge because that's what I see in the image.

40
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.390
You're always going to have a dark edge around your object but if that's what's in that image and that's

41
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.310
what you've got to do.

42
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.720
And then Mr. adding in my cast shadow

43
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.830
and again even with my cat shadow and stain pretty light just in case I ever need to come back and erase

44
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.130
and then you'll see how some of these edges are not all soft edges.

45
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.880
Some of them are really hard edges.

46
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.690
Then I'm to start adding in some of those lines that I see on the apple

47
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.200
and again just looking back at my image finding the information I need and then taking that information

48
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.090
and applying it to my own drawing.

49
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.020
So it's one little bit at a time.

50
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.400
So this has nothing to do with processing what is actually going on in the image.

51
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.020
It all has to do with just copying it.

52
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.630
Just looking at the image and copying it to your best to the best of your ability.

53
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.240
So you're just trying to copy the shape and then you're trying to copy the value and nothing else you're

54
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.550
not trying to understand how the reflections are working.

55
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.860
And you're not trying to understand light and shadow.

56
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.760
You're just trying to copy exactly what you see.

57
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.690
The more you do this the more you're going to understand how real life works.

58
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.440
It's just like anything else you practice the more you practice the better you'll get at it and things

59
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.040
will just start coming naturally and become instinctual.

60
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.720
Then I start darkening this area

61
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.930
and then you'll see down here at the bottom of the Apple we're kind of getting that bounce actually.

62
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.380
And I don't want you to dissect this too much like I said but I just wanted to point that out that there

63
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:52.260
is a bounce light on the bottom of this apple.

64
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.430
Some of the stuff you see on this Apple might not make sense.

65
00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.550
It might be something that we haven't even gone over yet such as reflections but that's ok.

66
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.120
Like I said the point of this is not to understand what's going on.

67
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.430
It's to copy exactly what you see

68
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.480
and to go out and fill in my stem which I'm pretty sure is my Darcus value.

69
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.700
As well as this whole right here that the stem is going into

70
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.860
so as I'm drawing this I want you to think what's my focal point.

71
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.870
The focal point is where the eye is drawn to first.

72
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.960
And so in this drawing most likely it's going to be the stem because that's where the most contrast

73
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.920
is happening.

74
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.720
It's the darkest part of the apple.

75
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.920
On top of the lightest part which is the highlight on top of the apple

76
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.800
then I'm just going to start adding in some more cast shadow underneath here.

77
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.880
And I just keep working it over and over again layer after layer until I get it looking the way it looks

78
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.340
in the image.

79
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.600
Now I'm going to start adding that table line in there.

80
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.720
And then I'll start adding in the background.

81
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.380
The background is also very important in this drawing and you want to make sure you get it in there

82
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:19.760
because the background is going to add some contrast between the apple itself and the background.

83
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.280
So up here where the Apple gets really white unless we add a darker gray background you're not going

84
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.430
to really see a difference between the apple and the background but by adding in this darker gray background

85
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.460
all of a sudden the Apple stands out a lot more.

86
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.550
And this is contrast.

87
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.710
We'll go over this in the next lecture.

88
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.340
And again I'm trying not to make up my own ideas of what the drawing looks like.

89
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.790
I'm trying to actually look at the image and put down on paper exactly what I see in the image or as

90
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.750
close as possible.

91
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.790
So in some areas the background is a lot lighter and in some areas it's a lot darker.

92
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.790
So I'm trying to show that in my drawing.

93
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.230
Now I'm just going back over it and adding some finishing touches just to make sure it all looks good.

94
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.560
I'm double checking my image over and over again making sure that every area looks like the same in

95
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.650
the image as it does in my drawing.

96
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.230
Then I'm just going to quickly add a little frame around that just to make it look neater.

97
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.340
Then one last double check.

98
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.010
And I think I need to darken this reflection area a little bit more as well as this background.

99
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:22.800
I need to pull it all together with one more layer of dark gray and I need to smooth this cash out to

100
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.300
add a little bit more so it's not such a hard edge.

101
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.870
And I think that looks pretty good.

102
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.340
All right.

103
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.050
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

104
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:38.800
So in this lecture we took our black and white image of an apple and we copied it for its exact values.

105
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.850
We didn't try to necessarily understand it.

106
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.450
We just tried to copy the values and the shape exactly as we saw it.

107
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.610
This is called a true life study.

108
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.160
And they're very important.

109
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:56.050
So your assignment for this lecture is to first draw this apple image that I've just done after you've

110
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.870
done that.

111
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.410
I want you to actually find a real life image.

112
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.090
It can even be another apple but I want you to have a real apple in front of you or anything else it

113
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.720
can be an egg a banana anything you want.

114
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:12.060
And then I want you to shine a lamp on it and then I want you to try to draw that from real life.

115
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.460
And I want you to try to copy the values and the shape of the object as best as possible.

116
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.940
So I really think you guys are going to enjoy this assignment and I look forward to seeing you in the

117
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.180
next lecture.
