00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.910
Alright in this lecture we're going to go ahead and add in over detail and volumes toward drawing.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.820
So just like we looked at each individual grid square and copied what was in that square in a photograph

3
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.150
we're going to do the same thing but with our values.

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.890
So let's start with the Anga.

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.950
So if we look at the I will notice that there's a little bit of a white spot or highlight within this

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.100
black part of the eyes so let's go ahead and fill that in.

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.590
But we want to make sure that we leave that little highlight out some laying down a piece of paper so

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.210
I don't smudge any of this.

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.240
I'll go ahead and start to fill it in.

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.250
So first I'm going to kind of draw out the shape of that highlighted area so I make sure I don't draw

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.750
in there or add any dark values.

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.960
Like so and then it's not necessarily one big large white area like this.

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.550
So now I can go at it go in there and kind of add some darker values in there and make it look more

14
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.610
like it does in the photograph.

15
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.140
Perfect.

16
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.420
Now we can go ahead and move on to the next part of the ice so there's like a white ring that goes around

17
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.860
the pupil of the eye.

18
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.270
So we want to include that.

19
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.190
So what we're going to do is we're going to draw a Durka ring around the pupil of the eye.

20
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.910
But we're going to leave out a little whitespace around the edge of that.

21
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.240
And then as we come over to this area the reflection continues over this so we want to make sure we

22
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.540
leave out a small area right there that we can use for reflection.

23
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.640
Go ahead and work a little bit more on that reflection.

24
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.880
So it looks more similar to what we have in our photograph.

25
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.540
And I'm also noticing on these edges of the white ring it's a little bit darker and it's lighter on

26
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.270
the top and the bottom something that I had and in some dark valleys on both sides her white cream don't

27
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.600
go ahead and move on to the orange part of the.

28
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.680
So the worst part of the eye is going to be a lighter value.

29
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.940
But it's still going to be dirtier than white.

30
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.610
So let's go ahead and begin to fill that in with the mid-tone value and really the top part a little

31
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.300
bit lighter in the bottom a little bit darker than I'm going to go ahead and start adding in some darker

32
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.330
detail around the edge of that part of the.

33
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.190
Great then I'm noticing that right here it's a little bit darker and then transitions into this lighter

34
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.620
color because there's kind of the reflection appear on the top of the eye and then down here it's a

35
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.270
little bit darker.

36
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.500
Also right around there.

37
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.700
So go ahead and Durkan that area in perfect.

38
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.830
Next we're going to go out and start working on the eyelid part.

39
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:45.030
So the bird kind of has a strange sort of eyelid where it has looping sort of design on top of it like

40
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.040
so kind of like lace almost.

41
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.320
And then it's got a darker edge right above the

42
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.740
and it goes all the way around the ice.

43
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.430
Some more of that sort of Lacy texture.

44
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.830
They're done here in the bottom.

45
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.850
It's the same.

46
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.220
So first we want to make the edge of Eilidh.

47
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.830
So go ahead and Adham sort of looping texture like so

48
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.410
let's go ahead and add some value in there.

49
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.860
Then I'm going to go ahead and add in some of this feather texture so we have sort of a dark edge race

50
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.930
here.

51
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.000
You know here it's a really thin dark edge but so a little bit of a dark edge that turns into some darker

52
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.110
feathers.

53
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.160
Then underneath here we also some dirt patches on our feathers.

54
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.270
Those kind of turn into their own feathers.

55
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.160
I'm just trying to copy exactly what I see in the square.

56
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.390
So it's very much like drawn from life.

57
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.610
So if you're only drawing one grid space at a time.

58
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.350
Right great.

59
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.780
So now we just created that one square.

60
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.070
So basically you just want to do this with every single square until you finished the entire drawing.

61
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.130
And I think once you do this you'll be really impressed with how good of a drawing you can draw by using

62
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.370
this technique.

63
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.530
I'm going to go ahead and speed up this process but I want you to see how I do it.

64
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.040
So let's go ahead and get started.

65
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.710
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

66
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.540
So in this lecture we learn how to add the value into our grid drawing.

67
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.700
Now once you've completed your drawing you're free to go ahead and erase away your grid guidelines.

68
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.050
Now I recommend that you erase these at the end and not at the beginning because you want to use them

69
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.800
throughout the entire drawing to make sure that you're transferring the image correctly on to your paper.

70
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.980
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
