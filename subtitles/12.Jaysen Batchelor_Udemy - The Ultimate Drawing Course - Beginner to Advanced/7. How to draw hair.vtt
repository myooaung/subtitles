00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.530
All right in this lecture we're going to learn how to draw here.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.540
So we're going to do two examples were first to do an example on a male and then an example on a female.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.870
Now now the first thing to understand about drawing hair is that you're drawing a form.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.650
So just like anything else you're drawing the shape and adding highlights and shadows through it.

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.040
You're not drawing individual lines that are strands of hair.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.320
If you think about it that way it's just going to look like you have lines and sticks sticking off of

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.690
your character's head.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.440
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.500
We're going to start with our male character.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.750
Now I'm looking at some reference right now and I recommend that when you add hair to your characters

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.930
or your portrait or drawings that you have referenced Also you can go back and compare it and try to

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.900
understand what's going on with the hair.

13
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.470
So the first thing I like to do and I'm drawing my hair is how I like to establish my hairline and the

14
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.530
hairline is just the line between the skin and hair.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.400
So go ahead and start to sketch that in.

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.350
So first we get the sideburns right here.

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.190
And then it that cuts and curves in just a little bit like so and then it comes back up.

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.500
Same with the other sides of the curves in just a little bit.

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.850
And then comes back up and then we have a widow's peak on this hairline.

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.330
So first it comes up like so.

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.000
And then it comes back down just a little bit like so.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
So that's her basic hairline for male character.

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.410
Next we want to go ahead and start adding in the shape of our hair.

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.950
So the hair up here is basically slipped back into almost a big sort of a bump or poof and it comes

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410
off the head quite a bit.

26
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.730
That's the thing that people make a lot of mistakes with them they're drawn here.

27
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.670
They draw the hair right up to the skull or the shape of the head.

28
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.110
And really your hair usually comes off quite a bit maybe not as much but it still comes off quite a

29
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.040
bit.

30
00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.560
Now we're going to go ahead and add and this part over here in scene with this.

31
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.590
So now we have the basic shape of our hair.

32
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.130
Now we can go ahead and we're adding in some more details so I want to start by raising what my head

33
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.810
guideline

34
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.190
is and then we're going to go ahead and start adding in the detail of where that hair is so we're not

35
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.860
drawn to individual hair strands but we are drawing some lines to indicate in which direction the hair

36
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.820
is going.

37
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.770
So I'm going to start sketching those in

38
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.020
and go ahead and start sketching out an over here.

39
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.480
Also and again look at your reference and study it and try to understand where the hair is going and

40
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.910
where it's coming from.

41
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.920
Sometimes you have pieces that are going off in the opposite direction or it might curve around a little

42
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.030
bit.

43
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.280
So make sure you add those in that'll make your hair look a lot more realistic.

44
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.810
You know over here we have a part and it starts to go in the other direction.

45
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.550
Sounds going in that direction rather than going in this direction.

46
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.340
Go ahead and add in the sideburn.

47
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.390
Go ahead and move on to the other side.

48
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.930
So on this side it's actually pretty short looking.

49
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.490
And then this hair comes off the head like so and then we can go ahead and start adding in the hair

50
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.120
over here so the hair on top is much longer than the hair on the bottom.

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.380
The shorter the hair the closer it will be to the actual shape of the head.

52
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.930
But in this case the hair is really long and so it comes off the head quite a bit.

53
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.720
Now we can go ahead and drop it in just a little bit Durkan some of these areas to make our hair stand

54
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.960
out.

55
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.140
Perfect.

56
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.360
Now like I said you have to think of hair as a form and not just individual strings.

57
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.610
So we're not going to go into great detail yet on how to add texture to this hair but we will go ahead

58
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.400
and add in some shading that will then later be able to add in some texture.

59
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.550
So down here we're going to get a lot dirtier of a value because it's on the bottom side of our hair

60
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.830
not on the top side.

61
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.150
We're going get a highlight right across through this area.

62
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.200
And this is coming from my reference.

63
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.380
I'm not making this up.

64
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.630
I'm looking at my reference and understanding where the highlights are.

65
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.110
So I want to go ahead and fill in this area.

66
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.650
So some folks here will go ahead and fill this in or here.

67
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.500
And now we have some form in our hair.

68
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.610
So now we have that form in our hair.

69
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.940
Now you'll see later how we use this forum to create realistic hair texture.

70
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.570
All right.

71
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.700
So now we understand how to make form and shape with our hair.

72
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.790
Let's go ahead and move on to the female head.

73
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.420
So the female head is going to have longer hair.

74
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.830
So let's start off by adding in the part in the hair.

75
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.790
So the part in the hair is going happen right about here on that line right there.

76
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.570
Now it can go ahead and add in the hair.

77
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.380
So the hair line is going to come down and around like so now the hairline on this hair doesn't matter

78
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.200
too much because you're not going to see very much of it.

79
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.100
But we do want to get the hair line up here in this top area in the side area.

80
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.080
Now this hairstyle is actually going to hang over half the face.

81
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.250
So let's go ahead and sort of sketch it.

82
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:58.430
So the hair swoops up off of this partly so and then it comes down and it wiggles across the face or

83
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.130
it waves across the face I guess you could say.

84
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.370
And then we get down here are some more hair.

85
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.100
And so now we just want to go out and start blocking all of it.

86
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.320
Let's try to get the country in line down first before we move on.

87
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.110
But like I said it's all about creating a form and a shape for your hair.

88
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.730
It's not about the individual strands.

89
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.020
It's about the overall shape that it makes in the flow of the.

90
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.640
Sure to keep looking at your reference and using it for the information that you need all the information

91
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.350
you need is right there in your reference to just look at it and then draw what you see.

92
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.970
The more hair you draw the better you're going to get at drawing hair and you're also going to start

93
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.660
building up a visual library of different hairstyles so you can see here her hairs come in off the shape

94
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.300
of her head quite a bit.

95
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.730
It's going to add in more hair.

96
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.350
All right.

97
00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:00.000
Now that we have the basic lines and shapes in there let's go ahead and start Darkman this in and adding

98
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.260
more detail.

99
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.000
Now when you're drawn long hair like this you need to think of it in sections and the sections are most

100
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.050
of the time broken up into separate locks of hair.

101
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.410
So let's go ahead and get started.

102
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.590
So first I'm the sort Durkan in this area and my contouring line.

103
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.200
But then when I get to lines like this where the hair is coming in front of another piece of hair we

104
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:28.140
need to make sure that we draw that over the top of the other one so he can go ahead and continue making

105
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.140
sure that we're paying attention to which locks of hair are coming over.

106
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.160
The other piece of hair

107
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.350
so we have one big wad of Harry here.

108
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.290
Let me go ahead and start recently with a drawing of my head in my ear.

109
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.000
We don't need that any longer.

110
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.490
Same with this do you see a little bit of that right there.

111
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.760
Similarly that there is.

112
00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:14.670
Go ahead and continue to draw.

113
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.450
All right.

114
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:16.010
Great.

115
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.720
Now let's go ahead and move on to the other side.

116
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.330
So this lock of hair comes off like so.

117
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.980
Curls over and then swoops down like this

118
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.910
then going to come up here and at a little bit more detail so you can see some more of these strands

119
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.550
of hair that are swooping around and turning into this sort of bump right there.

120
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:16.770
All right great.

121
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.520
Now we can go ahead and start adding in some vowels.

122
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.790
So first off right underneath here we're going to get a dark shadow like so and then we're going to

123
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.890
go ahead and add in some more dark shadows so between each piece of a lock of hair we're going to add

124
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.760
in some shadow on some shadow back here.

125
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.440
But we just want to think of each lock of hair like a sheep and a three dimensional form and then we

126
00:10:41.440 --> 00:11:51.700
need to sheeted in as it calls for.

127
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.210
All right.

128
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.850
Perfect.

129
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:59.440
So now we've added some three dimensional form to our hair by adding in some highlights and shadows.

130
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.990
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to teach you how to add actual realistic hair texture to your

131
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.120
hair drawings now hair texture is very shiny.

132
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:15.430
So it's kind of like a reflective type of texture but it's still very different from doing say a reflective

133
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.450
sphere.

134
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.710
So let's go ahead and get started.

135
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:25.360
So right you are you can see I have a circle and two rectangles drawn.

136
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.710
We're going to use these to practice a drawing our hair texture.

137
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.810
So first we're going to start with art.

138
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.370
Rectangles are going to start with this one right here.

139
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.470
When you're drawing hair you basically want just really quick lines that sort of fat and dark and then

140
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:44.380
get thinner so if you push a little hard with her pencil and then we go like that and slowly let up

141
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:44.960
off of it.

142
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.430
You'll see that and becomes more thin and also lighter.

143
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.150
So let's go out and do another one and they can be pretty long too.

144
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.580
Like so.

145
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:59.550
And what we want to do is we want to add a whole bunch of these to this side.

146
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.550
Another thing we can do is we can go ahead and shade this area in and as we get to the middle we want

147
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:10.650
to lighten that up can make it a little bit further down to this end.

148
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.860
And this is representing our volumes.

149
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:28.190
So once we have our values in there and we can also add those down here at the bottom.

150
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.130
So now that we have her values in there we can go ahead and continue to add these long strands of hair

151
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.460
just like so.

152
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:48.030
And so we're not necessarily drawing every individual strand of hair of what we're doing is we're drawing

153
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.680
the space in between hairs.

154
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.280
That's what these dark lines are the light areas are the actual strands of hair that have some reflection

155
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.530
on.

156
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.610
And as the hair strands curve around into this darker area they all become darker.

157
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:12.340
But up here in this area these lighter areas those are actually strands of hair.

158
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:20.060
And the closer to the side you get the darker you want it to be.

159
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.500
Now it's probably good for now let's go ahead and move on to this bottom.

160
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.610
So we're going to go ahead and draw the same type of lines across.

161
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.190
So

162
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:07.800
we can have some lines that come all the way across.

163
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.410
Great.

164
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.610
Now the reason why we're doing this is we're practicing creating hair texture in a very simple form.

165
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.160
So now we practice it going vertically.

166
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.920
We want to practice doing it horizontally so let's go ahead and practice that down here.

167
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.960
So just do the same exact thing.

168
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:31.080
We can go ahead and add in our value right there and go ahead and do the same thing on the side.

169
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.680
Now we can go ahead and draw in those strands of hair.

170
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.490
So just straight lines are pushed really hard.

171
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.430
And then lot of to get that nice thin and light one

172
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.320
US.

173
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.570
Now let's go ahead and practice doing this.

174
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.520
But in a circular motion.

175
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.210
Go ahead and bring my paper over so I don't smudge what I've already done.

176
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.260
And it's just going to be the same exact way this time.

177
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:36.090
We need to go ahead and make these curved lines so we're going to go ahead and press and then come around

178
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.850
like so in this case I'm not going to add in my values.

179
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.840
It's not 100 percent important.

180
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.180
It's more important that you add in your values to create the form of the shape of your hair.

181
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:51.200
But in this case we don't really have any form here so we're just going to go ahead and start practicing

182
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.570
drawing lines like so and we'll go ahead and get it from this side.

183
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.620
Try having these lines curved right into each other as best as possible.

184
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.070
And you may have to make these ones a little bit shorter see that you leave a white space in the middle

185
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.420
and you want that light space because that white space is your highlight on your hair

186
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:49.220
and as you get closer to the edges you're going to really Durkan those and not some short dark fat lines.

187
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.350
So you can add a couple of dark ones that go all the way across.

188
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.960
All right.

189
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.860
Great.

190
00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.710
So go ahead and practice this all the way around your circle until you really get the hang of it.

191
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:00.740
All right.

192
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.300
Great.

193
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:07.770
So now that we've done these exercises we can go ahead and actually apply this to some hair form.

194
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.820
So I'm going to go ahead and draw a lock of hair right through my paper.

195
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.030
So basically what we're going to draw is we're going to draw a sort of a squiggly type of form.

196
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.230
So it's going to come over like this not a squiggle back over like so.

197
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:40.940
And we want to draw this pretty lightly too because this is just the outline of our hair.

198
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.770
Perfect.

199
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.230
Now I'm going to go ahead and erase away some of this area that I don't want anymore.

200
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.350
Send out what we can do is we can go ahead and start adding in our thousands.

201
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.960
So basically we're going to have a highlight right here and a highlight right here and a little bit

202
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.460
of a highlight down here.

203
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.260
So what we want to do is we want to Durkan in all the areas that don't include our highlights

204
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.370
so we highlight there so we'll leave that out.

205
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.710
Can Durkan this top area like so.

206
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.440
And then this shadow was going to come all the way down like this.

207
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.390
You can Durcan the tip of our hair.

208
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.380
We can go out and Durkan that even just a little bit further.

209
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.470
In this area up here to

210
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.370
and then we want to go ahead and Durkan this edge of a lock of hair because the light is not really

211
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.500
going to be hitting it.

212
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.270
All right.

213
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:52.900
Great.

214
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:59.210
So next we want to do is we want to go ahead and start adding in our lines like we did over here.

215
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.190
So we're in a store up here and we want to do is we want to follow this curve so we're going to start

216
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.270
there push hard and slowly let it come off so.

217
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.540
And the quicker you can do it the better because the smoother your lines are going to be if you go really

218
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.690
slow and it gets all wiggly and it's just not going to look good.

219
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:21.640
So you want to make sure that you go quick push hard and flick it off but try to go that curve as much

220
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.960
as possible.

221
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.660
Now I want to go ahead and move on to the bottom part down here.

222
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.160
So will do just like we did with this rounded area of a circle.

223
00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:58.540
We'll start right there in the middle of where our derk line should be.

224
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.960
We want to curve those in and then back up

225
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.950
and they're going to do the same thing down here like we did over here on over and come down.

226
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.550
So we're just going to continue to do that.

227
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.790
We get the lines looking the way we want.

228
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.770
And this is bad right there.

229
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.260
We want to make sure that that's curvy.

230
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:28.720
I'm going to go ahead and embrace that make sure that the curves back up into this curve right there

231
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:07.770
go ahead insert Durkan in some areas like this and that way we can start to break this up into separate

232
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:14.470
pieces of hair or locks of hair.

233
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.950
Will come down here and start doing the same thing.

234
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.530
So this line is going to curve into our highlight and then we can also add in some darker lines over

235
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:49.240
here.

236
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.270
Great.

237
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:54.020
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going go ahead and switch over to a different pencil.

238
00:23:54.020 --> 00:24:00.740
So right now I'm using a 3-D beat pencil but I'm going to switch over to what's called and eat the pencil.

239
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:07.110
If you're not familiar with this this basically just means that this pencil is darker than a three pencil.

240
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.440
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going go ahead and and even some Dogar values in here.

241
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:17.660
So I want to go ahead and stir at the top here and I'll go ahead and start adding in some darker lines

242
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.350
like so

243
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.570
you know I'm down here in this area

244
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:40.500
and we can also add some darker value into these sort of cracks in the hair or crevices

245
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.940
where we can come all the way down here.

246
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.690
Same thing.

247
00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.150
And you can also have some hairs that are sort of strain off the lock of the hair that that'll make

248
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.300
it look more realistic.

249
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.040
UW-Madison coming off in the opposite direction we're here.

250
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.680
So all right grinned.

251
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.580
So now we have a pretty realistic looking wavy lock of hair.

252
00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.330
So basically if you take this technique and apply it to any form that you do for the hair such as these

253
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.670
forms that we drew for this male and this female Well then you can create some very realistic looking

254
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.430
hair.

255
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.830
All right that brings us to the end of this election.

256
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.020
So in this lecture you learn how to draw form for a male and a female when it comes to drawing their

257
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.720
hair.

258
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.810
And remember that it's all about the form.

259
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.470
And once you get the form down then you can go ahead and actually add in the strains of hair.

260
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:59.570
Which brings us to the second part of this tour trio was how to add in the strands of hair and make

261
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.510
it look realistic without drawing a ton of lines that just look like black lines.

262
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.800
You want to actually keep that highlight in there.

263
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.700
And that's what's going to create that realism isn't in your hair.

264
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:15.950
Your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw this diagram right here with the circle and

265
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.180
the two rectangles.

266
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.490
In practice doing this hair texture.

267
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.960
Once you've done that I want you to go ahead and try drawing a lock of hair.

268
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.810
And then once you've done that I want you to go ahead and draw the form for some type of a hairstyle

269
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.890
and it can be for a girl or it can be for a guy.

270
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.360
But then I want you to apply your hair texture that you learned to their hairstyle and see how real

271
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.620
you can get it to look.

272
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.120
Make sure you look at reference when you do this and it look much better.

273
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.490
Thanks for watching and I really look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
