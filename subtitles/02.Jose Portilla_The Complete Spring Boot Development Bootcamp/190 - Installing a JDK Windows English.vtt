A JDK short for Java Development Kit JDC.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.270
And so the name implies that it's something we need to develop Java applications.

00:12.820 --> 00:15.190
Now there are two things you need to run Java code.

00:15.220 --> 00:22.270
You need a Java compiler to compile your code and a Java runtime to run the compiled code.

00:24.650 --> 00:29.570
And that's why a JDC provides a compiler, a runtime and a lot of other things.

00:31.420 --> 00:35.740
So in this video, we're going to install a JDC from something called Amazon Coretta.

00:38.630 --> 00:39.080
All right.

00:39.080 --> 00:45.830
Amazon credit is just a distribution which once installed does the work of setting up a JDK in your

00:45.830 --> 00:46.550
computer.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.810
Basically, all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.370
So to start in this lesson, I need you to click the link in the resources.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.910
I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and do that.

01:05.270 --> 01:07.920
The link should take you to the Amazon Credo page.

01:07.970 --> 01:11.990
We're going to scroll down to the Windows platform and choose the first installer.

01:14.870 --> 01:17.930
You can go ahead and pause the video until you're finished downloading it.

01:24.130 --> 01:28.960
Once you download your installer, go ahead and open it, then go through every step in the installation

01:28.960 --> 01:31.970
wizard and it should take a few seconds to install.

01:31.990 --> 01:33.850
Just keep going through all the steps.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.550
And that's all.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.040
Now you have a JDK installed in your computer.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.910
Now to make sure we install the JDK, we can check for it.

01:55.910 --> 02:01.220
Namely, we're going to check for a Java compiler and a Java runtime since we know that's what a JDK

02:01.220 --> 02:02.180
is composed of.

02:04.230 --> 02:07.260
We're going to check for a JDK by looking for the command prompt.

02:12.190 --> 02:15.010
And the first thing we're going to check for is a compiler.

02:15.310 --> 02:20.290
So we're going to write Java C, which stands for Java compiler version.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.740
Then we're going to press enter.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.550
If a version shows up, that means you have a Java compiler.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.880
And this shows me I have a Java compiler, version 11.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.050
So now I'm going to write Java version two, check for a job by runtime.

02:36.620 --> 02:42.950
And once again a version shows up for me, which means I have a working java runtime courtesy of Open

02:42.950 --> 02:44.660
JD.com is on Curto.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.790
If for whatever reason you're getting a command not found message, just try to restart your computer

02:49.790 --> 02:51.020
and you should be fine.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.060
And so in this lesson you installed a JDK.

02:55.090 --> 02:58.120
Now your computer can compile and run code.
