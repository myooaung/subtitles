Welcome to Workbook 1.2.

00:02.460 --> 00:05.370
In this workbook, you're going to create a simple web application.

00:05.370 --> 00:09.810
You'll install the dependency that's needed to spin up an HTTP server.

00:09.810 --> 00:16.170
And when a client makes a request on local host 9990, your server is going to send back a response

00:16.170 --> 00:18.420
in the form of an HTML web page.

00:18.450 --> 00:22.500
Not sure I agree with Ryan that Java is better than Python, but we'll see how it goes.
