00:00.480 --> 00:04.680
Spring Boot is the best Java framework for developing web applications.

00:04.920 --> 00:08.130
In this video, you're going to create a spring boot project.

00:11.730 --> 00:17.610
You actually need to extensions to develop a Springwood application, the extension pack for Java as

00:17.610 --> 00:19.860
well as the spring boot extension pack.

00:23.700 --> 00:30.360
So go back to the Visual Studio Code marketplace and then look for the spring boot extension pack.

00:36.590 --> 00:37.490
There you have it.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.630
Now I've already installed it, so I'll give you a couple of seconds to do the same.

00:50.020 --> 00:50.440
Okay.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.270
Once you install it, I want you to close the code and reopen it.

01:03.020 --> 01:03.380
All right.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.630
So let's talk about the spring initial riser.

01:05.660 --> 01:09.440
The spring initial riser generates a spring boot project.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.240
The spring boot extension pack includes the spring initial riser.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.900
So from VW's code.

01:16.930 --> 01:23.890
Open the command palette using control shift P for using windows and command shift P for Mac.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.110
And then click on the spring initial riser.

01:36.530 --> 01:42.290
And as of this recording, the most recent stable version of Spring Boot is 2.6.7.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.100
The versions will be different depending on when you're watching this video.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.870
So just choose a stable version.

01:48.890 --> 01:52.460
In other words, choose one that doesn't precede parentheses.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.730
Obviously you will use the Java programming language.

02:01.180 --> 02:06.220
And the group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

02:08.990 --> 02:12.500
Your group ID should be a fully qualified domain name.

02:12.740 --> 02:19.610
It should include a domain extension like dot com, dot org dot net, followed by the name of the organization.

02:22.670 --> 02:28.520
So for this tutorial I'm going to create a group ID of com dot http further in the part.

02:28.790 --> 02:33.110
Now one thing I want to also mention is that the group ID should always be lowercase.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.440
The artifact ID determines the name of your application.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.140
I'm going to call the application.

02:42.140 --> 02:43.130
Hello, Spring.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.440
Collect the group ID.

02:45.470 --> 02:48.110
The artifact ID must be lowercase as well.

02:48.110 --> 02:51.470
And every word that follows must be separated by a hyphen.

02:54.330 --> 02:57.660
We will stick with the default jar packaging type.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.200
We're going to discuss packaging in more detail in an upcoming workbook.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.590
Choose a Java version that matches the one you have installed.

03:06.610 --> 03:10.270
I'm using Java 11, so I'll choose a Java version of 11.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.950
Dependency is software that your application depends on.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.100
We will discuss dependencies in more detail soon enough.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.340
You don't need any dependencies right now.

03:24.530 --> 03:28.360
And now you can generate your project inside the folder of your choice.

03:28.370 --> 03:31.430
I'm going to generate it inside of my desktop directory.

03:35.460 --> 03:36.030
Okay.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.800
Go ahead and press open.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.570
And it opens the project that you generated.

03:45.030 --> 03:52.380
To recap, you created a spring boot project using the spring initial user recall that group ID identifies

03:52.380 --> 03:54.630
the organization creating the project.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.590
It should be a fully qualified domain name that's completely lowercase.

03:58.770 --> 04:04.350
Artifact ID is the name of your application and every word that follows is joined by a hyphen.

04:04.830 --> 04:11.130
Choose Jar as the file type to package your application, and a dependency is software that your application

04:11.130 --> 04:12.060
depends on.
