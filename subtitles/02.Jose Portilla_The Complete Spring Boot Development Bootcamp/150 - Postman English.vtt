Postmen is a very popular tool that we can make requests from, go to post msn.com downloads and they're

00:09.990 --> 00:12.150
just go ahead and download postman.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.770
Not really much else to say.

00:20.040 --> 00:25.050
Start off by clicking on home and we're going to make a get request from Postman.

00:25.110 --> 00:29.550
Now, depending on when you're watching this video, the UI might change.

00:29.550 --> 00:32.760
So if it does, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.

00:32.790 --> 00:35.770
I trust that you'll find a way to make a get request.

00:35.790 --> 00:36.990
It shouldn't be that hard.

00:36.990 --> 00:41.070
So I'm going to go and create a new HTTP request.

00:41.700 --> 00:47.640
I'm going to make a get request such that the URI will locate a resource with the following ID.

00:47.640 --> 00:54.120
So we'll say local host add 80 slash contact.

00:55.070 --> 00:57.890
Is or has an idea of 1 to 3.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.060
If I send the sketch request.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.440
Beautiful.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.410
The rest API sends back that resource with a status of 200 OC.

01:11.710 --> 01:20.480
The beautiful thing about Postman is that it supports get put post and delete requests.

01:20.500 --> 01:26.950
So you may have been thinking, oh man, we might need to develop a front end in order to test our API.

01:26.980 --> 01:32.620
There is no need for that because we can just use Postman as a back end developer.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.050
Postmen can be very, very useful.
