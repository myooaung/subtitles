00:01.090 --> 00:04.870
In this section, you will build an application that lets the user submit a grade.

00:04.870 --> 00:06.880
I will submit a grade for Harry.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.460
We'll give him a C minus in potions.

00:13.060 --> 00:18.190
And you can also update an existing grade so we can upgrade that C-minus to a B minus.

00:22.630 --> 00:23.320
All right.

00:23.320 --> 00:29.440
And you will write all of your code around the model of controller design, where model stores the data

00:29.680 --> 00:35.650
view represents the visual elements of a web page and controller ties everything together.

00:41.740 --> 00:42.700
Throughout this section.

00:42.700 --> 00:46.330
And for the remainder of this course I'm going to be using VS code.

00:46.330 --> 00:52.210
But not to worry if there's anything in V's code that would need to be done differently in IntelliJ,

00:52.240 --> 00:57.370
then there's going to be two separate lessons one for Path A and one for Path B.
