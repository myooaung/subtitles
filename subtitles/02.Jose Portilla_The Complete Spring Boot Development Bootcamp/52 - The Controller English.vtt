00:00.330 --> 00:03.930
The controller makes up one component of the MVC architecture.

00:06.130 --> 00:10.840
The controller responds to web requests by managing the model and presenting the view.

00:14.110 --> 00:17.200
In this lesson, you will create a controller inside Spring Boot.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.610
Spring Boot uses annotations to create magic.

00:28.870 --> 00:31.640
Annotations create the sensation of magic.

00:31.660 --> 00:35.890
They add logic to an application without you having to add any code.

00:37.940 --> 00:42.200
So in the model of the controller section, you will encounter these for annotations.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.790
Controller get mapping, post mapping and request parameters.

00:45.890 --> 00:49.790
Each annotation magically adds functionality to your Spring Boot app.

00:52.430 --> 00:56.810
This annotation converts a class into a controller, as the name suggests.

00:58.740 --> 01:05.580
So when you annotate a class with ADD controller, it becomes the entry point for all web requests.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.260
In turn, the controller class contains handler methods.

01:12.290 --> 01:14.960
A handler method can respond to a web request.

01:17.980 --> 01:18.520
All right.

01:18.520 --> 01:25.390
First thing we're going to do is inside the grade submission folder, create a new file called Grade

01:25.690 --> 01:27.940
Controller Java.

01:30.210 --> 01:34.620
And what we're going to do is annotate the class with ADD controller.

01:36.410 --> 01:41.360
If you don't annotate the class with controller, spring boot will not see this class and nothing inside

01:41.360 --> 01:42.200
is going to run.

01:47.850 --> 01:53.280
Now recall the controller is the entry point for all web requests, and one type of request that it

01:53.280 --> 01:55.050
can handle is get requests.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.070
A get request is when the user is requesting a resource.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.060
In other words, a get request is when the user wants to get a resource from our Spring Boot app.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.560
The user can make a request from the browser.

02:14.710 --> 02:18.040
The URL that they type must specify the host.

02:18.830 --> 02:19.700
The port.

02:21.150 --> 02:21.990
And the path.

02:24.710 --> 02:29.000
So in the last section, you were actually making get requests the entire time.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.970
The Host and port will send the request to the Spring Boot app.

02:37.130 --> 02:41.000
Once their request reaches the app, the controller is its entry point.

02:42.440 --> 02:47.180
The controller uses the path portion of a request to decide which handler method to run.

02:47.450 --> 02:50.830
The handler method responds by returning a resource.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.150
In this case, it's some type of HTML.

02:57.440 --> 02:57.770
All right.

02:57.770 --> 02:59.810
The next annotation is get mapping.

02:59.810 --> 03:04.550
This annotation magically converts a method into a handler method.

03:04.820 --> 03:07.970
The handler method can respond to get requests.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.200
When you annotate a method with get mapping, it can respond to a get request.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.930
The get mapping annotation receives one argument a path.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.140
This method can respond to get requests made on the path.

03:26.160 --> 03:26.820
Hello.

03:28.100 --> 03:34.930
So inside grade controller java create a method called say hello that returns a string.

03:34.940 --> 03:37.700
Public string say hello.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.080
And the string is going to return is some HTML view.

03:46.510 --> 03:47.590
For the time being.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.100
And now we'll give the method the get mapping annotation.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.930
Wait for autocomplete to show, get mapping, click on it.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.140
And you can see that at auto imports.

04:01.560 --> 04:06.180
And now we want to make sure that this method responds to get requests made on the path.

04:06.690 --> 04:07.350
Hello.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.840
You can go ahead and run your spring boot application.

04:15.170 --> 04:20.750
And then from your browser make a request to local host 8080 slash.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.290
Hello.

04:23.140 --> 04:25.420
And we get an error code.

04:26.110 --> 04:29.200
The user makes a request on the path slash.

04:29.200 --> 04:29.910
Hello.

04:29.950 --> 04:34.180
The controller maps the request to a handler method that matches the path.

04:34.420 --> 04:39.250
The handler method tries responding with a view called some HTML view.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.210
What it does is it actually looks inside the templates folder.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.810
It can't find anything, so it returns an error code.

04:50.350 --> 04:53.650
The controller is the entry point for all web requests.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.970
Once the request reaches the app, the controller is its entry point.

05:01.260 --> 05:06.090
The controller uses the path portion of a request to decide which handler method to run.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.460
The Handler method is the one that responds to the get request.
