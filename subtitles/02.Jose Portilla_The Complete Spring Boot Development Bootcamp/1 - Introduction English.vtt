WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:05.700
Before we start to building robust Web APIs with Spring Boot, you need to learn the spring boot fundamentals,

00:05.700 --> 00:07.680
and that is what module one is for.

00:09.100 --> 00:14.290
As we go through this module, the three most important concepts that I want you to focus on are validation

00:14.290 --> 00:18.070
three layer code base, as well as beans and dependency injection.

00:18.100 --> 00:24.430
These topics will extend into module two, where we then shift our focus towards back end development.
