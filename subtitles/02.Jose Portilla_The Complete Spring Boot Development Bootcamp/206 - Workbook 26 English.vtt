00:00.690 --> 00:02.340
Welcome to Workbook 2.6.

00:02.340 --> 00:05.790
I already went ahead and launched the Starter Project.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.880
Task one is inside the Handler method.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.650
We need to add two pieces of data to our model.

00:12.660 --> 00:15.060
Let's go ahead and do just that.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.180
All right.

00:18.320 --> 00:24.320
And then here it's saying if the entry budget is greater than or equal to 5000, then blah blah blah

00:24.320 --> 00:24.950
blah blah.

00:25.070 --> 00:26.360
Otherwise display.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.990
Sorry, we don't have any cars below 5000.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.250
So let's start with the F and on less.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.770
We'll create one div, one empty container.

00:41.270 --> 00:48.170
And this dev is going to render if and only if we're going to grab the.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.740
We're going to grab the budget.

00:53.160 --> 01:00.270
If that budget is greater than or equal to 5000, then disruptive is going to render what's going to

01:00.270 --> 01:01.410
be inside this div.

01:01.410 --> 01:02.310
I have no idea.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.140
Let's just add another diff for now.

01:04.800 --> 01:11.010
And otherwise, if their budget is lower than 5000, let's just copy this.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.310
Then what do we want to tell them?

01:16.320 --> 01:20.190
We want to just say sorry we don't have any cars below 5000.

01:20.190 --> 01:23.160
So here we can just add a paragraph tag.

01:24.010 --> 01:29.380
That says, sorry, we don't have cars below 5000.

01:30.180 --> 01:30.720
Okay.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.110
So we're already done this part.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.500
Now let's finish up this part.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.170
If the budget is bigger than or equal to 5000, what do we do?

01:41.310 --> 01:49.050
Then compare the enter to make against five cases and the case match is going to be displayed.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.440
Hope this made you think of the switch expression.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.680
So here we can add another div.

01:56.460 --> 01:59.640
So if the budget is greater than 5000, this will render.

01:59.670 --> 02:07.680
Now we're here and this is going to determine which paragraph tag renders depending on which one has

02:07.680 --> 02:08.720
a case match.

02:08.730 --> 02:11.460
So we're going to grab the make.

02:13.430 --> 02:15.370
And we're going to compare it.

02:16.790 --> 02:19.970
We're going to compare it against five possible cases.

02:25.370 --> 02:26.090
First.

02:26.090 --> 02:31.370
This will render if the make equals Toyota.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.460
Which is the car that I drive.

02:38.180 --> 02:38.390
Okay.

02:38.390 --> 02:43.370
So the different possible cases are Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, Honda, and then default.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.710
So we'll say Toyota.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.610
Volkswagen.

02:49.750 --> 02:50.740
Ford.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.770
And Honda.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.080
And this was the default case if it doesn't match any of them.

02:59.280 --> 03:06.250
And then if it's at Toyota, I believe it said, to display a Toyota Corolla, $5,000.

03:09.470 --> 03:12.950
Otherwise, let's just copy them over.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.630
Volkswagen Jetta 6000.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.150
Ford Escape 7000.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.490
Honda Civic 8000.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.760
Otherwise, no cars match or query.

03:31.300 --> 03:37.180
So this was your first nested conditional and final leaf, and I hope it wasn't too hard.

03:37.780 --> 03:41.860
The trick was the first only focus on your F and on lessons.

03:41.860 --> 03:47.620
And then once that was out of the way, assume the F expression was the one that executed this diff

03:47.620 --> 03:48.250
would render.

03:48.250 --> 03:55.390
So your next focus would be to determine what render is inside of this container by comparing the make

03:55.390 --> 03:57.700
against five possible cases.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.140
All right.

03:59.150 --> 04:00.640
Think that's it?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.010
We should be ready to run our code.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.350
I'll spin up a new terminal.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.020
You're run the application.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.320
We'll say a local host, Eddie Ating.

04:18.340 --> 04:19.870
I'm just going to zoom in.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.460
And it says, sorry, we don't have any cars below 5000.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.500
Let me go back to my workbook controller.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.670
I'll say 8000 and I'm looking for a Toyota.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.910
What will we get?

04:38.250 --> 04:40.040
Toyota Corolla for 5000.

04:40.050 --> 04:40.800
Beautiful.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.770
I'll go and say Volkswagen.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.990
Volkswagen.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.480
And there is a Volkswagen Jetta available for 6000.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.190
That is all for workbook 2.6.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.250
I will see you in the next one.
