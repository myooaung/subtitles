00:01.870 --> 00:02.290
All right.

00:02.290 --> 00:06.670
I'm going to apply some breakpoints, actually, just one breakpoint to the application.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.760
I will go ahead and run this app in debug mode.

00:23.030 --> 00:23.720
All right.

00:23.720 --> 00:29.450
And starting from the very top, I'll make a get request on local host 886 grades.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.800
The first the breakpoint hits and the request goes to the handler method get grades.

00:34.820 --> 00:40.940
The handler method adds an attribute to the model that maps to an array list.

00:40.940 --> 00:48.200
The array list has three objects and if I step over model add attribute using the step over button.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.760
You'll see that the model now contains data.

00:53.590 --> 00:58.000
You can drill into it and you'll notice a key value pair.

00:58.030 --> 01:04.750
The string grades is the key, and the value that it maps to is a grades array list with a size of three

01:04.750 --> 01:05.710
objects.

01:06.990 --> 01:12.780
And right before the handler method redirects the user to the grade's view, it's going to send over

01:12.780 --> 01:17.700
this model data to the grades HTML template.

01:18.830 --> 01:24.750
And inside the final leaf template, the variable expression is going to grab the grade's array list.

01:24.770 --> 01:30.270
It's going to generate as many table rows as there are elements inside of the array list.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.890
And for every grade object that it loops through.

01:35.390 --> 01:42.320
It's going to generate a row that shares the exact same name, the exact same subject, and the exact

01:42.320 --> 01:43.160
same score.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.050
And if I press next.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.810
It will do just that.
