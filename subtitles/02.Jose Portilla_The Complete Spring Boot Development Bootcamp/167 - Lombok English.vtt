00:00.300 --> 00:04.200
Before we write any more code, let's simplify it using Lombok.

00:04.470 --> 00:09.200
Lombok is a very special dependency that minimizes boilerplate code.

00:09.210 --> 00:14.880
So go ahead and add the Lombok dependency if you don't already have it inside of your port XML file.

00:14.910 --> 00:20.010
I'm pretty sure I provided it in the starter project and if you're using VS code, there's actually

00:20.010 --> 00:27.420
another step that we need to employ in order to get Lombok working, you need to install the Lombok

00:27.420 --> 00:30.360
annotation support for VS Code Extension.

00:31.220 --> 00:36.100
And now, depending on when you're watching this video, the names of these extensions can change.

00:36.110 --> 00:41.660
So if you see the exact title that I currently have by Microsoft, perfect, install it.

00:41.660 --> 00:47.510
If this title happened to be renamed to, I don't know, Lombok for code, you know, just user intuition.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.660
All right, now it is time for the real fun.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.460
Please pause and get that installed.

00:52.460 --> 00:56.000
And once you do, we're going to go over to the student class.

00:56.270 --> 00:58.220
And let me just tell you this.

00:58.220 --> 01:01.970
You never, ever have to create another getter and setter again.

01:01.970 --> 01:06.590
So over here, up top, what I can just say is add getter.

01:07.210 --> 01:14.350
And etc., and that will automatically generate all of the getters and setters based on the fields that

01:14.350 --> 01:15.660
this class defines.

01:15.670 --> 01:19.120
So here I can remove all of this boilerplate code.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.210
This looks a lot better.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.180
Now, let's just say that I also wanted to have a complete constructor.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.720
So let's create a constructor using all fields.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.900
And let's just say that I also want it to have an empty constructor.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.980
Well, going forward, we do not have to write any of this code again.

01:41.130 --> 01:49.830
If I want Lombok to auto generate a complete constructor for this class, I can just say all args constructor.

01:51.890 --> 01:58.370
If I want Lombok to generate an empty constructor, then I can just say at no ARGs.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.480
Constructor.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.370
All right.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.140
And this is looking really good.

02:04.470 --> 02:09.480
If you don't believe me that this is actually generating constructors, getters and setters on the fly.

02:09.510 --> 02:10.740
Let's test it out.

02:10.860 --> 02:16.700
I'm going to create a new student object first using the complete constructor.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.630
And there you go.

02:18.660 --> 02:23.580
I'm going to create a new student object using the empty constructor, and this works as well.

02:23.610 --> 02:28.050
I'm going to call one of the getters that Lombok generates.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.540
Now I will call one of the setters.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.300
And this is looking really good.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.820
Never again do we have to write any boilerplate code.

02:37.830 --> 02:43.890
We can just specify the following annotations and let me just import all of these artifacts at once.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.540
And we're going to replicate this for the grade pod class import.

02:50.540 --> 02:52.010
Lombok Star.

02:54.470 --> 02:58.970
Then we'll do the exact same thing for the course of class.

02:59.600 --> 03:05.810
Let us delete all of these getters and setters because they will be auto generated.

03:08.050 --> 03:11.080
We'll delete these getters and setters as well.

03:13.360 --> 03:13.830
Okay.

03:13.870 --> 03:14.860
Looking good.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.430
Now let's just say you also wanted to override equals and hashCode.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.790
Instead you can just use Lombok and say equals and hashCode.

03:28.070 --> 03:29.810
Waiting for it to autocomplete.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.830
And there you go.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.200
But we're not going to be doing that.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.450
Let's just stick with what we have and.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.140
All right.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.000
Let's move on to the next lesson.
