00:00.180 --> 00:02.330
Welcome to Workbook 2.11.

00:02.340 --> 00:06.630
Please launch the starter project by going to this path in your course resources.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.540
In this workbook, once again, you're going to use a theme leaf loop that is going to generate as many

00:17.570 --> 00:20.660
table rows as there are records in this array list.

00:20.930 --> 00:27.240
Then you're going to use a utility method that can actually format each number into a currency.

00:27.260 --> 00:30.920
You're going to have to research this utility from the repo.

00:31.100 --> 00:36.770
And then in Test seven, you're actually going to color the background of each row, depending on a

00:36.770 --> 00:40.400
condition such as is the profit positive or negative.

00:40.430 --> 00:44.840
