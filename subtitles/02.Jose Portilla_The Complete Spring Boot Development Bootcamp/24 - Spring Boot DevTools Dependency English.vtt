00:00.330 --> 00:04.050
The Spring DevTools dependency accelerates development time.

00:06.300 --> 00:11.160
I like to use the MAVEN Clean Command at least once to start from a fresh build.

00:12.400 --> 00:18.100
And then I rely on the spring def tools dependency to auto restart the application every time I make

00:18.100 --> 00:19.090
a new change.

00:21.610 --> 00:25.030
So in this lesson we will add the spring boot devtools dependency.

00:27.320 --> 00:32.660
Spring Boot DevTools instruments your application to pick up new changes and restart.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.680
So what we're going to do is google spring boot devtools.

00:42.280 --> 00:46.660
And we will go to the know what?

00:46.660 --> 00:47.680
Let's be more specific.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.660
We'll say central maven repo.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.810
Go to the Central Maven repository.

00:56.040 --> 01:01.200
I will choose version 2.6.7 in accordance with my spring boot project.

01:03.410 --> 01:04.520
Click that.

01:05.730 --> 01:09.300
And I will synchronize the belt file.

01:11.590 --> 01:12.390
Now here.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.070
I can add the dependency now, I can actually remove the version number.

01:19.180 --> 01:24.790
That being said, the version for Spring Boot starters will be 2.6.7 by default.

01:25.030 --> 01:30.460
And what this dependency will do is provide all of the files needed to instrument your application to

01:30.460 --> 01:33.010
always restart when you make a new change.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.410
So let's try it out.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.480
I'll start off with a clean build maven.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.340
Clean spring boot run.

01:45.830 --> 01:46.330
All right.

01:46.330 --> 01:52.330
This time I actually have my Tomcat server running on Port 8080, so I'll go ahead and make a request

01:52.330 --> 01:52.810
there.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.640
Local host, 8080 l0 spring.

01:55.660 --> 01:56.640
All right.

01:56.650 --> 02:02.530
And now if you focus on my terminal, if I ever make a change in the back end for now, I'll just add

02:02.530 --> 02:03.640
a print statement.

02:06.530 --> 02:08.150
Notice that it auto restarts.

02:08.150 --> 02:12.680
That's pretty cool, but we don't need to make any changes in the back end right now.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.720
We'll go right into The View.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.080
And.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.860
I'll add another header that says.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.040
How are you?

02:25.850 --> 02:31.150
And now I don't have to restart the application because when we make a request on local hosts 80 to

02:31.150 --> 02:34.010
80, it's going to return the updated view.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.530
Beautiful.

02:36.010 --> 02:41.620
There's just one thing I want to warn you about is if you find vs code ever getting slow for you or

02:41.620 --> 02:48.490
you feel like an auto importing or the autocomplete feature just randomly stopped then shut down devtools

02:48.490 --> 02:49.810
using control c.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.220
It's usually the culprit, but most of the time it works really well.

02:54.580 --> 03:00.850
So to recap, you added the dev tools dependency that picks up new changes and restart your application.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.320
Every now and then.

03:03.320 --> 03:08.870
I like to start off with a fresh build using Maven clean spring boot to run and then I let DevTools

03:08.870 --> 03:10.100
take care of the rest.
