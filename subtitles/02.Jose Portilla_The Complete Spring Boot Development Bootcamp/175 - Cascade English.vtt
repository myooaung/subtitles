00:00.180 --> 00:06.420
I went ahead and gave Harry three grades before this, recording a B plus an A-plus and a C plus.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.500
Now, if I try to delete this student with an idea of one.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.300
I will delete Harry.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.190
It gives us a big error.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.890
That's because the grade table's foreign key column.

00:23.010 --> 00:30.630
It's referencing the student with that ID and by trying to delete this student with an idea of one these

00:30.630 --> 00:33.220
records, they would not mean anything anymore.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.420
So if I delete a student with an ID of one, if that deletion were to work, then our grades table wouldn't

00:39.420 --> 00:40.600
make any sense.

00:40.620 --> 00:47.370
We need to cascade the effect of that deletion to all of the grades associated with that student.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.410
So over here, back in our code, we're going to say.

00:53.870 --> 00:54.800
Cascade.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.360
Is equal to cascade type dot all.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.900
Let me go back and give Harry three grades.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.750
C-plus.

01:08.410 --> 01:09.490
A-plus.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.760
And B plus.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.140
But to run this query.

01:20.100 --> 01:20.270
Okay.

01:20.430 --> 01:26.850
Here we see three grades, and by deleting this student, it's going to cascade the deletion to all

01:26.850 --> 01:27.910
of their grades.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.400
Let's try it out.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.530
I will delete Harry.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.420
Beautiful.

01:33.690 --> 01:40.380
And if I were to run that same query again, we can see that any operation we apply to the student gets

01:40.380 --> 01:43.140
cascaded to its associated records.

01:43.590 --> 01:49.800
In this case, by deleting the student with an idea of one, that deletion was cascaded to all of its

01:49.800 --> 01:51.840
associated grade records.

01:53.160 --> 01:59.130
And I hope this makes you realize that this only worked because the relationship is bidirectional.

01:59.430 --> 02:05.160
When we delete the student our table, it understands that these are all the grades associated with

02:05.160 --> 02:05.950
this student.

02:05.970 --> 02:09.960
It finds all of their grades and cascades the deletion process.
