There are many ways to run a spring boot application.

00:05.690 --> 00:10.340
In this lesson, you will learn to run a spring app using MAVEN commands and the run button.

00:11.300 --> 00:15.020
The first question you have to ask yourself is Where does the runtime start?

00:15.200 --> 00:21.560
The entry point of your Spring Boot app is in the application Java file when you run your application.

00:21.650 --> 00:27.200
The runtime starts here and it's the spring boot application annotation that instruments the launch

00:27.200 --> 00:28.700
of a Spring Boot app.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.320
Let's go through the first to Maven Command Spring Boot Run.

00:34.350 --> 00:37.800
This command compiles and runs a spring boot application.

00:38.990 --> 00:45.260
When it compiles your code, the compiled classes are going to go to the target folder and then it will

00:45.260 --> 00:46.820
run your compiled code.

00:47.620 --> 00:51.640
Before we start, you can open up a new terminal by going to terminal.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.110
New terminal.

00:54.810 --> 00:55.780
All right.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.430
Your project should come with a maven wrapper.

01:00.580 --> 01:03.950
We can use the maven wrapper to run Maven commands.

01:03.970 --> 01:09.370
So right now our terminal points to the hello spring folder and inside.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.150
Hello spring.

01:10.150 --> 01:12.580
We can access the maven wrapper like so.

01:17.120 --> 01:22.700
If you're using a mac like myself, your maven command must follow a dot slash.

01:35.060 --> 01:41.960
So now from the maven rapper, we can say maven spring boot run.

01:45.310 --> 01:48.790
As you can see, it compiles your code into the target folder.

01:48.820 --> 01:52.300
This is the compiled version of our Spring Java file.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.550
And then it runs your compiled code.

01:58.760 --> 02:04.670
Now a close equivalent to the spring boot run command would be to just press the run button.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.930
Now you might think to yourself, Forget running Maven commands, I'm just going to use the run button.

02:15.170 --> 02:16.320
Not so fast.

02:16.340 --> 02:19.040
I recommend running your code using this command.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.830
Maven Clean Spring Boot Run.

02:22.550 --> 02:28.820
The way this works is before starting the build, clean will remove compiled classes from the previous

02:28.820 --> 02:29.480
build.

02:29.570 --> 02:35.210
The ensuing goal as before will compile your code into the target folder and then the run the compiled

02:35.210 --> 02:35.810
code.

02:37.170 --> 02:40.530
I can use the upper key to access previous terminal commands.

02:42.110 --> 02:43.910
To our spring boots run command.

02:43.910 --> 02:46.010
We will add a goal of clean.

02:47.760 --> 02:54.870
And if you focus on the target folder as I run this command, you'll notice that it removes the previously

02:54.870 --> 02:55.950
compiled code.

02:59.620 --> 03:03.220
And then the ensuing goal will recompile your code into target.

03:03.220 --> 03:03.940
Beautiful.

03:05.910 --> 03:06.120
Now.

03:06.120 --> 03:10.770
The reason why I like to use Maven clean spring boot run is because every now and then it's good to

03:10.770 --> 03:11.830
start from scratch.

03:11.850 --> 03:16.980
Sometimes I would get random bugs that were just solved by running from a fresh build.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.040
So to recap, you learned three different ways to run a spring boot up.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.100
Maven Spring Boot Run compiles your code into target and runs it.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.410
The run button is a close equivalent.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.670
Clean will remove compiled classes from the previous build.

03:34.940 --> 03:38.750
And then Spring Boot to run will compile your code into target and run it.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.810
Throughout this course, you'll notice I'll be using Maven Clean Spring Boot Run.
