A bean is an object, nothing more.

00:07.460 --> 00:11.120
A bean is an object that springs, stores and manages for you.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.740
In this lesson, you will learn what a bean is.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.720
Let's go over the most common way of creating a been.

00:27.650 --> 00:31.370
A component class is automatically discovered by spring boot.

00:35.450 --> 00:39.020
When you run a spring boot application, it does three things.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.590
One of them is a component scan.

00:47.090 --> 00:53.270
That is, it scans your project for component classes and so any class annotated with component is automatically

00:53.270 --> 00:54.080
discovered.

00:58.260 --> 01:02.460
Spring Boots creates an object out of each component class that it finds.

01:13.410 --> 01:19.200
A spring container also called the application context stores and manages the object for you.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.500
The object lives inside of the spring container.

01:26.830 --> 01:32.470
And that being said, an object that lives inside the sprint container is called a bean.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.370
The spring container stores and manages the object for you.

01:40.050 --> 01:42.570
To recap, you learned what a bean is.

01:45.050 --> 01:51.110
A bean is an object that lives inside of the spring container, also known as the application context.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.350
The spring container manages the object for you.
