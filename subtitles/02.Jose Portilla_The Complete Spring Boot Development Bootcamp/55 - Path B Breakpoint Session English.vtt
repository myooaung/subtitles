00:00.090 --> 00:02.750
Breakpoints allow you to visualize the runtime.

00:02.760 --> 00:08.880
They are important for debugging and we use breakpoints of very extensively in the Java bootcamp and

00:08.880 --> 00:12.210
you can rest assured we're going to use them again in the spring boot course.

00:12.270 --> 00:17.400
If you're not familiar with breakpoints yet, please visit the helpful resources inside of Appendix

00:17.400 --> 00:21.780
A and watch the breakpoints lesson that corresponds to your editor.

00:22.380 --> 00:22.610
Okay.

00:22.830 --> 00:28.650
First thing I'll do is I will add a breakpoint right over here and then run my application in debug

00:28.650 --> 00:29.250
mode.

00:37.600 --> 00:41.950
I can see that the HTTP server is running on Port 1880.

00:42.190 --> 00:47.550
So back here the client can make a get request to local host 8080 slash.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.130
Hello.

00:50.570 --> 00:53.050
The Handler method intercepts the get request.

00:53.060 --> 01:00.170
You can see that it reaches the breakpoint and it's going to respond with a view called some HTML view.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.300
If we continue the runtime.

01:04.350 --> 01:05.510
We get an error.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.100
It says the template might not exist or might not be accessible.

01:10.110 --> 01:16.130
So the HTML template that our handler method is trying to return doesn't exist.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.260
So Spring Boot actually just sends back an exception.

01:20.400 --> 01:26.040
Now, there's one thing I want to point out is that when you're doing your challenges or your workbooks,

01:26.040 --> 01:28.770
you're going to come across error messages like this.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.160
My biggest advice is to ignore all the noise.

01:32.190 --> 01:36.690
Look for the meaningful message that describes what your issue is.

01:36.870 --> 01:41.970
In this case, the error was that it could not resolve the template some HTML view.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.870
Don't be discouraged by all of these logs.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.010
Just make sure to look at what's meaningful.

01:47.040 --> 01:53.440
This is really important for debugging and as far as this breakpoint session goes, that's really it.

01:53.460 --> 01:58.530
It was only to show you how to visualize the runtime of a spring boot app and the Breakpoint sessions

01:58.530 --> 02:01.380
in the future will rest assured be more meaningful.
