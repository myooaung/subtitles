00:00.270 --> 00:03.230
Right now, I can give her mini an A-plus and potions.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.620
Let me just go and do that.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.690
And then I can go and give her an A-minus in that same grade.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.350
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.350
Which one is her actual grade?

00:23.360 --> 00:26.620
Did she get an A-minus in potions or did she get an A-plus?

00:26.630 --> 00:33.260
We will consider a duplicate grade to be one that repeats the course ID as well as the student ID.

00:33.470 --> 00:37.790
A student cannot have more than one grade for the same course.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.590
So to our table annotation, we're going to apply some unique constraints.

00:52.450 --> 00:55.090
And here I can specify a set of constraints.

00:55.090 --> 00:57.910
We're only going to have one unique constraint.

00:58.630 --> 01:03.850
And this constraint is going to be a multi column constraint because it's going to be based on the course

01:03.850 --> 01:06.100
ID and the student ID columns.

01:06.460 --> 01:11.530
So here we'll say the unique constraint is based on the column names.

01:12.780 --> 01:14.010
Student ID.

01:16.090 --> 01:18.430
As well as course I'd.

01:19.950 --> 01:27.090
Overall, we're imposing a constraint such that every student ID and course ID pair needs to be unique.

01:27.810 --> 01:30.810
Please make sure these actually match your column names.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.220
All right.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.730
I'm going to try duplicating a grade for her money.

01:35.730 --> 01:38.250
So first I'll give her an A minus.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.270
And then I'll try to give her an A-plus for that same grade.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.960
And we get back a data integrity violation exception.

01:47.930 --> 01:49.070
This is perfect.

01:50.910 --> 01:51.180
Okay.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.010
Now, here's another constraint that we have to impose.

01:54.030 --> 01:58.410
You cannot have two courses with the exact same course code.

01:58.590 --> 02:06.210
So back to our course entity, because this constraint of ours only spans one column, we can go over

02:06.210 --> 02:08.130
here and just say unique.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.350
Is equal to true.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.840
Now I'm going to try to submit a course that has the same course code as history of magic.

02:18.850 --> 02:26.470
So I will go to create course and whatever JSON that says, I'm going to submit a course that has the

02:26.470 --> 02:29.770
exact same code as one of our pre-existing records.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.540
Let's try to make that request.

02:32.140 --> 02:39.100
And once again, we get a data integrity violation exception, and that's it with all of these exceptions

02:39.100 --> 02:46.120
that are being thrown, the exceptions from JPA, the exceptions that we are throwing ourselves, it's

02:46.120 --> 02:49.210
time to apply some exception handling and we will do that.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.490
And then next workbook, see you in there.
