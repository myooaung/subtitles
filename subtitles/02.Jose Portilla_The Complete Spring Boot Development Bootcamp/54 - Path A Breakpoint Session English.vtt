00:00.330 --> 00:03.000
Breakpoints allow you to visualize the runtime.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.150
They are important for debugging and we use breakpoints of very extensively in the Java bootcamp and

00:09.150 --> 00:12.510
you can rest assured we're going to use them again in the spring boot course.

00:12.540 --> 00:17.670
If you're not familiar with breakpoints yet, please visit the helpful resources inside of Appendix

00:17.670 --> 00:22.050
A and watch the breakpoints lesson that corresponds to your editor.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.920
First thing I'll do is I will add a breakpoint right over here and then run my application in debug

00:28.920 --> 00:29.490
mode.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.150
All right.

00:37.150 --> 00:42.810
If I scroll up, I can see that the HTTP server is running on Port 8080.

00:42.970 --> 00:48.330
So back here, the client can make a get request to local host 8080 slash.

00:48.340 --> 00:48.910
Hello.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.820
The Handler method intercepts the get request.

00:53.820 --> 01:00.960
You can see that it reaches the breakpoint and it's going to respond with a view called some HTML view.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.060
If we continue the runtime.

01:05.110 --> 01:06.270
We get an error.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.860
It says the template might not exist or might not be accessible.

01:10.870 --> 01:16.880
So the HTML template that our handler method is trying to return doesn't exist.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.020
So Spring Boot actually just sends back an exception.

01:21.170 --> 01:26.810
Now, there's one thing I want to point out is that when you're doing your challenges or your workbooks,

01:26.810 --> 01:29.540
you're going to come across error messages like this.

01:29.570 --> 01:32.940
My biggest advice is to ignore all the noise.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.460
Look for the meaningful message that describes what your issue is.

01:37.640 --> 01:42.710
In this case, the error was that it could not resolve the template some HTML view.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.650
Don't be discouraged by all of these logs.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.790
Just make sure to look at what's meaningful.

01:47.810 --> 01:54.220
This is really important for debugging and as far as this breakpoint session goes, that's really it.

01:54.230 --> 02:00.080
It was only to show you how to visualize the runtime of a spring boot app using VS code and the breakpoint

02:00.080 --> 02:03.440
sessions in the future will rest assured be more meaningful.
