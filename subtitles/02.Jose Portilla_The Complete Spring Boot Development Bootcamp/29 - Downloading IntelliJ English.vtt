If you're watching this video, then you chose to follow this course using IntelliJ.

00:07.370 --> 00:10.820
So in this video, we're going to download the intelligence community edition.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.310
You can download Intel for Mac, Windows or Linux.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.770
I left you a link in the resources folder.

00:20.100 --> 00:24.440
The resources folder is just a small icon that you'll find close to the lecture title.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.690
So take a second to pause the video and we will continue.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.760
Once you're on the download page.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.830
Download it for whatever operating system you're using.

00:40.850 --> 00:46.550
There's only one download link for Windows, but there is two for Mac.

00:46.910 --> 00:51.410
In that case, what you want to do is go to about this Mac.

00:55.830 --> 01:00.900
And if your chip says Intel, then you would choose the Mac Intel installer.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.740
Mine says AM one, so I'll choose the other installer.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.850
The Ultimate Edition has many extra features for enterprise development that we do not need for this

01:13.850 --> 01:14.570
course.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.340
The community edition has everything that we need, minus all of the bells and whistles.

01:27.600 --> 01:27.940
Okay.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.400
Our download is finished.

01:35.570 --> 01:36.740
And I'm good to go.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.840
Open up IntelliJ.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.550
You can feel free to customize your theme.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.110
I'm going to stick with Mac OS Lite.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.220
I'm going to choose an ID font of 16.

02:11.450 --> 02:17.330
And as far as plug ins go, we're not going to add any more plug ins than what we've already been provided.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.340
And that's really it.

02:19.370 --> 02:22.550
You download it IntelliJ and now we can start using it.
