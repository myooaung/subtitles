00:00.090 --> 00:01.320
In this breakpoint session.

00:01.320 --> 00:05.130
We're going to start by adding breakpoints inside of get grades.

00:06.250 --> 00:06.910
All right.

00:06.910 --> 00:09.760
And now go ahead and press the debug button.

00:13.490 --> 00:17.590
We'll wait for the Tomcat server to load and run on Port 88.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.680
All right.

00:20.060 --> 00:24.500
I will make a get request on local host 8080 with path grades.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.500
The Handler method get grades, intercepts, the get request.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.810
You can see that the method has direct access to the model.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.580
The model right now is empty.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.720
There's nothing inside of it.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.490
It has a size of zero.

00:38.090 --> 00:42.560
So we need to give it some data, which is exactly what we're going to do in the next two lines.

00:42.560 --> 00:52.010
So I'll step over this breakpoint and this line creates a plain old Java object with a name, score

00:52.010 --> 00:52.970
and subject.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.760
And then here we're adding a model attribute where a grade key maps to that grade object.

01:00.730 --> 01:01.750
All right.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.990
The model gets populated with data.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.890
You can click here to expand and you'll notice a key value pair.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.250
The key grade maps to a grade object.
