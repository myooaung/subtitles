WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:03.330
The View makes up another component of the MVC design.

00:05.220 --> 00:08.520
The view represents the visual elements that make up a web page.

00:10.670 --> 00:14.090
So in this lesson, your handler method is going to return a view.

00:16.790 --> 00:20.840
When a user types in a URL into the browser, they're making a get to request.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.880
They are requesting a resource.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.930
The controller inside spring boot intercepts the get request, and then it maps the get request to a

00:28.930 --> 00:29.980
handler method.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.390
And the handler method responds with a view.

00:41.620 --> 00:42.060
All right.

00:42.070 --> 00:44.280
The view is what the user sees.

00:44.290 --> 00:47.860
The HTML that a handler method returns makes up the view.

00:51.750 --> 00:55.290
What I'm going to do is rename this method to get to grades.

00:56.750 --> 01:00.500
And I will change the mapping URL to slash grades.

01:00.980 --> 01:06.440
This handler method when invoked, is going to respond with the grades html.

01:08.980 --> 01:09.330
Okay.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.740
You can go ahead and run your spring boot up.

01:13.350 --> 01:13.620
Yes.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.160
I'll just have to rewrite it.

01:15.180 --> 01:19.170
Maven Clean spring boot run.

01:30.330 --> 01:33.450
And now from your browser it make a request to a local host.

01:33.480 --> 01:33.870
80.

01:33.870 --> 01:36.240
80 slash grades.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.720
Beautiful.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.460
The user makes a request on the path slash grades.

01:44.470 --> 01:49.030
The controller maps the request to a handler method that matches the path.

01:49.330 --> 01:53.260
The handler method tries responding with a view called grades.

01:54.820 --> 01:58.780
It finds the view inside the templates folder and returns it.

02:03.340 --> 02:06.850
The View only contains the visual elements of a web page.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.900
The View needs data to become meaningful, and the data that populates the view is called the model.

02:12.910 --> 02:15.400
That will be the focus of the next lesson.

02:17.190 --> 02:20.430
So to recap, the view is what the user sees.

02:22.450 --> 02:25.410
The user makes a request on the path slash grades.

02:25.420 --> 02:29.440
The controller maps the request to a handler method that matches the path.

02:29.770 --> 02:33.610
The handler method tries responding with a resource called grades.

02:33.790 --> 02:37.480
It finds the view inside the templates folder and returns it.
