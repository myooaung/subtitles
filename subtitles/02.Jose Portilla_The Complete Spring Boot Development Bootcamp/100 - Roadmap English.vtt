00:00.120 --> 00:05.070
Welcome to the Field Validation section and this section, we're going to prevent the user from submitting

00:05.070 --> 00:06.240
meaningless data.

00:06.270 --> 00:12.480
For example, if they leave the name blank, if they put an invalid score of, let's say, our plus,

00:12.480 --> 00:14.790
and if they don't submit a subject.

00:15.590 --> 00:18.110
We're going to display error messages.

00:18.740 --> 00:19.570
I hope you're excited.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.960
I will see you inside.
