00:00.810 --> 00:03.540
In this lesson, you will add some final touches.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.990
The constant -1000 is meaningful.

00:07.290 --> 00:13.200
Instead of writing -1000 every single time, which is a very good way to get bugs.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.800
We need to define it as a constant and describe its purpose.

00:17.250 --> 00:23.130
And inside this folder I will create a constant Java file.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.820
And now here I will declare a public static final.

00:30.240 --> 00:30.950
And.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.870
Equal to -1000.

00:39.580 --> 00:45.220
Final means the constant can never be mutated, and static means you can access the constant without

00:45.220 --> 00:47.440
creating an object of this class.

00:47.890 --> 00:51.580
This was already explained in the Complete Java Development Bootcamp.

00:51.970 --> 00:54.010
In any case, what I'm going to do here.

00:55.020 --> 01:00.750
Is replace the loose number a -1000 with a final constant constants.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.420
And we'll do the same thing all over.

01:15.080 --> 01:21.290
Next thing we're going to do is fix the following anchor tags, form and grades.

01:22.470 --> 01:26.550
Because right now the form and grades, buttons, they don't really lead to anything.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.570
They must be able to make get requests.

01:29.570 --> 01:35.360
So what I'm going to do is give each one of them a thin leaf, a rough attribute, as we did for the

01:35.360 --> 01:38.000
update button file leaf h ref.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.150
Finally h ref.

01:43.190 --> 01:48.320
The first one will make a get request to the relative path slash.

01:50.700 --> 01:57.570
The second one will make a get request to the relative path slash grades.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.810
Which, as you know, will return the grade's view OC.

02:05.870 --> 02:10.100
Now, if I'm inside of the forms page, these buttons should work perfectly.

02:11.170 --> 02:16.300
But inside of the grade's view, these buttons don't actually work because I'm going to have to go inside

02:16.300 --> 02:20.110
a grade XHTML and apply the same changes.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.620
All right.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.800
Now the app is fully functional.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.410
You can submit a grade.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.630
You can update that same grade.

02:39.350 --> 02:44.450
And then if you want to add a new grade, instead of writing out local host 8080 all over again, press

02:44.450 --> 02:49.310
a button that makes it get request to that same path and you can add a new grade.

02:49.550 --> 02:50.810
We'll say her mini.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.250
A-plus arithmetic.

02:55.030 --> 02:55.810
Beautiful.

02:55.820 --> 03:00.070
And actually, on the topic of final touches, one last thing I want to do is I don't like that we're

03:00.070 --> 03:02.470
calling this function twice.

03:02.470 --> 03:05.290
So what I'll say is int.

03:06.550 --> 03:11.980
Index is equal to get grade index at that ID.

03:12.980 --> 03:17.780
And then we'll just pass in the index making this line a lot shorter.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.170
Student grades get index.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.270
And that's it.
