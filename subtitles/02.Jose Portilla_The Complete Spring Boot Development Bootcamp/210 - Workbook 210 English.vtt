00:00.330 --> 00:06.330
Welcome to Workbook 2.10 already launched the Starter Project and Task one is to create a plain old

00:06.330 --> 00:09.480
Java object class for employee objects.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.290
So we will create a new class called employee.

00:15.590 --> 00:16.430
Java.

00:17.910 --> 00:21.420
And inside we will have three fields.

00:22.740 --> 00:25.230
Create the usual getters and setters.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.950
And we'll create a full constructor.

00:32.070 --> 00:32.940
All right.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.690
For returning the view.

00:35.720 --> 00:42.260
We need to add the following objects to the model so we can just copy this over to our workbook controller.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.260
Um.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.170
Seems I already had these imported.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.400
Convenient.

00:48.760 --> 00:53.170
And now we need to add this employees ArrayList to our model.

00:53.170 --> 00:56.860
So we'll say model dot add attribute.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.460
Was there a specific name we had to give it?

01:00.490 --> 01:01.720
Not really.

01:02.880 --> 01:08.520
I'm just going to call it employees and it's going to map to our employees array list.

01:08.910 --> 01:09.990
All right.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.120
Now under the header and staff of HTML, create a table similar to the following.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.310
So our table is going to have some number of rows and three columns.

01:23.820 --> 01:29.640
We'll go ahead and create a table right under our header.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.450
Uh.

01:36.450 --> 01:38.160
There's going to be one row.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.850
That contains a bunch of headers.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.600
It was three headers to be specific.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.030
Okay.

01:53.050 --> 01:57.640
And the headers are name, age and role.

02:04.350 --> 02:09.300
And now every table road that follows needs to be created using a timely loop.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.940
So here we'll say thiamine for each.

02:12.300 --> 02:19.650
And what thiamine is going to do is it's going to loop through every single employee inside of the staff

02:19.650 --> 02:20.340
list.

02:23.580 --> 02:27.450
So the variable expression grabs the stuff.

02:27.450 --> 02:29.430
ArrayList that's inside of our model.

02:29.430 --> 02:37.140
And if each is going to generate as many rows as there are employees inside of the staff array list

02:37.710 --> 02:44.850
and for each row that it generates, that row is going to have three data cells.

02:47.220 --> 02:55.320
And every data cell is going to display text that equals a field that belongs to the current employee

02:55.320 --> 02:57.000
that's being iterated through.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.820
Think about this like it's a regular for loop.

03:03.340 --> 03:10.270
This will display the age of the current employee that's being iterated through and this will display

03:10.270 --> 03:12.370
the employee dot role.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.720
All right.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.950
I think that's about it.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.830
We should be able to run our code.

03:31.190 --> 03:32.870
Local host, 1880.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.290
And it doesn't seem to work.

03:41.580 --> 03:41.900
Huh?

03:42.060 --> 03:43.120
Silly me.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.640
The model attribute is employees, but I passed in staff.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.940
All right.

03:54.950 --> 03:56.660
So here we have our table.

03:56.690 --> 04:03.160
The first table row is just a bunch of headers, and every row that follows was generated using a leaf

04:03.170 --> 04:03.800
loop.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.500
Now it expects the following output.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.490
So what we can do is add a border to our table.

04:10.640 --> 04:17.960
We'll say a border is equal to solid and we'll give it a width that spans 100% of our page.

04:24.850 --> 04:27.460
And that's all for Workbook 2.10.
