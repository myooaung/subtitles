Welcome to Workbook 3.2, where we're going to teach you the concept of cross field validation.

00:06.480 --> 00:12.590
So for example, here we can see that individually each of these inputs is technically valid.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.080
However, we want a first name and a last name.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.510
We don't actually want them to match up.

00:18.630 --> 00:23.760
So in this case, Ryan and Ryan as both first name and last name is invalid, which means we need to

00:23.760 --> 00:26.420
use cross field validation to check for this.

00:26.430 --> 00:28.890
