00:00.210 --> 00:01.770
Welcome to Workbook 2.3.

00:01.770 --> 00:07.320
I've already gone ahead and launched the Starter Project so we can move right into Task One, which

00:07.320 --> 00:12.050
is inside the handler method at a speed of 45 as a model attribute.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.790
Simple enough, right over here.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.790
Well, first, we need access to the model.

00:19.140 --> 00:19.710
Model.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.430
Model.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.840
And then we can say model DOT at attribute.

00:23.850 --> 00:29.820
The attribute will have a key of speed that maps to a value of 45.

00:30.910 --> 00:31.600
All right.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.760
And then inside sign HTML, create a header tag that displays the speed.

00:36.790 --> 00:38.430
Simple enough.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.810
We'll go over to templates.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.000
We'll say h one.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.600
Each one.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.480
And actually, I hope this made you think of a triumph expression, because what we're going to have

00:52.480 --> 00:55.180
to do is say, leave text.

00:58.020 --> 01:01.290
And we're going to set this equal to a text.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.950
And when you're writing a plain old string inside of a of expression, you should remember to wrap it

01:07.950 --> 01:10.080
inside of single quotes.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.800
So the string is going to be speed, colon, empty space.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.660
That's going to be our string.

01:17.380 --> 01:24.160
So we can concatenate this static string with the result of a variable expression by using the plus

01:24.160 --> 01:29.710
symbol, and then we can use a variable expression to grab the speed from our model.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.280
So this should say speed 45.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.020
I'm not going to run the code just yet.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.520
Let's do just a little more.

01:37.370 --> 01:44.930
And then it says Create an image element that displays slow down only if the speed is higher than 60.

01:45.290 --> 01:48.020
So here I can create an image element.

01:51.300 --> 01:56.050
This image element will only display if the speed is higher than 60.

01:56.070 --> 01:58.950
So we'll set it equal to a variable expression.

01:59.810 --> 02:01.760
And we'll say if the speed.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.530
Is higher than 60.

02:05.950 --> 02:09.710
Then we want to display an image from our static folder.

02:09.730 --> 02:14.410
So if you go to static slash images, slash slowdown PNG.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.310
That's what we want to display.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.130
If they're going too fast.

02:22.730 --> 02:23.960
I think that's it.

02:24.780 --> 02:29.300
Use timely for timely fun less give the image a with the 200.

02:29.420 --> 02:31.460
Let's give it a width of 200.

02:35.030 --> 02:41.120
Going back here create an image element that displays the speed limit if the speed is lower than 60.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.280
So I'll just copy the following.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.920
And instead of saying Finally F, f, I will say file if unless, which is going to evaluate the opposite

02:48.920 --> 02:49.760
condition.

02:50.000 --> 03:00.380
And if that happens to be the case, if they're going lower than 60 will display will remind them of

03:00.380 --> 03:01.370
the speed limit.

03:03.130 --> 03:03.610
Okay.

03:03.790 --> 03:10.060
I think we're ready to run our code and run these test cases.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.180
May have been clean.

03:12.180 --> 03:13.320
Spring boots run.

03:20.720 --> 03:20.920
Okay.

03:20.990 --> 03:22.580
It will say local host 80.

03:22.590 --> 03:23.180
80.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.240
Speed of 45 reminds them of the speed limit.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.620
What are what were some other test cases?

03:31.640 --> 03:33.290
What if we put 70?

03:35.710 --> 03:43.720
So from our controller, we'll pass in a model attribute of speed that maps to a value of 70.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.120
We run our code.

03:46.630 --> 03:48.160
It tells them to slow down.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.000
Beautiful.
