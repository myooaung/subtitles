00:01.410 --> 00:03.840
We never have to write auto pilot again.

00:04.260 --> 00:09.510
If you remember the challenge from the Beans section, if I were to put a constructor here, let me

00:09.510 --> 00:12.210
just generate a constructor using all fields.

00:13.900 --> 00:20.800
Then we wouldn't need auto wire because Spring Boot will automatically inject the relevant dependencies

00:20.800 --> 00:23.800
over here and then it's going to update your fields.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.260
This is useful when you've got many fields and you don't want to keep saying auto wired.

00:28.270 --> 00:32.920
And if I were to test everything out, everything would still work as intended.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.420
So let me just create a grade.

00:35.250 --> 00:35.970
Beautiful.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.020
Now.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.100
This is nothing new.

00:38.130 --> 00:43.320
You already saw this in your challenge, but instead of writing out this ugly constructor, we can just

00:43.320 --> 00:44.610
go up here and say.

00:46.690 --> 00:47.800
All our eggs.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.270
Constructor.

00:56.870 --> 01:02.270
And it will auto generate the constructor on the fly by virtue of just putting all our constructor.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.790
It's going to take care of dependency injection.

01:04.820 --> 01:07.370
Let us just test it out by making one request.

01:08.120 --> 01:08.930
We're still good.

01:09.230 --> 01:15.350
So wherever we're using auto wired, let me just put an all args constructor instead.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.750
So over here.

01:24.930 --> 01:28.260
And we'll probably need it here as well eventually.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.820
So let's just get it over with.

01:35.340 --> 01:35.530
This.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.140
Put it in the great controller.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.060
So don't forget to remove auto wired.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.810
And in the student controller.

01:57.950 --> 01:59.360
We're going to need this here eventually.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.710
So let's just do it right now.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.220
All right, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.

02:12.650 --> 02:13.940
Remove this.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.060
And looks like we're good.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.680
It's nice that now I don't have to keep putting out a wired every single time.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.930
Add another field.

02:23.940 --> 02:29.790
I can just say all args constructor and it's going to perform the dependency injection behind the scenes.
