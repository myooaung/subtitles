00:00.300 --> 00:05.730
In this section, your spring boot application will communicate with an SQL database in workbooks.

00:05.730 --> 00:07.650
9.1 to 9.3.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.500
We're just going to start by preparing the rest end points.

00:10.530 --> 00:15.610
Once we do that, you will create, retrieve and delete entities using spring JPA.

00:16.050 --> 00:21.030
Then you will set up a bidirectional one to many relationship between student and grades.

00:21.030 --> 00:26.310
And once again for extra practice you will set up a bidirectional one to many relationship between course

00:26.310 --> 00:27.450
and grades.

00:27.450 --> 00:32.670
And then in your final challenge, you will set up a many to many relationship between students and

00:32.670 --> 00:33.600
courses.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.360
This section covers a lot of ground and by the end you will become comfortable communicating with an

00:39.360 --> 00:41.930
SQL database through your Spring Boot app.
