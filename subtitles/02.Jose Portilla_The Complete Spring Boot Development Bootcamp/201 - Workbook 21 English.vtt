00:00.270 --> 00:03.330
Welcome to Workbook 2.1 using the Spanish laser.

00:03.360 --> 00:07.500
The first thing you have to do is create a new project with the following attributes.

00:07.590 --> 00:12.570
I've already created the project and the interest of time, so we'll just jump right into Task One,

00:12.570 --> 00:18.500
which is to create a handler method that can handle get requests made by the client on an empty path.

00:18.510 --> 00:21.810
So we'll start by creating a new controller.

00:22.110 --> 00:25.290
We'll just call it workbook controller, dot java.

00:27.500 --> 00:32.480
And we'll make this into a controller that can handle Web requests.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.710
The first thing we have to do is when a client makes a request on an empty path.

00:40.390 --> 00:43.990
We need to map this path to a handler method.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.770
So we'll say public string.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.300
I'll call the handler method, get shows.

00:49.390 --> 00:54.070
And what it's going to do is return a show's HTML.

00:54.460 --> 01:01.420
That HTML is going to be located inside of the templates folder we'll just say shows that HTML.

01:01.420 --> 01:07.450
But for this to work in order to work with templates, you need to have the file dependency installed.

01:07.870 --> 01:12.100
So what we'll have to do is go to the central maven repo.

01:12.130 --> 01:17.200
I already went there and copy the spring boot starter file leaf dependency.

01:19.230 --> 01:24.030
You don't need to include the version because it's already going to share the same version as every

01:24.030 --> 01:25.170
other spring boot starter.

01:25.170 --> 01:31.980
So we're good there and I think now we're ready to set up our table.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.350
Here it says to use.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.300
Well, seems we missed a step.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.090
We need this in our HTML.

01:41.300 --> 01:47.160
So what I'll do is I'll create the HTML boilerplate thanks to our HTML extension.

01:47.180 --> 01:50.800
If you're using intel, I already showed you how to set up an HTML file.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.850
You can remove all this junk.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.120
No scripts needed.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.990
Only thing we'll keep is the following.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.650
We'll just call this workbook copy and paste the header.

02:05.070 --> 02:09.690
And now we can use the cheat sheet to create a table using the following data.

02:09.780 --> 02:15.250
If you have a look at the cheat sheet, you'll notice there is a table element.

02:15.270 --> 02:18.480
This table element can contain many table rows.

02:18.570 --> 02:24.180
A table a row can contain many header cells, and it can also contain many data cells.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.320
This is all the information we need to start creating.

02:29.100 --> 02:29.970
A table.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.320
A table can contain many table rows.

02:37.350 --> 02:41.790
You'll remember this was the tag for a table rows.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.990
And each row can contain many hetero cells.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.670
We'll just copy this three more times.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.220
And the headers are.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.890
Title episode and rating.

03:03.980 --> 03:04.430
Okay.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.350
Now we'll create another row.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.620
And this one will contain three data cells.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.100
Okay.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.770
The first title is Breaking Bad.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.310
I can't even pronounce this.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.840
And it has a rating of ten.

03:31.030 --> 03:31.190
Okay.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.400
We'll just copy this four more times.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.990
The second title is Attack on Titan.

03:42.010 --> 03:47.200
The title is Hero and it has an impressive 9.9.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.590
I think the third one is also attack on Titan.

03:53.020 --> 03:54.190
Perfect game.

03:56.090 --> 03:57.170
9.9.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.880
And you might be thinking, hey, this process is really tedious.

04:00.890 --> 04:04.430
Do I have to go through this every single time I create a table?

04:05.360 --> 04:06.580
Not really.

04:06.590 --> 04:13.640
Once you really understand how life works and how we can use it to manipulate data that comes from the

04:13.640 --> 04:21.050
back end into our view, this process becomes a lot easier as we learn to leverage time loops.

04:21.260 --> 04:27.200
But right now, we'll just have to do it this way until we have expanded our skill sets.

04:30.410 --> 04:30.850
Okay.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.190
I think we're now ready to run our code.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.040
Let me just make sure that everything is good.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.540
Seems to be.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.860
Do we have all of the dependencies installed?

04:42.860 --> 04:43.970
We do.

04:44.710 --> 04:48.370
This points to the show's HTML.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.750
All right, I think we're ready.

05:00.500 --> 05:00.760
Okay.

05:00.980 --> 05:06.020
Let's say a local host, 80, 80, and there is our table, but it's not looking too pretty.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.520
I think there were some instructions on styling.

05:09.530 --> 05:13.010
So here what we can do is say.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.540
What was it again?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.830
The border should be solid.

05:20.830 --> 05:28.540
So border equals solid and the width is equal to 100%.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.480
We have def tools so we can just go ahead and refresh.

05:35.630 --> 05:36.470
Beautiful.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.230
See you in the next one.
