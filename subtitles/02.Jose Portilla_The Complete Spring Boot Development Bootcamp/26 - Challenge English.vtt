Welcome to your first challenge.

00:02.280 --> 00:06.450
And this one, you're going to be creating a new project with the following dependencies.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.790
Keep in mind, as back in developers, we don't really care too much about HTML, but we do need to

00:11.790 --> 00:12.840
work around it.

00:13.080 --> 00:17.700
So this exercise is going to allow you to leverage the HTML cheat sheet.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.120
You'll be provided with these two JPEG images.

00:21.150 --> 00:26.520
Then you'll display these images along with their corresponding captions in different ways.

00:26.970 --> 00:33.060
Again, keep in mind each HTML is not our main priority as backend developers, but we do need a little

00:33.060 --> 00:35.070
bit of understanding of how to work with it.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.380
Once you get familiarity with the HTML cheat sheet, you'll be set for the rest of this course.
