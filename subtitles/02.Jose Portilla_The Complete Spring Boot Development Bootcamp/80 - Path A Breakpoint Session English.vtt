00:00.550 --> 00:00.970
All right.

00:00.970 --> 00:05.380
I'm going to apply some breakpoints, actually, just one breakpoint to the application.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.440
I will go ahead and run this app in debug mode.

00:15.780 --> 00:16.470
All right.

00:16.470 --> 00:23.040
And starting from the very top, I'll make a guest request on local host 886 grades, the first two

00:23.040 --> 00:27.550
breakpoint hits and the request goes to the handler method get grades.

00:27.570 --> 00:33.690
The handler method adds an attribute to the model that maps to an array list.

00:33.690 --> 00:40.950
The array list has three objects and if I step over model add attribute using the step over button.

00:41.780 --> 00:44.510
You'll see that the model now contains data.

00:46.390 --> 00:50.770
You can drill into it and you'll notice a key value pair.

00:50.800 --> 00:57.550
The string grades is the key, and the value that it maps to is a grades array list with a size of three

00:57.550 --> 00:58.480
objects.

00:59.770 --> 01:05.560
And right before the handler method redirects the user to the grade's view, it's going to send over

01:05.560 --> 01:10.510
this model data to the grades HTML template.

01:11.620 --> 01:17.530
And inside the final leaf template, the variable expression is going to grab the grade's array list.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.060
It's going to generate as many table rows as there are elements inside of the array list.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.650
And for every grade object that it loops through.

01:28.170 --> 01:35.100
It's going to generate a row that shares the exact same name, the exact same subject, and the exact

01:35.100 --> 01:35.940
same score.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.840
And if I press next.

01:40.220 --> 01:41.870
It will do just that.
