Spring Boot is the best Java framework for developing web applications.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.120
In this lesson, you're going to create a spring boot project.

00:18.310 --> 00:22.030
The Spring initialize generates a spring boot project.

00:25.340 --> 00:30.440
You can access the spring initialization by going to start dot spring dot IO.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.910
Please pause the video and go to this website.

00:44.070 --> 00:44.430
Now.

00:44.430 --> 00:49.830
IntelliJ also has a spring initialized plugin that you can feel free to look into, but between the

00:49.830 --> 00:51.750
two, I prefer the websites.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.420
As of this recording, the stable version of Spring Boot is 2.6.7.

00:57.870 --> 01:01.440
The versions will be different depending on when you're watching this video.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.930
Just make sure to choose a stable version.

01:04.170 --> 01:07.710
In other words, a version that doesn't precede parentheses.

01:12.140 --> 01:17.210
And the group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

01:19.950 --> 01:23.460
Your group ID should be a fully qualified domain name.

01:23.730 --> 01:30.600
It should include a domain extension like dot com, dot org dot net, followed by the name of the organization.

01:36.100 --> 01:42.580
For this tutorial, I'm going to create a group ID of comm dot l tp four learn the part.

01:43.510 --> 01:46.660
The artifact ID determines the name of your application.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.710
I'm going to call the application.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.080
Hello, Spring.

01:54.130 --> 01:57.460
We will stick with the default jar packaging type.

01:57.580 --> 02:01.060
We're going to discuss packaging in more detail in an upcoming workbook.

02:04.570 --> 02:10.480
I have Java 11 installed, so make sure to choose a Java version that matches the one you have installed.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.780
Dependency is software that your application depends on.

02:13.810 --> 02:16.900
We will discuss dependencies in more detail soon enough.

02:17.720 --> 02:22.820
For now, you don't need to add any dependencies, so simply generate your project.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.850
And it's going to generate into your downloads folder.

02:30.810 --> 02:33.570
I'm going to extract the contents of my zip file.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.180
And move it to desktop.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.420
You can move it to the folder of your choice.

02:41.430 --> 02:42.660
It doesn't really matter.

02:43.940 --> 02:45.470
Now I'm going to go to IntelliJ.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.670
Click on file.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.790
And I will open.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.510
The Halo Spring Project.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.180
To recap, you created a spring boot project using the spring and nebulizer.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.190
Recall that group ID identifies the organization creating the project.

03:14.430 --> 03:18.120
It should be a fully qualified domain name that's completely lowercase.

03:18.300 --> 03:23.910
Artifact ID is the name of your application, and every word that follows is joined by a hyphen.

03:24.360 --> 03:30.510
Always choose jar as the file type to package your application, and a dependency is software that your

03:30.510 --> 03:32.070
application depends on.
