Welcome to Workbook 1.1.

00:02.640 --> 00:08.490
In this workbook, you're going to send a request to Google and Google is going to send back a response

00:08.490 --> 00:09.810
in the form of a web page.

00:09.990 --> 00:14.340
But in this case, you're not going to just write Google.com as you normally would.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.160
You're actually going to write the full IP address with the port.

00:17.370 --> 00:18.390
Hope you're excited.

00:18.390 --> 00:23.940
The link for the workbook is inside the resources folder, which will take you to learn the part C in

00:23.940 --> 00:24.810
the next lecture.
