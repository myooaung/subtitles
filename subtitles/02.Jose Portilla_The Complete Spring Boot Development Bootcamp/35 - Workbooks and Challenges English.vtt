00:00.330 --> 00:03.210
This course includes workbooks and challenges.

00:05.570 --> 00:09.650
A workbook is a coding exercise that allows you to practice what you learned.

00:10.480 --> 00:15.400
A challenge is going to be a bit harder than a workbook because it will encourage you to think outside

00:15.400 --> 00:17.860
the box and do some of your own research.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.740
So I'll have you start by downloading the course resources from GitHub.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.090
Click the link in the resources folder.

00:24.100 --> 00:28.540
The resources folder is an icon that you'll find next to the lecture title.

00:34.610 --> 00:35.330
All right.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.110
When you're done.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.830
GitHub is a place where you can download code or even post your own.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.340
I posted all of the resources for this course on GitHub.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.890
You simply have to click on this big green button, download the zip file and it should download the

00:48.890 --> 00:50.510
resources for this course.

00:51.990 --> 00:54.870
Once you download the resources, go to it.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.900
If you're using a mac, unzip the resources into a folder by just pressing open.

01:01.380 --> 01:06.210
If you're using a Windows computer, then you would have to extract the contents of your zip into a

01:06.210 --> 01:06.810
folder.

01:08.010 --> 01:13.050
Once you open the folder, you will see workbooks and challenges organized based on the section that

01:13.050 --> 01:13.950
they belong to.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.140
It's worth noting that not every single section is going to have workbooks and challenges.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.750
For example, the testing section will not.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.480
And another thing I want to point out is that these are not all of the sections for this course.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.940
It's just that as of this recording, we have only released the first six sections, but there will

01:32.940 --> 01:40.680
be more sections where we build a rest API, a section for SQL, no SQL, GraphQL, etc..

01:42.600 --> 01:48.030
And one last thing is that if you're ever stuck, every single workbook comes with a solution.

01:48.540 --> 01:53.790
Feel free to look at the solution to try to see where you went wrong and then try to solve the exercise

01:53.790 --> 01:54.540
on your own.

01:54.990 --> 01:55.710
That's all.

01:55.710 --> 01:59.310
Workbook 1.1 is coming up, so I wish you the best of luck.
