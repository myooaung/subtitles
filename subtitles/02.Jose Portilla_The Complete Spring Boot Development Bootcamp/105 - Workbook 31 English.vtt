Welcome to Workbook 3.1.

00:02.700 --> 00:05.620
This one is going to be a little bit longer, so I hope you're ready.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.910
You're going to create a new project with the following dependencies.

00:09.060 --> 00:15.720
And the purpose of this workbook is to set up a form that allows users to sign up for their favorite

00:15.720 --> 00:18.750
social site, which we're going to call a Java gram.

00:18.930 --> 00:24.150
As the users submit their information, you're going to pass it in as a request.

00:24.790 --> 00:31.820
And if the user happens to input any invalid or garbage data, you're going to display an error.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.440
As always, the links are in the resources at Learn the part.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.540
Good luck and I'll see you at the next lecture.
