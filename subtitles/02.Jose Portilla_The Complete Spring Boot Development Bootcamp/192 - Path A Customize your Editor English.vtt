It's worth investing a little bit of time customizing your editor.

00:04.610 --> 00:07.160
First I will show you how to adjust the color theme.

00:07.700 --> 00:12.230
So go to your VS Code Editor and if you don't have it open, just pause the video and do that.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.860
And then on Mac, go to code.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.020
Preferences and colour theme.

00:21.330 --> 00:21.900
On Windows.

00:21.900 --> 00:22.920
It's the exact same thing.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.900
But you would go to the file menu instead.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.420
And then you can cycle through the colour themes and choose the one that you like.

00:34.570 --> 00:37.220
And this would make sense if you could see the code.

00:37.240 --> 00:41.350
So I'm going to create some space and that way you can see the changes in each theme.

00:42.990 --> 00:48.240
And as I cycle through the default themes, to be honest, none of them really appeal to me.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.790
The one that I like to use is called Brackets Dark, but it's not available when you first install the

00:54.940 --> 00:57.220
code, which means we have to go to the marketplace.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.630
And there we can install it as an extension.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.220
So here I'm looking for brackets.

01:04.220 --> 01:06.170
Dark pro, but that doesn't exist anymore.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.220
Look up brackets.

01:07.220 --> 01:08.050
Dark instead.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.080
It's the same thing.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.600
And in my opinion, brackets dark is the best color thing we can use.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.580
So we're going to click on it and install.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.630
Once you install it, you can set the colour theme.

01:22.380 --> 01:26.430
And if you were to go back to your preferences, notice that now we can see it there.

01:29.770 --> 01:31.510
All right, let's see how it affects our code.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.890
And I think this looks pretty nice.

01:38.070 --> 01:42.000
I like this theme because it's easy on the eyes and it doesn't use up too much color.

01:43.450 --> 01:48.400
And the contrast between orange and blue is very good for those that have color vision deficiencies.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.520
This is by far the best color thing that I've used.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.470
But if you want a list of other cool themes, I left you a link in the resources folder.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.070
The only other thing you can really play with is the font size.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.030
So once again, you would go to code.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.460
Preferences.

02:09.030 --> 02:13.200
And for Windows once again, go to the file menu instead, then click on preferences.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.690
But in any case, preferences and settings.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.450
And here you can adjust the font size.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.900
A good font size is typically between 14 and 20.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.350
It depends on your eyesight and the size of your screen.

02:25.350 --> 02:31.230
So I suggest just play around with it and keep doing so until you find a size that works for you.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.440
I use a font size of 20.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.610
All right, that's all.

02:41.610 --> 02:45.540
I hope you took the time to change your color theme as well as the font size.
