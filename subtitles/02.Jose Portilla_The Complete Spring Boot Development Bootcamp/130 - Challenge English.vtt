Welcome to this challenge.

00:01.650 --> 00:07.080
And this one you're going to loosely couple your code and application by using beans.

00:07.080 --> 00:10.260
We give you three options that you can configure beans with.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.390
Please choose your preferred option.

00:12.390 --> 00:17.580
This challenge is going to get you to think outside the box because wire doesn't actually need to be

00:17.580 --> 00:20.700
applied to fields, it can be applied to constructors.

00:20.970 --> 00:24.210
The instructions are linked for you in the resources at learn the part.

00:24.210 --> 00:25.470
See at the next lecture.
