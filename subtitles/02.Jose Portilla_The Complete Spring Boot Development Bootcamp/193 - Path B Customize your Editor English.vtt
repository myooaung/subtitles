The only two things I consider worth customizing are the terminal font size, as well as the ability

00:06.000 --> 00:08.880
to scroll in and out in order to zoom in.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.560
So if you're using windows, go to file than settings.

00:12.570 --> 00:17.010
I'm using a mac, so I'll go to IntelliJ, followed by preferences.

00:17.550 --> 00:22.260
And the first thing you want to check is change font size with command mouse wheel.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.870
If you're using windows, it may be this might say something else, but anyways, select the option

00:27.870 --> 00:34.410
under mouse control so that you can zoom in and out of your file and going back.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.220
The next thing you want to adjust is the font.

00:37.230 --> 00:40.440
So right now my terminal has a font size of 25.

00:41.130 --> 00:47.010
If you're starting off your default, font size should be something like 14 or 12, which I think is

00:47.010 --> 00:47.820
too small.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.070
So choose a size that works for you.

00:51.090 --> 00:52.680
I'm going to go with 17.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.950
I think that's the perfect size.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.730
One more thing you can adjust is the appearance of your editor.

01:01.450 --> 01:04.040
I like to use Mac OS lite.

01:04.060 --> 01:09.160
If you want to use another color theme, by all means, feel free to experiment with them.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.410
Here you can see I have the material UI themes, which is something you have to install.

01:14.410 --> 01:18.280
So if you want access to more cool themes, go on, get more themes.

01:18.850 --> 01:25.810
If you want material UI themes specifically go on material UI and install it accordingly.

01:25.810 --> 01:33.000
But if you were to go back to get more themes, you can scroll through each one and look at the preview,

01:33.040 --> 01:35.110
see which one you like and install.

01:35.650 --> 01:37.750
Anyways, I don't really care too much about themes.

01:37.750 --> 01:44.290
Just make sure you just make sure you enable changing the font size using your mouse and you give your

01:44.290 --> 01:46.270
terminal a nice big font.
