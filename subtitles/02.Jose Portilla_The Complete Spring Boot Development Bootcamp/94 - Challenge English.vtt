Welcome to the challenge portion of this section.

00:03.180 --> 00:05.940
Please follow the path shown here in your course.

00:05.940 --> 00:08.580
Resources to get to the starter project.

00:13.280 --> 00:20.830
In this challenge, the user can submit an item and it can be a category like furniture or technology.

00:20.840 --> 00:28.160
For example, a couch for $300, and we can give them a $50 discount and maybe they have an order date

00:28.160 --> 00:30.710
sometime in the past, like the 6th of April.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.490
If you successfully submit that item, a banner will show up.

00:34.490 --> 00:37.310
That said, you successfully submitted the item.

00:37.670 --> 00:43.280
This is not something you've learned before, because if I were to just display the inventory, the

00:43.280 --> 00:44.570
banner will disappear.

00:44.930 --> 00:52.250
This banner only appears after a successful submission of the form, which means you're going to learn

00:52.250 --> 00:55.490
about a new concept known as flash attributes.

00:55.520 --> 01:00.860
Remember, the challenges are designed to be specifically harder than the workbooks, which means you

01:00.860 --> 01:04.100
need to think outside the box and research a little bit on your own.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.600
The relevant links can be found at the resources at learn the part.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.280
We'll see you at the next lecture.
