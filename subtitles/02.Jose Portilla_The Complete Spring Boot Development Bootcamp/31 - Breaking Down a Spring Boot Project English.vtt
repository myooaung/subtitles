00:00.470 --> 00:03.470
There are many different parts to a spring boot project.

00:05.220 --> 00:10.830
Spring Boot projects have an area for source code resources and application tests.

00:15.180 --> 00:19.440
In this lesson, you will break down the different parts of a spring boot project.

00:23.030 --> 00:29.600
So the first section is the main Java section and it contains the source code for your project.

00:31.780 --> 00:37.390
This section of your project contains three subfolders that match the group ID and the artifact ID.

00:41.310 --> 00:42.900
And inside there's an application.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.070
Java file.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.580
This file is the entry point of your spring boot application.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.170
You need to code all of your applications logic inside this section of your project.

00:57.930 --> 01:02.820
The next section is the resources section, which, as the name implies, contains the application's

01:02.820 --> 01:03.900
resources.

01:06.970 --> 01:13.690
The resources include a static folder that contains static web content such as images, CSS files,

01:13.690 --> 01:16.510
and sometimes static HTML files.

01:18.770 --> 01:24.590
A Templates folder that contains dynamic web content such as HTML templates.

01:27.480 --> 01:32.880
And an application, not properties file a file that configures the settings for your application.

01:37.390 --> 01:42.910
The final section is test slash Java and it contains all of your applications tests.

01:45.010 --> 01:49.780
Once again, it contains three subfolders that match the group ID and the artifact ID.

01:54.610 --> 01:56.110
And inside there is a file.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.760
Recontest your application.

01:58.150 --> 02:02.500
In the future, you're going to write all of your tests inside this part of your project.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.990
So to recap, you broke down the different parts of a spring boot project.

02:11.530 --> 02:15.220
Main slash Java contains the source code for your project.

02:15.250 --> 02:18.460
Main slash resources contains the resources.

02:19.260 --> 02:22.740
And Test slash Java contains all of your tests.
