WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:01.860
Welcome to Workbook 1.2.

00:01.860 --> 00:05.010
And this one you will create a simple web app using Spring Boot.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.620
Your first task was to launch the spring initialization, which I already have done, and here it tells

00:10.620 --> 00:14.220
you to create a group ID artifact ID dependencies.

00:14.250 --> 00:19.350
It doesn't say what the group ID or artifact ID need to be so you can just get creative.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.420
I will go to start spring IO.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.100
We'll create a Maven project using Java.

00:26.130 --> 00:32.100
The stable version as of this recording or the latest stable version I should say, is 2.7.0.

00:32.130 --> 00:35.910
You can feel free to choose whatever stable version pops up for you.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.630
Group id I will say come learn the part.

00:39.630 --> 00:40.920
Artifact ID.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.960
I'm just going to call this.

00:45.440 --> 00:45.840
Noah.

00:45.890 --> 00:47.420
Let's just call it workbook.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.130
I'm not that creative.

00:49.820 --> 00:51.770
The packaging type will be jar.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.490
Choose a Java version that matches the one you have installed.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.690
This is really important.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.230
I'm using Java 11.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.650
Do we need to add any dependencies?

01:01.970 --> 01:07.280
Add the spring web dependency because we would need that to set up a web application.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.290
Spring web.

01:10.230 --> 01:10.890
All right.

01:10.890 --> 01:14.580
I will generate this project inside of my downloads folder.

01:16.590 --> 01:18.150
Will Click Show End Finder.

01:18.150 --> 01:22.680
If you're using Windows, it will say Show and File Explorer or something like that.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.900
Then I will unzip this package and open it in IntelliJ.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.010
We'll say file open.

01:36.250 --> 01:39.010
I'll go to workbook and open it.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.630
Trust project.

01:44.220 --> 01:44.880
Okay.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.060
We'll give it time to load.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.600
Importing Maven project.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.040
All right, I think we're good.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.000
Let's move on to the next task.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.410
And it tells us that our application must respond to requests made on Port 99.

02:07.770 --> 02:15.150
This is something we can configure in our application properties, so I'll go to my properties.

02:16.610 --> 02:21.740
And I'll say server dot port is equal to 1990.

02:23.180 --> 02:27.170
The static folder contains static HTML images or CSS files.

02:27.200 --> 02:32.090
We're going to add an HTML file to the static folder that renders the following view.

02:32.510 --> 02:35.960
So here I will create a new.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.310
HTML file.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.140
Call it index.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.880
It already generates an HTML template.

02:44.890 --> 02:48.450
Let's just call the HTML document workbook.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.510
Doesn't really matter.

02:49.630 --> 02:56.350
And if you had a look at the HTML cheat sheet, you would know that we can use the h one element to

02:56.350 --> 02:57.460
create a header.

02:57.490 --> 03:00.130
The headers are going to be the following.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.260
Printing is fun.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.930
Let me just copy and paste this four times.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.630
Here we'll say Java is better than Python.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.600
I spilled java all over my paper.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.540
My dog ate my java.

03:16.340 --> 03:17.210
Splendid.

03:18.520 --> 03:19.050
Okay.

03:19.060 --> 03:22.180
I'll go ahead and spin up a new terminal.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.230
Page going here may have clean spring boot to run.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.630
I'll have to make a request on local host 1990.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.450
That's where our application is listening.

03:45.380 --> 03:45.980
All right.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.650
We made a request on local host 1990.

03:48.770 --> 03:56.210
Our server is listening on that port, and upon receiving this request, it responds with HTML.

03:56.240 --> 04:01.070
This HTML populates the browsers web page with headers.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.210
That's all for workbook 1.2.

04:03.230 --> 04:04.880
I will see you in the next one.
