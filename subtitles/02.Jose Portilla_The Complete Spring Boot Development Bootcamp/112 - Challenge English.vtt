Welcome back to this challenge portion of the section.

00:02.970 --> 00:06.870
Please open the starter project by checking out the path shown here.

00:11.890 --> 00:18.100
If you were able to successfully complete the Java Gram workbooks from earlier, this challenge should

00:18.100 --> 00:19.090
be a breeze.

00:19.300 --> 00:25.630
You can see here we have a form where a user can choose a category name, choose a discount or price.

00:25.630 --> 00:30.810
And what we want to do is actually have error alerts show up for validations.

00:30.820 --> 00:35.680
Essentially, if the date happens to be in the future, if the discount is greater than the price,

00:35.680 --> 00:37.670
you'll display these error messages.

00:37.690 --> 00:41.920
As always, the instructions are learn the part, click the link in the resources and we'll see you

00:41.920 --> 00:42.820
in the next lecture.
