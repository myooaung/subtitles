00:00.360 --> 00:04.050
The Spring boot devtools dependency accelerates development time.

00:06.300 --> 00:11.130
I like to use the MAVEN Clean Command at least once to start from a fresh build.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.860
And then I rely on the spring boot devtools dependency to auto restart the application every time I

00:17.860 --> 00:19.090
make a new change.

00:21.610 --> 00:25.030
So in this lesson we will add the spring boot devtools dependency.

00:27.340 --> 00:32.650
Spring Boot DevTools instruments your application to pick up new changes and restart.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.680
So what we're going to do is Google Spring Boot Def Tools.

00:42.290 --> 00:45.860
And we will go to the.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.660
No, let's be more specific.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.670
We'll say central maven repo.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.810
Go to the Central Maven repository.

00:56.070 --> 01:01.200
I will choose version 2.6.7 in accordance with my spring boot project.

01:03.410 --> 01:04.520
Click that.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.290
Now here.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.480
I can add the dependency.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.070
Now I can actually remove the version number.

01:19.180 --> 01:24.790
That being said, the version for Spring Boot starters will be 2.6.7 by default.

01:25.030 --> 01:30.460
And what this dependency will do is provide all of the files needed to instrument your application to

01:30.460 --> 01:33.010
always restart when you make a new change.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.330
So let's try it out.

01:36.090 --> 01:38.490
I'll start off with a clean build maven.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.350
Clean spring boots run.

01:50.790 --> 01:51.290
All right.

01:51.290 --> 01:57.290
This time I actually have my Tomcat server running on Port 8080, so I'll go ahead and make a request

01:57.290 --> 01:57.800
there.

01:57.830 --> 01:59.630
Local host, 8080.

02:01.610 --> 02:02.130
Spring.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.160
All right.

02:03.170 --> 02:09.020
And now if you focus on my terminal, if I ever make a change in the back end for now, I'll just add

02:09.020 --> 02:10.160
a print statement.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.350
Notice that it auto restarts.

02:17.350 --> 02:21.880
That's pretty cool, but we don't need to make any changes in the back end right now.

02:21.880 --> 02:27.370
We'll go right into The View and I'll add another header that says.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.540
How are you?

02:32.350 --> 02:37.650
And now I don't have to restart the application because when we make a request on local hosts 80 to

02:37.650 --> 02:40.480
80, it's going to return the updated view.

02:42.100 --> 02:42.880
Beautiful.

02:45.850 --> 02:52.420
So to recap, you added the devtools dependency that picks up new changes and restart your application.

02:53.770 --> 02:54.550
Every now and then.

02:54.550 --> 03:00.100
I like to start off with a fresh build using Maven clean spring boot to run and then I let DevTools

03:00.100 --> 03:01.330
take care of the rest.
