00:00.360 --> 00:03.720
Another type of family expression is the link expression.

00:06.230 --> 00:09.890
A variable expression executes on a model attribute in some way.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.510
After binding an object, a selection expression can select one of its fields.

00:21.730 --> 00:27.070
And a link expression specifies a URL endpoint or a path to a resource.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.960
In this lesson, you will use a link expression.

00:35.690 --> 00:38.450
The stylesheet is going to contain all of your CSS.

00:41.620 --> 00:48.280
The stylesheet contains all of your CSS code and as we slowly start templating using, finally the CSS

00:48.280 --> 00:49.990
code really stands in the way.

00:50.440 --> 00:56.290
The purpose of CSS is to style your web page, but as backend developers, we don't really care about

00:56.290 --> 00:58.750
styling font sizes or colors.

00:58.780 --> 01:02.500
CSS falls within the realm of a front end developer's job.

01:03.050 --> 01:09.440
And if you recall, the static folder is a folder that contains static web content such as images,

01:09.440 --> 01:13.480
logos, and in this case it's going to contain some CSS files.

01:13.490 --> 01:18.830
So inside static, what we're going to do is create two style sheets, one for the grades page that

01:18.830 --> 01:23.090
I'm going to call grades style sheet, dot CSS.

01:24.100 --> 01:30.130
And I will create another stylesheet for the form form stylesheet dot CSS.

01:31.610 --> 01:38.030
And now what I can do is remove all of the CSS code from the forum page.

01:42.930 --> 01:48.690
I can remove the following element and paste it inside a form stylesheet.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.930
And I will do the same thing for the grades.

01:52.350 --> 01:52.830
HTML.

01:52.890 --> 01:53.880
CSS.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.200
Remove all of this.

01:58.110 --> 01:59.820
Remove the style element.

02:01.590 --> 02:04.530
And place it inside of grade style sheet.

02:07.130 --> 02:11.420
Now, if I were to actually run the application, I don't know why I stopped it.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.180
If you view the app.

02:31.750 --> 02:35.230
An application looks pretty ugly without any success.

02:35.620 --> 02:43.280
So what we need to do is, quote unquote link each timely template to its respective stylesheet.

02:43.300 --> 02:49.480
And if you were to take a look at the HTML cheat sheet, I will scroll to the link tag.

02:49.510 --> 02:57.550
What this does is it links the current document to an external resource and the belief a ref attribute

02:57.550 --> 02:59.690
when used inside of a link element.

02:59.710 --> 03:07.570
What it's going to do is look inside the static folder for an external resource and it uses a link expression

03:07.570 --> 03:14.590
to specify a path to that resource, and REL specifies a relationship between the document and the external

03:14.590 --> 03:15.320
resource.

03:15.340 --> 03:18.400
In this case, the relationship is going to be stylesheet.

03:20.490 --> 03:25.110
So what I'm going to do is in accordance with the.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.640
A cheat sheet, I'll create a link element.

03:33.540 --> 03:41.190
We will use the final leaf attribute h ref and we're going to set it equal to a link expression, which

03:41.190 --> 03:43.650
is an add symbol followed by brackets.

03:43.650 --> 03:49.350
And here you would specify usually either a URL endpoint or a path to a resource.

03:49.380 --> 03:53.470
Given this context, we're specifying a path to a resource.

03:53.490 --> 03:57.030
The path is going to automatically start at static.

03:57.030 --> 04:03.120
So we can just say here, grades, stylesheet, CSS.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.510
And now if I were to refresh.

04:11.140 --> 04:16.720
Oh, I forgot to specify their relationship, which is stylesheet.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.580
This was also in our cheat sheet.

04:19.580 --> 04:21.350
So now if I were to go back.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.690
And beautiful.

04:23.690 --> 04:28.100
It successfully applies CSS styling to our HTML web page.

04:28.280 --> 04:34.430
We don't have a handler method set up for the form web page just yet, but that's not stopping us from

04:34.430 --> 04:36.770
just taking care of that right now for later.

04:36.950 --> 04:44.060
So we will link this HTML document to the form stylesheet using our link expression.

04:44.570 --> 04:45.410
Nice.

04:45.440 --> 04:53.090
Now you'll notice the link expression no matter what it specifies a URL endpoint or a path, and that's

04:53.090 --> 04:55.400
totally dependent on how you're using it.

04:55.400 --> 05:01.790
So if it's used in tandem with a final leaf action attribute, then it's going to be a URL endpoint.

05:01.820 --> 05:07.400
Just for example, if it's used inside of an anchor tag, then it's also going to be a URL endpoint.

05:07.430 --> 05:12.710
In this case, we're specifying a path, so it really just depends on the context.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.600
To recap, you linked each HTML template to a stylesheet.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.600
You have now looked at three types of family expressions.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.720
There is the variable expression which executes on your model attribute in some way the selection expression,

05:29.720 --> 05:34.070
which works in the sense that after binding an object, you can select one of its fields.

05:34.070 --> 05:41.320
And the link expression is a an expression that specifies a URL, end point or a path to a resource.

05:41.330 --> 05:42.260
That's really it.
