00:00.580 --> 00:03.340
In this video, you will launch the starter project.

00:05.360 --> 00:10.790
I'm assuming you downloaded the course resources and if not, please go back to the workbooks and challenges

00:10.790 --> 00:11.390
video.

00:12.050 --> 00:17.510
In any case, follow this path in your course resources and launch the great submission app inside the

00:17.510 --> 00:18.500
starter folder.

00:23.950 --> 00:24.580
All right.

00:24.580 --> 00:30.850
Once you launch it, go to the PubMed XML file and here you'll notice that I added the Def Tools dependency.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.890
Def Tools was covered in your first challenge because it instruments your app to auto restart every

00:35.890 --> 00:37.180
time you make changes.

00:37.390 --> 00:41.980
At first, I'm always going to use Maven Clean Spring Boot to run to clean the target folder and start

00:41.980 --> 00:45.760
fresh, and then I'll be using Def tools to accelerate the process.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.480
All right.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.300
You'll notice that I also added the time leaf dependency.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.680
Don't worry too much about it.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.220
For now.

00:51.220 --> 00:57.340
All I can say is we need time leaf in order to work with HTML templates.

00:57.640 --> 01:05.170
A template is dynamic html whose UI changes based on the data that you provide, but we'll get to that

01:05.170 --> 01:05.800
later.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.380
That's all for now.

01:07.390 --> 01:10.510
This is the start of a project that we're going to start coding on.
