00:00.120 --> 00:02.670
Welcome to another breakpoint session.

00:02.670 --> 00:09.600
And this one, we're going to trace the runtime and see how our custom constraint annotation is validating

00:09.600 --> 00:10.620
the score field.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.340
So the first thing we're going to do is apply some breakpoints.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.670
I will apply them all over our handler method.

00:18.030 --> 00:22.590
I will apply breakpoints inside of as valid.

00:24.320 --> 00:32.660
I'm going to apply breakpoints here as well inside of our constructor, our setters.

00:36.150 --> 00:39.180
And now we're ready to run the application and debug mode.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.280
All right.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.390
Our Tomcat server.

00:46.390 --> 00:47.980
I started on Port 88.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.210
Let's go there.

00:50.270 --> 00:53.510
And for now, I'll disable the breakpoints.

00:53.510 --> 00:55.760
We don't need to trace the runtime right now.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.140
Press continue.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.740
All right, I reform has loaded.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.870
I'll re-enable the breakpoints.

01:03.260 --> 01:07.130
Now I will submit a valid name, a valid subject.

01:07.130 --> 01:10.550
The only focus is to submit an invalid score.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.400
So let's say our plus, we'll submit that.

01:14.350 --> 01:18.010
And as always, submit form receives the request.

01:18.010 --> 01:22.030
First thing it does is it creates a new grade object.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.140
Um.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.990
And as always, spring is smart enough to use your sweaters to populate every field in this object where

01:31.990 --> 01:34.270
the values from the post request.

01:38.810 --> 01:39.290
All right.

01:39.290 --> 01:45.230
And after updating our grade object with values from the post request, the validation process starts.

01:46.380 --> 01:52.440
And here you can see that spring boot is leveraging our is valid function in order to check if the score

01:52.440 --> 01:55.350
value of this grade object is valid.

01:55.350 --> 01:58.830
So this for loop is going to run and it will never return.

01:58.830 --> 02:04.620
True, because our value is not equal to any of the scores inside of the scores list.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.720
It's not a valid letter grade.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.570
So this function is eventually going to return false when is valid returns false.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.690
That means the score field is invalid.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.760
So binding result carries the result of this validation.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.170
There is one error.

02:27.710 --> 02:30.380
The error applies to the field score.

02:30.410 --> 02:36.740
The rejected value was R plus and the default message is that the score must be a letter grade.

02:37.880 --> 02:45.020
So right as we return the form template file, Leif is able to access all of this data and here we're

02:45.020 --> 02:50.780
accessing the error that's associated with the score of the grade object.

02:50.780 --> 02:53.150
And it's going to display this error message.

02:53.150 --> 02:55.210
Score must be a letter grade.

02:55.220 --> 02:57.110
So if I press continue.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.860
It does just that.
