00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
so a couple things to keep in mind.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.750
First of all,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.870
after a while,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.720
you'll notice that Syrian waster and methods and certain choices that you make in language

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.000
learning work way better than other ones.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.110
Now,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.380
this could mean that maybe listening to a podcast works a lot better than something else.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.630
Or it could also mean that listening to a podcast while you're running works a lot better

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300
than listening to a podcast while you're cleaning the dishes.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.650
Say,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.410
anyway,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.340
try to figure out which ways work best for you and which ways help you the most in learning

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.940
these language.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.690
And make sure that you stick to these.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.940
Make sure that these are the methods that you use and see if you can keep using these

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.320
methods for any other aspect.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.160
So if while you're running,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.000
it really helps to listen to podcasts,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.910
see if you can do anything else while you're running.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.000
Maybe listen to some lessons or something along those lines.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.600
Now,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.940
if these results in a gap of knowledge,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.960
try to see if you can adapt this method once again.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
Maybe all the podcasts you listen to a really great but all the flash cards aren't helping

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.010
,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.070
and this means that you'll be really good at listening to stuff,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.310
but not so good at writing stuff down or necessarily speaking or something like that.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.350
So try to see if you can adapt these methods to something else.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.860
For example,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920
if you find that every time you talk to others and you have,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.170
ah,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.130
language exchange,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.230
it really helps you a lot.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.720
But every time you use flash cards,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.910
it doesn't help you at all.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.270
Well,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600
maybe try to change it up a bit,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.750
and maybe you can discuss writing flashcards with someone else.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.140
You can bring your flashcards to these discussions and see if there's any way you can find

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.980
a way to combine these two.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.500
So try to adapt whatever method works to whatever you need to learn,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.450
but regardless,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.760
better knowledge of one component leads to better knowledge of others.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.590
So if you become better at speaking and more more comfortable speaking,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.390
this will eventually also help you with the other aspects,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.380
like reading and writing.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.310
Also keep in mind that language learning isn't always steady progress.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.600
In fact,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.400
it's hardly ever stated steady progress.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.650
It goes in steps so you'll start learning the language and by virtue of the fact that you

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.320
start from zero right away,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.170
you'll start seeing some progress and you feel like you're getting better.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.520
And then you'll feel a plateau after a while,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510
and then later we'll see basically another jump and you'll start getting better all of a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.410
sudden very quickly,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.530
and then we'll plateau.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.130
In fact,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.300
sometimes you'll even feel like it's regressing,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.450
and it's getting a bit worse,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.180
even though you're studying as much as he can.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.930
Now.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.650
For some reason,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.960
language learning is like this,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.570
and many times it seems like you're not making progress or you're hardly making any at all

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.570
.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.490
It helps if you can try to quantify the progress you're making,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.390
but that's hardly ever possible with language learning.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.040
So just keep this in mind while you're learning your language that sometimes it can be

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.150
really frustrating.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.860
But once you get past the frustrating level,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.090
then you'll see a huge jump and you'll be able to progress all of a sudden,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.890
and hopefully this will keep you motivated to keep you going
