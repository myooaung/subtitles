00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.095
Now another method to practice writing is actually translation.

00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:06.240
And in order to do this is quite simple.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.160
What you should do is you should pick up a book,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.990
an article, or a magazine, or whatever it might be.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.570
This'll depend obviously on your skill level.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.880
And just pick up something that you wish to translate and have your go at translating it.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.535
Now, I should mention a couple of things.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.860
First of all, if you're a beginner,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.620
you should probably translate into your source language.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.280
What does this mean?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.950
This means if you're just starting out to learn Chinese,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.070
take a Chinese texts and try translating it into your native tongue stays English.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.590
Because otherwise, you'll sort of just

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.900
make a mess of it and you want to make sure you understand.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.665
And if you have issues with understanding,

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:45.020
then you're just starting out then tried to translate

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.280
into your source language from whatever language you're learning.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.615
If however, you are past the beginner intermediate, anything.

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:55.445
In fact, even advanced beginner,

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:57.590
I think you should translate into

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.095
the target language because this gives you real practice.

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:03.349
And for any of you who are out there who are professional translators,

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:05.420
you might sort of cringe at this because you're always supposed to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.790
translate into your source language if you're a translator.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.999
However, at least for ridden translations, however,

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.660
for practice, I think it's very good to translate into your target language.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.390
So if you are once again learning Chinese,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.160
but you're pretty advanced and you know how to say things,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.435
you know how to communicate.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:28.640
Then I suggest reading something in English and translating it into your target language,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.160
and then seeing how that goes.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.970
Now, of course you need to, you might want to,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.060
let's say usually you can tell by enlarge or you can ask someone,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.765
but you might want to check to see how good your translation actually is.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.210
In that case, you should pick a book like

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.860
a famous book that has been translated many times before and maybe that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.190
is available on Wikimedia comments or it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.790
just available in the public domain and that you can find a translation for.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.889
Otherwise, you'd find an article or magazine.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.880
Very often you can find articles or websites that are available in both languages.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.640
And so there you can just have your go at it and just find

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.269
any website that is available in both languages.

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.165
And then you can just start translating there and then later check

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:15.420
the translated website and see how yours compares to theirs.
