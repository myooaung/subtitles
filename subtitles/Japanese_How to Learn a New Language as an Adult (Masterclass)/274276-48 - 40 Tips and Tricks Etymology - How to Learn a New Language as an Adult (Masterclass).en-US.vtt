00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
so another tip that I like and I I personally like it.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.660
I'm not sure if other people will,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.180
but I thought I should mention it anyway.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.940
Is Entomology now?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.950
Entomology just means the origin of the word.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.660
And so if a certain word it said a certain way,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.200
it just means where its roots ours.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.900
For instance,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.470
in English,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.010
we have a lot of words that have Germanic roots.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.090
We also have a lot of words.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.860
Have Latin roots or Greek roots,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.250
etcetera,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.790
etcetera.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.280
So Entomology is just a study of this.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.550
Now.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
This might seem to go a bit too much in detail for many people who are just interested in

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.790
speaking language,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.710
and that might be the case.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.610
I find it very useful for vocab that I cannot remember because if I look at the Entomology

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.610
,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.250
then it allows me to see how that word came into being,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.890
if you will.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.030
So this has been very useful for learning Chinese for obvious reasons,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.830
because there you learn characters,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.600
and so you want to learn how the characters came to be and why they are drawn in a certain

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.950
way.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.800
But it could be useful in any other language that you learn because every language has its

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.290
own Entomology because it has its own history and it has its own roots.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.570
And many times it might share the roots of your language or a language you already know or

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.580
language that similar.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.500
And it might be surprising.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.060
Or either way,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.980
it could be quite interesting.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.500
Obviously,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460
you can't look up the etymology of every single word you learn.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.930
But every now and then it could be interesting to look up,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
and it can be helpful for problem words or words that don't stick.
