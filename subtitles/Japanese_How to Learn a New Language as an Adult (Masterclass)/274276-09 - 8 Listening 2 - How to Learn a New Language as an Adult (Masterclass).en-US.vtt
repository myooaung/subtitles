00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
listening is often quite hard for adults,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.240
and I mentioned this briefly before a swell.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.510
But it's because it's one of the last components we usually concentrate on.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.600
When you're a child,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.730
you start learning a new language.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.550
Usually start with listening and speaking because you're there on the playground or

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.190
surrounded by other kids and speak the language or other people.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.020
And that's just the way you learn.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.920
And it seems like a much more natural way to learn.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560
However,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.700
adults don't learn this way.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.160
We usually learn by through text through reading and writing,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.400
and because of this,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340
various their various issues,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160
it might seem that we don't learn is quickly.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.790
But things usually stick longer because we learned the grammatical rules and invoke behind

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.950
it.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.850
However,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.770
we might learn all the grammar and Texan vocab that we want.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.080
But then,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.320
when it comes time to speak and to hear people speaking the language at the rial speed that

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.710
they speak it and with their you know,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.760
slang and pronunciation we can use,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.280
we can often find it very hard.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.450
So what you need to do in these cases is try anyway,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.480
when you are listening to people And if you do find it hard,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.650
go for the gist.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.130
Listen for keywords and what I try to do is jot down any new vocab that you hear.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.310
So and again,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.830
very often,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.930
Children will do this too.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.940
They might not understand everything,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.100
even in their native tongue,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.600
that a grown up sets to them if they're speaking at full speed.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.880
But they kind of get the gist,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.830
and you become much better at this as time goes on.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.320
So try to do is go for the gist and listen exactly for the key words that you know the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.190
words that define the phrase and this can mean different things in different languages.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.710
But you kind of get a feel for this as well.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.070
And then what I try to do is every conversation or something like that.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.540
If I hear some new word or new vocab or something like that,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.050
I tried to jot it down so I can remember for next time.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.030
And ah,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.250
at least this helps me slowly,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.690
slowly learn new words that I get to hear in conversation
