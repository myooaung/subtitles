00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
So,

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.330
first of all,

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.220
first things first.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.910
Having pick your new language,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.710
many of you might not have picked your language yet that you want to acquire.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.930
Now,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.700
if you have picked it and you already know which language you want to learn,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.290
then you can skip ahead to the next lesson.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.030
But maybe you haven't.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.160
You're not sure trying to pick between a couple different languages.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.870
And so I just want to touch upon this quickly so that maybe it can help you in making your

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.450
decision.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.260
There are a couple of questions you should ask yourself when you're trying to pick your new

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.480
language or pick the language that you want to learn.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.590
First of all,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.450
who who are you going to be speaking with?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.410
Who are you going to be talking to?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.740
Who are you going to be using this language with?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.350
Try to picture yourself using this language and the type of people that you're going to be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.960
speaking this type of language,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.620
whatever language it might be and with whom you will be talking second of all,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.000
where where will you be when you speak?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.650
This language will be in another country,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.890
will be in a business setting will be at the bar with some friends.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.370
Where you going to be when speaking this other language and when using it,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.570
by the way you might not be speaking at you might actually plan to use it in writing or

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.250
something along those lines as well.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.890
So you can ask yourself these questions from that point of view as well.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500
And the third question is,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.150
what?

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.920
What will you be discussing?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.260
Will you be discussing?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.670
Are you going to be reading something like I mentioned?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.550
Or will you be discussing business topics with clients?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.940
Or will you just be shooting the breeze with friends?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.820
Will you be traveling and asking questions about travel and food and transportation?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.150
What will you be talking about?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.590
And the reason why I say you need to ask yourself these questions who wear what is because

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.950
you want to come to the final question the most important one,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.900
Which is why,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.950
why you want to learn this language,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.120
because this will give you your target or your goal,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.940
your objective for learning a new language.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.000
And of course,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.900
you can ask yourself this for any language you want to learn.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.560
But hopefully,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.890
after asking yourself these questions and arriving at your why or your goal,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.510
then you'll have a clearer idea and hopefully you'll feel a bit more inspired toward one

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.770
language rather than the other.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.170
At this point,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.890
Once you've gone through this exercise,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.680
I mean and you've asked yourself why you've come to your goal.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.650
Hopefully,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.240
you do feel more inspired toward one language and the other,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.660
and that's the languages should be picking,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.010
because whatever language you more inspired to learn is the language you're more likely to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.270
learn.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.380
As I mentioned,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.920
language,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.970
learning cannot be passive.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.920
It has to be active,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.950
It takes effort,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.990
and you're only gonna put that effort in if you're inspired to do so.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.390
So asking yourself these questions can really try to put you in a place and in a setting

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.450
and in a mind frame where you will be using this language and so you can see which one

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.110
inspires him,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.350
or and which one makes you want to learn the language more
