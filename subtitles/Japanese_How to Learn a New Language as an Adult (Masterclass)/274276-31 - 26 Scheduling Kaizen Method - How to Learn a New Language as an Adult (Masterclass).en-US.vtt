00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
So now I'm gonna touch upon the kaizen method or the kaizen process because I found this

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.510
very useful in terms off sitting up a schedule for learning languages.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.470
So if you go to the Wikipedia page,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.710
the for kaizen,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.010
it says kaizen is the Japanese word for improvement and business guys in all from the 1st 2

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.290
activities that continuously improve all functions that involve all employees from the CEO

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.450
to the same land workers.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.820
Now,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.340
obviously,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.560
when you're dealing with languages,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.610
it will be a bit different.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.340
But as you can see,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.370
it's been applied for many different facets of life.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.790
So if we scroll down a bit,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.550
you see small step work improvement approach.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.800
This is how you can apply it to language learning.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.830
This small step that's minuscule.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.430
Step improvement approaches,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.180
and here it goes a bit more into detail.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.500
Instead of encouraging large radical changes to achieve desired goals,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.710
the Mets is recommended that organizations introduce small improvements,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.410
preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.730
So how does this apply to language learning?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.150
Well,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.050
starting small like I mentioned before,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.870
rather than trying to set up the awesome schedule right away,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.520
start with a very small schedule.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.190
If you haven't awesome schedule in mind,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.250
keep it written down somewhere.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.130
But start very small and you congratulate Build up to it because once again,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.790
you're trying to make this your lifestyle,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.310
and you can't change into a whole new lifestyle right away and expect to stick with it to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.570
small changes and build up to them.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.200
An example of this will be toe.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.590
Have one flash card per day and you'll just take one flash card.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.380
Look at it and look at the definition in the meaning and that's it for the day.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.630
And that's what I mean.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.490
You can start ridiculously small,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.470
and you can add on to it as time goes by.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.290
For example,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.590
with the one flash car per day.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.750
If you add one flash card every day,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.810
se over six days.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.070
This turns out to be 21 new words.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.680
Obviously,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.930
I'm talking about you have one flash card the first day.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.440
Then the second day you add another flash card,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
so there you have to.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.390
The third day you add one flash card.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.340
You do this for six days.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.390
That's 21 new words in the first week and that's not too bad.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.730
Then you use the seventh state to review these 21 words and,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.970
uh,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.450
and continue on in this manner.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.940
In fact,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.610
if you keep adding one flash car per day,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.280
at a certain point,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.910
you realise that it will be too many flash cards for day and you'll have to stop.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.660
So it's a good way to start small and gradually build up to it so you don't have to start

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.780
right away with 10 flashcards a day,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
and suddenly you find yourself overwhelmed right in the beginning.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.750
But to start small and gradually build it up,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.620
and this can apply to anything.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.360
The trick is once again just to add a ridiculously small amount at every step.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.760
No matter what your method is,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.900
start very small and then add a ridiculously small amount.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.170
But do this every single time you study and try to do this every single day or every single

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.770
session.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.230
Just add that very small,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.250
minuscule amount,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.550
and before you know it,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.590
you'll actually have quite a packed schedule.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.590
But it'll feel like you're normal daily schedule a lot more than just if you try to change

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.850
your schedule at once,
