00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
another form of listening,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.860
which is very popular,

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.460
is songs,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.010
and I wanted to cover this a bit because songs are great,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.440
first of all,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.170
because they're fun.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.870
Everyone.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.170
Usually when you're studying language,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.750
you can find at least one type of song or one Johner of songs that you like that you enjoy

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.710
in the target language.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.100
And so you know,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.570
it's a great way to be able to learn to listen to the songs in that language.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.650
However,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130
they can be bad because first of all,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.460
songs often are sung in a way that's different from how people speak.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.990
So if you learn a phrase that someone used in a song,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.310
it might not necessarily be the same way people would use it in day to day language also,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.150
Very often,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.670
what ends up happening is you follow the sounds,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.030
but you don't really pay attention to what you're saying toe what the words were saying,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.460
and so you kind of just follow the sounds and maybe you understand every other word or

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.260
something like that.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.120
But you're not paying too much attention and wants to get you get kind of passive because

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850
you're just listening to the song itself.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.820
So just keep these things in mind when you are,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.010
listen to songs or if you look,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.200
if you're using songs to learn a new language again,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.910
What I try to do here is the same as I do with subtitles.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.700
I tried to notice at least one new word per song.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.310
So if I have a new,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.990
catchy song that I'm listening to,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.560
and I realize that I'm just listening to it passively,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.980
I try to listen hard and find one new word that I don't know,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.800
and then I'll jot it down.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.940
I'll look it up something like that.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.670
So at least I'm able to learn some new woke up for every new song that I listened to once

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.100
again.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.260
This is saying that I do with subtitles and TV shows and stuff like that.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.740
It's just,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.180
ah,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.020
something that's simple and easy,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.000
but you can do every time you listen to things so you can learn new vocab At the same time

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.000
,
