00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
so a way to keep it interesting when you're reading also is to change it up.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.930
And there's several ways to do this.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.860
One way is to find textbooks in your target language that teach your native tongue.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.600
So this means,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.180
if you are,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.680
say,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.590
an English speaking,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.730
you're learning Spanish.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.580
Try to find a book that's written for Spanish speakers who are learning English,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.850
and this will be interesting because it will show you a different aspect.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.900
Many of the same sentences will be there,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.250
such as John likes to eat the apple,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.690
but it will be explained in native Spanish while using very little English.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.250
And so it could be an interesting twist to how you learn a language.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.200
And this could be done by finding these books either your local bookstore.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.770
So this could be an interesting way to change it up.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.760
And to make it more interesting when you're learning your language,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.930
another thing you can do is laddering.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.790
Now what laddering is This works for people who speak more than one language already,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.160
and this allows you to use one of your other languages when learning the language you're

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.730
trying to learn.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.240
Right now,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.430
I know that sounds complicated.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.150
But for example,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.960
let's say I speak English and I speak Italian and I'm trying to learn Chinese.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.460
What I can do is try to use my Italian when learning Chinese rather than just using English

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.210
textbooks that teach Chinese.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.080
I could try finding Italian textbooks that teach Chinese,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.440
or I could just decide one day to right Oh my vocab that I learned in Chinese.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.260
I'll write the Italian definition rather than the English definition.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.630
Now this does a couple things.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.190
First of all,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.470
it helps maintain any third language any other language that you've learned in the past

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.910
that you might want to keep in the background.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.710
But also it gives you a new way to look at the language you're learning.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.220
And so,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.030
rather than always equating vocabulary with a certain word in your language,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.660
sommelier,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.010
equating it with a different word in another language.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.570
You speak,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.310
and it helps to give you a new sense of the language,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.080
and chances are it will help you remember the language you're learning a bit more.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.380
However,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.730
you can experiment with this.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.780
This is different for every single person and also obviously depending on the languages you

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.590
already speak.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.550
But it can be a fun way to change it up
