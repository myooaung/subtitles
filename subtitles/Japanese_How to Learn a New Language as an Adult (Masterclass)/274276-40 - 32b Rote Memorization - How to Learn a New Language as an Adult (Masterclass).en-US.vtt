00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
so rote memorization.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.680
Usually when people hear rote memorization,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.000
they grown a little bit inside and in fact,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.900
very often.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.210
Most of the time you find try to find methods where people have to use less rote

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.260
memorization and a lot of language courses,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.780
by the way,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.900
sell very well by saying they don't have any rote memorization and they have other methods

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.900
.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.760
I am actually personally quite a big fan of rote memorization,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.390
and I think,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630
and I understand why people don't like it,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.770
because it sounds very boring and tedious and not fun at all,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.240
especially for kids.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.930
However,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.200
as adults it doesn't have to be that way.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.150
And there are a couple factors that I think play in rote memorization favor.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.060
By the way,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.510
rote memorization in cases and clear it means that you memorize something and you just

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.710
memorize whether it be vocab,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.620
where there be a grammatical rule or anything along those lines,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.170
and you memorize it over time because it's something that needs to be remembered.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.120
So one of the factors in favor of Rome memorization is that,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.330
as I mentioned before,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.920
vocab or words are make up pretty much all of the new language that you learn.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.550
So nine if 90% of a languages vocab,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.580
then vocab is memorized.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.400
But through rote memorization,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.730
it's a great way to memorize it.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.120
Of course,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.710
you can learn it in conversation.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.550
You can learn,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.700
adjust on the fly.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190
You can learn it just,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.570
ah,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.720
by hearing it here and there.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.250
But you won't learn nearly as much.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.890
You won't learn the rules behind everything,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.370
and,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.940
ah,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.050
chances are hardly any of it will stick with you.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.590
And so rote memorization is actually a great way to learn vocab and grammar and to get the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.270
rules set.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.900
Obviously,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.990
that being able to use this with native speakers is a big challenge.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.420
And in fact,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.270
it's quite a big challenge for many adults because we learned in the classroom.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.220
And then we have to converse with speakers as I mentioned before,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.900
because then we have.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.910
Then we make mistakes,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.920
and it could be very difficult,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.250
etcetera,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.650
etcetera.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.970
But rote memorization is very important,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.460
and this is a big reason why people who learn by rote memorization tend to remember

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.510
languages longer,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.610
and people who don't actually tend to forget them more often.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.950
And another factor is that although we do hate it as kids.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.860
As I mentioned when we're adults,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.120
we know why we're learning this language.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.870
We know what the purposes.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.770
So this kind of makes it a bit less tedious because every time we learn new vocab or new

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.450
grammar,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.760
we know that it's something that can be used in real situations,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.930
and we find ways to apply it in real situations and we can set up our own schedule.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.660
So we know that if we learn a new grammatical rule,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.480
we can decide.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.920
OK,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.340
this means that I can use it in this.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.270
In that situation,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.490
you can go out and use it,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.300
and suddenly you find yourself improving that much more.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600
And so since we know why we're learning it and against it,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.880
this goes right back to having a goal and having a purpose for learning the language.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.090
And because we have this goal in this purpose,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.980
when we learn whatever it might be vocab or grammar,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.340
anything else that has to do with language learning,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.420
then we are.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.490
We're getting that much closer to our goal.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.830
And so as adults we could realise this,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.260
and this makes this rote memorization mawr important for us and not nearly as tedious
