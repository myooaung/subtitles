00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
So now we're going to get into scheduling once again.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.520
At the end of this course,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.300
I'm going to go through a precise schedule,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.650
the one that I follow and that I recommend.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.290
But for now,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.240
I just wanted to go through some of the points of scheduling and some of the good points

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.710
and bad points and some of the tips and tricks and tidbits that I've come across.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.610
So first of all,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.880
you should set a schedule,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.890
even a crummy one.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
And remember all the time the crummy scheduled that you stick to is a lot better than the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150
awesome schedule that you don't sick to.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.590
If you decide that you're gonna review all this vocab first thing in the morning and then

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.740
you're gonna work on this other stuff at noon and you're gonna watch all these videos and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.870
learned them in the evening and then during a spare time,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.920
you're going to do this and you're going to get something else done.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.450
You know,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.920
that's not gonna last more than a day if that On the other hand,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.810
if you just schedule a couple things,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.380
but you're able to stick to that schedule and do it every day,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.210
then that's actually a good schedule.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.890
And ah,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.140
and you can build on that.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.840
And that's the key you can.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.050
It's a lot better to create a small schedule that you can build on overtime than to create

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.000
a very complicated schedule that you deduct from over time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700
And we'll get into this a bit more later.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.440
Also,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.990
your schedule you should revisit it.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.950
I suggest revisiting it weekly and then monthly,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.120
but for different reasons.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.310
Now,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.870
when you revisit the schedule weekly,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.420
you should try toe check every week to make sure that a you're keeping to the schedule and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.320
also to see if it's too easy or boring or too difficult,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.950
maybe,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.700
and just try to assess how the schedule is turning out for you week over week when you re

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.410
visited monthly.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.810
However,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.260
this is for different goals.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.560
You want to make sure when you revisit the schedule monthly that you're getting the right

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.520
goals out of it.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.660
We've already discussed your goals and that you should set your own goals and target for

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.430
language learning.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.620
And this is what the monthly revisits or four and the months of reviews.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.400
They basically allow you to go back and make sure that you're actually striving.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.030
You're actually on the road to attaining your goals,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.610
and you want to make sure that you're heading in the right direction with these monthly

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.940
reviews and these monthly revisits because otherwise you might end up sticking to a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.850
schedule that kind of leads you in the wrong direction or leads you nowhere.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.210
And so you want to revisit for this purpose about every month,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.650
I'd say.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.890
Also,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.310
try to find a way to test yourself now.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.630
This is obviously for people who are not in courses or have ah,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.000
Tudor or anything like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.220
If you're learning by yourself,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.310
you kind of want to find a way to test yourself.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.880
Whether this be through just exercises that you find online or available in some random

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.300
textbook or somewhere else.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.480
It's important that you try to test yourself and see how you're doing and be honest with

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.430
yourself about it and so see if you can figure out a way to do this and maybe give yourself

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.970
a test.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.140
I don't know every months,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.990
every couple months,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.200
whatever you think is best,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.350
and treat it like like if you were your own annoying teacher that has to test you.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.690
And I only say annoying because many times you don't want to create a test for yourself,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.500
so you have to put yourself in those shoes,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.310
Uh,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.210
also put you keep yourself in those shoes when you're correcting the test.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.750
Obviously,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.590
another thing is,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.720
you want to make this your new lifestyle,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.910
and this is another reason why you don't want to create a crazy schedule,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.760
because this new schedule that you're creating should become part of your daily schedule,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.680
part of your life.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.370
And so you want to be able to fit for it to fit accordingly.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.260
No one can fit too much into their life because they have a job.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.430
They have other errands.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.930
They have to run.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.670
They have other duties they have to fulfill.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.340
And so you want to make sure that this scheduling into learning a language can fit into

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.550
your lifestyle So it becomes your new lifestyle if you will,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.050
and the way you conduct your life is you have a certain amount of time spent for work,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.810
for family,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.720
for this side of the other,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.690
and also for learning language.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.370
And so try toe make this fit in as part of your daily schedule.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.440
Obviously,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.330
you should make use of downtime.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.260
There's a lot of downtime if you look at it correctly while you're in the car commuting

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.750
while you're cooking while you're ironing,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.630
running errands,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.420
waiting in line walking from place to place.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.600
These are all great times for downtime in terms of listen to podcasts in terms of checking

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.840
app,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.480
some phones,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.050
etcetera.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.570
So keep these in mind.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.760
These quote unquote downtimes in mind for times when you can schedule extra little tidbits

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.380
that you can,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.950
ah,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.080
make you self for learning the language.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.530
But do something every day.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.790
Even just glancing at one flash card is better than nothing.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.940
And while you're learning the language,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.960
you should try to do something at least once a day,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.070
even if it's something small,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.590
even if it's maybe not part of the schedule you've set.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.250
But going for more than a day without even looking at the language you're learning can be

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.310
detrimental.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.430
And chances are you're going to forget what you did learn.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.500
Even just looking at something kind of even for the brief minute puts you in sort of a mind

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.680
set of the language you're learning.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.040
So it's useful to do at least something little,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.130
even minuscule,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.750
every day
