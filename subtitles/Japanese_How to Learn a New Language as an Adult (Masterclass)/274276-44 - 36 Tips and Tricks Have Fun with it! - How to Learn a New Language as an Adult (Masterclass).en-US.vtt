00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
so another tip that I have here is to have fun with it.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.870
And so what does this mean?

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.270
Obviously,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.100
if you're learning a language,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.970
you want it to be as fun.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.750
It's possible.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.360
But this means just toe simply that have fun with it.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.880
Whatever you find fun.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.460
If you are learning language and you like singing than invent songs or rap songs or

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.980
whatever off you know in the language learning,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.750
try reading comics in the language you're learning.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.490
Try,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.370
I don't know,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.240
insulting other language learning.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.800
You know your classmates or whoever might be or making jokes.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.750
Try to invent jokes in that language and see how that goes.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.890
Or maybe if you are learning with someone else,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.380
then this other person you can kind of see them as a partner in crime because you can go

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.690
out and about and speak this other language and know that other people don't understand you

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.690
.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.730
And so you can kind of just have your own little secret conversations that people around

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.760
you don't understand.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.940
And anyway,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.190
whatever you find,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.830
that might be fun or might be a bit Maura musing.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.020
Why not do it?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.370
Because it isn't completely structured and it isn't part of a formal lesson.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.020
And again,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.560
as adults,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.480
we tend to think of structure and former lessons in terms of learning.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.030
But sometimes we should think of it more like kids and just have fun with it.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.560
And whatever situation we find ourselves in and whatever we enjoy,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.090
why not try just adding this other language into it and seeing what happens?
