And that was it.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.110
Um So as you can see,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.450
I like languages a lot.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.570
I enjoy languages and I spoke to you in the seven or eight languages.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.110
I guess um and I left out a couple of it languages that I feel a bit less comfortable

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.860
speaking to you in going to teenies or what thing about I g on and those Those were,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.360
by the way,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.550
ah,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.240
Ticino dialect from the Italian part of Switzerland and Taiwanese.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.820
By the way,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.660
the languages I spoke to you in were Japanese,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.420
Korean,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.190
French,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.600
German,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.190
Spanish,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.640
Italian and English.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.670
Not necessarily in that order,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.140
but more or less anyway.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.760
As you can see,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.240
I'm someone who enjoys languages.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.020
However,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.850
I'm not someone who's very good at languages,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.400
and I know this because I met people who are very good at languages.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.810
We could pick up languages like that,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.910
and they can just start conversing in those languages.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.640
And not only that,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.850
but they can ah can switch from language to language.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.720
And I'm really bad at that and the only reason I could really do it here.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.060
In fact,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.000
maybe you notice me hesitate at the beginning of each language is because I use what I call

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.200
trigger sentences or trigger expressions for each new language,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.260
and I'll get into this in the course about what I use and how I use it.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.610
I I also know people who can go for,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.810
say,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.050
like,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.800
two years without speaking language,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.230
and suddenly they're thrust into a situation where they have to use that language.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.900
They can do that.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.550
I can't.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.250
At least I can't just naturally,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.800
I have to.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.130
Ah,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.660
again,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.700
I have my own regimen,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.890
my own method for being able to do something like this so that when I go to Germany or to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.230
Korea or whatever might be,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.110
I can make sure my language level is at the level where I left off.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.110
So basically I haven't lost anything.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.660
But I need my own method,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.270
my own regiment,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.770
for doing this.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.450
And I'll cover this in my course as well.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.980
So this course is for anyone who wants to learn a new language.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.480
This course is for anyone who has been struggling to learn into language and who maybe has

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.300
thought that since they're an adult and they're grown up,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.890
they can't learn another language.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.600
I'm here to first of all tell you that's not true.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.180
In fact,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.770
very often,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.410
this kind of used as an excuse,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.580
But you can learn a new language,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.380
and I'm here to show you how I'm here to show you.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.700
The mess is that that I've seen that I've come up with because I've had a lot of false

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.630
starts like I said,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.890
I'm not very good at learning languages.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.830
I thought I was,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.830
and I realized that I wasn't and that it was quite hard sometimes for me to learn a new

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.180
language.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.390
And so I need to figure it out,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.650
and this all depends on what,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.910
exactly you want to do it.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.940
So this course starts from basically a 10,000 foot point of view at a Narrows and hones in

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.940
.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.440
Basically,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.220
it starts from first of all,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.290
which language going to learn,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.690
I assume,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.010
you know,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.740
but you might not.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.690
So we start there.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.450
But then also,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.080
what your goal is,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.380
why you want to learn that language.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.170
Is it for business?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.550
Is it for a classic for a test?

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.680
Is it because you're traveling there?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.910
Do you want to converse in the language?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.250
Do you want to read books in that language,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.270
all these air a bit different,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.960
And being adults,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.010
we can gear what we want to learn toward our goal so we can achieve this goal.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.720
That's what this course tries to do.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.980
Now I have my own method,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.700
and what you'll find is right at the end.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.890
I have a template that you can follow that you can fill out so you can create your own

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.500
customized,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.350
own personalized schedule for your own language.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.370
So it's helpful if you take this course from beginning to end and you keep all this in mind

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.370
.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.550
So at the end you can fill out this template.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.880
Now,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.820
the final lesson in this course is me going through the template point by point with you.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.970
But it should be someone self explanatory,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.870
and that way you can create your own schedule.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.340
You can create your own template for learning your language.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.760
Another thing I should point out,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.300
by the way,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.830
is that because I have this online course,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.710
I'm not very flashy as you might have noticed.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.290
Or if you've taken any of my other courses,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.480
you know that I'm not very flashy.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.170
I don't have a bunch of cool effects.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.860
I won't have all these cool background sounds and noises and whatever things.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.940
I don't do much of that.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.990
But what I do is I try to detail everything that you need in a logical manner,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.670
and I will,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.090
and that's what this course does.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.510
So if you are interested in learning a language you can get all the information from this

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.020
course,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.750
and that's what I try to show you as an adult.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.550
That is very possible for you to learn a new language and I show you how to do it.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.650
So without any further ado,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.450
let's get started.
