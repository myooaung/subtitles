00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Another thing you can do to increase

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.775
your speaking ability is to try to disagree with people.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:08.430
And what do I mean by this?

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.310
By this, I mean, that is one thing.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.245
When you're listening to someone and you heard them speak to basically constantly say,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.055
Oh, that's true, you're right.

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:20.360
And in fact, I find when I'm learning a new language,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.790
I become very good at saying that I say something

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.490
like made swap meets or it's in Italian,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.040
maybe a bit of vidoes had I joined a dual still.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.500
And you find yourself saying this while

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.545
someone's talking and you're kind of nodding your head and agreeing.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:38.615
But it can be quite useful if every now and then you decide to disagree.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.180
So maybe you just memorize

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.260
the phrase that says yes but yes however or something like that.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.210
As in C, Chad,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.145
I join it but all yes, you're correct.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:52.505
But however, something like that,

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.460
this means that you're disagreeing with them and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.220
you're trying to add something to it, and what does it do?

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.875
This forces you to actually add

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:03.950
another sentence on rather than just saying yes, you're right.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.985
Yes, that's correct.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.470
You have to say yes,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.015
but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.130
Yes. However, don't you think then?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.705
Yes, you're right.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.480
But in my experience does something like that.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.710
Now, obviously, I'm not saying that you should be disagreeing all the time and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.045
be disagreeable all the time and just find fault with everything that everyone says.

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:27.935
But just try to add something more than just saying.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:28.625
Yes.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:29.855
Okay, that's fine.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.080
And saying but or however or something along those lines

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.010
is a very easy way to do that because you have to add something after that.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.500
Now of course this goes for any other conjunction,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.480
so feel free to use any type of conjunction,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.690
any type of phrase or expression that could

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.415
combine two different phrases or that could just allow you to add more to it,

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.255
however, therefore, so if OR et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:56.165
And all of these will force you to not just say,

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:57.725
oh, you're correct, you are correct.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.690
But actually add your own sentences,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.980
create your own sentences,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.280
create your own thoughts in the target language so that you are

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.000
forced to create more sentences and become more comfortable doing so.
