00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
once again This is a plan that I came up with,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.470
that I follow and that I find very useful.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.540
So I wanted to share it with you just so hopefully you can find some use it as well.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.210
Now all of these points,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.540
by the way,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.880
have already gone through them in the presentation and in the class in the course itself.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.950
But here,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.170
I kind of synthesize what I've been talking about and try to make it into a cohesive

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.450
learning plan that hopefully you can follow and used to your advantage.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.060
So starting off as we started off with the course,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.200
you start off with a goal,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.590
As in What do you want to achieve from learning this language?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.260
And And I gave a give here various examples and such as one of them,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.140
which is quite common,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.260
is converse all evening over a dinner and then I say be,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.190
Can you break down this into the smaller goals?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.670
Gonna break this down into smaller goals.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.080
A commercial evening over dinner Could be converse for 30 minutes and so converse for 30

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.680
minutes.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.070
OK,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.340
I don't want to bore you by filling it all out here in the example already put Converse for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.870
30 minutes.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.110
Here.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.840
This could be converts for several minutes.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.750
Uh,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.710
and if you break it down even further,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.820
converse for several minutes.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.060
Could be have at least two exchanges in a row.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.570
And then if you break it down even further than that,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.830
have at least two exchange bureau can be have at least one exchange or one question

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.270
response to exchanges.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.680
Usually I would mean you ask something.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.300
They respond,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
you ask again a follow up,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.890
and they respond something like that to exchanges.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.880
And here is this one exchange for the F will be one exchange.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.020
So you ask a question and you understand the response or they ask a question which you are

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.480
able to respond to and that we just one exchange.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.000
So there you've broken down pretty much as much as you can break it down.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.260
And ah,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.150
and so this way your goal to converse all evening over dinner is broken down into more

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.250
manageable parts,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.650
and from there we go on to page two.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.320
And where you have once again you have these components,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.150
their components for language,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.180
learning that once again,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.480
I've mentioned before in the course.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.960
Ah,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.840
quite at length.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.340
In fact,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.440
first is listening than speaking than reading and writing.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.150
And so you want to see what applies to your goals to the goals that we have here?

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.190
21 A more specifically,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.810
converse all evening over dinner.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.770
So what applies?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.450
Listening?

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.900
Yes,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.710
I will have to listen.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.910
If I'm conversing over dinner,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.920
I have to listen to what they say.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.410
So I click.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.910
Yes.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.250
Speaking.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.980
Ah,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.180
well,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.450
yes.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.150
If I'm conversing,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.820
that means speaking.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.500
So yes,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.330
that will apply reading,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.600
reading Not so much,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.200
because if I'm conversing with people,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.210
I won't be reading presumably.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.990
So I click.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.330
No and then writing.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.320
Also know what I found with most of my goals is usually two of these apply,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.400
and two don't.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.650
There might be exceptions,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.630
but by and large,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.680
you're either concentrating on listening and speaking or in reading and writing.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.100
And so,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.540
generally,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.050
two of these applying to don't.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.140
Anyway,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.650
once you fill this out,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.720
uh,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.590
below you can see activities.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.190
These activities are our activities for each components.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.320
They have the listening components,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.420
that speaking components,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.220
the reading components and the writing components.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.730
Once again,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.310
it's divide into these four components.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.050
And so what I say here is to write 1 to 4 next to each activity as you pick them.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.620
So this will mean that if I go to podcasts,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.380
right one here,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.700
people around town to practice would say to here,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.720
Ah,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.830
then maybe I do three here and four here Now.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.530
You noticed something as soon as I wrote three here,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.880
it popped up here,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.880
and I did this because finding online games in that language means that you're reading the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.630
online games.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.320
But it could also mean that you're writing in the online games if they're chat or something

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.900
like that.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.160
So I just want to make sure that you don't count the same activity for two different

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.680
components.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.280
That's the only reason why I put that there.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.270
If you're reading online games,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.780
you can't add it as writing for online games as well,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.610
because that's the same game that you're doing right.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.990
I want you to find another activity.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.570
So anyway,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.110
that's the only reason why I did that.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.660
Hopefully,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.640
this works for you.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.480
This whole if it doesn't,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.090
or if you have issues with this worksheet,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.920
let me know because obviously making work.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.990
She's is not something that I do professionally,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.750
and so hopefully just works out.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.530
But anyway,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.620
once he filled out all these this information,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.340
you have all the information you need for your for your schedule.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.680
And also,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.400
this helps you.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.690
It's a good exercise to see what you wish to accomplish and how you wish to accomplish it.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.550
How you wish to attain your goals.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.410
So that's when we go on to part two now,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.310
part two.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.000
I have these as two separate files just so you can follow along with this file while you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.020
fill this one out.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.160
So here in part,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.160
to you see the schedule we can start building up a schedule will use a kaizen method once

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.890
again that I mentioned to the course and use that as an approach.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.440
So you write the correspondent activity next to each number.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.550
What does this mean?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.080
This means that he received Monday Tuesday,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.170
Wednesday Thursday,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.600
with numbers next to them.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.380
1234 You go back here one podcast,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.820
So under one,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.570
you write podcasts and under two people around town to practice with so on.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.910
So under here you find people around town to practice with again.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.330
I don't want to take up too much time,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.120
but you see what I mean?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.690
You do the same for three and four and that's your schedule for the first week.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.590
OK,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.020
eso here you was.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.840
Do briefly find online games.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.460
And what was four right?

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.330
Short texts.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.810
OK,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.140
so here.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.880
Right short,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.850
Tex.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.150
Now,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.250
this is their schedule For the first week.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.490
I want Monday,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.600
you decide you're going to do podcasts to have stay people around town to practice with

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.040
Wednesday.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.770
You're gonna find online games Thursday,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.020
right?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.750
Short texts.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.050
And this is obviously a very preliminary thing,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.340
and you're just kind of using it to connect the dots.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.510
See,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.880
really?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.760
To see if it works for you.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.180
That's why I say Friday,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.050
use the state to review make changes,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.530
make bonafide attempts.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.840
Monday,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.170
Tuesday,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.410
Wednesday,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.690
thirds.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.340
Don't just think.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.520
Oh,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.290
I'm not gonna find people around town to practice with.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.700
Forget it.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.860
No,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.980
no,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.330
no.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.340
I want you to try.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.130
And because if you put that already has one of the speaking components here one of the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.000
activities to do,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.330
then it means that it's a complete you want that you want to try and you know you think

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.050
will help you out.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.920
So I want you to try this for the first week Friday.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.650
Use the state to review and make changes.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.180
Maybe there were issues with it,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.560
and I and I give examples here for the review.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.840
You want to make sure things are working thus far,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.190
Correct Any preliminary issues right away.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.850
Examples of possible issues.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.620
The podcast had only five episodes,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.070
so that wouldn't be enough for learning in the long term.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.800
And the solution will be to find another podcasts.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.250
Just find something else.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.850
Another potential problem could be you couldn't find anyone around town to talk to.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.180
Then choose something else from this component.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.660
So you go back to speak speaking components.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.080
Choose something else.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.820
Once again,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.510
it's not exhaustive at all.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.800
You can fill out other.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.280
I think I mentioned this before,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.780
but none of these lists are exhausted,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.680
and that's why I have other here,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.970
where you can write down whatever other activity you want here and put the number next to

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.230
that.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.930
If you wish.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.870
Um,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.950
so feel free to do that as well,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.560
then here.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.110
Another problem is he filled out just one flash card and it doesn't seem like enough

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.130
increased the number of flashcards.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.720
Eso This could mean that you wrote down just one,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.700
and you want to increase the number of flashcards because they were following the kaizen

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.160
method.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.780
Then increase the number of flashcards to whatever you feel comfortable.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.000
And I'm just showing you how you need.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.820
You can review what might have seemed robotic or just seem like you're checking off certain

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.290
steps,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.980
Do you?

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.190
Review is when you get toe,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.350
look at it and make sure it's working out.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.910
So use the weekend to turn this into a sustainable schedule.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.790
So you use Friday to review and use the weekend to make it into a schedule.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.160
This is a very easy schedule,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.520
Okay,

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.040
because Friday you're reviewing,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.510
then the weekend you're making a schedule.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.270
I do this on purpose once again to follow the kaizen method.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.520
It's a lot easier toe.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.950
Add on to the schedule over time to increase the amount over time than to decrease because

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.490
usually decreasing doesn't happen.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.200
It's that's when you give up on your schedule because it's too difficult,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.560
so you want to increase over time.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.680
That means starting off small So ah so What do you do here?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.640
This is the first week.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.770
So for the second week,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.120
whatever's been working out,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.030
if it has been working out,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.100
you just transpose whatever is there to week two.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.230
For the second week,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.390
you start with the same activities from last week.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.410
So that means podcasts under here you go once again,

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.270
Podcasts.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:24.360
As long as it's been working out people around town to practice with once again people

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.520
around town,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.620
I won't write the whole thing,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.230
etcetera,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.700
etcetera.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.240
What about five and six?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.720
Well,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.410
that's when you go back to the designated components once again.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.690
I'm kind of going through this a bit quickly,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.250
but hopefully you can go back and follow through on your own while you're filling this out

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.830
yourself.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.720
Because it should all make sense as long as you follow along.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.930
Because here once again you filled out.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.710
Check all that.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.320
Apply to your goal.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.150
This it always goes back to your goal.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.400
Converse in all evening.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.250
The components that apply here are listening and speaking.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.290
The ones he clicked.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.640
Yes,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.550
on these are the ones I want you to concentrate on now.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.000
So if you quick yes,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.050
on listening and speaking.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:12.090
Then I want you to choose something else from here now se listening and karaoke A for

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.570
speaking,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.350
watching TV and care.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.730
Okay,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.440
so here you fill this out all like before he let me do it quickly.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.050
Just so you see how it looks.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.330
Ah,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.740
right short,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.850
Tex.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.390
So all this was working out,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.360
and we're doing that fine.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.900
But here we have for five.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.200
We have watch TV and we have some TV show we can watch.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.050
And for six,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.580
we have career.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:36.950
Okay,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.550
maybe you can go sing karaoke with some friends or something like that.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.760
We have a machine,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.420
and you can use that to practice as well for your speaking.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:44.980
Anyway,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.800
this isn't usually one of my favorite activities,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.390
but I included,

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.150
because you get to use pronunciation and center and stuff like that.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.260
And this is your schedule for week two.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.470
And here you have from Monday to Saturday.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.100
You have an activity for each day,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.810
and you concentrate a bit more on in this case on listening and speaking,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.260
because that's what you want to concentrate on more anyway,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.150
you Sunday to review once again to make sure that things are working out this far.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.730
Correct any preliminary issues right away and try to correct correct them as soon as

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.300
possible.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.070
Otherwise,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.950
this schedule is your schedule Until your first monthly review.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.590
You can add minuscule additions to each day as desired once,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.680
and this goes back to the kaizen method where you add small.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.780
If you find that talking to one person around town,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.160
it's pretty easy.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.980
And you could talk to another person because maybe you go to the same coffee shop that has

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.500
another person who speaks that language,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.170
then fine.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.030
Feel free to add it.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.320
Feel free to add to podcast episodes per day instead of one or just whatever small,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.950
minuscule change you want to make.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.780
Make it even if it's just a fraction of,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.420
ah,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.190
the next podcast or something like that,

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.790
that's fine.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.690
Minuscule changes are great and,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.330
uh and yeah,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.840
that's pretty much your schedule now,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.230
and you can follow the schedule until your first month.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.060
You review now the monthly review.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.090
I just have some pointers here,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.860
and I've covered this before during the course,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.140
but just to just to recap,

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:14.650
you use this opportunity to review progress and how they compare to your broken down goals

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.390
from Unit one.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.640
Ideally,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.140
you've already achieved your most broken down goal,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.470
which is one F and so again,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.260
your monthly review.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.030
Rather than seeing how your schedule works,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.590
deals more with your goals.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.550
And so these are your goals here.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.740
Do you want to see how they compare to your broken down goals?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.620
Ideally,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.840
you have already achieved your most broken down goal,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.280
which is one f.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.070
So have at least one exchange or question response.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.390
Be ableto ask a question and understand the response.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.030
Ideally,

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.450
you know,

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.940
by this first week or two weeks,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.620
quite frankly,

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.450
you've already been able to do this.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.750
Which means you can concentrate on this goal.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.170
And maybe you've even,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:58.470
ah even accomplish your second most broken down goal one e and have at least two exchanges

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.830
in a row.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.150
Maybe you ask the question.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.780
Got a response?

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.640
Asked another question.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.430
Got another response.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.750
Boom.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.180
That means he already covered this and you could start concentrating on one D.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:12.040
And so this is really what you try to do.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.030
You try to achieve them.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.830
Goal by goal.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:19.270
Working backwards one F toe one e toe one D toe one seat one b until you can achieve one A

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:19.270
,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.150
which was their gold,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.130
and I have also a note here once he won sear one beagle.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.950
So once you start getting pretty high up there,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.950
you can decide toe on Lee.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.210
Work on the designated components from Unit two.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.290
I recommend still working on all four components here,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.750
so working on once again,

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.060
this deals with listening,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.510
speaking,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:39.830
reading,

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.280
writing.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.940
But once you start getting close to your goal,

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.160
if you want to come,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.760
if your goal is to converse all evening over dinner,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.550
you can decide at that point to not cover reading and writing anymore.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.340
Maybe you don't have to deal with the online games or the writing.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.860
Short texts like on Facebook updates their messages to friends,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.760
and you can just concentrate on these.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.730
And so you spend more time concentrating on speaking and listening because that's what you

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.850
want to achieve anyway,

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.730
Once again,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.810
I've said this many times.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.730
At the beginning,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.420
I recommend you concentrate on all components because it always helps out.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.370
But once you get closer toward your goal,

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.940
then yeah,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.090
you can decide to concentrate mawr on just the components that apply to your goal.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.280
So in this case,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.290
listening and speaking and that's pretty much it.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.010
Obviously you're going to tweak this As time goes by,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.820
you're going to customize it more,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.870
depending on what you're able to achieve and what you're not able to achieve.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.470
And ah,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.810
what works best for you.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.140
But hopefully this can kind of work out for you.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.290
And once again,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.310
you can find these to pdf's in the downloadable section.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.050
You should be able to fill them out yourself.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.890
Feel free to print them out or to keep them handy so that you can use them for your

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.080
schedule and feel free.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.470
Teoh.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.370
Tweak them as time goes by and feel free to let me know.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.200
Also if you have any recommendations for,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.560
because I'd love to hear about recommendations or tweaks or changes that you've made that

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.020
have worked for you and so feel free to let me know at any point in time and obviously feel

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.730
free to let me know if you have any questions.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.440
I kind of went through this quickly,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.950
but also because I've covered a lot of these points in this material during the course,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.940
and so hopefully you're somewhat familiar with it.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.460
And hopefully you can follow along with what I said and also whether we're didn't

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.170
instructions here.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.010
And it makes sense.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.660
And yeah,

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.390
that's pretty much it.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.710
And now you might have noticed.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.640
I think I'll have a copy written.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.250
Ah,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.890
and you might have noticed.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.650
I think I'll have a copy written.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.720
Yeah,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.150
hopefully you can find this useful and yeah,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.050
hopefully you can find this useful and it helps you out.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.150
And you might have noticed I will probably have ah,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.580
copy,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.430
written or copyright noticed somewhere on the screen here.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.860
And that's only because,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.570
I mean,

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:58.940
you know,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.340
this is why we can't have nice things is only because I've been following this method for a

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.320
while and I've told several people about it,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.670
and I found out that this other teacher was not only using this method and passing it off

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.410
as his own,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.750
but he was trying to make money off,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:17.450
for he's trying to sell it and sell it as his own message that he couldn't make money off

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:17.620
of,

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.240
and I only found out about anyway,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.950
I won't get into it,

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.220
but,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:21.670
uh,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.110
so that's why I have a copy,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.950
right right in here.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.660
And you know it doesn't mean it.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.200
Obviously,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.060
if you want to use it,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.370
use it.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.070
If you want to tweak,

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.440
tweak it.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.230
If you want to share it,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.670
share it.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.170
If you are honest,

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.150
this has no bearing on what you're doing.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.100
But obviously,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.360
don't try to pass it off as your own and try to make money off of it because that's not

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.830
nice and not honest.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.920
But once again,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.170
I hope you find this useful.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.890
And please let me know if you have any recommendations or if you have any questions I love

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:47.840
to hear about them.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.910
Does it really helps me?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.370
I've realized that I really like learning languages,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.600
and it doesn't come as naturally to me as it does to certain people.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.130
And so I do need to follow the schedule,

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.250
and it really helped me out.
