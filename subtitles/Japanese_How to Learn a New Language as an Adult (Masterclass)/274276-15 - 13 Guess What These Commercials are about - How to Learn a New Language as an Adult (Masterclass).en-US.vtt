00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
So now I'm going to show you two commercials.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.490
Oh,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.200
are possibly three anyway.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.460
The first ones will be from their Italian commercials from 1990 1991.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.260
These they're all TV commercials.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.670
But the 1st 1 would be a bit more like radio commercials and that there's a lot of talking

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.670
.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.190
You can't really tell what's happening just due to the background and the other commercial

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.660
can be a little bit deceiving.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.760
At least it was for me.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.390
And so let's see if you can guess what these commercials air about without speaking the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.790
language.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.830
The first commercial or two will be in Italian.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.250
The one after that will be in Chinese.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:47.810
I last time after the younger was called the Phoenician Vincente.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.540
So little area.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.870
I haven't checked article in Ankara in my problem area and not I I don't know about that.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:13.310
So how did you do?

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.590
We're able to guess what the commercials about chances are in the 1st 1 You just heard a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.550
bunch of talking,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.100
and maybe you caught a couple key words.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.460
If you're studying Italian and for the last one,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.450
you probably thought I had something to do with taxis or transportation.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.590
At least that's what I thought.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.140
But in the end you found out,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.680
or at least I found out that it was something completely different.
