00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.970
mistakes now.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.030
Mistakes is a very important part of language learning.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.710
And this is a biggy,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.490
especially for adults.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.210
We are used to knowing things,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.030
and now we know nothing in terms of learning a new language.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.120
And quite frankly,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.260
this is the biggest advantage the main advantage of Children have.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.650
Children are used to being told what to do there used to not knowing something and having a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.070
teacher telling them what to do,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.050
making mistakes and being corrected,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.200
making other mistakes,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.070
being corrected again,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.360
and then finally getting to know it.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.530
We're not used to this.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.940
We as adults are used to knowing stuff already and maybe even telling other people what to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.160
do.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.040
But we're used to looking knowledgeable,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.850
sounding knowledgeable,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.780
being knowledgeable,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.210
and we're used to be able to speak with authority,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200
and all of a sudden and we're learning a new language and we're going to make mistakes,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.730
we absolutely are going to make mistakes,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.970
and we have to learn how to deal with it.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.250
So what do we do?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.630
We have to become comfortable when we make this mistakes.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.600
And so try to remember that every time you make a mistake,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.990
this mistake is going to stick with you?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.220
Was that mean?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.830
That means that you're going to remember the mistake you made.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.750
And chances are you're never gonna make that mistake again.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.530
In fact,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.760
if you ask language learners how often they make mistakes,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640
then ask them how often they make the same mistake twice.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.430
You'll get some pretty interesting answer is chances are they'll make mistakes.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.240
Very often,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.670
they'll say,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.820
Oh,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.010
yeah,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.430
I made mistakes all the time.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.730
I've made mistakes here and there and they'll have some funny anecdote Funny story about

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.930
how they made a mistake in an embarrassing situation and either said complete the wrong

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.380
thing.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.500
They ordered the wrong thing at a restaurant at a coffee shop,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.350
or they made everyone laugh around them.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.010
But then ask them how often they made the same mistake twice.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.640
If they made that mistake ever made that mistake ever again,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.520
chances are they didn't on.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.840
The reason for this is that any time you make a mistake,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.750
it sticks with you,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530
you're going to remember your mistakes,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.230
and the more you embarrassed about your mistake,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.580
the more you remember it.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.480
So you should try to use that use mistakes to your advantage.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.930
Mistakes are actually a good thing because every time you make a mistake and you make it in

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.670
public and you get embarrassed about it,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.050
you're going to remember that mistake and you're not going to make that same mistake again

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.050
.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.540
Look and understand.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.180
As an adult,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.470
very often it's hard to actually want to make mistakes.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.480
If you're still embarrassed,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.130
you contrive various different things.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.690
You can try talking to Children.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.160
Now I use this for Chinese.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.840
I am lucky enough that I have a nephew who's ah,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.330
who lives in Hong Kong and speaks Chinese,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.650
and he's only about four years old now,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.050
and so I can speak to him in Chinese and we can,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.460
you know,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.410
communicate and I can make mistakes and not feel too bad about it.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.200
So if you have this opportunity,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.610
you can do that.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.980
Another thing you can do is talk to other people who are learning the same language.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.570
Obviously,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.900
if you talk to other language learners and you make a mistake,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.220
chances are they've either made the same mistake or they know exactly why you've made it.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.650
And so if you talked the language learners who are more advanced than you are.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.970
This could be very helpful because they will notice the your mistake,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.350
and they will either notice it as a common mistake or as a mistake that you are likely to

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.780
make learning that language,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.750
so this could be very helpful as well.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.980
In my experience,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.440
I've found that people who can laugh at themselves and at their mistakes are much better at

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.610
learning new languages.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.490
And the reason for this is obvious.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.010
It's because if you get embarrassed,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.210
get too embarrassed by mistakes.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.410
That means you don't want to make them.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.790
And this stops you from talking from speaking in public.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.820
And this,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.070
in turn stops you from learning.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.020
Because if you never get to use your language,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.920
then you're never going to improve it.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.180
And using the language when you're learning it,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.730
unfortunately means making mistakes,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.950
people who can laugh it off.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.100
People who can laugh at themselves,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.420
even if they get embarrassed in my experience,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.360
tend to do much better.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.000
By the way,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.750
this is a big reason why a lot of people say that you learn languages better while you're

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.280
drunk,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.530
or having fun with friends or stuff like that,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.000
because your inhibitions go down,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.660
and when your inhibitions go down,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.180
you don't care so much about the mistakes you make and it becomes easier to laugh for

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.590
yourself.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.140
Of course,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.080
when you're drinking than you remember these things less.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.820
And so I would advise trying to find a way to laugh for yourself even when you're sober and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.940
especially when you're sober,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.840
because then you can make the mistakes and actually remember them so you don't make them in

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.350
the future.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.180
Ah,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.360
solution that I implemented that I recommend,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.870
is to reward yourself every time you do get embarrassed every time you look stupid because

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.450
you look stupid and you'll feel stupid at the moment.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.550
But you realize right after that that actually you learn something new and that you've

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.750
improved because of that mistake because of that embarrassment because of that perceived

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.840
stupidity that you thought you got embarrassed about.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.200
And you're like,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.710
Oh my God,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.490
I can't believe I said that later on,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.800
you'll think,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.960
Oh,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.200
no,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.510
actually,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.950
it was good that I did that because I made a mistake that I won't make again because I

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.190
don't want to be in that situation again.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.920
So try to reward yourself every time you make a mistake.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.660
And in fact,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.830
right now,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.970
as part of my schedule,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.320
I try to make a mistake every day.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.640
Now this is also because,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.460
as part of my schedule,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.880
I'm speaking to native speakers every day,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.730
and so it gives me a chance to make a mistake.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.400
But I actually try to push myself,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.030
order more complicated things,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.410
talk about more complicated things.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.390
So I do make a mistake every day because that way I feel like I'm actually learning.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.900
So rather than trying to avoid mistakes,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.550
which is what you learn to do in your professional life and as an adult,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.500
try to seek them out and try to make mistakes,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.950
because that's how you're improving.
