00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.380
now,

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.140
in terms of writing,

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.370
there are various options out there and to go through them quickly.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.190
First of all,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.910
one is keeping a notebook.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.300
Ah,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.500
we're in your writing inside the notebook as you'll notice a lot of these will coincide

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.810
with the ah reading components just because writing and reading go hand in hand,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.510
obviously,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.160
shopping lists when you're writing down the shopping list now,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.140
as opposed to reading where if you buy the same things are more or less the same things

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.800
every week.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.580
It's good practice to retain it.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.260
It's actually good practice for writing when you can write different things.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.960
But either way,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.160
the other two sides of the same coin ah,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.960
finding online games in that language,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.190
obviously here,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.370
this is only valid if these are games that you write for or chat on,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.980
or you know things along those lines where you get to use your writing skills now finding

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.140
people who teach the language online.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.910
Uh oh,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.200
this could be in Twitter and Facebook.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.560
Obviously,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.540
I don't put you to,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.350
because here were emphasizing writing once again.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.540
And once again,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.130
this is stuff that's interactive,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.220
wherein you can write back to someone whether it's beyond Facebook or Twitter or just a

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.090
language teacher online that allows you to write with them now.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.480
There are some drawbacks to these,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.900
which I'll get to in a minute.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.990
But right now I just wanted to cover various options for writing again.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.580
Find a pen,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.840
pal.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.500
This could be either online or else just writing on pen and paper and flash cards once

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.890
again as long as you write them down.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.280
Because flash cars can be pre printed and you want the type you can write down because thes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.790
are,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.220
ah,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.220
a lot more useful to you,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.730
obviously,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.010
and they're only useful for writing if you get to write them yourself.
