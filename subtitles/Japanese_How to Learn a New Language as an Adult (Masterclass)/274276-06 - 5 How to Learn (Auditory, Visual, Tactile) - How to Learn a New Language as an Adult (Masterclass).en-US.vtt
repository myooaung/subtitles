00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
So how do you feel that you learn best?

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.790
Most people will find that they are a combination of these three options.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.320
Basically,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.440
that you learn more with an auditory style on.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.730
This means more listening and hearing or visual style,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.330
where you have to see something in order for it to stick or tactile and tactile means that

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.850
you need to interact with it.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.370
Mawr.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.590
I mean,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.230
it literally means you need to touch something.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.530
But it means if you have mawr interaction with it than you're more inclined to remember.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.460
Now most people have.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.570
You know there are combination of these three,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.630
but they tend to be influenced more by one than the other.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.810
And so they'll some people are very visual or some people are very auditory,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.950
some people very tactile and uh,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.250
and so you usually find that some of these systems works better for you than others.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.130
By the way,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.540
when you translate this into,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.860
say,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.360
the components of languages,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.700
an auditory person,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.610
usually this means that they learn very well with listening and speaking.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.480
If if they have ah,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.870
verbal conversation with someone,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.830
then they learn very well.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.130
Ah,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.840
visual person will learn a lot better with reading and writing,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.560
while tactile person will learn quite well with stuff like speaking and writing.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.810
In other words,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.910
when they have to do perform the actions themselves.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.670
If they have to speak on DSA art saying things than these things will stick.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.520
Whatever they say,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.370
they have to write things themselves.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.520
These things will stick.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.000
By the way.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600
This is also a reason why very often,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670
people who write their own flashcards retain the knowledge so much better than people who

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.050
just download the flash cards or get him off the Internet or something like that,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.020
because the act of writing it down means that you remember it more.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.500
And that's the tact ill part of learning.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.040
Ah,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.070
you'll notice here that there is no combination,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.090
which would just be receiving stuff.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.910
So listening and reading because only receiving information,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.330
even though it's a bit more passive,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.550
many times more easy because you can kind of just do it without thinking,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.560
almost really doesn't help.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.710
You need some sort of active component to be able to learn the language,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.290
and so either speaking or writing or both.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.060
Now,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.350
if this sounds a bit complicated,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.860
don't worry about it too much.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.090
All I want to do is try to ah,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.640
make you aware of the fact that they are.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.270
There are these different ways of learning and that you're probably more inclined toe one

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.780
than the other.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.630
So as you learn,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.240
try to see if one way helps you more than the other.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.690
Or maybe from past experience,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.990
you've already noticed that one way helps more than the other.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.620
And just keep this in mind while you're learning the courses,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.900
because that means that certain matters of learning will be easier than others and will be

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.380
more effective than others as well.
