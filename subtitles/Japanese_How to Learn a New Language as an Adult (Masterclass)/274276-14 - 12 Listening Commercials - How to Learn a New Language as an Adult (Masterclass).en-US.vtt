00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
advertisements and commercials are another great way to,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.570
Ah,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.970
learn a new language by listening.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.190
What I try to do is I try to guess what they're advertising as quickly as possible.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.400
And what I mean by this is if I hear a commercial even see a commercial on TV,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.780
where he went on the radio or whatever it might be in the target language in the language

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.760
that I'm trying to acquire,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.490
I try to see if I can guess what's being advertised as quickly as possible,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.970
preferably before they named the product would usually tends to be toward the end of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.610
commercial,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.560
but I tried to see if,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.530
based on the clues and the keywords that here,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.460
or if I feel much in a video,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.480
obviously it's easier.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.650
But based on the queues and what they say,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.930
I try to see if I can guess what they're advertising.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.990
And if you're with some friends and you're studying together,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.330
you can turn into sort of a game and see who is able to guess it more quickly,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.670
or what weird and says you come up with when you're trying to guess what's being advertised
