00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.870
now some other things to keep in mind.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.680
First of all,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.060
learning a language is not just learning it.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.250
It's also having to remember it now.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.510
What this means is that once you learn a language,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.350
first of all,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.790
learning language in itself doesn't really mean anything because learning it toe what level

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.320
you need to figure out what your goal is once again,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.480
and your goal could be many different things.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.810
That could mean that you want to be able to have a conversation with someone you want to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.290
read through something you want to be able to business in that language,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.640
etcetera,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.970
etcetera,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.340
etcetera.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.280
So learning language in it,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.760
in it of itself doesn't mean much of anything.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.880
Most people,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.520
when they say they want to learn a language,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.820
it doesn't mean that they want to be 100% super fluent,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.350
just like a native speaker,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.590
because they usually want to choose some other level.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.030
By the way,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.880
when people say they learn a language in three months or six months or something,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.920
I find it rather stupid because first of all,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.930
obviously it doesn't mean it doesn't specify toe what level,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.550
let's say,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.190
but also there's the aspect of remembering it.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.680
Remembering the language is something that you have to do for everything.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.180
Would you learn?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.970
Because languages of some of the easiest things to forget Now you could say I'm going to

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.120
take a 31 of course,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.020
and learn Arabic perfectly and great.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.170
Take that course and learn it to me.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.370
You won't let her perfectly,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.830
but you might learn it quite well.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.720
Um,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.820
and then you will promptly forget a whole lot of it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.410
And so,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.330
in one year's time,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.980
two years time,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.430
when there's an opportunity to use it,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.280
you won't remember half of what you learned.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010
And this happens.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.550
Unfortunately,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.340
the whole languages,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.660
and I'll get into this later about my regiment and what I do in order to maintain languages

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.740
over time.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.590
Because,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.890
as you've seen,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.720
I have speak seven different languages at various levels.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.000
But for now,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.260
just remember that learning a language per se doesn't really mean anything,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.310
and there's a lot more entailed with learning language and maintain over time.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.910
Another thing is that there are no real synonyms.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.770
So I think it was Steven Pinker,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.940
someone who said that in the English language or in any language.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.720
There are no real synonyms for one word and another,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.370
the dictionary might say they're synonym,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.400
but in usage there,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.260
used in different situations,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410
they have ah different tone or inflection there,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.420
used with different types of people,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.770
etcetera,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.250
etcetera.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.810
So if you keep in mind that in any language there are no real synonyms,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.570
then think about from one language to the other.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.860
There are no rial synonyms from one language to the other.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.830
This means that there are no real direct translations.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.510
Anyone who is a translator can attest to this,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.440
but this as a language learner,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.670
it means that you really need to pay attention to see how words are used and tried to find

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.790
examples of words we used in sentences.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.580
These always help.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.030
If you have any question,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.800
or if you're unsure about how to use a word,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.470
just keep this in mind.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.480
And ah,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.570
remember that you can look up sample sentences,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.130
which should give you a better idea of how certain words or expressions there types of

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.690
grammar can be used in a sentence.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.400
Also,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.950
remember that native speakers sometimes are not very good at answering your questions.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.400
You might have a question as especially with the wise.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.050
When you say Well,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.330
why would I put the verb at the end of the sentence?

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.380
Or why would I do this?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.250
Why would I use this instead of that expression or this instead of that word or something?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.850
Many native speakers they just grew up speaking that language so they'll just say,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.100
Well,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.650
because that's how it's done or it's something along those lines.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.640
And so sometimes it can be hard,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.600
especially when you're learning a language and you want to know the rule behind what you're

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.790
saying so that you can say the correct thing in the future for maybe a similar sentence,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.360
or if you find yourself in a similar situation and you're not sure if it applies or not.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.800
In this case,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.210
usually it's good to a ask teachers.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.660
If you can find someone who teaches the language,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.070
they can usually answer this question quite correctly,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.090
or be many times someone else who's been learning the language.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.960
And maybe it's a bit more advanced than you are because they had to go through the same

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.520
thing you did.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.710
And chances are they had the same questions at some point and came across the answer or

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.110
found a solution for it.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.200
So once again,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.820
keep this in mind.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.360
It can be quite frustrating when you're asking questions,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.220
especially the wise or things about,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.490
say,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.470
Entomology or stuff like that to native speakers,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.580
because very often they just want they just won't know the answer.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.870
They'll know how to say something correctly,

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.100
but they'll have no idea why.
