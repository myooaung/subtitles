00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
So what are the components of language learning?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.190
Basically,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.500
I've divided the components of language learning in tow four.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.790
And they are as follows.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.430
First of all,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.090
there the verbal ones and under the easy find,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.620
listening and speaking.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.420
So in terms of language learning,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.730
you can learn by listening when people talk to you or when you just hearing it spoken.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.850
You can also learn it by speaking at yourself.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.910
The other two are the textual versions,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.010
and that's reading and writing.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.200
And these are the four components for learning language You can learn either through

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.490
listening or through speaking or through reading or through writing.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.320
And we're going to cover each of these in a bit more detail just so you get more of an idea

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.160
of what's entailed for each one and what the possibilities are in terms of concentrating on

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.950
these different facets because the issue is,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.820
you might learn,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.210
say,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.750
reading and writing very well.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.940
But if you neglect listening,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.790
speaking altogether than,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.400
ah,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.210
the first time you try to have a conversation with someone that's really gonna show,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.440
like was the other way around.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.780
If you just concentrate on listening,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.480
speaking,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.870
it's really gonna show.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.730
If you haven't done any reading and writing since,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250
he won't know you know the words in the grammar behind it.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.680
Like I mentioned before,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.870
quite a few people think they only want to come concentrate on conversation and the neglect

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.130
reading,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.920
writing altogether,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.130
which can be a big mistake,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.350
at least up until you reach a certain level.
