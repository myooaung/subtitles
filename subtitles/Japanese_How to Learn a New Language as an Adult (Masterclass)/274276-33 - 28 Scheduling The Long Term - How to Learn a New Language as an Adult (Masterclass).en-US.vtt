00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
So another component of scheduling,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.020
by the way,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.150
is the long term.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.150
Just remember language learning never stops,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.910
and it's not like you can say one day.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.170
Okay,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.970
I learned the language.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.150
Now I can just quit.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.130
And in 20 years time,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.500
if someone speaks to me in this language,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.590
I'll speak to them perfectly.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.110
No,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.670
unfortunately,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.320
it never stops,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.730
and I'll talk about this later about how me to maintain a language over time,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.410
how to maintain multiple languages,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.470
and I'll go over my regiment for doing so.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.480
But for now,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.100
just remember that language learning never stops.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.370
And along these lines,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.970
no one can intensively learn a language for average.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.320
So you might come up with a great schedule and you're able to stick to it even where you

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.820
learn for several hours a day and you get a lot out of it.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.650
But chances are you're not gonna be able to keep to it forever.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.330
Remember,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.300
you still have a job,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.240
and you might have,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.540
say,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.160
a family,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.850
or you might have other interests,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.010
or you might have other duties and obligations.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.150
And so even if you can stick intensively to language learning now,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.140
you might be able to do that and maybe only plan on doing that for a few months or

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.150
something along those lines,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.920
and that's fine.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.940
But just remember,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.520
you cannot stick to it forever.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.320
So just personally,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.020
what I prefer to do is actually I prefer to be really intense about it for a short period

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.420
of time and then take a rest.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.090
Like I said,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.950
I build up a schedule.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.460
I build up a schedule I can keep to.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.030
But one of the reasons I can keep to it is I feel like this won't last for the rest of my

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.370
life.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.910
But it's just a short burst,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.330
if you will,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.760
even if it's a short burst of quite a few months,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.960
I see it as a short burst of very intense language learning.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.030
And so Aiken delve deep into it,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.310
and then I take arrest.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.390
But obviously this will depend on your schedule,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.260
and you should see what you can do based on your schedule and how much time you can

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.950
dedicate to language learning in the short term and over the long term.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.840
Generally,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.200
though,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.990
I find that being really intense about it for a short period of time,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.940
is very good because allows you to delve deep into learning the language.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.440
And then you take a break and,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.070
quite frankly,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.920
breaks or good.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.450
If you take a short break from a language and then you get back to it,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.140
I think A you'll be surprised how much you've retained.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.550
In fact,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.740
many times I feel like I've improved over the break for some odd reason and be you'll be

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.270
that much more motivated when you get back into it because you took a break and you feel

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.380
like you've been slacking off a language learning,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.160
and now you want to jump right back into it.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.900
So this is what works for me once again.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.400
So I do recommend it generally,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.830
but of course it will have to depend on your own schedule.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.910
But just keep this in mind over the long term,
