00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
So the following videos from my YouTube channel,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.340
and it's ah,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.410
just where I talk about how I use flash cards.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.630
And I thought it would be an interesting tip at this point to,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.840
ah to share with you because it's a bit different from just a normal way of using flash

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.090
cards.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.860
And I find it really helps me in terms of space repetition and in terms of concentrating on

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.080
the flashcards and on the vocab that I need to concentrate more on while not having to

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.540
waste time on on the flashcards and on the vocab that I already know.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.150
Anyway,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.700
I just want to share this with you quickly.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.110
Once again,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.180
it's from my YouTube channel.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.810
So that's why the format is a bit different.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.360
But hopefully you'll find it helpful.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.650
See that spin you?

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.810
I'm sorry.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.960
Okay,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.300
well,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm gonna have to lift these up.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.910
I have three bowls here.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.380
One has a smiley face,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.480
one has so so face.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.050
And as you can imagine,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.110
this one has a sad face.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.080
So what is this?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.580
Okay,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.040
let me let me explain.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.450
What I'll do is when I see my new vocab and when I see my new index cards.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.830
I always find in next cards very helpful just because I can leave them anywhere leaving

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.520
next my bed.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.080
I leave them lying around and I can always be working on them.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.910
I could take them with me,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.670
put in my pocket,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.300
so I like them.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.740
And so what I'll do is I'll look at certain words.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.950
And so this is how I write out my index cards for Chinese.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.150
I usually have a character with the tones right above,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.420
and so I'll take this word and say,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.810
You know,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.880
it's dangle Stangel is to block and you say OK,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760
I'm familiar with Dong Ju to block.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.970
And so I'll put this in the little smiley face bowl Perricos and what I mean by that.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.210
So the little smiling face bowl is a bowl of the vocab that I already know that I know

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.630
quite well and I don't need to revisit it for a while.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.370
And then I'll take this word.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.160
Yoli Joey is you know,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.530
I'll say,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.680
Oh,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560
I know that it means intentional,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.060
but,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.400
uh or doesn't mean interesting.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.610
No,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.990
wait,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.440
no,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.170
It means intentional interesting with us.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.810
Okay,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.230
I check.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.060
And yes,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060
it means intentional,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.640
but I was a bit iffy about it.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.390
So what I do is I put it in this one where I know it.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.150
But it didn't come like that.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.870
Like the other one.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.540
Then here I have doing doing his pronunciation.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.470
I know that very well.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.180
So once again,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.820
I can put that in there in the smiley face.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.000
But then say I get something like this to junk toe young.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.280
If I'm pronouncing it semi correctly and this junk is,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.040
you know,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.450
so I can't remember what it is at all.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.050
It means,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.870
uh what does it mean?

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.300
What does that mean?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.790
I can remember.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.470
And so I check on the back and it says characteristic.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.370
Or maybe I don't even know.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.670
I could only remember how to pronounce it,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.050
but that's still but I don't remember how to pronounce the other part.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.640
How do I say that?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.330
How do I say that?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.750
I can remember.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.310
I have to look it up okay to junk.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.040
And,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.550
um,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.940
at this point,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.330
if I don't know it at all,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.650
then and if I can't think of it either the pronunciation or what it means I put it in this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.970
part.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.170
And so what I do with these piles is that when I have to revisit it later on during the day

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.780
or something,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.940
this sad face pile is the one I visit first.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.040
Because this is a book of that I know least and the one I know least So these are the ones

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.620
that I will be going over more.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.880
And so if I see this again and I know it right away,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.990
then I can put it into I usually upgraded just by one.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.410
So then I'll put it right into here.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.540
And But if you know,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.520
I have this other one hope and I don't remember it at all put in the sad face.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.990
And later,

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.750
when I revisited later it during the day,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.770
I still have no idea and can't remember it all.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.740
It goes right back in here.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.910
This one gets revisited most often.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.680
And then this one and the smiley face hardly used to be revisited at all.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.060
In fact,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.010
I could probably forget about it for this session or for however long because I know these

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.450
right away.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.320
So And you know,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.410
the way I think of it is my goal is to make all of these be smiley faces,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.520
and I want them all to be smiley faces in the end.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780
And so gradually,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.010
I want them all to move up there.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.050
And so it's just a mess that I keep.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.400
That is very easy.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.010
All I need is three bowls,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.780
as you can imagine,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.560
my wife isn't very thrilled with this,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.910
but,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.780
you know,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.350
we had these extra so it kind of works out,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.070
and,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.520
uh,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.020
and it's a very easy way for me to not have to repeat all the vocab that I know really well

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.020
.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.250
And instead I can concentrate on the vocab.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.360
I know less well and it helps me improve more quickly.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.470
And it helps me use space repetition,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.370
but in a more efficient way.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.530
And so I really like this method,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.220
and obviously this is for Chinese,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.900
but it can work for any type of language and anything you're trying to memorize.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.320
In fact,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.560
any time you have index cards,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.020
you could just do a system like this.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.950
So if you're trying to learn new vocab,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.170
I highly recommend it.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.690
I think it's very easy and it's a thing that you can keep around and you see these three

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.270
bowls with three faces on them?

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.060
It reminds you as well.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.480
You know,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.100
your if your waltz waltz in or you're not doing something I don't like.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.250
Oh,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.420
yeah,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.010
I should look at it.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.840
Look at those okay.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.680
Toe junk,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.410
junk.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.250
I still come on.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.440
What?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.870
It means old characteristic feature.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.900
Characteristic feature.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.570
Okay,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.850
okay.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.050
Put it back in.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.350
I revisited whatever works for you for me.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.800
I try to leave at least a couple hours until I revisited the next time.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.330
Because otherwise I remember it too easily.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.140
And yet that's pretty much it.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.410
It's a very simple system,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.120
but it works quite well for me.
