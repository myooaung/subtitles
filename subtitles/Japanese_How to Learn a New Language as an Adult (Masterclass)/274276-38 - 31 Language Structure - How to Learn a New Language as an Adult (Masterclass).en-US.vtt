00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
so here just wanted to discuss language structure.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.570
Don't worry.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.450
I won't get too much into detail with weird terminology,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.840
but just to give a brief outline of how languages air structured in a very broad sense just

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.410
to give a better idea so it can help you along when learning language.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.540
First of all,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.510
they're varies aspects of language.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.880
There's vocab,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.150
which is words.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.760
And then there's grammar.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.150
And then this pronunciation.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.670
So just briefly for each one vocab is,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.480
as I mentioned,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.260
words.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.470
This is the most important part of any languages,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.870
the main part of any language.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.810
Because words are what you used to say.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.040
Anything you say this could be.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.170
Now these can be verbs,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.700
adverbs,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.440
adjectives.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.590
You're always using words to say anything you're saying,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.460
and so these very much compose any language.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.140
And generally speaking,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.250
the more vocab you know,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.190
the more words you know,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.750
the more you can communicate in any given language.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.720
So any time you have a chance to learn more vocab,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.800
you always should,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.020
and any opportunity have for learning more words is always good,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.400
and this can be through the myriad ways there are to learn these new words once again of

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.980
anything from YouTube videos to podcasts,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.950
the textbooks to flash cards,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.310
etcetera,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.640
etcetera,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.100
etcetera,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.890
the nets expect is grammar.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.370
Grammar is the way to describe grammar is basically the glue that keeps the vocab in place

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.370
.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.510
Vocab is just a bunch of words,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.580
and the way you put them together can be nonsensical or can make sense.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.810
Grammar is what makes sure that they make sense and grammar needs to be learned.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.600
And unfortunately,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.980
it's the most underappreciated aspect of most languages.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.670
This is because if you get grammar correct,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.190
people don't really notice it because you just spoke of sentence and you said it correctly

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.280
and use the correct grammar structure.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.440
But if you make a mistake,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.650
people notice it right away.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.500
If you use complicated words,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.480
invoke have people tend to notice that more.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.900
But if you use the correct grammar,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.740
people notice it.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.500
People hardly ever notice it at all.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.720
They only noticed the mistakes.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.600
For this reason,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.430
it's usually very underappreciated.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.200
However,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.060
having said that,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.710
the good news about grammar is that there is always a finite set of rules.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.070
Now,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.870
with pronunciation.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.010
Now,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.190
we already covered pronunciation under the speaking section for language components.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.330
And so I won't get into the nitty gritty about learning different pronunciations.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.380
You can always check that.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.450
However,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.490
from a more theoretical standpoint,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.120
pronunciation is where it all comes together.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.990
Let's say when you learn the vocab and then you learn the grammar structure later,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.460
especially with speaking,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.760
in fact only was speaking in terms of pronunciation.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.970
This is where it all comes together because you need to be able to pronounce things

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.490
correctly.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.880
And this goes back to the arguments we had before about pronouncing R's in different

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.510
languages or even ends or peas or any other type of letter might not be pronounced the same

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.940
way in a different language.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.790
So you need to take this into account when you're pronouncing your vocab and using your

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.530
grammar structure.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.180
Pronunciation is a big part,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.800
and once again,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.850
the best way to learn pronunciation is usually to imitate native speakers.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.780
However,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.800
when speaking and when listening,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.350
pronunciation is something that needs to be taken into account
