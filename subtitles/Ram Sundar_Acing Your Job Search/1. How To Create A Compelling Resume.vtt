00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:09.970
Welcome to the fifth video in this lecture series, How to Create a Targeted Resume Based on a job description.

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:19.540
But before that, I would advise you to create a global resume or a template resuming or a blanket resume

3
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.590
containing a list of all your achievements.

4
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.340
So far, every project that you worked on, what the goal was, who you worked with, what the results

5
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.430
were, and what your contribution was, and so forth, and what companies you did that.

6
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.870
And so this will be your single point of reference for all jobs going forward.

7
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.930
And when you find a job that you like, that you feel like you match, then you will edit the global

8
00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:02.770
resume and create something that's shorter by removing all the unnecessary experiences and making it

9
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.140
relevant only to this job description.

10
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.680
Now, if you followed the previous video, then when you've found a job description, you would have

11
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.600
split the entire job description into a set of keywords, two sets of keywords, the soft skills and

12
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.680
the hard skills.

13
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.540
Now you're going to include all these in your resume, and I'm going to share my screen and show you

14
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.730
my resume with some confidential information removed, of course.

15
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.280
But we're going to take a look at the most efficient way to do this.

16
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.800
So it's always useful to have your name at the top left and your contact information.

17
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.600
You want them, obviously, to find find you.

18
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.910
You want them to know who you who they're talking to.

19
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.740
And that would be your name.

20
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.950
And if you have any professional designations, then you can include them along with your certifications

21
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.240
that could be relevant to the job that you're applying for.

22
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.320
And they want to know.

23
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.390
Most job most hiring managers will want to know where you're located.

24
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.030
So if you do not give a location, then you could be anywhere in the world and they wouldn't know.

25
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.320
And the pressing question for them becomes, Where are you?

26
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.440
How long would it take for you to get there, for a face to face interview and so forth?

27
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.350
If you want to save people the trouble, you want to save them as much trouble as possible and sort

28
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.550
of guide them along.

29
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.510
And it's always useful to provide your LinkedIn link.

30
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.380
Now, in my case, I also provide my personal website.

31
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:06.020
This is real soon, but you also want to include your LinkedIn profile.

32
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:15.140
Now, if you don't have a username for the profile and extension, then you can always go into LinkedIn.

33
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.300
Click on your profile and choose a name.

34
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.120
And that makes it easier for your hiring manager to remember your LinkedIn username.

35
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.990
Or your LinkedIn website.

36
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.130
Now below that, you want to identify what your market dominating position is, or, in other words,

37
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.950
what your unique selling proposition is.

38
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.450
What makes you so special?

39
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.310
Why should a hiring manager who has 200 other job applicants choose you?

40
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.280
Why should they give you the chance to interview what makes you special?

41
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.590
What makes you stand out from the other 200 people?

42
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.320
And that is what you want to establish through your headline.

43
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.890
For example, with me.

44
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.840
What makes me stand out?

45
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.430
What makes me qualified to be doing this course?

46
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.010
I am a body language coach.

47
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.260
I'm a business growth specialist.

48
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
I am a licensed professional engineer.

49
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.530
I've lived in five countries.

50
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.730
I speak seven languages.

51
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:34.760
I have 13 years of international experience with a consistent track record of helping jobseekers find

52
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.420
jobs.

53
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.990
Now, if I were applying to to a job posting myself, then I would.

54
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.460
I would show my track record of helping small and medium sized businesses or of successfully delivering

55
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.050
engineering projects.

56
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.800
Now, that said, let's move on to.

57
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.830
Not the headline.

58
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.910
This was the headline which we just talked about is this would be a little summary about yourself.

59
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:11.420
You can choose to include this or you can choose to include something about the job or the company itself

60
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.680
and why.

61
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.200
What makes you want to work for them?

62
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.230
So what kind of qualities do you have now?

63
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.490
If you're an entry level candidate, then it's likely that you don't have industrial experience, you

64
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.710
don't have field experience, which means your main focus becomes your combination of soft skills,

65
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.070
more your soft skills than your hard skills.

66
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.600
So then you want to show them that you're proactive, you're committed, and whatever qualities that

67
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.500
company values, you want to check out their website and find their core values.

68
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.160
What is it that drives that company and its employees?

69
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.760
Why are people proud to be working for a company like that?

70
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.450
And then you you should ideally include those qualities in your resume.

71
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.620
Now, it's not enough just putting those qualities here in the keyword section or even in the objectives.

72
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.080
What you want to show is how does this tie in with the rest of your experience?

73
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.890
For example, Board of Advisory Group Chair How and where have I done that?

74
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.800
This is just to cash the right.

75
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.940
My intention in writing these keywords is not to get through the applicant tracking software alone,

76
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.700
although that is one of the objectives.

77
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.370
Eight is not enough.

78
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.100
If you just get through the applicant tracking software, you want to tie it in with your experience.

79
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.030
So.

80
00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:03.140
If if someone is looking for Six Sigma implementation, this alone will get me through the applicant

81
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.710
tracking software because that is a key word or a key phrase in itself.

82
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.080
But where have I done that before?

83
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.410
Where have I used it?

84
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.320
Then they can take a look at this.

85
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.130
And you see Six Sigma here.

86
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.210
And they take a look at what I've done engineering, consulting and Six Sigma OC.

87
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.180
Where else may I have done it?

88
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.600
They see that I have driven.

89
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:41.010
Savings of more than 1.4 million CAD in a two year period.

90
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:48.870
And this becomes my Six Sigma project because it's creating cost savings of more than $1,000,000 in

91
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.010
a two year period.

92
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.510
Now, that said, every single company.

93
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.180
Deserves a little write up about them.

94
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:07.510
So you have to show the interviewer you have you're trying to save them as much trouble as possible.

95
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.530
So you start with your headline and show what makes you special.

96
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.180
And what qualities do you bring to the company and to the job?

97
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.110
Then you talk about your specific experiences.

98
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:28.710
And for each experience, talk about the company, maybe include one line about the company, what they

99
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.190
do.

100
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:39.730
And what your roles and responsibilities were and make it as data driven as possible, provide as much

101
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.470
detail as possible.

102
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.910
What what was the goal of your task?

103
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.950
What did you start with?

104
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.740
Did you work with different teams?

105
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.180
If a company if a job description that you've looked at calls for.

106
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.170
Teamwork.

107
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.150
Team oriented.

108
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.050
Working.

109
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.300
Then you want some of your experiences to reflect that teamwork work.

110
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.910
So choose a project that shows that you work collaboratively with other people.

111
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:18.290
Show what the end result was and what your individual contribution was, because you do not want to

112
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.000
put yourself in a situation where you worked in a team.

113
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.820
But.

114
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.770
You didn't do much work.

115
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.330
You want to show some kind of contribution.

116
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.240
You don't want to rest on other people's shoulders.

117
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.500
And that's not a good sign for for a hiring manager.

118
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:43.700
So if you want to impress your hiring manager, you want to show what your significant individual contribution

119
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.320
was while working.

120
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.690
And do this for every single job and every single project that you worked on.

121
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.810
And then top it off.

122
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:06.970
With your education and perhaps a list of all the softwares that you know and talk about community involvement

123
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.540
as well.

124
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:15.370
When you talk about community involvement, this shows that you are not just someone who takes home

125
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.180
a paycheck.

126
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:22.050
You want to be someone who's actually invested in improving the lives of others.

127
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.810
I know that.

128
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.040
That's what drives me.

129
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:33.720
And a lot of my mentorship, a lot of the free webinars that I conduct are aimed towards community involvement

130
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.960
and improving the lives of others.

131
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:44.430
So the more you do this, the more visibility you get, the more you can influence the lives of people

132
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.680
in a positive way.

133
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:53.160
So that's what people want to see, especially in a company that's driven, a company that focuses on

134
00:10:53.160 --> 00:11:00.000
experience and education and training, continuous improvement, things like that.

135
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.030
So that said.

136
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.840
Keep it simple.

137
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.990
Use a lot of keywords.

138
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:19.490
Use as many keywords as possible from your job description for which you're applying for and don't have.

139
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:27.640
Have a blanket address but don't use it to apply to jobs.

140
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:34.720
Tailor your resume for every single job description and.

141
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.050
Your resume has to have a good flow.

142
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.990
So your keywords key skills.

143
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:50.870
Need to be tied to the job description and then your experience need to be tied to the keywords.

144
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.740
And that's how you create a resume and match it to the job description.

145
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.480
Thank you very much.

146
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:05.860
I hope I was able to add value through this and I look forward to the next video.
