1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,530
When a hiring manager says You're great but you're missing some key skills, it usually means that the

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:14,130
details of the job description and what's relevant to who can solve the problem reveal themselves at

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,230
a later time in their own job search process.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,860
So when they started by posting to the job description.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,160
And they may not have considered every skill that's important for you or for anyone to perform the job

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,360
effectively.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,490
As they interview more and more candidates, some of these skills reveal themselves.

8
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,430
And usually it's later on.

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,180
And if you find yourself in that position, then focus only on your strengths and focus on what you're

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,990
willing to learn.

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,840
Now there are three things that you can do.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:00,370
You either you're willing to learn because you see your skills and.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,570
Your career going in that part, you're willing to learn a new skill.

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,500
You're willing to learn a new skill, but you don't want to make that the top priority for you because

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,840
it helps you perform a job well.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,410
It helps you get results, but that's not something that you wish to invest more time than it's necessary.

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,500
And then you have the skills that you're willing to not learn at all because they don't bring any value

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,010
to you.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,010
So identify which of these the skills that you're missing will lie under.

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:42,210
And if any of those skills lies under the first two categories, either the ones that you want to actively

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,110
invest time and effort in, or the ones that you're willing to learn for the sake of performing the

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:57,060
job, then be open about it and say that you're you're willing to learn whatever it takes and skills

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
can be taught, but attitude cannot.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:07,020
So most companies, even if you are missing key skills, will want to hire if you show them the right

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,710
attitude, because learning skills is just a matter of time.
