00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.610
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.980
This is the 20th video of this master class.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.120
And and we're going to see how we can build a relationship with your interviewer before and during.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.020
Now, before the interview, you presumably have been told the name of the person.

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.980
If you're at a walk in interview, then you will not have the chance to.

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:32.800
You may not have the chance to talk about your your interview or name and their interest and things

7
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.370
like that.

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.610
But if you do have the opportunity, you should definitely perform either a LinkedIn search or a Google

9
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.160
search just to find out what their interests are, what their leadership style is, what they care about,

10
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.940
things like that, perhaps even volunteering activities.

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.920
Now, once you have that in place, try to match that with what you have done, what your skills are,

12
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.210
what your interests are.

13
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.900
They would definitely be interesting conversation pieces.

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.660
They will also help you break the ice and establish a good communication channel that you can build

15
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.320
their own.

16
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.790
And they will also help you put your your own self at ease before and during the interview.

17
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.310
Let's talk about what you can do during the interview.

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.060
In.

19
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:37.850
Like I mentioned before, Chris was one of the leading FBI negotiators and the creator of of the Black

20
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.780
Swan Group.

21
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
He also wrote a book called Never Split the Difference.

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.600
And it's all about negotiating.

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.650
And if you haven't read that book or if you haven't watched his masterclass, I highly recommend it

24
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.440
because it is one of the best masterclass videos out there that you're ever going to find.

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.760
Huge fan.

26
00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.810
Anyway.

27
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.190
Chris Wallace talks about a few different tricks to establishing a relationship with people.

28
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.040
Now, like I mentioned before.

29
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.660
One of the fundamental things about human nature is the need to be heard.

30
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.740
And you can do that.

31
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.030
You can either be heard or make sure that you're projecting yourself in a in a way to your interviewer,

32
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.790
that you're hearing them, you're actively listening by mirroring them.

33
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.490
You want to show them that the two of you are on the same wavelength.

34
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.830
So how do you do that when your interviewer leans forward to talk to you, to convey something, then

35
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.180
you lean forward as well.

36
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.360
You don't need to lean all the way forward, but at least a gesture of forward leaning motion.

37
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.380
And that's enough.

38
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.220
When your interviewer picks up a glass of water to drink, then you can do the same thing.

39
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.230
You can always carry some water.

40
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.800
There's no rule against not drinking water during an interview or not having a coffee during an interview.

41
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.490
Sometimes people just function better with these things and you can always pick it up.

42
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.980
SIP at the same time if your interviewer changes their position.

43
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.380
Then you can end up doing the same thing.

44
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.140
You can also change your position a little bit.

45
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.560
What that tells the interviewer is, subconsciously, you're both kind of synchronized.

46
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.320
You're on the same wavelength, which means cosmically you're an extension of the same, let's say,

47
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.270
energy level.

48
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.830
Then people tend to trust you more.

49
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.650
People tend to open up when they notice that you're in sync.

50
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:59.830
Another good way to establish a relationship is to repeat the last few words of what your interviewer

51
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.370
says.

52
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.220
So when your interviewer asks you question, you rephrase the question and ask them back.

53
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.600
Is this what you want to know?

54
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.830
What that tells the interviewer is that you are actively interested.

55
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.230
You're listening to what they have to say and you're trying to understand the question clearly before

56
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.250
you respond to them.

57
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.330
When your interview interviewer gives you information, then you can always repeat the last few words

58
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.180
to show that you're paying attention, to show that you're invested in that conversation and your entire

59
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.660
focus is on the interview at that point of time.

60
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.950
A third way to do this is through your tone of voice.

61
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.310
Now, don't use commanding.

62
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.470
Tone of voice or commanding language during an interview.

63
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.670
You see what I did there?

64
00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.700
You don't want to use commanding body language or tone of voice because you're not there to upstage

65
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.540
your interviewer.

66
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.070
You're not there to take over from them.

67
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.280
You're not there to take their position away.

68
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.500
You're there to solve a problem.

69
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.240
And so it's imperative that you show a certain degree of difference because.

70
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.280
Invariably, your interviewer will be the one that.

71
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.410
You will be reporting to or there will be someone in a hierarchically higher position than you, and

72
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.760
you need to respect that.

73
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:44.840
So by showing by using either the slow, relaxed tone or slight upward inflection at the end.

74
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.180
You're showing submissive, submissive tone of voice, which means you're showing a little bit of difference.

75
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.010
You can do this while still projecting yourself as an expert.

76
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.720
It has nothing to do with that.

77
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.870
You just need to show confidence in your own skills and present yourself as an expert while at the same

78
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.500
time.

79
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.820
Don't projecting overconfidence.

80
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.050
Not saying that if you don't hire me, then it's your loss.

81
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.230
It doesn't always work that way.

82
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.780
Sometimes it might, but not always.

83
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:28.330
We'll talk about some of that in the future videos where we talk about some selling methods that you

84
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.990
could use effectively during the interview.

85
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:42.160
So at this moment, you're in an interview and you know what kind of body language you need to be using.

86
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.100
You also know what kind of research you need to be doing before your interview.

87
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:57.760
And at the end of this video, you'll know exactly what you need to do to build a relationship with

88
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.840
your interviewer.

89
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.740
Start before and continue that.

90
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.560
Continue to build a relationship during the interview.

91
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.140
The interview doesn't need to be questions and answers.

92
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.450
Have you done this?

93
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.170
Yes.

94
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.490
Have you done that?

95
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.090
No.

96
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.660
That's not very engaging.

97
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.630
And at the end of the interview, you think if you were interviewing ten candidates today, would you

98
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.150
remember yourself as a candidate?

99
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:36.480
Would have you created a memorable enough experience and left a happy memory in the mind of the interviewer

100
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.560
that they should even think about you if they've interviewed ten people?

101
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.560
That's the kind of relationship that you want to build.

102
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.720
Thank you so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
