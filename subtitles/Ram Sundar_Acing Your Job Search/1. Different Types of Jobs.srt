00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,970
Welcome to the first video.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,430
Let's take a look at the different types of jobs available in the market.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,700
Knowing what kind of jobs are out there and what excites you is important to your success.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,140
Usually you'll find this information in the job description, and if nothing is posted, you can safely

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,270
assume that it's a full time position.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,440
The first time that we're going to talk about the temporary part time or seasonal or temp jobs, as

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,470
you may call them, they're meant to fill a role temporarily.

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,850
It could be like on a daily basis.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:52,590
For example, I used to work at a bookstore at the start of the fall season because the bookstore on

10
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:00,390
campus needed help with restocking all the books and making sure that all the textbooks were available

11
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,790
and easily accessible to students who are going to start their school in the fall season.

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,320
Now, once that period was done, the bookstore didn't need us anymore, so we would have to find other

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,540
means of employment.

14
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:20,340
This would be temporary or seasonal employment now temporary full time.

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,860
These jobs are designed to meet the company's needs on a temporary basis, perhaps slightly longer than

16
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,930
the temporary seasonal jobs.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,860
For example.

18
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,340
Think of someone who's gone on maternity leave.

19
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,980
You need to fill their position.

20
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,310
Until this person returns to work.

21
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,480
Third kind we're going to talk about, ah, the contract and contract to hire Jones.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,730
Now from a company standpoint.

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:02:00,930
Contract jobs are attractive because they reduce or eliminate the risk associated with hiring a new

24
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,590
person.

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,830
Now, hiring a new person is not without risks.

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,930
And depending on your seniority and your job role, it can take up to 12, sometimes even 18 months

27
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,200
for a candidate, a new hire to actually start making money for the company.

28
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,360
This can include expenses like as simple as creating ID cards all the way to software licensing and

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,690
training and making sure that this new hire is able to independently execute all the tasks that they

30
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,860
were hired to perform.

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,490
The fourth kind is the consulting type now with a consulting gig.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,930
Your let's say you're a consultant, then you accept a job.

33
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:58,380
As a job order for yourself to solve a specific problem that exists in the company.

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,770
Once this problem is solved, you move on to the next task and possibly the next company.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,820
It allows you to explore the job market without being tied down just a contract job.

36
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:23,090
Consulting will give you the flexibility of being able to work for multiple employers in multiple industries

37
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,310
and see what's the most exciting to you without being tied down to a company.

38
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:36,320
Now, permanent, full time jobs, which are very common in a lot of specialized and professional fields,

39
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:44,450
they are said to be in a permanent job, of course, when you're employed with the company on a permanent,

40
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,690
full time basis.

41
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,530
Your salary comes from the company and your pay stub probably has your company's information on it.

42
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,880
Now, in the next video, we will take a look at what your resume could say about you.

43
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,730
And before then I have to mention that every job opportunity, no exceptions, every job opportunity

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,950
that is posted is designed to solve a problem.

45
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:20,990
And you as a job seeker have to project yourself as the one that can solve this problem better than

46
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,830
anyone else.

47
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,380
And that is what will get you your interview.

48
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,450
Thank you for watching.

49
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,510
I hope you found value in this and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
