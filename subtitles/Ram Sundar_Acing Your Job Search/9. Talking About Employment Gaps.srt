00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,800
Let's talk about employment gaps as we move out of COVID.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,130
It's not uncommon for people to have employment gaps.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,360
You could have had an employment gap for any number of reasons.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,440
You could have been laid off due to reorganisation.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,720
You could have taken an extended vacation.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,920
It stopped working to go back to school, started a family.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,910
You could be you could probably be looking for your ideal employment, and that's why you're there.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,440
Now, the most important thing is to not display shame or embarrassment in this.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,340
Everybody goes through an employment gap.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,760
A lot of people do at least, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:55,380
Talk about briefly state how long your employment gap was and why and what you have done in the meantime

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,020
to make yourself a better candidate.

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,930
And I strongly advocate going through coursework online or trying to improve a certain skill, make

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,430
yourself a better candidate, and position yourself better in the market.

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,680
And when you do that, then that's something that you can really leverage.

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,310
During an interview when talking about employment gaps.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,480
Thank you.
