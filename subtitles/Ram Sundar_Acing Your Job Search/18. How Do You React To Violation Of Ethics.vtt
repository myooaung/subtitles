00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.370
How do you react to a violation of ethics?

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:12.690
What if you see someone violating some kind of unspoken law, which is a violation of ethics or integrity,

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.620
things like that.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.150
Most companies, most good companies will want to hire stand up people, people who will stand up to

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.660
violations of ethics or the company's interests or lack of integrity, things like that.

6
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.880
And if a company does nothing about these about violations, think about really think about whether

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.850
you want to be working for this and for such a company.

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.950
Probably not, because then if something happens to you and you see something, then you will never

9
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.900
be in a safe space.

10
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.370
You will never be in a safe position to report a violation of ethics.

11
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.820
Right.

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.950
So if a company asks you a question on how you would react, talk to them about how you would follow

13
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.090
the chain of command.

14
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.410
And it's all based on workplace safety and workplace training is what your chain of command is.

15
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.430
When you see someone violating a certain law or violating something within the company, then you want

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.150
to report that to your immediate supervisor.

17
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.410
And if your immediate supervisor is the one, then you want to go up the chain or to the H.R. or talk

18
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.120
to the H.R. or someone in the company to see what the correct chain of command is.

19
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.970
And usually all this is outlined in training.

20
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.320
So your answer to such a question would ideally consist of something along these lines.

21
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:57.300
I would follow the chain of command and report it to the appropriate manager, and if I didn't know

22
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.070
who to report it to, I would talk to the HR and see who I should report it to.

23
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.190
But I assume that your training, the workplace training, covers violation of ethics and what constitutes

24
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.580
violation of ethics.

25
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.290
You can also talk about any incident.

26
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.560
If you've seen such an incident, if you've been part of it, then you can also talk about that too.

27
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.820
And it would serve as a good example during the call.

28
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.860
So during the interview.

29
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.960
So you're not just saying hypotheticals, but you're giving a concrete example of a situation where

30
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.070
it happened to you.

31
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.310
And again, the start approach, what happened?

32
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.220
What was the reason for that?

33
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.770
What did you do, what the action was that you took and what the end result was?

34
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.870
So that's a good way to back up your hypothetical response with hard data driven example.
