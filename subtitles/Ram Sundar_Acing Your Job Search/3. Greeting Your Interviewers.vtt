00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.210
Hi again and welcome to part 13 of this master class.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.780
Now, we're going to assume that you've been called for an interview and this is your time and this

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.660
is where you get to greet your interviewers.

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:23.780
Now, if you're in a phone call, if it's a phone interview, then obviously we talked about 93% of

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.850
your communication being nonverbal.

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.910
When you're on a phone call, then the entire body language part, which is 55%, gets taken out of

7
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.460
the equation because obviously they cannot see you.

8
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:47.000
So the remaining 45% of which 7% is what you say and 38% is your tone of voice.

9
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.990
These are still critical and these are what you will leverage during your phone call.

10
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.670
And to start with, you want to sound upbeat.

11
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:10.890
Now in his master class, Chris Voss, who was a leading FBI negotiator and he's also written the book

12
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.610
Never Split the Difference.

13
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.650
He talks about having three different tones of voice.

14
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.890
One is the late night FM deejay voice, which is when you want to come somewhere down.

15
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.150
And another is a submissive voice, which is ending sometimes with an upward inflection, and the third

16
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.190
is commanding.

17
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.960
You do not want to sound commanding.

18
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.040
You do not want to overpower your interviewer.

19
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.540
So when you greet someone, greet when you get that phone call, then introduce yourself with your name.

20
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.520
Hi, this is Sundar.

21
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.870
Or good morning.

22
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.890
This is Sundar or obviously whatever your name is.

23
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.650
That said, when you're in a video interview, the first thing you want to do is make sure that they

24
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.000
can hear and see you.

25
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.060
Okay, so introduce yourself.

26
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.840
Hi.

27
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.860
Good afternoon.

28
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.150
How are you today?

29
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.650
Things like that.

30
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.790
And then ask if they can see and hear you clearly if everything is okay and if automatically or all

31
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.660
of a sudden if the call video call is dropped or if the phone call is dropped, then is there a way

32
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.830
that you can contact them?

33
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.990
Again, this is a simple gesture that a lot of people miss out, but it will add a lot of value to the

34
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.170
interview, to your interview, and it will make you stand out as a candidate because you're taking

35
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.860
that extra effort to make sure that you're having the best experience and you're making sure that they

36
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.710
have the best experience and they have the best tools they need to gauge your interviewing skills.

37
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.400
When you interview in person, then you want to greet someone, of course, with a smile.

38
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.110
Of course, making eye contact.

39
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.810
And it's important to note that too much eye contact is also not good, as is not making any eye contact

40
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.230
at all.

41
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.170
And the reason for that is it's not a staring contest.

42
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.300
You want to make enough eye contact to give that person the impression that you're actively listening.

43
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.440
And the way to gauge yourself is you blink a certain number of times in a minute, and you can possibly

44
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.110
every time you blink, you can look away for a moment and then look back just to break the eye contact

45
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.410
for for a quick second and then come back to it.

46
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.300
When you shake hands, you want to shake hands by keeping your palm facing the side, not up or down.

47
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.600
This indicates submissive behavior and this indicates the dominating behavior.

48
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.370
You want to show neither of those.

49
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:13.070
When you use your other hand to touch someone's shoulder, for example, then that it's called a politician's

50
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.490
touch.

51
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.130
And it's not in your best interest to do that.

52
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.430
So let your other hand lose by your side and just use your dominant hand, your right hand to shake

53
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.360
twice and then let go, and that's it.

54
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.440
And when you shake, practice eye contact and say something, the correct response for how do you do

55
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.120
is How do you do?

56
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.180
It's not I'm fine or very well.

57
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.040
Whatever someone says, how do you do?

58
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.330
Then you say, How do you do?

59
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.300
And you can also greet and say good afternoon, good morning, good evening, whatever time of the day

60
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.900
it is.

61
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.270
And you can introduce yourself saying.

62
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.330
Good afternoon, Rahm.

63
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.740
Or I am Rahm or.

64
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.390
And that's it.

65
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.110
Now.

66
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.070
Don't focus too much on the handshake itself.

67
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.320
Keep it firm.

68
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.290
Not flaccid.

69
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.400
Not like this.

70
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.110
But keep it firm so that you can press firmly like this.

71
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.000
Shake twice and then let go.

72
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.960
And that's it.

73
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.600
Thank you very much for watching and I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next video.
