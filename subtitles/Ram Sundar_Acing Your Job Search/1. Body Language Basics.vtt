00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.810
Welcome to the next section, which is my favorite part, and it's about body language.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:18.050
Now, if you've seen my intro video, then you will know that I mentioned that 93% of all communication

4
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.870
is nonverbal, which means 38% of it is through your tone of voice, and 55% is through body language.

5
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:37.370
As humans evolved, the limbic brain has consistently been the one responsible for the most primal instincts.

6
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.650
And when people encounter an unfamiliar situation, one that could potentially cause discomfort to them,

7
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.610
then the limbic brain or the reptilian brain, as we call it, will trigger one of three different responses

8
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.680
in this order Freeze, flight and fight.

9
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.410
Now the first thing your brain will tell you to do when you encounter an uncomfortable situation is

10
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.130
to freeze.

11
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
And if freezing is not an option, then it will ask you to run away.

12
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.580
And if running away is not an option either, then your brain tells you to fight it out.

13
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.450
And for a lot of people, nervousness.

14
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.940
Because we live in a civilized society today.

15
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.720
You're not faced with a lot of potentially deadly, uncomfortable situations.

16
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.870
Sometimes you can, of course, and that's the sad fact of some of the situations that we encounter

17
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.220
today.

18
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.310
But other than that, in most situations, since we're talking about interviews here, interviews can

19
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.620
be overwhelming for a lot of job seekers and interviews can also be nerve wracking.

20
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.560
And this nervousness presents itself during the actual interview itself.

21
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.150
And a candidate wants to either freeze and not respond anymore or they want to run away or they want

22
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.870
to fight it out.

23
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:18.920
And it causes potentially negative reactions during the interview itself.

24
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.950
And I've mentioned to this time, and I've mentioned this to you time and again, that an interview

25
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.410
has to be an enriching experience and you have to allow yourself to feel nervous.

26
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.230
Only then you, your brain will say you're nervous, but it's okay because this is not a life threatening

27
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.920
situation.

28
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.130
If anything, it could be a life changing situation and you will no longer freeze.

29
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.910
You will not try to run away or fight the situation.

30
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.050
Now, the fundamental basis for finding out whether or not someone is having a good time, whether or

31
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:06.750
not someone is at peace with themselves, is to find out if they're comfortable or uncomfortable, or

32
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.810
rather comfort versus discomfort behavior.

33
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:18.210
And in order to find out what makes someone comfortable, you have to establish a baseline in an interview.

34
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.030
You want to put yourself in a position where you tell your brain that it's okay.

35
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.110
You want to trick your brain into feeling comfortable, even if you're not.

36
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.140
When that happens, then anything that's out of the ordinary.

37
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.260
For example, if I'm sitting here with with an open body posture, I'm not protecting any of my organs.

38
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.590
I'm comfortable sitting here in front of you and talking to you.

39
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.420
And all of a sudden I lean back and I cross my arms like this.

40
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.750
Then I'm no longer open to a conversation.

41
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.750
I'm no longer open to debate or whatever is happening at that moment.

42
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.570
That tells the other person that I'm not in a state of comfort anymore, so then I either want to freeze

43
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.000
or I want to run away, or I want to fight.

44
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.280
And I want to do neither.

45
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.840
None of those right now.

46
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.470
So that's said.

47
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.190
Let's take a look at a couple of pictures which show us what comfort and discomfort look like.

48
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.190
Now.

49
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.570
When?

50
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.780
You look at these people here, you see that they are all sitting down.

51
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.850
They're all displaying open body posture.

52
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.070
What that means is they do not feel vulnerable.

53
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.830
They have smiles on their faces.

54
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.910
Real or fake is a different story, but they have smiles on their faces.

55
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.110
They're displaying open body posture.

56
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.550
Their palms are raised up.

57
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.490
Then the lady on the left is showing a thumbs up sign.

58
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.230
And these are all good signs.

59
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.690
No discomfort.

60
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.730
When you look at these two people here, then you can clearly say that they're not comfortable.

61
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.600
How can you do that is because there is a lack of a smile on this person's face.

62
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.700
You can see that the facial muscles are really tense and it's the same with the lady in the picture.

63
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.660
Below is the muscles on the face are really tense.

64
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.080
The muscles on the shoulder are really tense and the arms, the arms are crossed here and here.

65
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.480
Someone in the picture below.

66
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.790
The lady is trying to remove her frustration on that pencil.

67
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.660
So then you know that these people are experiencing discomfort at that moment.

68
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.260
The best way to get success in an interview.

69
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:58.920
Besides learning how to say, besides learning what to say is to allow yourself to feel a little uncomfortable,

70
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.690
but at the same time, tell your brain that this is not a life threatening situation.

71
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.810
What's the worst that can happen?

72
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.410
You don't get the job.

73
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.780
Go ahead and improve.

74
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.300
Right.

75
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.860
So when you tell your brain that the worst thing, worst possible scenario is that you may not have

76
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.980
a job at the end of the interview, then you should also convince your brain that it's okay.

77
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.210
And when you do that, then during the interview you'll be much more comfortable than you would have

78
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.760
been if you think only about the consequences.

79
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.520
So the fundamental takeaway from this lesson today is.

80
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.130
Allow yourself to be nervous during an interview.

81
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.620
If you are feeling nervous because that itself will bring a sense of comfort to you.

82
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.930
And the whole premise of having a good interview and leaving the interviewer with a good experience,

83
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.020
a happy memory about you, lies on your display and comfortable behavior.

84
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.520
Thank you.

85
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.910
And I hope to see you in the next video.
