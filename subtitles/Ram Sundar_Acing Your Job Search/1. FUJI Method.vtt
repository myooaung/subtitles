00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.890
Hi again.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.460
Now we move on to the final step in this series, the final series in this master class, which is how

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
to answer some of the most difficult creative questions.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.970
But in order to do that, let's understand three different methods that are used effectively in sales

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.250
and to craft your responses.

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.050
The first one we're going to talk about in this video is called The Fuji Method, and it's called Fuji

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
because it's got four different ways in it.

8
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.350
Different influencers, different decision makers are influenced in one of four different ways.

9
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.440
F stands for fear of loss, u stands for urgency.

10
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.010
J stands for Jones Effect, and I stands for Indifference.

11
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.860
Now it's.

12
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.990
It's valuable information to you if you can find out what influences your interviewer.

13
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.390
Is it fear of loss?

14
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.110
Is it urgency?

15
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.340
Is it?

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.030
Oh, the Jones family has it.

17
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.830
And therefore you should get one too.

18
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.140
Which is the Jones effect?

19
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.500
Or is it indifferent?

20
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.960
So one way to do this is to throw in a little.

21
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.420
Teasers.

22
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.670
It's called teasers.

23
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.070
To find out which one has the most effect.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.720
So if you're in a position where if you're interviewing for a very specialized role, then it's possible

25
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.530
that.

26
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.020
If not you, then no one else can do it.

27
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.030
Or there's so much competition.

28
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.070
For candidates that if.

29
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.460
If the company doesn't hire you, if the interviewer doesn't hire you, then it's going to take them

30
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.830
a lot of effort to find someone else.

31
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.820
And the cost of that will be more than they're willing to pay.

32
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:24.580
Then fear of loss is a big motivator, which means that if you're in a role where you're the only person

33
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.800
that can do the job or you're one of only a handful of people that can do the job, you can say that

34
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.510
if you don't hire me, then it's going to cost the company in terms of money and time and effort, which

35
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.870
they're not willing to trade off.

36
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.800
It's a bad trade off.

37
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.920
Then that's where fear of loss works.

38
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.600
Urgency works when you want to be hired.

39
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
Let's say a company wants to hire someone immediately.

40
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.960
Because of the workload and because they've already spent some time searching for the right candidate.

41
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.990
And it hasn't worked.

42
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.050
Now they find someone and that someone is you.

43
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:18.050
You're sitting in front of them and they need to act fast because you probably already have a couple

44
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.540
of job offers or things like that.

45
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.380
Then urgency works, so you can test out any of these methods.

46
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.160
All of them do during the same interview, and you can see which one has the most effect, but it takes

47
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.500
a lot of practice to be able to do that.

48
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.680
So your primary focus should be on building a good relationship, and your other focus should be on

49
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.430
associating you with a happy memory in the mind of the interviewer.

50
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.530
When you do those, you're practically guaranteed that even if they don't call you for that job, even

51
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.920
if you don't do great, you will be on their minds.

52
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.670
Should a future position open up now?

53
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.770
Coming back to Fuji, we covered fear of loss.

54
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.970
We covered urgency.

55
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.720
Next we're going to do Jones Effect.

56
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.400
Someone else has a superstar candidate and you are missing that person in your team and therefore you

57
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.670
need to hire me because I am the one that can step in, fill in that gap, and solve your problem for

58
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.970
you.

59
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.730
Indifference.

60
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:39.260
This indifference is effective when you really indifference is effective for the so called rocket scientist

61
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.330
people, the ones that really analyze data, the ones that are very rational minded.

62
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.790
That's when you can tell them that here are the facts.

63
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.370
This is why I am a good hire.

64
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.810
This is why I'm able to solve your problem in a way that no one else can.

65
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.140
Now, whether you hire me or not, it's your call.

66
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.240
I don't care one way or another.

67
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.070
Then that's indifference.

68
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.110
What that does is it tells the other person that you're not desperate.

69
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.770
You do not want to appear desperate in a job search or an interview.

70
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.290
You might be that different.

71
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.530
You don't want to project it to the interviewer.

72
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.660
And when you do that, then you're showing indifference, which kind of triggers the curiosity in the

73
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.920
mind of the interviewer and and ask them to dig deeper into your experience and see whether you're really

74
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.660
a good fit.

75
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:47.630
And quite often, fear of loss and indifference are big motivating factors, and they're also big factors

76
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.600
in creating long lasting relationships.

77
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.130
Because when when you approach something with indifference, then, then, then you're kind of working

78
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:05.920
towards a set to, to towards a logical conclusion and you work everything out in your mind.

79
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.490
So does the interviewer.

80
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:16.560
And when they're approaching it from a point, a standpoint of indifference, then they justify to themselves

81
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.880
that you're a good liar.

82
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.770
You're not the one justifying to them.

83
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.580
They are doing that in their own minds.

84
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.740
And once they do that, then there is no going back.

85
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:34.480
When it is far more powerful for you to allow the interviewer to make their own decision to come to

86
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.470
their own conclusion, because then you will have a very strong say going forward.

87
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.850
You don't want to be the one begging them to see your point.

88
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.040
You want to just show them the way and let them make their own decision?

89
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.190
I hope this was helpful.

90
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.960
And the next video will look at something called the Star Method.

91
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:06.870
And this is used for situational questions and I hope I'm able to add value as I have been so far.

92
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.750
And I look forward to the next video.

93
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.110
Thank you.
