00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,030
Welcome to the next video in this masterclass, which is about maximizing your chances of success at

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,170
job fairs.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,980
Now, when someone has the right attitude, I can usually narrow down the lack of success to two things

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,040
either a lack of skills or a lack of guidance.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,640
And with the job fairs, you are not there to get hired.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,490
You might.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,980
But that's not the fundamental goal.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,180
That's not the primary goal of a job fair.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,260
A job fair.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,500
You need to approach it with the intention of building relationships.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:52,150
And in order to in order to get success at job fairs, you need to detach yourself from the outcome.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:59,050
You may or may not get a job, but doing the groundwork ahead of time will yield much, much better

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,820
results than if you're unprepared.

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:08,860
And if you just walk it in now, ensure that the job fair is at least two or three weeks ahead in time.

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,530
And you have to remember that all job fairs have a theme.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,600
Now, if it's not a if the companies are not specific to a region, then they're specific to an industry

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,810
or specific to certain skills.

18
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,550
So identify what kind of job fairs you're going to.

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:41,810
Is it a is it a job fair with all the companies in a certain location or is it a construction job fair

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,310
or an I.T. job fair?

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,270
Or what is it about?

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,960
Make sure that you try to upload your resume well ahead of time.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,020
So usually you have to register for a job fair.

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,880
And you can do this today.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,010
You can do this online.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:09,170
And when you do that, you might most likely you will have the opportunity to upload your resume.

27
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,410
And when you do that, also get a list of all the companies that will be presenting or that will have

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,850
stalls at this job fair.

29
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,400
Now, take special note of the ones that have triggered your interest, the ones that have jobs specifically

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,410
in your areas of strength.

31
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,040
This takes a lot of groundwork, by the way.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,820
Visit the website of each company that you've identified and apply.

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,540
Apply already to all the jobs, relevant jobs in the career section of each of those companies.

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,360
If they don't have one, try to find what jobs they have available through sources like Google or indeed

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,550
or Glassdoor or whatever.

36
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,120
Keep a list of all the positions that you've applied to.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,430
And this is critical because when you're organized, then your thoughts will be organized.

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:12,320
And when you enter the job fair, you will know exactly what what positions you have applied to at that

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,040
company.

40
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,780
And.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,750
You need to have a cover letter and a resume prepared for each company and Job wrote.

42
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:30,270
It helps her not apply to too many varying positions within the company because then the way you will

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,610
come across is that you don't know what you want.

44
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,490
You're indecisive or not focused and you don't want that.

45
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,360
Now read up about the company, read up about the core values, draw some inferences about the work

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,200
culture, and print out at least one copy of your resume for every position that you've applied to within

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,980
the industry.

48
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,710
And it's possible.

49
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:02,360
In fact, it's it's also a fantastic idea to create business cards if you can afford them on your own.

50
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:09,410
All you have is your name and contact details and perhaps a list of skills in the back or a couple of

51
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,070
keywords.

52
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:17,330
Don't make it too busy, keep it clean, and have your your own personalised business cards.

53
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:24,680
If, of course, if you can afford it and attach one business card to a copy of the cover letter and

54
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,010
the job description.

55
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:34,250
Now let's assume you're applying for a company, ABC, and you've applied to two positions there.

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,570
Then you want to have a copy of the resume that you used for each of those positions.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,320
Now, if you've followed my advice so far, then your resume might and most likely will be slightly

58
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,110
different for each position because you would have tailored that to the job description.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,230
Now, as long as it's not vastly different, you're fine because you've only chosen to retain what is

60
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,390
relevant for that job description.

61
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,530
Everybody works more than they can print on their resume at some point of time, and no one will judge

62
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:08,950
you for it.

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,970
Along with the résumé, you would also include the cover letter and the business card and be ready to

64
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,410
hand it over at the job fair.

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:26,770
Now, when you get to the job fair, spend some time and take note of the map if you can find it.

66
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,390
Or walk around and take note of the companies that are there compared to the list that you've made previously.

67
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,240
There could be some last minute new entrants.

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,530
There could be someone who dropped out last minute.

69
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,390
You never know.

70
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:48,070
So at that point, Mark, the ones that are most interesting to you.

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,990
And mark differently the ones that could be of interest to you.

72
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:04,150
And lastly, Mark off the ones that you find uninteresting or the also rans, as I may call them, when

73
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:12,130
you do this, you will spend a majority of your time among the companies and jobs that are very interesting

74
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,920
to you, that you would like to be a part of, that you would like to contribute, to walk over.

75
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,960
And when it's your turn to talk, don't ask them about the company.

76
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,700
Show them what research you have done about the company and tie that to how you are a good fit.

77
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,040
Talk about the work culture.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,960
Talk about their values.

79
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,920
Talk about what makes them unique and what makes you unique.

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,690
You're showing them that you've done the research and you hand them a copy of your resume.

81
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:54,910
And don't say that I would like to apply because this is something that you would have done already

82
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,330
when you registered or well ahead.

83
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,360
So most likely when you hand them a copy of the resume, you're just putting a face to the name and

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,030
that's it, or you're helping them do that.

85
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,630
And when that happens, most likely people will get impressed by the amount of groundwork that you have

86
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,430
done and your chances of getting a call to an interview will be higher.

87
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,330
Not just because of the impression that you create, but also because you would have applied a couple

88
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:33,120
of weeks before the job fair, which also means that they would have had a couple of weeks to go through

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,930
your resume to identify that you're possibly a good candidate.

90
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,470
And when you present yourself well, then you are just further.

91
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,550
You're likely to improve your chances of getting an interview.

92
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,130
Now dress well, dress.

93
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:57,480
Always dress appropriately for a job fair, depending on the dress code, depending on the level of

94
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,830
education and the level of seniority that you're looking for.

95
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,190
Always remember that it's better to be overdressed than to be underdressed.

96
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,060
You do not want to go in a polo shirt and jeans when you're looking for a professional job that involves

97
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,280
a high level of responsibilities.

98
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,180
Thank you.

99
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,510
And I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
