00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,200
Let's talk about what you need to do before your interview.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:13,530
Now, ideally, in an in-person interview, you print out copies of your resume, as many copies as

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,650
the number of interviews you're going to be facing.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:25,850
And if it's your if it's a video interview, then you would have a copy of your resumÃ© open.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,750
So just in case you want to share your screen, then it makes it easy to do.

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:39,060
Now you will make a list of all the keywords from the job description and highlight the ones that match

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,670
your resume and your skills.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,890
Now that will be for easy reference, but it will also attract attention.

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,520
You should familiarize yourself with company specific information like their core values, their mission,

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,800
their vision, facts and figures.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,640
If that makes sense, depending on what role you're going for and the higher the seniority, the more

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,270
you want to know about the company.

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,380
Otherwise, talk about the work culture, look at the reviews on Glassdoor, and indeed look at what

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,840
other employees have to say about working for the company and try to empathize with those values and

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,660
see how much commonality you can get.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,100
You should also look at the LinkedIn profiles of your interviewers, if possible, to find out if you

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,620
can get some common ground and understand their background and what kind of leaders they are, where

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,050
they may have worked, and what you can find in common with your own experience.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,880
Write down at least two or three questions to ask the interviewers now in person.

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,480
When you have a copy of your resume, one is your personal copy where you have the list of keywords

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,400
and you have the list of questions that you want to ask the interviewers.

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,580
Then that automatically shows the interviewers that you've done some homework.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:16,430
And you know, about the company and the copies that you hand out to these interviewers will be just

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,420
plain nothing written on them, and that's just for their reference.

25
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,850
And they can choose to write whatever they want.

26
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,980
Now, another thing to do if you're in a video interview is to have sticky notes with little prompts

27
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,960
similar to teleprompters.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:41,330
But here you can stick them to the sides of the screen and they might even help you answer some of the

29
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,770
difficult questions.

30
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,880
And you also could get away with typing your elevator pitch and having it in front of you on the screen,

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,350
in word or notepad or whatever you feel comfortable using.

32
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,970
The reason for that is, although I'm looking at the screen right now, if I look away and I were reading

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:12,440
from there without actually moving my eyes from left to right like this, then I could do a better job

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
than having to memorize it.

35
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,890
Of course, I did say in the previous video that it's important to memorize it.

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,400
So even if someone wakes you up from sleep, you're able to recite your elevator pitch.

37
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,440
But in case you are not confident enough to do that, it's always a good idea to have that open in front

38
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,690
of you during your interview because the Tell Me About Yourself question is what you will respond with

39
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,270
your elevator pitch, and that will set the tone for the rest of the interview.

40
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,150
Now, next video, we're going to talk about video interviews and phone interviews.

41
00:03:50,150 --> 00:04:00,290
So I hope I was able to add value here and hopefully you have enough information to prepare for your

42
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,900
interview and what kind of homework you need to do before your interview.

43
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,680
Thank you.
