1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,650
There's another question.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,710
It's a dated one, but a lot of interviewers still like to ask this question.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,580
It's where do you see yourself in five years?

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,340
I'm not a big fan of this question because a lot of things can happen in five years.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,180
And it's important to set goals.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,230
For example, I read close to 50 books in a year.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,100
I pick certain activities that I wish to accomplish, and I do accomplish by the end of the year.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,730
And if I don't, then I'm at least a certain percentage close to completion.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,430
And I talk about or I justify to myself why I was not able to finish them and what I can do.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,470
And these are all related to personal and professional development.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:57,090
Now, if you are driven, if you are a driven individual and trying to continuously improve, then you

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,660
should get into the habit.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,470
If you are not there already, then you should get into the habit of setting goals for yourself.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:11,220
And these will not just be professional goals, but they should be personal goals as well.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,480
Things that help you improve not just in your career but as a person.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,960
Help involve help get involved in in the community.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,800
Give back to the society by mentoring somebody or by leveraging your skills to see how you can benefit

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,790
the society.

19
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,900
Things like that.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,790
Now, the reason I even talked about all of this is because they kind of relate to how you see yourself

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,110
in five years and for most people.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,820
That would be relevant to their job interview at hand.

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:57,120
And you would not you should not say the other side of this desk or in your position or something like

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,360
that.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,490
That doesn't make sense because.

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,430
You do not want to come across as threatening to the interviewer.

27
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,740
And when you don't come across as threatening.

28
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:15,790
Then your interviewer might like you because they see that you are a goal oriented individual.

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,840
You care about your personal development.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,360
You care about growth.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,940
You have a drive.

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,910
But at the same time, your drive is not to upstage anybody in the company.

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,650
Your drive is just to grow.

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,190
And that's what you want to convey through this.

35
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,390
So when someone asks you, where do you see yourself in five years, you can answer that with tact and

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,900
say, These are the goals that you've set for yourself and this is where you wish to be professionally

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,890
and personally.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,870
Now, for example, you can also think about everything that's involved from start to finish in a typical

39
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:06,290
project in your field, and you can talk about how many things you've been a part of for.

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:15,110
As an example, let's talk about manufacturing with the when a product comes to market and it's sold

41
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,960
in the market, that's the end.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,810
But the beginning is when the product is identified as a result of a need.

43
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,130
So a need exists in the market and there's nothing to fulfill that need.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,080
And that's where someone comes up with the idea of a product that can fulfill that need.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,490
And then they go about getting specifications and then they translate those specifications into concept.

46
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:48,440
And then the concept is translated into a detail design, which is then manufactured and tested and

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:57,140
assembled, put together, and then the finishing stages it's sent out to the customer after creating,

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:04,190
let's say, documentation, user manuals, agreements, things like that, and making sure that it not

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,020
only meets the needs, it does what it's supposed to do, and it does it in the best way possible.

50
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:16,400
Now, what I just mentioned to you, I was I walk you through the entire product development lifecycle

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,880
there.

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:26,210
And if you're in in the in the product development field, then you can think about or consider every

53
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,760
stage that you have personally been a part of that you have personally contributed to.

54
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,080
And over the next year, two years, five years, whatever, what other stages would you like to be

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
a part of?

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,690
What else can you contribute to to become a more well-rounded individual?

57
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,760
Now, that's from a professional standpoint, and then you can talk about supplementing that with something

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,200
that improves your skills.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,860
So did you learn a new software or did you learn a new tool?

60
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,100
Did you attend some kind of leadership courses?

61
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,020
Did you study, let's say, business law or.

62
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,580
It doesn't matter.

63
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm just throwing out examples here.

64
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,990
But think about how this would apply to your field.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,430
Think about a project and think about what what your contribution level is and base your answer from

66
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,580
that and start with that and think about what else you can do in the next five years that will help

67
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,860
you grow professionally and personally.
