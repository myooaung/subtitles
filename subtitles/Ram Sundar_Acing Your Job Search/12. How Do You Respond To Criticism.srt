1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,780
Here's another question.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,270
Tell me how you handle criticism.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,380
Now, this is kind of a curve ball question because they want to see how well you handle criticism,

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,480
but also whether you're a team player.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,790
It's a lot of questions rolled into one.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,010
What if your manager gave you an unfavorable appraisal at the end of the year?

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,310
How would you handle it?

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,520
What if someone told you that your work was not up to par and how you handled it?

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,450
So a lot of questions rolled into one.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:46,540
Now, if you cannot think of any experiences or any examples from your previous work history, then

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,450
you can talk about things like your school or your personal life, your sports, whatever.

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:59,320
But be ready to come up with an example and this is something you should do well beforehand when you're

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,440
rehearsing all your answers and talk about what the criticism was.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,950
But before that, talk about the task again, your your following the state approach, your situation,

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,720
what the situation was.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,240
And why you received criticism, which is the task in this case?

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,110
It's not a task.

18
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,840
But what who criticized you and what did they say then?

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,760
Action what you did.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,450
That would impact this situation positively and what the result was.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:47,310
So it always helps to to keep a positive attitude and to also maintain lessons learned, if not in a

22
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,460
journal, then you can always do that right here.

23
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,560
But you want to keep a record of lessons learned, so you're continuously growing and improving yourself.

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,030
I am not the same person that I was ten years ago or 15 years ago because I've learned so much and my

25
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,730
mind has expanded from what it was before.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:17,280
And and when someone has criticized me, then I've generally taken that as an opportunity to improve

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,940
myself.

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:25,620
So that would be the way you would frame your response to this question is how you took the criticism

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:33,180
and didn't take it personally, but you applied it as as a means to improve yourself.

30
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,200
So from where you were using the criticism to where you are today, and that's what you want to convey

31
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,130
through this.
