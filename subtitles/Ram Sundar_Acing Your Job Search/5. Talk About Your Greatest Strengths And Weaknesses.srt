1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,470
Tell me about your greatest strength or your greatest weakness.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,310
Now, the strategy for both of these questions is the same.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,340
First of all, you do not want to appear either overconfident or depressing.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:23,980
You do not want to absolutely open yourself up and and project yourself as a weak candidate instead.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,270
As far as strengths go.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,640
Think of specific examples.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,650
The same goes for weaknesses.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,570
Well, don't just jump in with a random adjective or something like that.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh, I'm a workaholic or I care too much.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,610
No, that's that's not a good way.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,060
That's not a good approach to doing this, although a lot of people say that it's okay.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,600
The best way to approach it is actually through specific examples.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,320
So any of these questions, you can always give a specific example and then demonstrate to the interviewer

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,480
how that made you feel, what made you feel like that and what you did.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:14,670
So greatest strength, for example, you want to show using a specific example what your greatest strength

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,060
is.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,690
And if you've gone through the job description or if you've gone through the core values of the company

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,170
or the word culture, then you will have an idea of what quality to display as your greatest strength.

19
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,390
For example, if a company values.

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:44,520
Integrity or honesty, then you can always say, for example, a hypothetical situation.

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:57,730
I could say I was in in one of my previous companies, I saw someone trying to do this, trying to disregard

22
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:07,420
existing products and and try to buy new, new, for example, camera lenses, try to buy new camera

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,870
lenses, each one costing upwards of $10,000.

24
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:18,790
Then what I did was I identified that there were still some lenses available that we had never used,

25
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,920
and instead of throwing them away and ordering new ones, I said, we can just use them.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,720
And through this simple gesture, I saved the company $20,000 because we needed two lenses.

27
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,040
What I did was I stood up for the company.

28
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,030
Even though I was talking to a colleague, I was I stood up for the company.

29
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:50,680
I tried proactively to save the company money by by identifying products that had been that would have

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,130
otherwise been neglected or just trashed.

31
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,210
So what did I do there?

32
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:02,740
I displayed integrity and I displayed value for the companies time and money.

33
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,130
And these are valuable qualities to have.

34
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,270
So that would be an example of a strength.

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,890
You don't want to say.

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,920
My greatest strength is this.

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,700
And then stop.

38
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,670
That's not a good approach for weakness.

39
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,560
There's a couple of schools of thought.

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,410
One way to do it is to disguise a strength as a weakness.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,770
For example, you had to work.

42
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:36,290
Being a workaholic might be considered a weakness, but at the same time, if you're a person of the

43
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,800
company, then you're you go above and beyond to ensure that your work is done.

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,770
And even if that means having to work overtime, then you're disguising a strength as a weakness.

45
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,330
That's one approach.

46
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:58,460
And another approach would be to choose a weakness that has nothing to do with the job at hand.

47
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:05,960
It doesn't have anything to do with any qualities that that you might need to fulfill your roles and

48
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,430
responsibilities properly.

49
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,850
Right.

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:17,670
For example, you might want to do you might be interviewing for once again a marketing job.

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:26,950
And if you are, then things like being being a good salesperson, having good people skills, being

52
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,650
empathetic in your communication, these might be important to your success in the role.

53
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,660
But what's not important, probably being bad at math, I'm not sure.

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:48,850
So then you want to pick something that's that's completely unrelated to your job roles and the responsibilities

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:55,930
that you will be fulfilling in your job role and using that so it doesn't affect you negatively in any

56
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,270
way.

57
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:03,610
There are two different schools of thought and it's difficult to ascertain which one is better because

58
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,940
they both work in different situations.

59
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:15,160
As for my personal preference, I would I would keep it relevant to the job description itself and perhaps

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,680
disguise a strength as a weakness.

61
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,270
Or I would say what started out as a weakness.

62
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:32,470
For example, a couple of videos prior we saw about manufacturing and how someone saved tens of thousands

63
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:40,720
of dollars by correcting the manufacturing drawings instead of allowing them to to be manufactured and

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,390
costing the company tens of thousands of dollars.

65
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,870
So in that situation, what started off as a weakness ended up as a strength.

66
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,350
So in that situation, you're not disguising anything.

67
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,550
You're starting off with some mistakes that you made and you're showing what you did to proactively

68
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:10,430
correct yourself and ending with what you have learned, the lessons learned and what why exactly.

69
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,120
You have not repeated that mistake ever again.

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,220
And that's what people want to hear.

71
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,660
And that would be my favorite approach there is be honest, but at the same time show what you've done

72
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,980
to correct yourself.
