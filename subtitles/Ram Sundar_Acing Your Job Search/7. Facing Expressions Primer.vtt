00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.030
Hi again and welcome back to this masterclass on job search and interviewing.

2
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.870
I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about microexpressions.

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:27.010
Now, Dr. Paul Ekman of the Pokemon Institute is known as the father of Micro-expressions, and he travelled

4
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.840
around the world for more than 20 years and he captured pictures of people from the remotest parts of

5
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
the world all the way to the most civilised and most urban parts of the world.

6
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590
And he proved that expressions of human emotion are universal.

7
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.750
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what your social standing is.

8
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.560
You will always display emotions the exact same way.

9
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.360
And there's only a few different human emotions.

10
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.860
As you can see on the screen.

11
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.240
There's happiness.

12
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.860
There's sadness.

13
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.950
Well, happiness is not included here, but there are only seven expressions of human emotion happiness,

14
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.450
sadness, contempt, surprise, anger, disgust and fear.

15
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.390
And each of these manifests differently based on the situation you're going through.

16
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.400
But the important thing to remember and why these things are called micro-expressions is because they

17
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.120
appear on the face for less than a 10th of a second, sometimes way less than that, sometimes a little

18
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.660
longer, but usually in fractions of a second.

19
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.060
And there are right and wrong emotions to display during an interview.

20
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.050
Now, these things, these expressions cannot be controlled.

21
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.790
And when you're facing a situation, then your body will automatically react.

22
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.330
In a certain way when you're enjoying when you're having a good time, then you will see happiness that

23
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.160
will manifest itself on your face, the exact way that it manifests for anyone else in the world.

24
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.360
So how do you control them then?

25
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.310
The best thing to do is to put yourself in the state of mind where you're at ease, where you're comfortable.

26
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.740
Some expressions you should absolutely never show in an interview are anger, disgust, contempt.

27
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.310
Contempt is the only asymmetrical expression.

28
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.680
If you look at the picture in the top row, in the middle.

29
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.900
That's contempt.

30
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:50.160
And it's characterized by the corner of your mouth and just one side moving out and closer to you.

31
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.610
And the rest of the face has no indicators.

32
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.390
So.

33
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.800
The contempt itself is is very bad because it's it comes from a point of higher moral ground.

34
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.880
You feel like you're morally better than the other person.

35
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.730
And that's not a good expression to display, because then you're no matter what the other person says,

36
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.890
you cannot take them seriously.

37
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.530
And you you believe that somehow you're superior to the other person.

38
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.170
And that's why contempt is a very destructive emotion.

39
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:37.140
Now, anger also cannot be controlled, but anger is characterized by tensing the muscles of the face

40
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:47.280
and especially tensing of the the eyelids and your eyebrows moving down and in an inverted triangle.

41
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.940
And tensing of the upper lip.

42
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.880
So an clenching of the jaw is another one.

43
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.970
Anger is not to be displayed in an interview because you want it to be present.

44
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.920
And when you leave the interview room, you want them to associate you with a happy memory.

45
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.170
So some.

46
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.640
Emotion.

47
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.060
A couple of emotions that you can display.

48
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.620
Surprise, happiness.

49
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:24.160
Usually keep yourself upbeat, keeping yourself comfortable and putting your mind at ease by telling

50
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.000
it that this is not a situation to be afraid of will automatically drive the other emotions away so

51
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.650
you won't feel the need to show them.

52
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.780
And your body will not feel like you need to display fear or anger or whatever.

53
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:46.360
If you're having a bad interview, then just say you will do better and just focus on the present moment.

54
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.150
Don't focus on what is already happened.

55
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.420
If you've already had a bad interview, there's nothing you can do about it.

56
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
So focus on how you can improve your life from that moment on.

57
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:05.660
And for of course, if you want to know more about microexpressions, then you can always check out

58
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.930
the Web and visit the Ekman Institute.

59
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.960
And that helps.

60
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.570
The Paul Ekman Institute really focuses on improving relations by being able to decode the face and

61
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.390
by learning to read micro-expressions.

62
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:32.030
But anyway, for the purposes of this interview masterclass, we will limit this to to saying that.

63
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:40.000
You need to display positive emotions, and that can only be done if you put your mind in a positive

64
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.570
state.

65
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.870
Now, that said.

66
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.590
When you present yourself at an interview, then you you want to avoid unnecessary facial movements.

67
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.320
So think and process what information the interviewer is giving you.

68
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.630
And if the interviewer is asking you a question, then resist the urge to sell yourself.

69
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.660
Resist the urge to answer immediately.

70
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.900
It's not a rapid fire round and no one is going to ding with points for answering a couple of seconds

71
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.380
late.

72
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.990
Stop.

73
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.090
Process that information.

74
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.930
Ask the interviewer if this is what they want to know and then formulate your response.

75
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.480
Avoid filler words.

76
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.550
Avoid words like well, things like that.

77
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.680
Because they take away from the essence of what you want to say.

78
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.430
And the longer it takes for you to get to a point, the more frustrating it becomes.

79
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.570
So that's about facial expressions.

80
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.130
And thank you for watching.

81
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.590
I look forward to the next video and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
