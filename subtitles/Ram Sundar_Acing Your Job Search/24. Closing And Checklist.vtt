00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:11.320
So here we're going to talk about a quick checklist and what to do going forward, what what you should

2
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.500
have achieved if you've followed all the directions in this master class so far.

3
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.540
So, first of all, with your resume, you should get at least four people to review your resume.

4
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.860
One of them should preferably be someone with a background in English or a good command of the language,

5
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:43.180
because their responsibility should be to to check your resume for typos, for grammatical errors,

6
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.240
for incomplete sentences, things like that.

7
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.720
You can also use Grammarly if you wish to, that can do the same job.

8
00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:02.590
And Grammarly will also suggest ways to make the sentences stronger and avoid repeated uses of certain

9
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.640
words like successfully or proactively.

10
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.990
Because when you use them in your resume, then you want to show how you did it as well.

11
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.050
So that's it.

12
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.040
The second person would preferably be someone in the creative field.

13
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.310
They can look at your resume from from a look and field standpoint.

14
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.240
Does your resume stand out or does it just look plain black and white?

15
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.600
People don't need to be printing resumes anymore.

16
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.290
They still do.

17
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
But most people just look at your resumes on the computer.

18
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.070
So when they look at your resume, you want it to make a good first impression.

19
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.210
You should make them want to call you.

20
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:52.360
So once again, your resume shows the interviewer how you are going to solve their problem.

21
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.300
So your resume cannot be a generic resume.

22
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.350
It has to be tailored specifically to that job description.

23
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.150
And that's what the keywords and everything that we talked about in the resume video.

24
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:16.270
Now, as far as your chances of getting hired go, it also depends on your ability to pass the ATS,

25
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.370
which is the applicant tracking software that a lot of companies use.

26
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.130
So you want your resume to show certain keywords that are in the job description and how they match

27
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.750
up to your experience as well, where it's not just about including keywords, it's about including

28
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.600
them as well as mentioning where exactly you've used those skills or, or gained knowledge.

29
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.400
So network with a lot of people in your field.

30
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.260
Get to know what skills are required for success in the field.

31
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.250
Get to know people in the same field.

32
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820
Different sub industries.

33
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.410
So let's say within law there could be real estate law, there could be tax law.

34
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.410
So many different kinds of family law.

35
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.280
So.

36
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.860
Get to know people from different fields and even within the same field, get to know people from that,

37
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.640
specialize in different things and see what works for you.

38
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.430
If you already have a specialization, then that's great.

39
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.200
So list out the skills that will make you successful even without a job.

40
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.730
And that is what will keep you ahead of everybody else when it comes to interviewing even, or when

41
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.100
it comes to getting a job.

42
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.960
Not just any job, but getting paid high.

43
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.770
Coming across as a superstar candidate.

44
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.900
Moving on to the next section, you should rehearse your answers.

45
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.520
So make a checklist with every single question that I've addressed.

46
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:15.630
And talk about every create an answer, create a response of your own and use a specific example from

47
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.640
your life addressing that.

48
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:26.990
For example, if you're talking about your greatest strengths, then come up with a specific example.

49
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.290
And provide data driven.

50
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.100
Evidence or not even evidence, but provide data.

51
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.000
Talk about what made any what made something, what it was and what you did and things like that.

52
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.860
But don't keep it abstract.

53
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.090
See what I did?

54
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.730
Don't keep it abstract.

55
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.230
Talk about exactly what the situation was, exactly what you did, what the result was, and how that

56
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.900
shows your greatest strength.

57
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.760
Or what quality does that show?

58
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.850
So.

59
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:11.110
Prepare one or two responses for every single one that will give you an idea of how to proceed.

60
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.500
Then combine that with your body language part.

61
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:23.160
So you're going to learn or you're going to you should have gone through the body language section of

62
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.800
this master class already.

63
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.880
So you will combine the nonverbal and the verbals together and rehearse.

64
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:38.190
If you don't want to do it in front of a mirror, then just set up a zoom call and just sit in front

65
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.800
of the camera record.

66
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.980
And just play it back.

67
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.750
See how it feels.

68
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.340
And get an idea of what energy you're trying to portray, what you're trying to convey to the interviewer.

69
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.570
Is it one of positivity and optimism, or are you showing nervousness and negativity?

70
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.500
If there's nervousness, keep going back until you're perfect.

71
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.060
Your body language and your words.

72
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.850
So this brings to an end.

73
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.080
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.

74
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.510
So this brings to an end this masterclass.

75
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.300
Over the next couple of videos, I'm going to be to tell you a little bit about how to get in touch

76
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.790
with me and creating your unique selling proposition.

77
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.250
So thank you very much for being a part of this course.

78
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:47.690
I truly appreciate you having having stayed this long, and I hope that I've been able to add value.

79
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:55.800
And of course, like I mentioned before, feel free to leave any specific questions in in the comments

80
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.380
or send them my way.

81
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.100
I'll talk about how to get in touch with me and you can send me specific questions and I will do my

82
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.330
best to answer them.

83
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.270
So thank you again and my very best to all of you.
