Here's another trick question that you can be asked during an interview.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:13.300
Now, most companies receive and are required to undergo training and sensitivity or ethics and things

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.050
like that.

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.440
But still, there might be the off chance that you will meet a hiring manager that will ask you this

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:29.530
question Can you work under someone of a specific gender or can you work under someone younger or something

6
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.060
along these lines?

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.840
And even though the chances of getting asked this question are very slim, it's it's useful to know

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.270
what to say and not have to say it.

9
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.480
Then being asked the question and not knowing what to say.

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.050
Right.

11
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.710
So let's analyze this for a moment.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.280
If a company has promoted someone regardless of their gender, regardless of their age or years of experience,

13
00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.880
based purely on their skills, their competence and their abilities, then that says a lot about the

14
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.630
company itself, that says that the company looks past all these details and focuses only on what is

15
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.480
important, which is your competence, which is a sum of everything your abilities, your aptitude,

16
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.470
your skills, your drive, your motivation, everything.

17
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.860
So that's what you need to be successful in your job.

18
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.040
And if a company has promoted such a person, then the chances are that you will receive the same treatment.

19
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:37.690
So even though this may be an uncalled for question, you can still treat it as a positive because it

20
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
means that the company is looking only at your ability to do your job.

21
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.490
So the correct answer here would be why not?

22
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.970
If someone if you're working under someone that's younger than you, why not?

23
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.080
What's the harmony?

24
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.350
As long as that person knows the job well and is a good leader, then age is irrelevant.

25
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.070
Thank you.

26
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.260
And I'll see you in the next video.
