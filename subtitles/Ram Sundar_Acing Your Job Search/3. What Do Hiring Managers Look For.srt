00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,010
Welcome to the third video in this lecture series.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,220
What do recruiting managers and hiring managers look for?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,990
Generally speaking, a job posting is meant to solve a problem within the company or the department.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,680
There's a problem in a company.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,640
You didn't create it.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,840
It's already there.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,870
The company has decided that this problem needs to be solved by a new hire.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,220
In other words, the consequences of letting the problem remain are not acceptable.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,860
And this is when a company posts a job with the list of skills that they think is necessary to solve

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,640
their problem.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,150
And that person with those skills could be you.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,700
Now staffing companies operate on a many to many basis.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,520
What that means is they serve many companies.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,790
And usually have many candidates on file that they can tap into.

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,220
To help fill these positions for their clients, the companies.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,410
So it follows that a staffing company is looking to fill the needs of their client and will look for

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,040
a candidate that closely matches the job description.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,000
You have to remember here that the more general order, the lower the level of experience for a job,

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,530
the more competition there could be for this job posting.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,970
Specialized roles have lesser competition.

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:38,370
But it also means that their chances of finding the ideal candidate could be less because this ideal

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,890
candidate could be employed at a different company.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,270
Now, when there are two candidates with very similar experiences and attitudes, then companies, including

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,660
staffing companies, they try to find the one that's most eager to get the job, the one that's most

25
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,600
motivated, the the proactive one.

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,800
Now, a perfect match in terms of attitude and experience, of course, would be the perfect candidate,

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,350
100% matching the job description skills and 100% of the attitude.

28
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:20,250
Now, someone is a reasonable match in terms of experience, but has strong soft skills, strong qualities

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,350
such as attention to detail, critical thinking and so on.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,580
Then they would be a good match.

31
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:34,560
The least desirable match would be someone who has the experience but no other attributes to go with

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,890
it.

33
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,240
So.

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,020
The questions to think about here are what does it mean to be a team player?

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,970
As an example, someone who's invested in the collective success of the group and someone who puts the

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:58,020
needs of the team above their own personal needs, someone who can collaborate with others to solve

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,810
problems.

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:06,720
Think of all the instances in your professional and personal life where you've had to show teamwork,

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,610
dedication, focus, attributes like this to solve a problem.

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,490
List at least three of them down.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:22,020
Think about six different things for every single incident or example.

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,270
What the issue was.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,760
What were the consequences of not acting on the cost of continued inaction?

44
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,610
What you did.

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,990
What qualities you displayed, such as teamwork, dedication, motivation, focus.

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,210
Quality, critical thinking.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,220
Any number of these things.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,130
What people you interacted with and the end result.

49
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,050
Now once you've done this.

50
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,650
These will serve as examples that you can share during your interview.

51
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,770
In the next video, we will take a look at how to decode a job description.

52
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,440
Thank you for watching.

53
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,700
I hope I'm able to add value.
