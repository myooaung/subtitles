00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.290
A common question that comes up during interviews, especially when you will be collaborating with a

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.350
lot of different teams or a lot of different members within the same team is how do you respond to conflicts

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.100
at work?

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.400
Now, if you've ever had or been part of a conflict at work, then this should be very easy for you

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.150
to say.

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.150
For for you to build your case around.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.350
If you have not been a part of conflict at work, then you don't have a benchmark.

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.070
So think about if you've ever been in a conflict anywhere at school, perhaps at home.

9
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.790
How did you respond to that?

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.950
The best way.

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
The underlying question here is, are you a team player?

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.100
Do you put the needs of the team and the company above your own personal needs?

13
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.420
Now, that said, the way you want to approach it is you want to state the root cause of the conflict

14
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:13.020
and what your views were and what the other person's views were and what you did to proactively defuse

15
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.400
the conflict and then talk about what the end result was.

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.300
You can always use the starter approach here the situation, the task, the action and the response.

17
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.830
So you want to with the situation, you want to talk about the root cause and the task was what you

18
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.180
did to resolve that problem.

19
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.800
What?

20
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.170
And in between you will also talk about how you felt and how the other person felt and you're going

21
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.450
to empathise with them.

22
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.960
So you will not just be presenting your view.

23
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.540
You will talk about how the other person felt and why you feel they felt that way.

24
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.330
Do not badmouth other people.

25
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.950
Do not badmouth your colleagues.

26
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.620
Don't talk trash about them and try to keep it professional.

27
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.700
And to the point, do not display emotions at this point.

28
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.040
You're trying to convey information.

29
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.340
You're not trying to convince anyone of anything.

30
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.480
They want to see if you are a team player or not and you want to show them not just the team playing

31
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.380
stuff, but also your critical thinking, which is very, very important to solving problems and solving

32
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.670
conflicts and just like solving problems the same thing.

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.400
Thank you very much.

34
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.670
And let's take a look at the next question in the next video.
