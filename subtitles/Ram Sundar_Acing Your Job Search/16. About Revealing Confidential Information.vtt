What do you do when you're asked to reveal confidential information about a previous project or employer?

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.020
Now, a lot of times when companies ask you for confidential information, it's because they don't know

3
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.400
that it's confidential.

4
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.220
Sometimes it can be because they don't care.

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.520
Sometimes it can be because they're testing to see if you are the type that will reveal confidential

6
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.420
information.

7
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:38.630
Anything that any company your previous employer could be jeopardized from if it became public knowledge

8
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.890
is confidential information.

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:49.790
A lot of times technical documents, manuals, those are confidential and they're indicated on either

10
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.380
watermark or in the footer or the header.

11
00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:02.870
The level of confidentiality company confidential, top level, top secret, things like that, or public

12
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.810
information.

13
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.670
It's up to you to know what you are revealing, and it's up to you to know whether what you're revealing

14
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.380
is confidential or not.

15
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.880
Now, if you know something is confidential instead of stonewalling, instead of telling your interviewer

16
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.210
that, Oh, no, I'm not going to do this, I'm not I don't care if that's confidential, say it politely.

17
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.490
After all, it's up to you also to build a positive relationship, and you have to say something along

18
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.300
the lines of, I wouldn't want to jeopardize the interests of my previous employer in the same way that

19
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.280
if you, as my boss, were to entrust me with confidential information, then you would trust that I

20
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.350
would not reveal that to someone else.

21
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.240
So I always act in the interest of the employer.

22
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.810
So acting under acting in their interest, I don't think it would be a good idea to reveal confidential

23
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.770
information.

24
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.010
And that's it.

25
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.810
Simple.
