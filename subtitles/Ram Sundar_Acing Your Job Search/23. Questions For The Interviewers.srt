1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,980
Let's talk about questions you can ask the interviewers.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,730
Now, at the end of any interview, because an interview is a two way street.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,980
They want to know how you can solve their problem and you want to know what's in it for you.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,150
Of course, you want to know about the word culture and your future there.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,980
So your interviewer will ask you, do you have any questions for us?

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,700
And yes, you should have questions.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:35,650
So if you're in an in-person interview, then ideally on your copy of the resume, you would write down

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,470
facts about the company and a couple of questions that you can ask the interviewers.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:50,290
Now, if you're in an entry level or lower mid-level position, then it's absolutely okay to ask questions

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,200
like, what's my team going to look like?

11
00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:02,720
What's what's the average day in the life of an engineer or what's the or accountant or lawyer or whatever,

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,150
right?

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,600
A paralegal assistant.

14
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:11,050
It doesn't matter what's the average day look like in the life of someone in this position?

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:21,920
And you can also ask questions about the company's learning programs or what sort of trainings they

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,320
do and things like that.

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,630
But as you grow to higher level positions, these questions become very, very basic.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,100
So in addition to these or as a replacement to these, you should be asking questions that are more

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,310
geared towards the company's growth and things like that.

20
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,260
So you want to ask questions about the company's growth plan for the next few years.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,950
But what it shows, it doesn't have to be one year or two years, five years, whatever the number is

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,660
relevant.

23
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,280
What's important is your.

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,530
You're trying to get an interest in the company or trying to know about the company's growth plan for

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,050
the next few years, which means you're willing to make a long term commitment to the company.

26
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:17,540
You can ask questions like, what is the what specifically is the interviewer's problem when it comes

27
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,040
to fulfilling their responsibilities where you can step in and help?

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,920
So what is the nature of the problem, apart from the job description itself?

29
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:36,620
What other traits and experiences or qualities do the interviewers find useful?

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,350
When it comes to fulfilling this role and doing it successfully.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,890
And those are the kinds of questions that you should be asking.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,510
You can also ask questions about the companies work culture, what they do in the way of events, show

33
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,670
some interest and be engaged.

34
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:02,810
Because even if you choose to be a contract employee, whether you choose to be a contract employee

35
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:10,510
or a permanent employee, you want to show that you're interested in being a part of the organization.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,350
So frame your questions around that and have at least two or three questions.

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,640
Write down at least three questions that you can ask the interviewers.

38
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,640
One of them could specific to the role.

39
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,510
One of them could be specific to the company, and one of them could be about how you fit in.

40
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:37,940
And remember, always follow up their response with something that you say.

41
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:47,570
For example, if a company says that they find a certain quality, very important and key to being successful

42
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:56,840
in this position, then always follow it up with one example of how you demonstrated that quality.

43
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,320
And this is impressive because this is one of the last questions that this is probably the absolute

44
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,640
last question that an interviewer will ask a candidate.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:17,500
And when they do that, then the response is kind of firmly imprint why you are qualified for the role.

46
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,620
So it gives you a better chance at success.

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,370
Thank you and see you in the next video.
