00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.380
Hi again.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.720
Here.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.630
We're going to address an important trick question.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.510
Are you interviewing at other companies?

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.170
Sometimes if you are interviewing at other companies, then it's good, to be honest.

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.240
It's good to be open.

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.320
You do not have to mention what companies you're interviewing at because nothing good can come out of

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.590
it.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.360
How is that information going to be useful to your interviewer in any way other than curiosity?

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.010
Think about that for a moment, and if you are interviewing, you can always say, yes, I'm interviewing

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.970
at one or two or any number of companies.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.260
And this can also create a sense of demand, which means that if you are interviewing at several companies,

13
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.670
then you have the choice.

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.050
And if you've done well at your interview, then the chances are that they will start talking about

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:08.800
how great it is to work for them because they will want to offer you the job before any of the other

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.810
companies can do that.

17
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.620
And they will want to also give you a better offer.

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.160
Right?

19
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.990
So this might come up, it might prove to be useful in negotiations later on.

20
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.550
But if you are not interviewing at other companies, then creating an artificial sense of demand by

21
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.150
saying that you are interviewing, which is allowing itself.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.480
But creating an artificial sense of demand may not be the best approach because if someone feels, oh,

23
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.090
he's interviewing at other companies as well and.

24
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.780
And so he's got a lot of choice.

25
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.780
But if if it works against you, then you'll be left with nothing.

26
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.120
So feel free.

27
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.200
If you're not interviewing at other companies, then at least in my opinion, what has worked for me

28
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.500
and for several people that have coached before is to say, I'm don't answer with a yes or no.

29
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.320
Just say I'm actively looking for a job right now and I'm actively in the market.

30
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.250
I'm pursuing it and I'm happy to do whatever it takes.

31
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.140
So turn it back and.

32
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.430
And say that.

33
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
Tell them why you are a good fit for this company.

34
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.980
Don't answer with a straight yes or no, but say that you are actively looking and list out the reasons

35
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.420
why you're a great fit.

36
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.160
Thank you and see you in the next video.
