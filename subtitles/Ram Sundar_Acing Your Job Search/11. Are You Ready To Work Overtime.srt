1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,260
What happens when an interviewer asks you if you are ready to work overtime?

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,460
Now, if you're like me, then you enjoy work life balance.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,480
I don't even like calling it work life balance because you shouldn't have to balance the two.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,190
One should not come at the cost of the other.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,250
You should be able to enjoy both.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,130
Now be true to yourself and answer the question according to what?

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,080
How you see fit.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,050
It's allowed to ask an employer how often you'll be working overtime.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,310
And if you're a workaholic, then that's great.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:50,080
Then having to work constant overtime might actually fit in with your need to keep busy all the time.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,310
But if it's going to affect your personal life, if it's going to affect your family, then think about

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,740
whether that's the right thing for you to do and be upfront and honest about it.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,730
And you can always say, Yes, I'm happy to put in whatever effort is necessary to finish my job and

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,410
to go above and beyond.

15
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,880
And it also depends on how often I'll be putting in overtime.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:24,580
So you can ask questions like instead of just directly responding to the question, you can also ask

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:33,430
what the history is and how often over the last, let's say, six months, how often other colleagues

18
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,110
in the team have been working overtime and what kind of projects are involved?

19
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,310
What kind of challenges are they solving by working overtime?

20
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,270
What are other people doing to go above and beyond?

21
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,080
And you can base your response around that.

22
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:57,190
You can have some kind of a skeleton, some kind of an idea of what you're going to respond, what you're

23
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,510
going to use as a response when you talk to them, but at the same time, be ready to ask them some

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,610
clarifying questions as well.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,960
Think about how that affects you and frame your response accordingly.
