00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.140
Welcome to the sixth video of my masterclass.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.940
And this video is about how to create a compelling LinkedIn profile.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.050
Now, from the previous video, we learned that it's important to have a global resume.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:24.180
And when you find a job description that matches your profile, then you build off of your global resume

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.930
by removing whatever is not relevant to this job description and saving that as a, let's say, a resume

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.120
that's specific to that job description.

7
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.860
So you want to give it a name as such, so it's easy for you to go back and refer to that.

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.340
Now, that said, using your global resume, we're going to build your LinkedIn profile and we're going

9
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.100
to ensure that the two of them are consistent.

10
00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.440
And before doing that, it would also be immensely helpful to you to look at as many job descriptions

11
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.250
as you can in your field, no matter what the field.

12
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.760
When you look at ten, 20, 30, maybe more job descriptions and you start decoding the same way we

13
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.630
did in one of the previous videos, then you will see a lot of keywords beginning to repeat themselves.

14
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.340
Whether they're hard skills related to your technical expertise or whether they're soft skills related

15
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.920
to your communication and your qualities, your aptitude, it doesn't matter.

16
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.440
A lot of times they begin to repeat themselves.

17
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.230
Then when you've seen so many job descriptions and when you've compiled a list of keywords, then it

18
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.800
becomes easy for you to identify all of them and you can use those keywords in your LinkedIn profile.

19
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.530
I'm going to share my screen just like I did for the previous videos, and I'm going to see how we can

20
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.970
build the LinkedIn profile.

21
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.980
Now, this will be my own profile that I'm going to show you.

22
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.370
Now, what you saw in the headline of my resume is what you see here.

23
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.990
This is what sets me apart.

24
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.600
This is what makes me different from other coaches, other engineers, other professionals that are

25
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.880
trying to apply for a job now open to work.

26
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.540
Now this you will see on your profile.

27
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.530
You can always disable this by saying.

28
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630
Delete from profile or.

29
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.120
You're not open to work when you click open to work.

30
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:55.980
Then you start appearing in search results for for hiring managers or recruiting managers that are looking

31
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.780
to fill a certain position.

32
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.400
LinkedIn also provides you with certain analytics.

33
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.520
How many people viewed your profile in the last day?

34
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.490
How many people viewed your profile in the last week or whatever?

35
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.110
How many people interact with your post and how many search appearances you've appeared in?

36
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.250
Now.

37
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.360
When you click when I click the about section, then you will see that this contains the exact same

38
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.650
text as what you saw in the global resume.

39
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.230
So this would appear in the headline.

40
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.460
Or in my case, this part.

41
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.380
And then.

42
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.800
The summary appears in the about me section of my resume.

43
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.760
And then the experience would be identical.

44
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.640
All I've done is copied and pasted things from my professional experience onto my LinkedIn profile here.

45
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.390
And then all my licenses and certifications.

46
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.070
Where did I get my professional engineering license?

47
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.430
Where did I get my Six Sigma Black Belt?

48
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.930
Things like that.

49
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.330
My community involvement section goes in the volunteering section here.

50
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.930
Now as far as skills go, remember that list of skills that we've curated from several different job

51
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.060
opportunities, job postings?

52
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.280
All of those skills will go here.

53
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:46.010
LinkedIn allows you to include up to 50 skills, so feel free to be as elaborate as possible and feel

54
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.650
free to be as broad as required.

55
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.300
So you appear in multiple searches.

56
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.370
Now, when a staffing company or when a hiring manager searches for candidates and trust me, they do,

57
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.860
then they don't search for candidates names.

58
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.860
Obviously not.

59
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.710
They would search for keywords.

60
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.120
They would search for skills.

61
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.570
And if you want your resume to appear at the top, then you want not just the skills to be there, but

62
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.850
you want to endorse them.

63
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:26.570
So a couple of recommendations would be to get people to endorse you for your skills and to get recommendations

64
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.520
from people, because these reflect positively on your resume and on you as a person.

65
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.220
So when a recruiting manager looks at this and they they see all these recommendations, then it increases

66
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.940
their confidence and makes you more likely to be hired or to even be called for an interview.

67
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.720
And then you can talk about different courses or the different languages that you speak and feel free

68
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.920
to add a few companies as or.

69
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:13.890
Societies, organizations in your interests so that when someone looks at them, then then they know

70
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:21.540
what your interests are and how they relate to the company or that job description or department or

71
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.070
whatever the case may be.

72
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.950
You also get a good chance to network with professionals who share similar interests.

73
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:43.430
I would also recommend posting or making yourself visible by sharing posts or by commenting on the posts

74
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:52.640
of influencers, or some people that or companies that you might have an active interest in because

75
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.600
that also has the chance of improving your visibility.

76
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.130
Now, thank you and I look forward to the next video.

77
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.090
I hope this has been valuable for you so far.
