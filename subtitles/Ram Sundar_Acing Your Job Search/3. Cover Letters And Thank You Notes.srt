00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,950
Welcome to the seventh video of my masterclass.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,470
This video will talk about cover letters and thank you notes.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,640
So far we have covered how to decode a job description, how to create a targeted resumÃ©, and how to

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,170
build your LinkedIn profile.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,540
So cover letters and thank you notes are extremely underrated and it's very important to build a strong

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,410
cover letter.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,900
And once your interview is done, to follow it up with a thank you note.

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:39,980
So for this, I'm going to share a page from my book that has a sample cover letter and we're going

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,970
to talk about it.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:56,700
Now, when you look at a business letter, any letter, then obviously your name and your certifications

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,880
or licenses or designation comes on top.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,060
And as far as a cover letter goes, you want to keep this part consistent with your resume.

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,200
So you want to have the same header and then the date.

14
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:20,370
Now, if you have the companies information, then it's always useful to include it here.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:27,790
And if you have the name of the person who posted the job, then it's useful to include it there as

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,180
well because then you know what the salutation will be.

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,710
You know who you're addressing.

18
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,410
And it's, it's, it acts favourably from the company standpoint as well.

19
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:46,870
If you've gone that little extra mile just to find out who posted it and you're addressing them directly.

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,030
Now that said, your salutation will be the name of the poster.

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:03,350
And on LinkedIn it's fairly easy and it's quite common for a lot of hiring managers or staffing company

22
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,960
managers to use their names and their profile as the person who posted it.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,730
So then you know who it is.

24
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,370
Now, with any business letter, three paragraphs are involved.

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,030
The first one has the introduction in the salutation, and that's pretty generic.

26
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:30,830
And most companies, from a psychological standpoint, most companies, most people will focus their

27
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,470
attention immediately on the second paragraph, and that becomes the main body of the letter.

28
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,620
What's your background in a nutshell?

29
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:47,420
Now, before saying that you want to establish what makes you special and include that that's your market

30
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,350
dominating position, that's what you are offering that no other candidate in the job market is offering

31
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,720
for that same position.

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,530
What is it that makes you special?

33
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,750
How many years of experience you have and what relevant fields?

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,320
And pick a few words from the job description and the company's core values.

35
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,030
It helps to do research about the company.

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:20,030
Now you can also provide one or two data driven examples of when you've achieved certain things that

37
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,250
are relevant to the job description.

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,750
And this data should reflect verifiable information.

39
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,400
And it shouldn't be it shouldn't be hypothetical.

40
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:43,370
So think about things like how much time you saved at some point what your what the end result was for

41
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,270
the company, how many people you may have trained, the size of the facilities you were working at,

42
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,410
things like that.

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,960
And then your conclusion.

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,390
What's the goal of the cover letter is to make it compelling enough for them to read your resume.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,870
So then what's the next step forward?

46
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:12,370
You've included your resume along with with this application and then tell them how they can contact

47
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,790
you and when you are available for an interview.

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,450
So the resume is basically your portfolio.

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,940
You've created your resume for them to view and gauge for themselves that you're a good fit.

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,940
But the cover letter tells them the other details, like when you're available for an interview, what

51
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,620
makes you special and how you can be contacted.

52
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,740
Things like that.

53
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,420
Now, thank you.

54
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:49,090
Notes work the same way and I find it very useful to have a template thank note as well as a cover letter

55
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,260
and vary them based on the job posting or based on the results of the interview.

56
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:06,370
Now it's always a nice gesture to include a thank you note in your in your application after you have

57
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,290
been interviewed.

58
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,150
It shows that you've done some due diligence.

59
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,150
Send a thank you note within 24 hours after your interview is over.

60
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,760
Don't delay.

61
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,780
And in your thank you note the main body.

62
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,170
The difference between the thank you note and the cover letter in this case is in the main body.

63
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,180
You're in the thank you note.

64
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,930
You're telling them exactly how the interview went for you with specific instances.

65
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,770
That may have come up during the interview that show them how you are qualified to perform the job.

66
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,410
That's it.

67
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,610
Keep it simple.

68
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,700
Thank you very much.

69
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,940
And I hope I was able to add value.

70
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,480
And I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
