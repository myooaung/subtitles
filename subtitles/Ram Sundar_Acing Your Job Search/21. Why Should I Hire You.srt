1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,410
Hi again.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,390
Let's talk about one of the last questions that you will encounter in the interview.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,210
Why should I hire you?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,250
So.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,150
Remember the Fuji method.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:25,070
Now, typically, people who are logic oriented, people who think logically and people who are still

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:33,330
fence sitting, they might ask you this question just because they want to hear from you one last time.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,060
They want to convince themselves.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,560
What?

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,950
I am not sure why I should hire this candidate.

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,350
So what makes them so special?

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,330
Let me hear from them one last time.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,930
So why should I hire you?

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,730
So here.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:59,430
I would suggest I would recommend strongly not bringing up any of your any abstract values or words.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,950
I'm hard working.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,530
I'm a team player, things like that.

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,830
You don't want to do that.

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,330
Everybody can claim that.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,340
What is unique about you?

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:15,900
Now, if you if you go back to the beginning of this class, this Masterclass series, then we talked

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,730
about your unique selling proposition and how to create one.

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,480
Now, before your interview, you would have created one for yourself as well.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,410
And if not, then this is the time to do it when you're preparing for your interview.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,670
Then specifically write down what makes you special in the field.

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,300
The whole reason you're sitting there in the interview is because there's something special about you.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,580
And they have identified that now they want to match what's on your resume on a piece of paper to what's

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,510
in front of them.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,300
Your interviewer That is.

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:05,040
So when you talk about why they should hire you, then you want to convince them based on facts and

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,320
based on things that they can actually see.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:16,830
So that also means that you will you will frame your answer of two or three fundamentals here.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,900
The first one would be.

34
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,240
What makes you special?

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,400
Why you stand out?

36
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,850
The next one will be what is the problem that the interviewer has?

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,290
Which resulted in this job description.

38
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,520
Or this job opening.

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,110
So there is a problem or there are some problems that the company has that they've identified.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,630
That a new hire will solve the problem.

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,020
Right.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,890
So the cost of inaction versus the return on investment, if they sit on it and do nothing, then that

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,750
will cost them more money than to hire somebody and solve the problem for them.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,660
And that's the reason for the job.

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,980
So empathize.

46
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,160
Think about it from the employer standpoint, why should I hire you?

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,720
Is actually a question on how will you help me solve my problem?

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,850
How will you solve my problem?

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,780
So frame your answer around that.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,800
So we're looking at three things.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,570
One, what makes you stand out to what is the company's problem?

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
Three, how will you solve it?

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,680
And once you've done that, then you can put the cherry on top saying, I am also.

54
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:40,680
This, this, this, which is just a summation of the company's core values or their work culture.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,480
So how you fit in, but don't make that the primary objective of your answer.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,000
Your primary objective is to solve that problem.

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:04:00,340
So before you interview, make a create a paragraph and rehearsed it and be ready to answer it whether

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,020
you're asked this question or not.

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,110
Thank you and see you in the next video.
