Hi.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.270
My name is Ram Sundar.

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.180
And if you're here today watching this video, I can assume that you're actively investing in your own

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.340
professional and career development.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.600
Just like you.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.920
I was a job seeker.

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.760
After graduation, I spent more than a year without finding the right job, and this was because I didn't

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.260
have the guidance that I needed.

9
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.550
Then I started working on them and slowly removing all the pain points and coming up with strategies

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.690
that helped me with success to such an extent that I have not failed an interview since 2011.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.220
Today, I am a business coach to small and medium sized businesses.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.470
I help them accelerate their revenues.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.960
I'm also a body language coach and a licensed professional engineer living in Canada.

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.740
I'm also a returning guest speaker at the University of Guelph in Ontario and at the Immigrant Services

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.540
Canada, where I help newcomers.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.260
What sets this course apart is that this course is based on my book, Acing Your Job Search.

17
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.320
It was written under my author name, Roy Mapleton.

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.140
It's available online, but we won't go into that.

19
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.140
This is the only course in the market right now with a comprehensive section on body language, nonverbal

20
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.920
communication.

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
And it's not just general advice, like smile and make eye contact because you can find that information

22
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.550
for free on YouTube.

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.530
This is about positioning yourself as a superstar interviewee by building a relationship with your interviewer

24
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.010
through body language and through some very, very critical strategies like the Fuji method and the

25
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.880
Star method.

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.350
And we start with creating a resume and creating your documents, crafting your elevator pitch, and

27
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.940
then we study body language.

28
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.260
There are practice exercises which I absolutely recommend that you do.

29
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.420
You also need to work on your documents as you're working through the course.

30
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.550
So everything runs in parallel, and by the time you're done with the course, you'll have your documents

31
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.910
ready.

32
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.700
You know what to say, you know how to say it.

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.780
And when the time comes for an interview, then you will not fail.

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.280
So that's it.

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.010
Without further ado, let's get into the course and thank you very much for watching.

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.820
Good luck.
