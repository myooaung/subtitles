1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:10,090
So far, you have learned how to create a compelling resume, how to decode a job description, how

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,630
to improve your nonverbal communication, your body language.

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:21,610
During interviews and in the last video, we talked about the Fuji method to influence your interviewer.

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,350
Now onwards, this last series is about answering some of the most difficult air interview questions.

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,720
There are two kinds of questions.

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:42,460
Let's talk about situational questions and the other kinds which are tell me about style questions.

7
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,460
So situational questions.

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:55,360
They when they're still telling me about questions, but then data, your interviewer might ask you

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,060
something like, tell me about the time where you resolve the conflict.

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,630
Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and what action did you take to correct that mistake?

11
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,450
Tell me about something on your resume.

12
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,000
Tell me about this experience right here.

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,800
When when you're confronted with a situational question there.

14
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,640
Then one very effective way to deal with that is the star method.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,090
Star stands for situation the task.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,420
Your action taken and the result.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:41,510
So you would do well to think of all these negative as well as positive situations.

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:50,840
Situations where you excelled, you exceeded expectations, situation that could have been embarrassing,

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,350
but you turned it around.

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,480
A situation that shows your strength, situation that shows your weakness.

21
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:06,110
Think about one example for each of these and write down what the situation was and then what was the

22
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,810
cost of continued inaction.

23
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,690
Which is all in the situation.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,790
So for example.

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,880
You could talk about as an as a manufacturing person.

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:29,110
You made a mistake that could have been worth tens of thousands of dollars of of of wasted raw materials

27
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,370
or wasted product.

28
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,010
But that was the situation.

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,790
So continued inaction would have cost the company tens of thousands of dollars in terms of wasted material

30
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,510
or product.

31
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,360
What's the next step?

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,250
Which is a t tusk.

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,790
What did you do?

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,980
What was the task?

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,480
It was to correct it.

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,430
Right.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,990
So what action did you take to correct it?

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,820
And that would be the root cause analysis, which would be why would the money have been wasted in the

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,420
first place?

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Why would the company have incurred the loss of tens of thousands of dollars?

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,840
Think about that and then think about how you solved that problem.

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,780
Exactly.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,230
Perhaps you stopped the production midway and made sure that the drawings were corrected and then sent

44
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,500
them back so that people could start working on them.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,710
From there on.

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:39,820
And the result was that you saved the day by taking corrective action in a timely manner and saving

47
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,250
the company tens of thousands of dollars.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,060
Now, what I did right there was I turned a position of weakness into a position of strength by being

49
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,280
proactive and by taking the necessary steps to correct the error and making sure that the company didn't

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,780
lose money because of that.

51
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,040
Now, think of.

52
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,570
Similar situations that you have been a part of.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,950
If you haven't been a part of such situations professionally, that's fine.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,070
Think of something from your college.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,350
Think of something from your university, your personal life.

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:25,300
Think of anything that can add value to you as a candidate by using a situation to ask action and result

57
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,670
and write down.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:37,660
Three or four such incidents showing different, different qualities in you that you can use during

59
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,300
your interview, because these will help you prepare your interviews, not just about your resume.

60
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:49,750
And the more prepared you are in your responses, the less you will have to improvise.

61
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,960
So think of all these and make a list.

62
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,820
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:04,270
This was a start method and in the next short video, we will see the Six Sigma method to approaching

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,490
situational questions.

65
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,530
And I look forward to seeing you in the next video.

66
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,090
Thank you.
