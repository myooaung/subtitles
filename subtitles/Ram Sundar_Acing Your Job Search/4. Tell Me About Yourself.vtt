Hi again.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.750
Now talking about questions that are not situation oriented.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.880
Let's start with the first one, and this is probably going to be the first and most important question

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.050
of your interview.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.090
Tell me about yourself.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.700
We've already covered this when you created your elevator pitch.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.020
And I'm just going to take probably one minute just to reiterate what the what we talked about is.

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.940
When you when you tell someone about when you tell an interviewer about yourself, then you want to

9
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.750
start with your education or your experience or whatever makes you good fit for the company.

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.930
You will also throw in a few key words from the job description that match your resume, and you can

11
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.880
also include some key words such as values, mission, vision, statement of the company, something

12
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.170
that matches your own core values and the values that you live by.

13
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.170
And you should always include one data driven example of something that's relevant to the job opportunity.

14
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.000
For example, if the if you're applying to a sales consulting job, then you want to include one relevant

15
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.590
example showing your sales skills or something like that.

16
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.930
And, and finally you want to leave them wanting to know more.

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.520
So don't drag it on and on for more than 60 seconds.

18
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.330
60 seconds is your absolute limit.

19
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.880
Thank you.

20
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.380
And let's take a look at what other questions we can answer in the next video.
