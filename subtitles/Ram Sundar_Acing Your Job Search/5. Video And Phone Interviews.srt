00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,640
Hi and welcome back to this masterclass on job search and interviewing.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,350
Now, we already talked about what you need to do before the interview.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,020
And here is a quick list description.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,080
Keywords match them to your resume.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,050
Highlight them so they're easy to see not just for you, but also for your interviewer.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,710
So they know that you've done some kind of work and then familiarize yourself with the company work,

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,490
culture and values and mission and vision and things like that.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,800
Write down questions and try to do as much research as possible about the interviewer so you can find

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,220
some common ground and build a relationship during the interview.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,820
Moving on, let's talk about video and phone interviews.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,850
Now, I did mention earlier that 93% of your communication is all nonverbal.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:04,290
That means your tone of voice, which makes up 38% and your body language, which makes up 55% of nonverbal

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,310
communication.

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,360
However, in a phone, they cannot see you, obviously.

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,780
So the 55% of body language goes away, but you still have to work with your 45%, out of which 38 is

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,830
your tone of voice.

17
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,050
Only 7% is what you say.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,640
So that's it.

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,900
Be enthusiastic, be upbeat, and try to emphasize all the keywords.

20
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,110
And trying to emphasize what makes you stand out.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,840
Now, it always helps to actually dress up even for a phone interview because your brain automatically

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,850
switches modes.

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:54,040
If you're dressed in a hoodie and pajamas, then it's likely that you will think in a more relaxed way

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,430
as well.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,970
And that will come across in your interview as being very lax and not eager to get the job.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,760
So if you want to avoid that, then even though it's a phone interview, dress up in formals.

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,080
Now, we already talked about how to dress up for interviews, so my recommendation here would be to

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,000
dress up the exact same way that you would for an in-person interview, even if it is a phone interview.

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,490
It's just a question of half an hour or one hour, but it'll change your mindset.

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,600
Now, video interviewing is almost exactly like in-person interviewing, except there are a few things

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,730
to remember here.

32
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:42,070
Now, as you see the screen in front of you, you see that this person is in front of the computer.

33
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,950
But there are nine other people, three in each row in that video call.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:56,980
And if you observe the top row, the middle person here and the middle row, the person on the left,

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,150
these two are probably positioned the best for success in this video interview, and that's because

36
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,370
their head all the way to their chest is visible in front of the camera.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,960
Also, they have neutral backgrounds.

38
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,090
Everyone over there has neutral backgrounds, but they don't have anything that distracts them from

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,180
the conversation.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,160
It's okay to have a conversation piece in the back provided it doesn't provoke debate.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,650
So if there's something interesting, like a picture of your dog, for instance, then that could be

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,710
a conversation piece that might help build a relationship with your interviewer.

43
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,940
But you don't want political pictures there because that might spark debate.

44
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,230
You don't know which way it's going to go and you're not there to have a political debate.

45
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,670
You're there for an interview.

46
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,320
So that's it.

47
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,750
Make sure that no more than 30 or 40% of the screen is actually you.

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,580
So if your face is too close to the camera, then it will overpower everything else.

49
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,240
And you do not want that smile, of course, and keep a positive attitude.

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:15,490
It's always good to have your hands visible so that you can gesture whenever necessary and it doesn't

51
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,260
appear like you're hiding anything.

52
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,110
Another thing to remember is do not swivel in your chair.

53
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,930
Don't do what I'm doing right now.

54
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,610
Because it looks unprofessional and distracting.

55
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,210
It also gives the appearance that you're not invested in the interview, you're not invested in the

56
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,320
interviewer's time.

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,610
And even though it's just 30 minutes, one hour, whatever it may be, the duration of the interview,

58
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,530
you want to be completely invested.

59
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,900
You want your torso facing the camera.

60
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,780
Don't slouch your shoulders.

61
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,250
Don't do this because it indicates a lack of confidence.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,060
So how do you prevent yourself from swiveling?

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,940
Simple.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Just place your feet firmly on the ground.

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,590
And when you do that, you're achieving two things.

66
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,630
You're making sure that you're completely invested and focused on this interview.

67
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:21,470
But secondly, you're also telling your mind that this is not a situation where you want to trigger

68
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,250
a freeze flight or flight response.

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
So there's no place to hide.

70
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,050
There's no need to hide or run.

71
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,730
And there is no need to freeze.

72
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,190
The worst thing that can happen if you're uncomfortable is that you'll spend a few more seconds thinking

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,080
about what the correct response is.

74
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,010
And that's it.

75
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,930
Now, other than that.

76
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,820
Everything else is similar to in-person interviews, and I'll talk to you about gesturing in the next

77
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,390
video.

78
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:59,000
But as far as video interviews themselves go make sure you don't you don't hide your neck either like

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,370
this because that automatically triggers some kind of victim response.

80
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,980
So when you look at children when when they're caught doing something that they shouldn't be doing,

81
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,940
then their neck goes up like this and they want to turn them in and they don't want that happening.

82
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:27,290
You want your toes to point towards the screen and make sure that your feet are comfortably placed in

83
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:36,290
front not too far back, because then it gives it triggers a reserved set of emotions in you.

84
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:43,760
So you tend to withdraw a little bit and don't put your feet too far out because then you can get overly

85
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,580
comfortable and you want to.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,410
There's a difference between being comfortable and being too comfortable.

87
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,010
Being lazy is, is that you're you're comfortable and yet you are alert, you're paying attention,

88
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,530
you're actively invested in the conversation.

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,990
Let's talk about hand gesturing in videos and in-person interviews in the next next lesson.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,590
Thank you for joining me and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
