1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,100
Now the next question is, why are you looking for a new job?

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,400
It's never going to work in your favor if you speak ill of your present employer.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,830
So you want to avoid gossip.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,910
Avoid creating a toxic environment because you want to leave your interviewer with a happy memory associated

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,420
with you.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,740
So what?

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,880
Before your interview?

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,220
You should make a list of some solid reasons.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,120
Maybe two or three solid reasons on why you want this new job.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,720
Now, if you're unemployed or if you're just starting off, then it's much easier because you can just

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:45,300
talk about what the company offers and and relate that to what you can offer and try to create a bridge

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,720
there.

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,630
If you're currently employed and looking for a new job state, what drives you?

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,660
If you know why you're looking for a new job.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:04,360
Now, perhaps the work environment right now is toxic for you, but you cannot say that to a new employer.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,610
What you would say?

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:15,010
Is how this new employer's values and the new employer's culture matches better is a better match for

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,230
you than where you are now.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,180
Perhaps you want to make progress and feel.

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,090
If you're shifting from a small company to a large company, then you can talk about how in a small

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,570
company it's very fast paced and you wear many hats, but in a larger company your job would be more

22
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,700
focused and that allows you to perform better and at a more optimal level.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,020
If you're moving from a large company to a small company, then you can say the opposite.

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,420
You enjoy more dynamism.

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,160
You enjoy being more creative in your problem solving.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,860
You enjoy having complex challenges and a fast paced environment, and that's why you're shifting to

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,140
a smaller company, things like that.

28
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,890
So think about what drives you.

29
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,730
Think about why you would want to leave where you are and and move into this new company where you're

30
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,790
being interviewed.

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,080
What values do they have that match up with yours?

32
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:23,240
And you would have taken note of the company's core values, of course, when you were doing the research

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,620
prior to the interview.

34
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,160
You can always use that to leverage your answer.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,680
So there are two stages.

36
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:37,400
Why are you looking for a new job and why are you looking for a new job in this particular company?

37
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,800
So then you can you can target both issues with the same question.

38
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,940
Thank you very much and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
