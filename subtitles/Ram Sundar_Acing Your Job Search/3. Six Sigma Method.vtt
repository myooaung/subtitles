00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.450
Again, we've seen the Fuji method and the Starr method to answer situational questions and to build

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.670
relationships with your interviewers.

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.260
Now, we will see.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.230
We will talk about the Six Sigma method.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.810
Now, Six Sigma is an industrial method that has been used highly effectively to streamline processes

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.800
and to solve complex problems in the best way possible.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.270
So that's it.

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.120
What is the Six Sigma meant that the Six Sigma method is of two kinds.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:43.730
If you have an existing process, then you would use the make method, which is define, measure, analyze,

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.800
improve and control.

11
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.330
And if nothing exists and you're designing something new or you're creating something new, then you

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:05.240
would use the died of method, which is did0v, which is define, identify, design, optimize and verify.

13
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.410
How can you use this to answer situational questions?

14
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.970
Now, if someone talks about wants you to talk about a task that you accomplish successfully, then

15
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.030
you can think about it in the Six Sigma way.

16
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.590
You can think about how you define the problem, what you do, how you define the issue, what you did

17
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.560
to identify the root cause of the problem.

18
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.360
Then what you did, the design stage, the idea the design stage would would involve you talking about

19
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.710
what you did.

20
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
To solve that problem that you identify.

21
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.330
And then what you did to optimize your solution, how many iterations you went through and what you

22
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.810
did to solve it in the most efficient way possible.

23
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.440
The fee part would be verified which which is about showing someone verification and validation of your

24
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.950
process, which means you're showing someone that it's verified to be the most efficient way to deal

25
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.940
with this problem.

26
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.940
So when an interviewer asks you, for example, tell me how you optimize this is from a previous video

27
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.560
where I talked about a financial planner, for example, that overhauled a payroll system and saved

28
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.790
the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.

29
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.100
Fictional example.

30
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.550
But let's see how we can approach it in the Six Sigma way.

31
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.770
The root cause and the ID of the problem is that the company is bleeding money.

32
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.730
Why?

33
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.530
Because there are hundreds of thousands of dollars left on the table.

34
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.720
Because a process is not efficient.

35
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.040
What process is that?

36
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.600
The payroll process.

37
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:11.610
Now, the definition, the defined part of the data of approach in Six Sigma would be to say that the

38
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.700
company could be doing better because hundreds of thousands of dollars are being wasted.

39
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.470
Why are they wasted?

40
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.320
Because the payroll process is not efficient.

41
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:34.320
So then the design stage would be what this person did to to stop that wastage, stop that bleeding

42
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.630
of money, that is.

43
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.000
And what the person did to overhaul the payroll system.

44
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.450
And then the optimize would be how they managed to actually create a robust enough process where so

45
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.670
much money is not being wasted.

46
00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.200
And then the verify would be to show the upper management that they actually designed a process that

47
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.300
was absolutely robust.

48
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.520
It was the best one possible, and it saved the company $100,000 or hundreds of thousands of dollars

49
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.620
using its implementation.

50
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.210
And this money could be used towards other things or to improve the company, improve the workplace,

51
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.920
things like that.

52
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.750
So that's a simple example.

53
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.130
But think of what method you would want to use to answer situational questions, whether you're using

54
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.360
the star method or the Six Sigma method, and think about keeping it consistent and.

55
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.830
Try to formulate at least three or four different responses.

56
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.340
Three or four.

57
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.600
Think of three or four different situations that you can explain away using Star Method or the Six Sigma

58
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.080
method.

59
00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.800
Because if a situational question comes up in an interview, then you will be prepared for it.

60
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.480
Thank you very much.

61
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.940
And the next few videos.

62
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:13.670
The rest of this masterclass is about targeting one question in each video and seeing how best to respond

63
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.700
to some of the most difficult interview questions.

64
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.180
Thank you so much for being part of this masterclass and I look forward to having you in the next one

65
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.720
as well.
