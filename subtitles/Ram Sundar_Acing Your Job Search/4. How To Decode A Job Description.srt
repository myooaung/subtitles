00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,210
Hi.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,020
Welcome to the fourth video in this lecture series.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,230
How to Decode a Job Description.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,260
Now, unfortunately or fortunately and conveniently for us, most job descriptions in most fields are

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,880
created the same way.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,260
And like we mentioned before, all job descriptions are designed to solve a problem for the company.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,430
Now, when you look at any job description, you will see a few lines about the company, a few lines

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,860
about the job divided into must have skills and nice to have skills.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,850
And then you will find you may find a few benefits of working for said company.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:53,050
Now what I would like to do is share my screen and we can take a look at three different job postings

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:00,940
from three completely different fields and try to decode them so that we can create a resume that's

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,110
targeted to that.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,950
I'm going to.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,740
Share my screen here.

15
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,890
So first thing I wanted to show you was.

16
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:25,250
I performed a simple search for mechanical engineering jobs in California.

17
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:33,230
Now, when you look at this, this is a random job posting from a mechanical engineer for this company

18
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,910
in Carlsbad, California.

19
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,200
And when you look at it, job highlights the qualifications.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,610
Here are the must haves.

21
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,630
These are things that the company cannot do without.

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,140
They absolutely need someone with a bachelor's or a master's degree with five years of experience in

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:58,280
this and with experience in 3D CAD design software, in this case SolidWorks.

24
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:08,120
Experience with drawings and rapid prototyping in Microsoft Office and being able to draft work instructions.

25
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:15,680
Now, those are the must have skills as far as technical the technical area goes.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,030
Now, when it comes to soft skills, they also want someone with strong written verbal communication

27
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,940
skills, analytical organizational skills.

28
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,370
Conceptualising, innovative and creative designs.

29
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,880
They also want someone with sheet metal experience and all these things.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
Good troubleshooting skills.

31
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,840
Strong general computer literacy.

32
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,670
Five years of experience.

33
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,920
They already covered that previously, and if they repeated it here, that means it's important to them.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,680
Previous biotech engineering industry experience.

35
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,420
Previous experience with automation, production equipment.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,730
Now those are the must haves.

37
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,490
Now, the responsibilities could also tell you more about what they're looking for.

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,770
Cross Functional Engineering Team.

39
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,930
What does that mean?

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,510
To be successful, you are expected to be working as part of a group.

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,740
So they're looking for teamwork, cutting edge biological and medical research, which means they're

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:36,120
looking for someone with experience in research because industrial research is vastly different from

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,530
academic research.

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:48,600
Now you will work with a variety of R&amp;D staff and team members for new product introduction with an

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,380
emphasis on customer wants and needs, which means being able to understand customer requirements is

46
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,970
important to this company.

47
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,710
Now understanding and applying technical knowledge theory, best practices.

48
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:14,810
So they want someone who is strong, not only with applied part of engineering, but also with the theoretical

49
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,260
part.

50
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,840
They're talking about.

51
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:26,860
The primary engineer being the one to increase capacity on critical automated production line.

52
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,930
That means you'll you'll be involved in critical, out-of-the-box thinking.

53
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,380
You will need to demonstrate that.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,600
You will need to demonstrate that you're able to support people.

55
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,430
You'll be required to analyze, identify improvements.

56
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,450
So.

57
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,130
Let's take a look before.

58
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,060
Before we make any conclusions here, let's take a look at something else.

59
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,090
Sales jobs in Toronto.

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,860
This was another surge stemming.

61
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,450
Now.

62
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,430
Again, just like I mentioned, there's a little bit about the company.

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,890
And about the road working there.

64
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,370
What does it mean being part of a friendly team in a working environment, in a welcoming environment,

65
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,470
open to new ideas?

66
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:25,620
That means that they're looking for someone who is friendly, who can be welcoming to others as as welcoming

67
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,960
as they are to this new person.

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,940
It means being able to communicate with senior management and being dynamic.

69
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,890
Now growing and open to continuous training of employees means that they're looking for someone who

70
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,890
is proactive, who wants to keep learning and improving.

71
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:53,190
Now look at the roles and responsibilities generate sales.

72
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,920
Of course, that's a sales consultant's job.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
Maintain a high level of customer service.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,270
So they're looking for someone who's cheerful, who wants to who who wants to put the interests of the

75
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,090
customer above their own interests.

76
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,950
High level of knowledge of products and services, product merchandising, cleanliness of the store.

77
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,010
That means they want someone who is organized.

78
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:30,740
Now demonstrating curiosity and empathy, being a team player, working with little supervision, which

79
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,900
means that they want a team player who is capable of working independently.

80
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,930
And doesn't wait around for directions to be given to them.

81
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,400
And then there's a little bit about the benefits.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,250
I want you to focus on this rigorous and structured training program.

83
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,350
When you look at that.

84
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,030
And you compare that to this growing and open to continuous training of its employees.

85
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,010
That means that they're looking for someone who is committed to working for the company.

86
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,800
Join an innovative company in business for more than 50 years and benefit from a rewarding work climate

87
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,780
in the interior design industry.

88
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,720
Now let's take a look at another one.

89
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,790
Lot of jobs in New York.

90
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,120
This was another search that I mean, this is for a paralegal in New York.

91
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,380
New York.

92
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,670
Self-Starting highly.

93
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:44,450
The kind self-starting, highly organized, detail oriented individual with excellent written and verbal

94
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,600
professional communication skills and follow through.

95
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,210
Paralegal experience is required.

96
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,440
But they're still open to various levels and types of experience.

97
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,940
Interest in working as a member of a team.

98
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,670
What does that mean?

99
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,050
Team player once again.

100
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,330
Disciplines of theater publishing related entertainment fields.

101
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,740
So why is that?

102
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:22,310
They're looking for someone who is a true team player as well as has experience in.

103
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,950
In the theater.

104
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,150
But what could it mean?

105
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,750
It could mean someone who's self-starting, who's who's a detail oriented, because theater involves

106
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,580
a lot of these skills.

107
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,360
They will be liaising with attorneys and fines.

108
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,360
And I'm looking at the responsibilities now handled state and federal compliance.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,570
So this is a little bit of a high stakes job.

110
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:58,430
Assist with attorneys and clients in connection with the creation and dissolution of entities.

111
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,000
Now.

112
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,900
They're busy.

113
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,950
They are a boutique entertainment law firm.

114
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,840
Now, that's that explains the experience that they're looking for in theater is because they're in

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,520
entertainment law firms.

116
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,590
And.

117
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:25,440
They are looking for someone who has good analytical skills, who is organized, who has experience

118
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,510
in all the fields earlier, and who can support and work as a team member.

119
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:39,220
Once again, that's exactly what this says self-starting, highly organized, detail oriented, with

120
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,430
excellent communication skills and follow through.

121
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,500
Now.

122
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,650
We have seen three different job postings in three different fields.

123
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,120
Mechanical engineering, sales consulting and a paralegal.

124
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,250
Three completely different ones.

125
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,910
But the job postings are built the same way.

126
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:19,010
And out of every job posting, we have managed to extract a set of keywords that can be put into one

127
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:26,090
of two categories either skills required to perform the job or soft skills.

128
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,110
Now, things like teamwork, self-starting or highly organized detail oriented.

129
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,960
These are all.

130
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,190
Soft skills.

131
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,990
They're related to communication.

132
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,250
We're not quantifiable.

133
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:51,270
Things like five years of experience, bachelors degree in engineering, experience with sales or experience

134
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,350
in the theater.

135
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,430
Things like this.

136
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,010
These can be quantified.

137
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,050
How many years of experience do you have?

138
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,220
So when you look at a job description, make sure you break it down and.

139
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,790
What did down as a set of keywords.

140
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,140
Instead of focusing on the entire job description, focus on the keyword.

141
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:22,560
Every required skill, every job responsibility will have at least one keyword now.

142
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,970
Jot that keyword down and put it into one of these categories.

143
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,460
Is that a skill that's required, like a hard skill or a soft skill?

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,680
And this is how you break it down.

145
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:44,400
Now, at the end of the analysis, you should have broken down the job description in its entirety into

146
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,750
a set of whatever keywords five, ten, 15.

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm not sure depending on how big the job descriptions.

148
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:00,510
And once this is done, you are going to integrate all these keywords to build a targeted resume.

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,690
Thank you very much for watching and I look forward to the next video.

150
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,030
I hope I was able to add value.
