00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,360
Here's another question that interviewers like to ask.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,040
Sometimes it's What would you change about your life?

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,890
And this is an interesting question because they want to see if you are someone who's forward thinking

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,780
or someone who lives in regret.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,690
Remember that every decision, every event that has taken place in your life has shaped you in some

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,310
way into who you are today.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,630
And any rational person, anyone who's capable of even the least amount of critical thinking, given

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,130
a certain set of circumstances, will always make the right decision.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:49,870
Now, whether it's right for them or not at that moment, it can never be known at that moment.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,660
It can only be known when the results make themselves known later on or in the future.

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,030
But your fundamental focus should be on maintaining a positive attitude and maintaining an attitude

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,690
of no regrets with when you're in the interview.

13
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:16,330
So something that you could change in your life has to be said without any regrets.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:24,160
And don't make it something so big that it will change the course of your life, because then you may

15
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,530
not even put yourself in the situation where you're presenting yourself as a good candidate.

16
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:37,010
Because then you're you're talking about some decision that went so wrong that you didn't you didn't

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,810
foresee it.

18
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,490
You didn't do anything to correct it.

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,510
You you weren't a good decision maker, so you want to come across as a strong candidate.

20
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,920
Then you want to show that every single thing that you've done has been done with due thought and consideration.
