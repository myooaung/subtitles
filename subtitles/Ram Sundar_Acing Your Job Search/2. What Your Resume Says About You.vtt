00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome to the second video.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.980
What does your resume say about you?

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.170
Your resume can tell you hiring manager a lot about you.

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.830
Say you're applying for a job in research, but you do not have any numbers.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.660
Quantitative details about your previous achievements, about your previous researchers.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.300
Then it could tell the hiring manager that you're not invested in the outcome and you're not invested

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.260
in the details.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.760
After all, how would you justify a job in research if you cannot convey what you're researching and

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.740
how it turned out right?

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.670
If your resume has a lot of white spaces, then it could tell the reader, in this case, the hiring

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.520
manager, that you are not efficient at using your resources.

12
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.780
If your resume has a lot of typos, it shows that you are not detail oriented and do not care about

13
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.190
the quality of your work.

14
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.420
If your resume is not well constructed in general, you might come across as being lazy.

15
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.950
It's not uncommon for hiring managers to receive more than 200 resumes for every job posting.

16
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:25.310
Now, to reduce the time spent on scanning every single one of these resumes and also to make sure that

17
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.530
there is no human error involved because of which good candidates can get passed up.

18
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.540
A lot of companies use a software called the Applicant Tracking System.

19
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.460
That's the 80 s.

20
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.220
If you have a coherent resume, it will not only meet the job description and not only meet the keywords,

21
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.230
but it will come across as professional.

22
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.410
Now, when when a hiring manager receives over 200 resumes for the same posting, they pass all these

23
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.400
resumes through the applicant tracking software.

24
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:08.450
And what the software does is it matches preset keywords that are relevant to the job description that

25
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.430
are set by the company.

26
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.130
Do the keywords in your resume?

27
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.860
So.

28
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.490
The key thing to remember here is if you just have random keywords on your resume that match the job

29
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.480
description.

30
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.490
Then it will pass the test.

31
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.660
But once it passes, when they take a look at it, then your resume will come across as unprofessional.

32
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.730
So the key is to show your hiring manager, your future hiring manager, how you can solve their problem

33
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.410
in the way they want.

34
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.810
And also be professional and detail oriented about it.

35
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.890
Now this is what you will need going forward.

36
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.420
And in the next video we'll take a look at or we'll talk about what hiring managers and recruiting managers

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.160
look for in general.

38
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.930
Thank you for watching.

39
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.510
And I hope I was able to add value.
