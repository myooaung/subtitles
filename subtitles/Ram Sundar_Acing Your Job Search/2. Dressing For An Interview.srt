Hi.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,250
And welcome back.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,320
This is the 12th video of the master class and it's about dressing for an interview.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,940
Now, before you get invited to an interview, obviously you know what position you've applied for,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,340
which means that, you know, the seniority level, the level of education and experience that they're

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,090
looking for, and it's important to dress according to that.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:36,100
Now, even though you may be dressed in in casuals at work, it's not necessary that you must be dressed

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,630
the same way during interviews.

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,150
You want to be your best version of yourself.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,830
Now, think about this.

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:49,690
Are you in a customer facing role or are you are you going to be dealing primarily in the back end?

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,210
And if you're in the back end, then you may not need to be dressed in formal every day.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:02,140
But a lot of times sales professionals, marketing professionals, they're usually dressed in formals

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:10,350
because they interact with people and it represents a certain degree of professionalism within the company.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,860
So that said, if you're in an entry level, you could even get away without a tie.

16
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:25,840
But if you're regardless of your gender, you would be advised to dress up in either formals or business

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,590
casuals.

18
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,080
So that could include a blazer.

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,150
Now, it's important to remember that when you sit down, you want to have your blazer unbuttoned.

20
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,910
The reason for this is the blazer is a direct descendant of body armour.

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:50,140
And when you have your when you button up, that means you're in a way protecting yourself and you're

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,690
not opening yourself up to the conversation.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,990
Now, if you look at a lot of motivational speakers, people who speak on stage, they display open

24
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,250
body language by opening their arms up like this and saying, welcome.

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,500
Thank you all for being here.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:12,610
And the reason for that is they are displaying what is called ventral fronting.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,030
In his book, What Everybody is saying.

28
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,790
But Joe Navarro says that ventral fronting is when you leave your front exposed.

29
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,420
Now, those are where your all your vital organs are.

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,780
And if you leave that exposed, you're not protecting any of it, then you're showing the other, the

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:41,230
listeners and the recipients of your information that you are not displaying protected or uncomfortable

32
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,920
behaviour.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,330
In other words, you're you're showing yourself as vulnerable and inviting and that should be the basis

34
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,810
for your communication during an interview.

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,080
And one good way to do this is dressing appropriately, but at the same time having your blazer and

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,410
obviously not your shirt but your blazer.

37
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:12,820
And when you when you're interviewing at a senior level, then apart from attire, you could also have

38
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,930
a pocket square.

39
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:23,270
And that kind of completes the outfit and it helps you present yourself more professionally.

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:31,720
Now, the tip here is even in a phone interview, I would advise you to be dressed the same way you

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,180
would for an actual interview.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:44,260
The reason for that is, although the interviewer cannot see you over the phone, obviously it still

43
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:52,390
helps you get into that frame of mind where if you're dressed in casuals, wearing your pants or pyjamas

44
00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:01,180
at home and wearing just a hoodie, then you might be inclined to think and approach it from a casual

45
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,930
standpoint.

46
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,140
But if you're dressing in formals, then your brain automatically thinks that it is in a formal setting.

47
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,280
And even though you're on the phone talking to somebody, you will still feel that need to be formal

48
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:24,520
and that itself will trigger your brain do to craft your responses correctly and to treat the interview

49
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,800
with the consideration that it deserves.

50
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,150
Thank you, and I hope I was able to add value.

51
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,400
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
