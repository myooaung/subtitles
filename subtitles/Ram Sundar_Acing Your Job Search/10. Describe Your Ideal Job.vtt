Sometimes interviewers also like to ask what your definition is of a perfect job.

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.860
So tell me about your perfect job.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.910
And when you're asked this question, don't just jump and say this one.

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.950
It might be it might be the next job that will help pay off your bills.

5
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.380
But that's not how you want to project it.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.100
You want every question and every response to every question to be well thought out, well constructed,

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.320
and backed up by some kind of data or facts or feelings, whatever.

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.790
Then when you talk about your perfect job, then instead of just saying this one, talk about what the

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.530
company values.

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.030
So most things like agility, things like teamwork or continuous learning and improvement and things

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.670
like that, identify what makes the company special and insert that into your response.

12
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.770
So you will talk about your the job that you're interviewing for.

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.240
You will talk about what makes that job special to you.

14
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.700
So talk about what you see yourself doing.

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.490
For example, if you're doing sales calls, then then you can talk about things like I.

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.470
My ideal job is one where I build customer relationships and build long lasting relationships that are

17
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.250
based on trust and I enjoy.

18
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.300
That's the reason I enjoy making sales calls every day and I enjoy the challenges that come with it.

19
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.690
This would be the ideal job and why this company is because the company values this, this and this.

20
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.840
So you're talking not just about the job itself, but you're talking about the company and you're presenting

21
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.220
to them without saying specifically this company and this job.

22
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
You're showing them through all these keywords.
