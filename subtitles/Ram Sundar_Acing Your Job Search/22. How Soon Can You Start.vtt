Here's another question.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.970
And if you're asked this question, then it probably means that you've more or less got the job.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.820
The question is, how soon can you start?

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.020
Now, if you're unemployed, you're looking for a job, then your best interests lie in joining right

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.400
away because then you at least you have an income right while you're searching for another job.

6
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.720
Or you can choose to continue and explore your opportunities within the organization.

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.290
If you are employed, then of course be honest and tell them what your notice period is.

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.350
Try not to create conflict with your present employer by by saying, Oh, I can join tomorrow and then

9
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
having to go back to your present employer and trying to negotiate and turning it into a conflict.

10
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.980
So that answers the question How soon can you start?

11
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.970
Thank you.

12
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.860
And see you in the next video.
