00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.600
We're going to analyze Mark Zuckerberg's interview regarding the instant personalization.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.030
Now, for those of you who don't know what instant personalization is.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.290
It's a feature that came out at least a decade ago, and it was about how you would search for, let's

4
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.600
say, hotels somewhere.

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.240
And within the next few seconds, you start seeing ads for hotels in your Instagram or Facebook or even

6
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.600
Google.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
And that's your instant personalization back when it came out.

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.900
It led to some huge privacy concerns and it didn't go down well.

9
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.200
And today we take it for granted that your and we trust that your data is in safe hands.

10
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.270
Back then, it wasn't the case.

11
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.500
And the reason I'm sharing this interview is it's a three minute video and we're going to analyze it

12
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.830
together to see what you shouldn't be doing in an interview.

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.030
And that's it.

14
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.100
Let's take a look.

15
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.920
Do you feel like it's a backlash or that you feel like you're violating people's privacy?

16
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.340
Do you?

17
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.480
So the interviewer wants to know something that's very controversial.

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:35.230
Is it a violation of people's privacy to have instant personalization, to snoop into their ads and

19
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.860
their searches and generate ads or send ads to them that are based on their web searches?

20
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.730
Do you feel like you're adequately portrayed as a.

21
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.120
Because I want to wonder now let's pay attention to how Mark Zuckerberg answers this question about

22
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.310
the person who actually created this thing.

23
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.500
Yeah, I mean, you know, a lot of stuff happened happened along the way, I think.

24
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.150
You know, there were real learning points and turning points along the way in terms of in terms of

25
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.440
building things.

26
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.660
You know, it really went from this position very early on where we were just in this college dorm room

27
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.220
to we moved out to California.

28
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.540
It was a few friends and me.

29
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
And I'm going to pause here for a moment just to analyze what's happened so far.

30
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.360
So the question there was, is it a violation of people's privacy to be doing this?

31
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.880
The answer, the response from Marc has nothing to do with violation.

32
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.860
Now, if you remember from the previous videos conveying versus convincing, this is a conveying question.

33
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.020
So the question can literally be responded to with a yes or no.

34
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.020
Is it a violation?

35
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.100
Yes or no?

36
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.410
Instead, he chose to take the long road and say that it started off with an idea in his garage and

37
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.220
things like that.

38
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.490
Now, diversion is a common tactic when you don't know or you don't want to answer.

39
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.140
And I strongly recommend against using diversion in an interview because.

40
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.790
The sooner you get to the point, the sooner you convey the information or convince the other person,

41
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.890
the better your chances at getting the job done quicker and leaving the interviewer with a happier memory.

42
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.060
I'm.

43
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.150
You know, it just kind of had this project feel for a while.

44
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.090
And there was this real turning point when when companies started trying to buy the company for a huge

45
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.600
amount of money.

46
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.680
And, you know, I had to kind of get my friends together and we had to decide what was it that we really

47
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.840
cared about and what was it that we wanted to do?

48
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.070
Now we're going to observe his facial expressions for a moment here.

49
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.290
You see him sweat.

50
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.270
You see him perspire.

51
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.380
And you see that the muscles on his face are really tense.

52
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.620
What does that tell us that he is?

53
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.090
He does not want to be there.

54
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.880
Now, if your muscles are religion's.

55
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.920
Then you want to do whatever it takes.

56
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.250
To move on to get back to a state of comfort.

57
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.490
And the fundamental nature of human beings is in a conversation.

58
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.480
They want to be heard.

59
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.060
It is the same thing for your interviewer as well.

60
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.020
Your interviewer wants to be heard and so do you.

61
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.130
Now the question is, can you find common ground?

62
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.790
And if you do, then you're in a position of comfort.

63
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.520
If you cannot, then you're you're in, you're uncomfortable, and your brain wants you to move away

64
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.410
from that as quickly as possible.

65
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.290
Two.

66
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.450
And we decided not to take those offers.

67
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.400
And, you know, to me, a lot of that decision was that what we wanted to do and what we wanted to

68
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.330
spend, you know, a big part of our lives doing was just continuing to push and and kind of build products

69
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.860
that help people share information.

70
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.430
Now, think about this.

71
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.850
He still hasn't answered the question.

72
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.060
Build products that help people stay connected.

73
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.550
And that's really what we're spending our time doing.

74
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.770
And, you know, I think there's just been a lot of a lot of space between that early stuff and where

75
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.730
we are now.

76
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.070
If I could if I knew what I knew now, then, then I hope I wouldn't have made those mistakes.

77
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.830
But I can't go back and change the past.

78
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.260
I can only do what we think is the right thing going forward.

79
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.980
So before we move off this privacy thing, and I thought that was a fascinating answer, want to take

80
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.640
off the hoodie?

81
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.150
You know, I never take off the I know you don't that there's a group.

82
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.520
Now, one of the reasons she probably wants him to take off the hoodie is she's able to sense how much

83
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.840
discomfort he's in.

84
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.500
And in order to answer the question at hand, they want him to feel comfortable again.

85
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.320
Women in the audience that wish you would know.

86
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.730
Now, at this moment, I also want you to observe their body language.

87
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:16.580
She is the interviewer here, is leaning away, leaning back and away from the interviewee, which is

88
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.480
Mark Zuckerberg.

89
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.370
And hotels are pointing away.

90
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.230
Her leg is crossed towards this other interviewer and her toes are pointing away.

91
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.300
What does that tell you?

92
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.760
That he is losing the attention.

93
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.080
He's losing the interest of the speakers of the interview with.

94
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.960
Huh, girls?

95
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.680
Whoa.

96
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.810
All right.

97
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.410
Sorry.

98
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.670
That's okay.

99
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.890
Can you explain what this instant personalization thing was that you did and why you did it?

100
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.710
And what was the what's the value of it to users?

101
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.930
Maybe I should take off the hoodie.

102
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.830
Take off the go ahead.

103
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.150
So again, the question was, can you explain instant personalization?

104
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.260
And now the response is directed towards the hoodie.

105
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.190
We get someone.

106
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.680
Are you all right?

107
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.360
Yeah.

108
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.490
This is a great moment in Internet history.

109
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.360
What?

110
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.180
All right.

111
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.420
What are we going to do with the mic?

112
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.110
Put it on your.

113
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.120
Put on the collar of your T-shirt.

114
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.060
You want.

115
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.250
You need some help?

116
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.900
No.

117
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.510
All right.

118
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.990
Okay.

119
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.570
Sorry about that.

120
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.800
No, we're not even yelling at you.

121
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.420
Yeah.

122
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.730
Yeah.

123
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.570
We're not going to yell at it now.

124
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.340
Of course not.

125
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.530
That is a warm hoodie.

126
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:40.980
Yeah.

127
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.850
No, it's a thick hoodie.

128
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.330
It's.

129
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.390
It's a company hoodie.

130
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.210
We print our mission on the inside.

131
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.850
What?

132
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.290
Oh, really?

133
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.430
The inside of the hoodie.

134
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.110
Everybody take it off.

135
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.160
What is it?

136
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.310
Making the making the world more open and connected.

137
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.120
Oh, my God.

138
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.480
It's like a secret vault.

139
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.040
Maybe that making the world open and connected.

140
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.560
Stream graph platform.

141
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.850
And this weird symbol in the middle that is probably for the Illuminati.

142
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:17.570
Now, at this point, one would think that the attention has successfully been diverted from privacy

143
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.520
violations to the hoodie.

144
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.820
Oh, 2000 and no, it's 2010.

145
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.020
Oh, no.

146
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.960
Now, as you can see.

147
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.280
As you can see.

148
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:45.810
That that video was an example of what not to do in an interview.

149
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.310
First of all, don't try diversion tactics.

150
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.550
There are several different kinds of lies and false.

151
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.880
There are things like falsification, aggrandized, fashion, miniaturization or minimization.

152
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.920
Diversion.

153
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.110
Diversion is one.

154
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.450
You want to answer the question that they ask you and then you want to follow that up with does that

155
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.590
answer the question?

156
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.830
So that's how you build a relationship.

157
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.900
There are more tricks to building a relationship, which we'll talk about in the next video.

158
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:28.050
But for now, I hope this was a fun activity for you and that you got a lot of tips so far on what to

159
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.960
do as well as what not to do in an interview.

160
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.940
As far as body language goes.

161
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.470
Thank you so much.

162
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:41.760
I was I look forward to seeing you in the next video and I hope I was able to add value to you.
