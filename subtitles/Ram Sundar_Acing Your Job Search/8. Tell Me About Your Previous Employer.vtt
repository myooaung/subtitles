00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.740
A lot of times in interviews you will come across or you will be asked this question.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.060
Let's talk about your current employer or your previous employer.

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.670
Remember the most fundamental rule you do not want to trash talk your previous employer.

4
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.700
You may have experienced the worst possible scenario.

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.300
You may have not left on the best terms.

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.550
But that still doesn't mean that you can trash talk them.

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.520
You may not get a referral from them, but when you trash talk your previous employer, you're not displaying

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.080
a sense of integrity.

9
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.560
It is okay to do that in a private setting, but not when you're talking to your future employer.

10
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.280
With your future employer.

11
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.250
You want to be forward focused or future focused, and you want to present your previous employer in

12
00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.000
such a way that it doesn't bring them into disrepute and it doesn't damage your reputation either.

13
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.660
So when you're asked to talk about a previous employer, especially during an interview, talk about

14
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:17.530
specifically what your goals are, what your what, what makes you happy, and what you have in mind

15
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.870
for your career goals.

16
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:29.350
So if your previous employer was toxic and you quit because of the situation, then talk about the kind

17
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.930
of person that you are and the kind of person that or the kind of company that your new employer would

18
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.690
be like.

19
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.840
And then go from there.

20
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.810
Talk about how.

21
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.590
Talk about something that will not damage that reputation.

22
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.190
Don't say toxic work culture.

23
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.600
Say something like.

24
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.860
I was working all this time and it was really enjoyable.

25
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.710
But at the same time I am career focused and I want to do this, this and this in order to achieve success

26
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.780
professionally and personally.

27
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.550
And that's why I'm here today.

28
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.980
So keep in mind that I didn't say anything bad about the previous company.

29
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.330
I said, I've enjoyed working there, but this is why I'm leaving.

30
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.800
And this again ties back to the previous question Why are you looking for a job?

31
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.100
So remember, never trust your employer and always leave on a good note.

32
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.510
Never on a sour note.
