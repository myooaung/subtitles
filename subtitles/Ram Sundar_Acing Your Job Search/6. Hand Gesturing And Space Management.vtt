00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.350
Hi again and welcome to the next section of this masterclass, which is hand gesturing.

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.240
Now, it's not it's not enough to just use your face to convey your point.

3
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.270
It looks very boring if I just keep talking like this.

4
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.630
So I want to use hand gesturing to convey my points.

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.400
So how do you do that?

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.830
Just like in video interviews.

7
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.710
In person interviews would be very similar.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.780
The only difference is that you would either be standing or sitting in front of the interviewer and

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.850
they can see you in your entirety and they can actually interact with you physically.

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.360
Right.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.680
So as far as hand gesturing goes, except when you're using welcoming gestures like this, like open

12
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.460
arms gestures, or when you're greeting someone with a hug, for instance, then you don't actually

13
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.780
extend your hands out.

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.740
But I would recommend a few things.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.060
First of all, keep your palms facing up, not down.

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.550
If you've seen courtroom dramas, then a lot of lawyers use this language when they're trying to convince

17
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.230
a jury on.

18
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.140
Effect.

19
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.600
So when they talk to a jury, then they showed this to show that they're not hiding anything.

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.740
Their palms are clean.

21
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.110
But when you turn them down, then that tells the listener that you're trying to hide something or you're

22
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.010
trying to bury something and you don't want to do that.

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.910
You want to show that.

24
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.380
You have nothing to hide, and you're you're there for an open discussion.

25
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.260
Remember, an interview is an open discussion.

26
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.530
Your employer, your potential employer has a problem.

27
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.140
They didn't they they decided that by interviewing someone, by giving someone a job, that problem

28
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.800
will be solved.

29
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.270
And why are you there?

30
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.360
To show that you can solve that problem for them.

31
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.180
And that's the bridge.

32
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.460
The interview is the bridge.

33
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.360
That's it.

34
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.540
Try to use open palmed gestures still to come across as open and forthcoming.

35
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.810
This means you're trying to hide something.

36
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.830
And if you have your palms out like this.

37
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.670
This way.

38
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.170
Then you're saying stop.

39
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.950
This is obstructing.

40
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.150
So stop.

41
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.470
Don't do that.

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.790
Keep open bonds and imagine.

43
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.360
This is your space in front of you.

44
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.050
So from shoulder to shoulder, all the way to your chest or whatever you can see during the interview.

45
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.960
And you don't want to go beyond this.

46
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.700
Otherwise it looks very awkward.

47
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:09.190
So when you're conveying a point is of point bullet points, for example, then you want to divide this

48
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.270
visual area into different parts.

49
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.460
So let's say I have three things to convey.

50
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.080
Then my first thing I would start with my left.

51
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.660
Point number one.

52
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.610
Point number two.

53
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.080
Point number three.

54
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.580
What I just did there was I broke down this space in front of me into three clear areas.

55
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.940
So they're easy to visualize.

56
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.050
You don't have to use any imagination.

57
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.010
You're making it easy for your interviewers to see and grasp the information quicker, because studies

58
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:58.330
show that most people are visual and when you show them through hand gestures, what the data, when

59
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.700
you show them through hand gestures, what you're trying to convey, then people tend to grasp much

60
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.510
more of that.

61
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.170
If you use that in a non chaotic way, if you use your space in an organized way.

62
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.030
So another way to do that would be to use your fingers.

63
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.750
Point number one.

64
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.720
Point number two.

65
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.840
Point number three.

66
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.790
But when you're using your fingers, they're more like stating rather than conveying information, you're

67
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.890
stating commands for.

68
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.230
For example, I want you to do this and then I want you to do this, and then I want you to do this

69
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.530
and.

70
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.960
As opposed to different areas.

71
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.890
And when you want to come across as being an expert, then one of the hand gestures, this is a power

72
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.140
move is to bring your fingers together like a steeple like this and just touch them gently as you're

73
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.710
talking.

74
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.430
If you've seen Shark Tank or Dragon's Den in Canada, then you may have seen Mr. Wonderful do that.

75
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.660
And this means this shows the interviewer that you know what you're talking about and that you are an

76
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.320
expert.

77
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.340
And when you press your fingers and fingertips too tight, then that indicates nervousness.

78
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.950
So you don't want to show nervousness.

79
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.060
You just want to show that you know what you're talking about like this.

80
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.200
This is not submissive.

81
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:42.020
It just it's it's it's very similar to this gesture when you however, when you cross your fingers like

82
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.780
this, when you test your palms and and you're doing this, then that's a sign of humility.

83
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.340
So when you're conveying something, when you're conveying a point, then you want to have open body

84
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.850
language.

85
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:03.890
And also this helps because when you're conveying something, then it's it can be inferred that you

86
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.380
know what you're talking about.

87
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.400
So at this moment, we'll talk about conveying versus convincing.

88
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.160
So there are two kinds of questions, objective and subjective.

89
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.920
So when you have an objective question, then what?

90
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.450
What could the response be?

91
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.860
Data.

92
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.490
Fact.

93
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.990
Yes or no.

94
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.240
Binary things like that.

95
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.070
Things that don't involve feelings.

96
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.860
And when something is subjective, then it is personal to you, and it could be personal to the interviewer

97
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.820
in a different way.

98
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.830
So when you're trying to convey information, then you want to you want to think about what the question

99
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.070
is.

100
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.440
Are you trying to convey information or are you trying to convince the interviewer?

101
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.940
If your interviewer ask you a question like How do you feel?

102
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.510
Or What do you think about or questions like that?

103
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.300
Then those are not data driven questions.

104
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.140
They involve you to talk about your feelings and your thought process.

105
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.560
Then you're trying to convince them.

106
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.230
And when you talk about questions like.

107
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.370
How many years did you work at this company or what exactly were your roles and responsibilities?

108
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.230
What did you do in 2021?

109
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.680
Why was there an employment gap and things like that?

110
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.440
Then you're talking about facts, you're talking about things that happen, so there's less convincing

111
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.660
involved there and more convenient information.

112
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.350
And with that, we will talk about a few other power moves.

113
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:52.140
If you have if you've ever seen the former German chancellor, Angela merkel, she she makes a diamond

114
00:07:52.140 --> 00:08:00.030
like this and stands away in 99% of her poses that you see of her pictures.

115
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.410
You see her standing like this.

116
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.570
And in fact, it's called the Merkel diamond.

117
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.950
And that is it's the same thing.

118
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.300
It's a steeple, but then inverted.

119
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.930
It conveys the same information.

120
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.520
It shows that you are an expert.

121
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.750
You know what you're talking about.

122
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.860
It's a power move now when someone.

123
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:31.070
When your interviewer, for example, is talking to you and conveying information or telling you convincing

124
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:40.370
that what they do is exciting and they're excited by the events in the story that they're telling you,

125
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.240
then it's always useful to lean forward.

126
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:51.650
And when you lean forward like this, then you can also choose to move your hands out of the way.

127
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:59.210
So you're you're displaying vulnerability and you're telling the interviewer that not only are you invested

128
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:06.440
in the story, you're actively listening, but you're also open to everything that they have to tell

129
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.830
you.

130
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:14.300
So you're you're actively listening, but at the same time, you're not creating an obstruction.

131
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.080
I mean this.

132
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.610
Of course, if I were to sit like this, then that would be really relaxed.

133
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:28.630
But it's also a power move because you're you're exposing your.

134
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.750
Of Fenton area.

135
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.710
And you're not creating any barriers.

136
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.340
But at the same time, you're in a super relaxed pose.

137
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:44.790
And that tells your listener, of course, you wouldn't do this in an interview, but it's just useful

138
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.600
to know that tells whoever is in front of you.

139
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.990
That you are not afraid.

140
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.930
You're in a position of extreme comfort.

141
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.170
Once again, think about comfort versus discomfort.

142
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:05.840
And I would highly recommend at this stage that before your video interview.

143
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:13.410
Create an account with Zoom or teams or Google meet whatever and.

144
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:21.530
Practice answering and looking at yourself in front of the camera so you don't have to use a mirror.

145
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:30.380
You can do this with Zoom because then it will be real and it will be exactly the way it would be in

146
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:39.100
an actual interview is have just yourself in the meeting and record yourself doing it.

147
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.960
Record yourself answering this.

148
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:49.820
Now, in some of the previous exercises we talked about how you you make a list of things that have

149
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.820
displayed different ways.

150
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:58.370
You've had the opportunity to display different qualities like teamwork, commitment, dedication,

151
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.210
focus.

152
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:08.330
Correcting a mistake that you made, for example, and you frame your responses according to that and.

153
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:17.360
You can practice delivering each of these in front of the camera and record it and play it back for

154
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.260
yourself so you can practice your body language.

155
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.390
You can practice delivering it the right way, stressing the right words at the right time.

156
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:34.340
Now, for any person to try to survive in the job market, three things have to exist.

157
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:41.060
A problem has to exist, which in this case is the job description, the job opening.

158
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:47.150
Second, you have to have the solution to that problem, which you must be a match.

159
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:55.160
And so when you know that you are a match for the job description, then you want to present it in the

160
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.800
right way.

161
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.710
And one of the ways to do it is through tone of voice, which means that you're stressing the right

162
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.820
words at the right time.

163
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.800
Thank you for joining me here and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
