00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome back to The Masterclass.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:12.000
And after 18 videos so far, we've covered how to create a targeted resume, how to decode a job description,

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.780
how to create a cover letter and a thank you note where and how to effectively apply and how to let

4
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.980
jobs find you.

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.780
We've also talked about body language during interviews, and at this stage I think this practice exercise

6
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:40.140
would be fun and informative for you, so feel free to stop this or pause the video at any point you

7
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.030
feel is necessary and write down your thoughts about what you see on the screen.

8
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.130
And let's talk about it.

9
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.990
We talked about comfort versus discomfort previously, and everything you do, everything you project

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.530
and present at an interview can be divided into either comfort behavior or discomfort behavior.

11
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:13.020
Now, when you look at the screen, what do you see projected in these two pictures?

12
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.960
Is it comfort or discomfort and why?

13
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:28.880
It is discomfort because you can see that the guy on the screen in the picture he's covering his face

14
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.040
is covering his forehead with his hands.

15
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.950
That's usually a sign of shame.

16
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.340
So it's usually that expression manifests itself when something embarrassing has happened.

17
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.590
And the same with the next picture as well is he's not able to believe what's going on.

18
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.620
Or you can tell that it's not normal based on comfortable behavior.

19
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.980
Moving on to the next one.

20
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770
Let's take a look at these two pictures here, side by side.

21
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
Can you spot the real smile from the fake smile?

22
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.310
And why.

23
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.520
If you answered that, the smile on the left is fake and the smile on the right is a real genuine smile.

24
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.140
Then you are correct.

25
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.640
How do we know that is when someone is truly smiling, when it's a genuine smile?

26
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.860
Then it's not the muscles.

27
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.650
In the cheeks, but it's the muscles near the eyes that contract and they reduce.

28
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.880
You cannot be genuinely smiling and have your eyes wide open at the same time.

29
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.650
So when you greet your interviewers, it's important you flash a genuine smile instead of a fake smile.

30
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.530
Because a modeling smile, although it looks nice, is not genuine.

31
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.770
And if you want to build a good relationship with your interviewer, then you want to show them a genuine

32
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.090
smile.

33
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.180
You want to show that you're actually enjoying the experience of being there.

34
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.930
What expression do you think this person here, the one second from the window is showing?

35
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.300
I can almost hear him say at the end of that expression.

36
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.890
Is that true?

37
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.030
Is it real?

38
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.630
Is your story real?

39
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.150
Whatever the other person is trying to tell it, that's disbelief.

40
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.320
That's surprise.

41
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.130
The lady closest to the camera is displaying happiness.

42
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.580
She has her thumb up.

43
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.310
She's got a smile on her face.

44
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.300
Although it's not genuine, she's posing for the camera, which is understandable because they're all

45
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.510
sitting here, presumably waiting for an interview.

46
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.590
But as you see these other people talking, then what can you gauge from this picture?

47
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.940
The person wearing the glasses, the one in the middle is probably telling a story and the others.

48
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.900
He has the attention of everyone else over there.

49
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.490
And they're all listening to him.

50
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.940
And it's presumably a story that could be hard to believe.

51
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.630
And that's why the expression on the faces of these two people, which is no surprise.

52
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.380
Their eyebrows are turned, their eyebrows are up.

53
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.140
And this expression, it's unmistakably surprise.

54
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.280
Let's take a look at another one.

55
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.690
What?

56
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.640
What expression do you see here?

57
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.590
Sadness.

58
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.110
If you answered sadness, then you are correct.

59
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.310
How do we know that?

60
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.300
It's sadness.

61
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.450
The muscles near the eyes are not tense, the jaw muscles are not tense.

62
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.730
And there's, of course, this side, the hand gesturing that shows that she is said.

63
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.370
But there's also the question of the eyebrows.

64
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.510
You cannot see them very clearly, but it's almost like if if the hair were known in the way, then

65
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.240
you would see the eyebrows pointed up this way.

66
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.050
What expression do you see here?

67
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.580
Nervousness.

68
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.900
If you answer nervousness, then you're correct.

69
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:54.820
The reason for that is you can see that there is no indicators on anywhere over here, but the eyes

70
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.870
and everything below it show fear.

71
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.110
So the eyes are wide open.

72
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.290
You can see that the pupils are dilated here.

73
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.640
And that happens when someone is afraid.

74
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.580
It's also because when you are in a position where you're afraid.

75
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.880
Then your eyes need to be extra aware of everything that's going on.

76
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.750
Because your brain needs to scan for all the signs of imminent danger.

77
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.210
And that's the reason I keep saying that.

78
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.040
Don't allow yourself.

79
00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.420
Don't allow your brain to think that it is a negative situation because an interview really isn't.

80
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.680
If you look at it, the problem, you're there to solve the problem.

81
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.900
Let's solve the interview is and treat it as such.

82
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.960
Treat your interviewer with respect and consideration, but treat the interview itself as just another

83
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.000
step to getting your dream job.

84
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.620
And with this, we will stop this exercise.

85
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.290
Thank you so much for joining me.

86
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:17.300
I hope it was fun for you as well, and I hope that you were able to learn as much about body language

87
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.510
as it takes to succeed in an interview.

88
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.510
The takeaway from this would be that you start developing your own style of delivering your responses.

89
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:36.170
You start analyzing your own videos by being the only person in a Zoom call.

90
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.440
But make sure that you record all your responses.

91
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.310
Make sure you rehearse them and deliver them the right way.

92
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.340
So when the time is right, you don't need to prepare for it.

93
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.450
You already will be.

94
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.070
Thank you very much.

95
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:55.850
And let's take a look at another video, another practice fun video in the next section.
