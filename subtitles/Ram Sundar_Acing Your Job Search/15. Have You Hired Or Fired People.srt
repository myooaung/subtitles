1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,150
Have you ever hired or fired people?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,140
When someone asks you this question, they're trying to establish whether or not you're cut out for

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,250
a corporate job.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, when you hire someone, you do it based on your best judgment and put yourself in your interviewer

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,500
shoes.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,370
Would you hire yourself?

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,570
That's the fundamental question here.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:33,300
When you establish your own candidacy for the position, but when you hire someone, then you're taking

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,110
into account their personality, their skills, that experience, and how they fit with the company.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,510
Now, if it doesn't work out, then you need to show resolve and fire them and or let them go.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,220
But the company might expect you as a team leader to justify your decision in firing this person.

12
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,780
So that means that if you're fired, if you have hired or fired people, then you can always tap into

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,920
your experience and and talk about what.

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,010
What qualities you look for when you're hiring.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,850
People don't just say yes or don't try to justify that.

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,090
Try to give some kind of reasoning or some data.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,930
Tap into your background and talk about what qualities you've looked for when you've hired people.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,750
And if you're fired, someone then talk about why you had to do that.

19
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:37,290
So again, start response right there, situation, what happened and then what was the what was the

20
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,980
consequence?

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,300
What was the result of that?

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,890
And what did you do?

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,760
You fired this person and what the result of that was?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Did it improve company morale?

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,300
Did it result in you hiring a different person?

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,070
Did it result in saving the company some money because this was a totally unproductive employee?

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,060
Think about everything.

28
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,720
And you want to show determination.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,070
You want to show results.

30
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,700
And if you've never hired or fired anybody, then just say so.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,550
Say that if your goal is to be a team leader, if if that is your goal, then talk about how it is your

32
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,140
goal to be a team leader and to be able to hire people.

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,650
Don't say be ready to be able to fire people, but just say you're looking for the opportunity to build

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,220
your own team, which will be productive and which will match the company's core values and things like

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,730
that.

36
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,190
Always related back to the company.
