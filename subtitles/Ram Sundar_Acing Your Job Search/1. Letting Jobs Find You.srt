00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,220
Welcome to the ninth video of this masterclass, which is about how to gain visibility efficiently.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:16,720
Now, when you have your resumÃ© and your LinkedIn profile created, the next thing is to gain visibility.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:24,220
Now you want to do this in the most efficient way possible, which is not just sit and apply for jobs,

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,380
but let jobs find you as well.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:33,460
So to do this, identify all the top job search sites in your area.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,560
For example, if you're in Toronto, Ziprecruiter is a big one.

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,360
But if you're out west, CareerBuilder could be a big one.

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,920
And in certain other places, like with Corporate Corp, Monster and Dice Dotcom are also big.

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:01:01,150
So the recommendation here is to upload your resume and fill out all the forms and make sure that everything

10
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,780
is consistent with your resume on every job search site.

11
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,470
Possible.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,340
Don't you do this?

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,600
Just keep track of all the websites where your resume is online.

14
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,920
Once a week.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,720
You want to just log in?

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,090
Click Update resuming.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:25,690
This is a trick that I use that I recommend to people that I teach as well is Click Update as May.

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,450
You don't have to actually update your resume unless there is something to be updated, but then just

19
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:30,810
save.

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,760
And the reason for that is when a recruiter or a hiring manager performs a search on any of these sites,

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,190
then the top search results will be the ones that were active most recently.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,930
And by just clicking on update resume and saving, you want to show that you are active.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,820
The same thing works for LinkedIn.

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,660
The more active you are, the more likely you are to appear at the top of the search list.

25
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,820
And the more relevant your keywords are to the job that you're gunning for.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,280
The more likely you are to appear at the top of the list.

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,290
So obviously combine the two, you have highly relevant keywords that maximize your chances of getting

28
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,780
found in a search result, as well as updating your your skills or your resume getting recommendations.

29
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:30,380
This works, especially for LinkedIn, is you should ask either your previous employers or people that

30
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:40,460
you've collaborated with, or if you're a fresh graduate, then your academic advisors or your teachers,

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:47,510
probably somebody who can recommend you and someone who can endorse your skills, especially on LinkedIn,

32
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,510
because that helps you get found as well.

33
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,770
And when you see recommendations, then it increases the confidence level for the recruiter or the hiring

34
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:04,790
manager and you are more likely to get invited to an interview sometimes even without even applying

35
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,600
for a job.

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
You will let Jobs find you.

37
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,990
Another way to do this is to network efficiently with recruiters.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,700
Now, recruiters, just like I told you before, they work on a many to many basis.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,900
So you have one recruiter with many clients on one side and many candidates on the other side.

40
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,800
So the recruiter can tap into a pool of candidates and choose which ones or recommend more than one

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,620
candidate to interview at any of their clients when the opportunity arises.

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:47,270
So what you want to do is contact as many recruiters as possible, upload your resume on the staffing

43
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,190
companies websites, try to build relationships.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm more about building relationships with people than about just selling.

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,870
The best people, the best salespeople are the ones that build good relationships.

46
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,900
Spend more time building a relationship with recruiters, with hiring managers, with your with the

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,030
staff at your university or college and so forth.

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,480
And when you do that, then you are more likely to get referred.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,630
You're more likely to let Jobs find you.

50
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,510
People will be more pleased to work with you.

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,260
So approach it from a standpoint of empathy.

52
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,390
Now, at this point, I want to explain to you the difference between empathy and sympathy.

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,000
Empathy is when you understand the other person's standpoint without.

54
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,190
Necessarily agreeing to it.

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,650
Sympathy is when you agree.

56
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,770
And when you empathize with someone, you understand where they're coming from and you can act accordingly

57
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,740
to maintain a harmonious relationship.

58
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,930
And when you maintain harmony in relationships, that's when you can really maximize your chances for

59
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,680
success.

60
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:13,170
Now, Daniel Pink, in his masterclass on Sales and Persuasion, he talks about how you can write the

61
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,130
letter E!

62
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,110
And in front of you in the air.

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,980
And if you do this.

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,840
Then you're seeing it as a reverse.

65
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,980
So I'm doing this from my perspective, so I'm not thinking about it from the other person's perspective.

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,790
But if I were to write an E like this, that's an E to you.

67
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,680
It's reversed.

68
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,300
To me, that means that I'm empathizing and making it more convenient for you.

69
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,300
To see what I'm writing in the air.

70
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,980
So think about it.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,440
Empathy versus empathy and use an empathetic approach to selling your skills.

72
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,840
Always think about what the other person will want and act accordingly.

73
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,700
Talk to hiring managers, talk to recruiting managers, connect on LinkedIn if you can afford a premium

74
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,520
membership.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:13,190
Then during the peak of your job search, it's also advisable to pay for a premium membership because

76
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,080
it allows you to connect with people.

77
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:23,630
It allows you to send emails directly to hiring managers, directly to staffing company managers, and

78
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,630
to recruiters without having to connect with them.

79
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,730
And it's probably not advisable to send connection requests unless you've actually built a relationship

80
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,590
with that person.

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,530
And Premium helps you send an email without needing to connect first.

82
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,440
And this way you can show off your skills.

83
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,600
You can invite them to view your profile.

84
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:58,610
In that situation, your cover letter would go something like, This is who you are and this is why

85
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,100
you're interested in working for the company.

86
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,880
And the call to action, which is the last line in a standard cover letter, you would have mentioned

87
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,870
something like I'm available for interviews immediately and may be contacted by via this email or phone

88
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,370
number or whatever.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,790
Right.

90
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:23,930
You would change it slightly to include, I invite you to view my LinkedIn profile and this is the link.

91
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,600
And once again, if you don't have the LinkedIn.

92
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,380
You know, stash your name.

93
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,310
It's recommended that you get one because it's easier to remember.

94
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,230
Thank you.

95
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,190
And I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
