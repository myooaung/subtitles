00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi and welcome back to The Masterclass.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.060
Let's talk about sitting and standing during interviews.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.690
So we already covered part of this.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.480
When you're sitting, plant your feet firmly on the ground.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.500
I have your torso and the rest of your body facing the camera and your shoulders up and out slightly

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.020
to project confidence.

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.380
You do not want to round your shoulders out or slouch them or have your head disappear into your neck

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.300
like this, because that shows a lack of confidence and you want to project yourself as the candidate

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.320
that that can solve the problem that the interviewers have.

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.630
Now, what happens if you're standing?

11
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.170
Then you want to make sure that your toes are pointing towards the interviewer and especially when you

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.860
greet them.

13
00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.230
This is vital because when your toes are pointing to in any other direction, then you will not be entirely

14
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.980
invested.

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.890
What it means is during the evolution of humans, the feet and the legs have been the most reliable

16
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.330
partners for us to run away or to face danger.

17
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.710
And in order to do that, the feet have just like other extremities.

18
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.800
When you're faced in an uncomfortable situation, then all the blood flows to your extremities, your

19
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.340
fingertips, your feet, your toes, things like that.

20
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.330
So when you're not comfortable and you don't want to be in an interview, you don't want to be in that

21
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.620
situation, then the first thing, the most reliable indicator of that would be your toes, and they

22
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.030
would point towards the exit.

23
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.330
Now if you're pointing towards the exit, then that immediately tells me, for example, that you don't

24
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.260
want to be part of that conversation, and that would be a red flag.

25
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.260
We want to avoid red flags here.

26
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.640
Face the interviewer.

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.610
What if you have multiple interviewers?

28
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.930
You always know that one person is the leader of that group and the main interviewer.

29
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.330
They may not be the topmost boss, but they will be the ones that they will be the person that takes

30
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.280
charge and wants to interview you and face them.

31
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.790
And if you don't know who that person is, then face everyone else equally and try to face the person

32
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.570
in the middle.

33
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.690
And it's okay to turn your torso when you're talking to different people like this.

34
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.780
But you don't need to turn your entire body, your your toes don't need to shift from one person to

35
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.910
another every time you answer a question put forth by a different interviewer, so be stable.

36
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.920
And another piece of advice would be your physical stability in the stability of your structure will

37
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.070
determine how confident your responses are as well.

38
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:15.290
So don't stand don't lean too far back or to the sides, because if you're not stable enough, then

39
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.810
your responses will be will not be concrete either.

40
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.610
So that said.

41
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.880
You also want to lean slightly forward instead of backward.

42
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.310
And when you lean slightly forward towards the person that's talking to you, you don't need to lean

43
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.220
all the way like this, but just a little forward.

44
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.290
That tells the interviewer that you are invested in that conversation.

45
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.310
And it tells the interviewer that you are actively listening.

46
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.840
And this is about sitting and standing.

47
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.350
When you're when you're standing, don't make unnecessary movements with your hands.

48
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.600
Of course, we talked about the handshake and all that earlier, but other than that, if you want a

49
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.550
distraction, then you can always hold on to your resume.

50
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:19.090
Or if you have a tablet or or device to share a presentation, then you can always hold on to those

51
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.050
and that that would give your hands something to do.

52
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.570
But if there's nothing to do, then avoid the need to stretch.

53
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.150
Or do things like this.

54
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.280
Or stretch your arms.

55
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.300
Avoid.

56
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.650
Avoid all these.

57
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.780
So just keep your arms next to your sides and by your side and just be casual but at the same time be

58
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.120
actively invested in the conversation.

59
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:55.450
You can also use your hands for gesturing if your hands are free and some hand gestures we already covered

60
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.890
in the previous video.

61
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.340
Now I'll cover some more hand gestures here.

62
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.950
If you're talking about.

63
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.520
Yourself.

64
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.130
Then you say I.

65
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.560
But if you're talking about you all, then that could be you.

66
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.210
Of us.

67
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.470
All of us.

68
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.360
None of us.

69
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.980
But notice that my arms, my hands don't go.

70
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.680
Don't extend far beyond my shoulders.

71
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.320
And that's because of this space that I talked to you about.

72
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.240
You want to keep your hand gesturing within that space.

73
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.320
Now, that said, thank you so much for watching and I look forward to the next video.
