00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.670
Some of the most successful candidates sell experiences.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.440
They don't sell themselves.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.970
They don't sell their skills.

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.980
They help the hiring manager associate them with a happy memory.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.080
And that's what compels the hiring manager to call them back.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.550
That said, welcome to the eighth video of this masterclass, which is about creating an elevator pitch.

7
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.090
In the previous video, we saw how to create a cover letter and a thank you note and the importance

8
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.960
of both of them.

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:45.220
Now, that said, an elevator pitch is essentially a 62nd pitch on what separates you from your competitors,

10
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.480
what separates you from the rest of the candidates applying for the same position?

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.220
And why is it 60 seconds?

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.200
Think about it as you and a hiring manager in a hypothetical situation in an elevator and you get in

13
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.420
at the same floor or you're getting off at the same floor.

14
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.390
So let's say you have 60 seconds to convey what makes you special and.

15
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.980
You have to focus on three things here.

16
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.660
Who you are.

17
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.910
What your experience is about and most importantly, what separates you from your competitors?

18
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.710
What value do you bring to the company?

19
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.670
What value do you bring to the position that no one else would?

20
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.480
So that's it.

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.540
I like to separate my elevator pitches into two different types a stock elevator pitch and a job specific

22
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.620
elevator pitch.

23
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.180
A stock elevator pitch.

24
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.350
You must create memorize it so that even if someone wakes you from deep sleep, you should still be

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.020
able to recite it without any problems.

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.540
And that's the kind of mastery that should that you should have for your elevator pitch.

27
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
There is good reason for this is because when.

28
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.250
Almost every interview starts off with Tell me about yourself.

29
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
You need to be prepared to set the tone for the rest of the interview.

30
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.450
And the elevator pitch is the single most important thing that helps you accomplish that you will talk

31
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.840
about in the in the stock elevator pitch.

32
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.070
You can talk about what your name is and how many years of education or experience you have.

33
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.360
Things like that.

34
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.250
Mention one.

35
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:41.010
Key data driven accomplishment that a hiring manager might find useful for a job specific elevator pitch.

36
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:49.200
We work under the assumption that you've been invited to an interview, and your elevator pitch is tailored

37
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.740
to that particular job at that particular company.

38
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.410
So it changes slightly.

39
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.320
You do not need to include your name anymore because they know you're there.

40
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.060
They reviewed your resume.

41
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.200
They know who you are.

42
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.810
But you can include your education and your experience and the key accomplishment that separates you

43
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.410
from from the rest of them.

44
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.870
Now, as far as what values you bring to the company are concerned.

45
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.250
You can talk about things like how you match up with the core values of the company.

46
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.430
You can talk about some of the key words and tie them to your resume just like you did while creating

47
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.180
your resume.

48
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.300
You can use that in the elevator pitch as well.

49
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:45.080
A good example would be something like I have a bachelor's degree in finance and over the course of

50
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.000
seven years I've learned enough skills to help me overhaul the payroll system at my previous employer,

51
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.540
and that saved the company $100,000.

52
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:06.110
This is a hypothetical situation, but you can see how overhauling the payroll system and saving the

53
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.000
company $100,000 would actually benefit them.

54
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.440
And this would spark enough curiosity with the listener that they would want to know more about how

55
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.130
you did that.

56
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.190
So that sets the tone for the rest of the interview.

57
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.500
So have two elevator pitches, one job specific and one stock elevator pitch.

58
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.140
And for every interview it is advisable to change your job specific elevator pitch.

59
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.000
Thank you.

60
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.730
I hope I was able to add value.

61
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.830
I look forward to seeing you in the next video.
