1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,840
So far, the entire interview process has been from the perspective of the employer.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,190
So I'd like to talk a little bit about what it means from your perspective.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,100
How can you make yourself a more marketable candidate or a superstar interviewee?

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,080
It's through creating a unique selling proposition or a USP.

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:31,240
Now, you might be unique, but it doesn't mean anything if you cannot project it to your to your interviewers

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,020
the right way.

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,910
And this is what I tell my business coaching clients as well.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,260
So how do you create your unique selling proposition?

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:46,210
See, when you graduate from college, then it's very, very likely that you're going to be a generalist,

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,780
which means that you have some general idea of how things work, but you don't have any real exposure

11
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,400
to to the industry because academia and industry are two different things, right?

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,950
So when you gain experience, as you keep gaining experience, as you keep working with more companies

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,170
or in better roles or whatever, then you start building up not just your resume.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,620
You start building up a set of skills that all amount to something, that amount to get you where you

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,000
are.

16
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:26,560
And if you're in college now, or if you've just graduated and you're looking for a job, then this

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,340
is your time to think about where you want to be in the next two years, five years, ten years, whatever.

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,510
Yeah.

19
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,730
Okay, let's not think about ten years for now.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,700
Let's let's think about short, medium and long term.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,380
By short term, I mean in about three months, medium term, I'm thinking two years and long term,

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,580
maybe five years.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:57,430
So that said, think about all the skills that you need that you think you will need in the next three

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,160
months or six months or two years.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,340
And think about what your ideal employer is going to look like.

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,240
So if you already have an ideal employer in mind, then take a look at their job postings and see if

27
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,420
there's something that that interests you.

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,810
You may or may not be an immediate fit, but it's something to definitely consider and keep in mind

29
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,520
because just having a copy of that, just having it somewhere on your computer or print it out, pasted

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,310
on the wall, whatever, will give you an idea of what skills it takes to be part of that company,

31
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,990
and you can work towards that.

32
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:48,700
Now, as we evolve, our goals evolve as well, and the challenges we face will determine some career

33
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,280
paths that some detours that we take.

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,290
So it's never a straight line.

35
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,940
So when you start out from college, you're here and then suddenly you face some kind of challenge and

36
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,730
that that forces you to detour.

37
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,400
And then you start learning a different set of skills and then you continue back on that path.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,870
And then there's another detour.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,660
So more, more likely than not, your graph, instead of a straight line, is going to be up and down

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,350
like this.

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:24,040
But as long as you're dedicated to to what you want to do and who you want to be, then it'll definitely

42
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,710
show an upward trajectory.

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,840
So that's a.

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,080
Creating a unique selling proposition will involve let's let's say, three steps.

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,000
First one, what makes you special if you're still lacking experience, if you have less than two years

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,750
of experience, then it's likely that there's not too many things that make you special, that make

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,510
you stand out from 200 other candidates that are that have sent their resume for the same position.

48
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:56,940
Right.

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,270
So don't worry, there's always time to work on something.

50
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:10,760
What it means is that you can always project yourself as someone who is willing to learn because you're

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
making it a part of your career goals.

52
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,790
So it's not just willing to learn so you can do a good job and take home a salary, but it's willing

53
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,100
to learn from a career standpoint.

54
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,340
And this is something that employers find very desirable.

55
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:35,210
And you will thank yourself in a few years time if you think back to this day and decide to have to

56
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,470
learn a few courses if you're in college or if you've just graduated and you still have your student

57
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:51,350
credentials, then it's also a good idea to to pick up new courses, such as if you're in India engineering

58
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:59,870
field, then you can learn computer aided design or analysis or things like statistical software, whatever,

59
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,290
whatever will get your career accelerating.

60
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,460
Think about doing certified courses and then do them, of course.

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,080
But if.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,920
A $50 course which has a certificate which comes with a verified certificate of any value.

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,430
Right.

64
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:28,460
If a $50 course will get you a job that pays you $100 more each month, then within a couple of weeks,

65
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,520
you would have already recovered the investment that you made in that course.

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:41,990
So think about that for a moment and keep doing this over and over until you have a lot of knowledge

67
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,710
which will propel your career in the direction you wish to go.

68
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,970
So regardless of challenges, you won't be stuck there needing a job.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,330
You jobs will come to you because you will become a desirable candidate at some point of time.

70
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:02,300
You could also show those those certificates, and that's the effort that you've put into self development,

71
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,530
personal development.

72
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,910
And you can say, this is me and this is what I'm capable of.

73
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,350
So what more do you need?

74
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean.

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,550
Think about it.

76
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:22,400
And the unique selling proposition is what separates you from all your competitors.

77
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,330
When you think about, let's say, Domino's Pizza.

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,550
There is nothing great about.

79
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,180
There's nothing really special about them.

80
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,210
They're a pizza company.

81
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,890
And there are so many others.

82
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,730
So why?

83
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,150
Why did Domino's Pizza become a multibillion dollar company?

84
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,440
It's because they had something unique, even with something as generic as pizza.

85
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:56,290
They cater to to college students who are hungry and who wanted to have pizza within 30 minutes, 30

86
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,340
minutes or free.

87
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,800
And they wanted it cheap because it was college students.

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,660
So they had two unique, unique things about them that separated them from all their competitors, and

89
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:19,260
they use those two things to their advantage and projected themselves as the viable choice for most

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,170
college kids, most college students.

91
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:31,920
So this is the kind of thinking that will help you establish your market leading position or unique

92
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,150
selling proposition.

93
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,350
Thank you.

94
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,990
And in the next video, we will go through the closing and the checklist.

95
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:47,010
And if you've come this far, then congratulations and thank you very much for being a part of this

96
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,370
course.

97
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,460
I hope that I've added a lot of value to you.

98
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,440
See you in the next video.
