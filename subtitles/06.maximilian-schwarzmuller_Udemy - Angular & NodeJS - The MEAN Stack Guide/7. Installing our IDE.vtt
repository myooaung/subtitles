So in the last lecture, we created our Angular application and now we want to edit it.

1
00:07.190 --> 00:13.010
As I mentioned, for this we want to use an IDE or some advanced text editor because that simply makes

2
00:13.010 --> 00:15.330
working with our code much easier.

3
00:15.410 --> 00:20.520
In this course, I will use a Visual Studio Code and that code part is important, not Visual Studio,

4
00:20.530 --> 00:22.540
Visual Studio Code.

5
00:22.700 --> 00:23.820
It's a free IDE,

6
00:23.930 --> 00:24.860
totally free,

7
00:24.860 --> 00:26.000
it's pretty powerful, it's

8
00:26.000 --> 00:27.460
highly extensible,

9
00:27.560 --> 00:34.460
it's awesome and it's available for Mac but also for Windows, Linux, you can pick your installer version here if

10
00:34.460 --> 00:40.040
it doesn't auto-select the right one automatically. Simply download it then and walk through the installer

11
00:40.070 --> 00:40.760
it gives you,

12
00:40.760 --> 00:42.650
there should be nothing special about that and

13
00:42.770 --> 00:47.230
once you've got it installed, open it. If you open it, it should look something like this,

14
00:47.240 --> 00:48.380
you'll probably see that

15
00:48.380 --> 00:49.360
welcome page

16
00:49.430 --> 00:54.590
and there you can click open folder to open that Angular project we created with the CLI

17
00:54.680 --> 01:00.100
a few seconds ago. If you don't see that page, then you can always open it through File, Open.

18
01:00.110 --> 01:03.180
Now, let's click open folder and navigate to the folder.

19
01:03.200 --> 01:08.750
Here I've selected that MEAN course project and I can click open now and this loads it into the IDE so that

20
01:08.750 --> 01:10.080
we can work on it there.

21
01:10.100 --> 01:14.300
Now, the IDE might look a bit different for you, maybe it doesnt have this dark theme,

22
01:14.300 --> 01:19.910
it probably has different icons and that is simply something I fine-tuned for myself, so

23
01:19.910 --> 01:26.300
I like this way of looking and working and I will show you how to get there. If you're using a different

24
01:26.300 --> 01:26.660
IDE, you of course have 

25
01:26.660 --> 01:30.950
to fine-tune it on your own. For Visual Studio Code,

26
01:31.040 --> 01:37.760
I want to install a certain extension first of all, two extensions to be precise and for that, go to View

27
01:38.250 --> 01:39.280
-> Extensions,

28
01:39.500 --> 01:43.180
you might also see a bar on the left where you can click on the extensions icon and

29
01:43.600 --> 01:47.570
on this page, make sure to install Angular Essentials.

30
01:47.570 --> 01:49.740
Now here I already got that installed,

31
01:49.790 --> 01:55.940
you can search for Angular here and you should quickly find the Angular Essentials package, search for

32
01:56.090 --> 01:57.020
Angular Essentials otherwise and

33
01:57.030 --> 02:03.200
that's a pretty amazing collection of different extensions that enhance the IDE to work

34
02:03.200 --> 02:04.820
better with Angular.

35
02:04.820 --> 02:10.250
So simply install this with the install button and feel free to skip or read through the documentation

36
02:10.250 --> 02:13.150
here to find out what's included and how it works.

37
02:13.490 --> 02:18.610
Besides that, I use one other extension which is purely optical,

38
02:18.660 --> 02:22.600
it's the Material Icon Theme here, so

39
02:22.630 --> 02:28.300
by searching for material, you should find it. Also install this if you like the way my icons look

40
02:28.300 --> 02:30.450
in this course, it's purely visual,

41
02:30.460 --> 02:34.250
it gives you nicer file icons and I quite like these.

42
02:34.390 --> 02:39.460
So with that, you can go back to View Explorer once you're done and you should see something like this.

43
02:39.670 --> 02:46.000
Well I also use a dark theme and you can get that same look by going to

44
02:46.210 --> 02:48.240
code thing here, preferences and there, color theme and here,

45
02:48.280 --> 02:54.740
I'm using Dark+, by default, you probably are using Light+ or Light.

46
02:54.780 --> 02:59.520
Now you can try out these different themes here by simply clicking on them, you can always switch and

47
02:59.520 --> 03:01.340
choose the style you like.

48
03:01.350 --> 03:03.530
Now with that, you get the same setup as I do,

49
03:03.540 --> 03:06.900
now let's get started working on our Angular app.

50
03:06.900 --> 03:11.540
This is the folder the Angular CLI created for us, time to edit it.
