00:02.120 --> 00:09.300
So welcome to another module in this course. In the last module, we added authentication, in this module

00:09.330 --> 00:13.690
I will add authorization and that's a slightly different thing.

00:13.910 --> 00:21.110
In the last lecture, we made sure that the users interacting with our webpage need to be authenticated which

00:21.110 --> 00:28.220
means they need to have an account in order to be able to create posts, edit posts or delete posts and

00:28.280 --> 00:31.200
see these options in the first place.

00:31.220 --> 00:34.710
Now authorization goes one step further.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.970
We don't want to allow every user to edit or delete every post.

00:39.980 --> 00:44.880
Users should instead be connected to the posts they created in the database,

00:44.900 --> 00:46.320
so we want to have a connection,

00:46.400 --> 00:54.410
we want to store the ID of a user who created a post and then when a user tries to delete a post, we

00:54.410 --> 01:01.520
want to check that the user who did this really is the user who created the post. So that is what we

01:01.520 --> 01:07.530
will implement in this module, authorization which is all about connecting users and posts.
