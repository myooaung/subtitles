00:02.070 --> 00:06.830
So now we're updating the information in our header, for our messages,

00:06.830 --> 00:13.710
we want to do the same, the edit and delete button should only be visible if we are authenticated.

00:14.150 --> 00:18.600
Of course we can simply go to the post-list component and edit it there.

00:18.770 --> 00:22.680
For that, we can implement the same logic we have in the header component.

00:22.910 --> 00:29.070
We'll first of all inject our auth service with private or public, that by the way

00:29.070 --> 00:30.430
doesn't really matter here,

00:30.440 --> 00:32.450
you can use either. With public,

00:32.450 --> 00:38.260
you could theoretically directly access the service from within your template, though this is discouraged,

00:38.300 --> 00:41.390
so you can also just use private here.

00:41.430 --> 00:49.050
So I will use private auth service of type auth service and we import that of course from our auth service

00:49.050 --> 00:49.590
file,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.980
so this path needs to be added.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.290
That yields the auth service and now again, we need to set up that listener.

00:57.310 --> 01:05.900
So first of all, I'll add a private property for the subscription, authStatusSubs or sub which is of

01:05.900 --> 01:12.680
type subscription and in ngOnInit, I want to set it up. There we have our post service subscription

01:12.680 --> 01:14.890
for the posts next to it

01:14.990 --> 01:20.360
and remember, this will execute immediately after this because it will not wait for that subscription

01:20.360 --> 01:21.610
to yield something.

01:22.190 --> 01:30.910
There I add this auth service, get AuthStatusListener and call subscribe on the return observable and

01:30.930 --> 01:39.420
the result of the subscribed call is the subscription which I'll store in authStatusSub. authStatusSub

01:39.620 --> 01:42.170
is then cleared in ngOnDestroy,

01:42.300 --> 01:44.280
there I will call this 

01:44.280 --> 01:45.320
authStatusSub

01:45.610 --> 01:48.420
unsubscribe. With that,

01:48.420 --> 01:51.140
we have to do something in that subscribe method here.

01:51.180 --> 01:54.700
There we again get the isAuthenticated information,

01:54.780 --> 02:00.930
so a boolean which is true or false telling us whether the user is authenticated or not and I want

02:00.930 --> 02:04.260
to store this in a special property on this page.

02:04.440 --> 02:11.110
So there I will add a public property which is userIsAuthenticated

02:11.110 --> 02:14.370
again, you can name this whatever you want of course

02:15.350 --> 02:23.450
and then in my subscription here, I will set this userIsAuthenticated equal to the isAuthenticated

02:23.630 --> 02:27.120
information I'm getting from my service.

02:28.450 --> 02:32.780
We can now use that userIsAuthenticated property in the template

02:32.830 --> 02:40.450
and as I mentioned, this whole action row should only be shown if we are authenticated. So here I will add

02:40.540 --> 02:49.920
ngIf userIsAuthenticated, only then this should be added to the DOM, otherwise it shouldn't.

02:49.920 --> 02:56.940
So now if we reload the app and therefore we are not logged in, we can see that we get no buttons down

02:56.940 --> 02:57.290
there

02:57.330 --> 02:58.620
and that's correct

02:58.740 --> 03:06.540
and as soon as I do login here and I go back, we actually also don't see them.

03:06.540 --> 03:11.800
Now this can be quite challenging to identify, what's the issue here?

03:13.610 --> 03:18.840
The problem is in the post list component, we're setting up our listener, right,

03:18.980 --> 03:25.030
and this of course means whenever we push that authentication information, this will be updated here.

03:25.400 --> 03:33.090
But the problem is the post list component is only loaded after we logged in because we navigated to it,

03:33.140 --> 03:38.440
so ngOnInit only runs after we have authenticated ourselves.

03:38.780 --> 03:44.000
So this of course means there is no new information being pushed after the post list component has been

03:44.000 --> 03:47.260
created and we don't fetch the current information here,

03:47.300 --> 03:49.700
we just push new information.

03:49.890 --> 03:56.480
Now there are a couple of ways of solving this, one is for example to use a different type of subject.

03:56.480 --> 04:03.290
There is a subject which automatically should yield you the previous value but I will use a very straightforward

04:03.350 --> 04:07.420
way instead. Here in auth service,

04:07.630 --> 04:16.210
I will simply add a new private property, isAuthenticated which I'll set to false initially and I will

04:16.210 --> 04:20.240
set it to true in the same place where I push that information,

04:20.470 --> 04:28.440
so here I will set this isAuthenticated equal to true or at least I want to do that if we have a token

04:28.440 --> 04:29.570
because that's a check

04:29.570 --> 04:36.640
I should add anyways, only if we have a valid token, only then I want to set this to true and only then

04:36.640 --> 04:38.290
I want to change the status.

04:38.550 --> 04:43.800
So I will first of all check if we have that token because we could have gotten a response which contains

04:43.830 --> 04:44.840
no token,

04:45.150 --> 04:49.610
so only if that is the case I want to set this

04:49.820 --> 04:55.550
but if it is the case, well then I will use this isAuthenticated and set this to true and push that

04:55.550 --> 04:58.230
information to the other components.

04:58.250 --> 05:04.010
Now since we have this authenticated property in this component now, I can add a new method here at the top,

05:04.670 --> 05:12.400
getAuthStatus or maybe getIsAuth and there I will return

05:12.420 --> 05:14.790
this is authenticated

05:15.060 --> 05:20.130
and now we can call this method to find out whether the user is authenticated. In the post list

05:20.130 --> 05:20.630
component,

05:20.630 --> 05:21.890
I will do that.

05:22.020 --> 05:27.480
I will register this listener because this will become important once we connect the logout button

05:27.840 --> 05:32.960
which will be in here and therefore we are on the page when the auth status changes

05:33.300 --> 05:39.630
but for now when we first visit the page, I will have set this user is authenticated by reaching out

05:39.630 --> 05:43.500
to the auth service and calling getIsAuth there.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.460
And now with that, if we reload and I login

05:50.530 --> 05:54.900
and I go back to my messages, now we correctly see the buttons.

05:54.910 --> 05:57.390
So now this is also working in this case.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.090
Now we're still not there yet,

05:59.110 --> 06:05.410
we need to connect the logout button and we also have another issue. If we are not authenticated, we can still

06:05.470 --> 06:13.000
create a new post by manually entering the URL, I can enter /create here and boom, I'm on the

06:13.000 --> 06:14.150
creation page,

06:14.200 --> 06:16.010
I also want to prevent this.

06:16.180 --> 06:17.870
So still some work to do.
