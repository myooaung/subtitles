00:02.220 --> 00:09.930
Let's start with the toolbar because I think every application has some sort of header and I'll actually

00:09.930 --> 00:11.690
create a new component for that,

00:11.730 --> 00:14.580
so not in the post folder but in the app folder itself

00:14.590 --> 00:20.600
I'll add a new folder, header and in there I want to create my own header components, so I'll name it

00:20.600 --> 00:26.620
header.component.ts and add a header.component.html file, you learned how we create

00:26.670 --> 00:30.050
these component, so go through that a bit quicker.

00:30.120 --> 00:39.060
Export my class header component in there and add the @component decorator which you need to import

00:39.060 --> 00:39.510
from

00:39.570 --> 00:42.490
@angular/core, my IDE automatically added the import,

00:42.540 --> 00:45.440
you might need to do that manually depending on your IDE.

00:45.900 --> 00:54.960
Add a selector, I'll name it app header and then also add a template or a template url and here

00:55.020 --> 01:00.520
I'll be pointing to my header.component.html file.

01:00.590 --> 01:04.280
Now that's the header component typescript file, in the html file,

01:04.290 --> 01:08.890
I will use yet another component provided by the angular/material framework.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.250
So in app module we need to unlock that first, here to our import list from @angular/material,

01:15.250 --> 01:20.340
I'll import yet another module, the mat toolbar module.

01:20.340 --> 01:27.060
Now as you probably can guess, this unlocks a certain toolbar component, to unlock it for angular, we need

01:27.060 --> 01:31.320
to add this to our imports array

01:31.680 --> 01:34.360
and now we can use the material design toolbar.

01:34.490 --> 01:40.710
Let's quickly checkout the docs, there on the left you find toolbar and you can check out the demo code,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.390
as you can see it's really easy to use,

01:42.390 --> 01:43.420
not that difficult,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.370
you can configure a lot though,

01:45.390 --> 01:48.830
again feel free to read through the entire documentation here.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.370
So I will add it in my header component toolbar and we can for example set a color which I will set

01:55.370 --> 02:01.620
to primary because I don't like that boring gray-ish look and there for now,

02:02.610 --> 02:07.530
I'll just set my messages as a title so to say.

02:07.530 --> 02:10.550
Now the header component isn't used yet, to use it

02:10.560 --> 02:16.590
we first of all need to unlock it, so we go to declarations in our app module, not imports because we're

02:16.590 --> 02:21.160
not importing another module, we're just importing another component in our case

02:21.330 --> 02:28.230
and there I will add my own component, so I'll again let my IDE automatically import this and I will

02:28.230 --> 02:33.360
just add header component and my IDE adds the import up here,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.310
this is important.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.100
So now this is added, now we can use the header component here

02:40.670 --> 02:48.900
and I want to use it in my app component, instead of our first app, I'll add app header like this.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.230
Now with that added here, let's save this,

02:52.240 --> 02:57.980
let's go back to our application and we get this nice toolbar above the rest of our application.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.330
Now the card is sitting directly on the edge of the toolbar, to change this, what we can do is we can

03:04.420 --> 03:10.080
simply wrap our main content with the main element.

03:10.090 --> 03:17.170
Now that's a normal html element, put our post create component in there and now style that main element

03:17.290 --> 03:22.720
directly here in the app component.css file maybe and you can of course also use css class

03:22.720 --> 03:25.610
selectors, you don't have to always select the elements,

03:25.660 --> 03:33.850
so here I will give this some margin to the top of let's say 1rem or 16 pixels would be the equivalent, 

03:34.330 --> 03:36.100
whichever unit you prefer,

03:36.160 --> 03:37.580
I will work with rems here.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.330
So we get some distance between the card and the toolbar,

03:40.550 --> 03:44.560
now the thing that is missing for now, we'll add navigation later,

03:44.590 --> 03:51.330
the thing that is missing for now is a way to output the posts. It would be nice to output the posts below

03:51.550 --> 03:53.320
our input area here,

03:53.590 --> 03:54.970
so let's do this next.
