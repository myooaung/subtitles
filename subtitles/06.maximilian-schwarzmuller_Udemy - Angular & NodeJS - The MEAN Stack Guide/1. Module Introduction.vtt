00:02.120 --> 00:03.600
Welcome to this module,

00:03.600 --> 00:10.080
now that we're all set up and learned how we set up our IDE and create our first angular experience,

00:10.620 --> 00:13.350
let's dive into our course project.

00:13.350 --> 00:17.410
Now you will learn how the mean stack works on a real project,

00:17.460 --> 00:25.440
we'll build a simple posting, messaging like app where users can create and edit and delete posts and see

00:25.440 --> 00:28.950
the posts of other users which they can't edit though,

00:29.130 --> 00:36.210
so a mini-social network we could say, this is what we build and we'll actually start with the angular

00:36.210 --> 00:37.160
frontend.

00:37.350 --> 00:43.050
So if we have a look at our big picture here on how the mean stack works, we're going to focus on the

00:43.050 --> 00:45.830
left side here, on the client side

00:45.960 --> 00:51.480
and the reason for this simply is that by doing that, we can see something very quickly, the backend

00:51.480 --> 00:57.510
holds a lot of logic but we don't see that much of that if we don't have a frontend where we can actually

00:57.510 --> 00:59.970
render our data and display it.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.370
So we'll start with the left part because we can always work with some dummy data until we have the real

01:05.370 --> 01:06.470
backend added

01:06.720 --> 01:09.840
but we get a beautiful UI right from the start.

01:09.900 --> 01:15.510
So this is what we'll start with in this module and I will also give you a brief reintroduction to

01:15.540 --> 01:16.370
angular,

01:16.380 --> 01:20.420
now I strongly recommend going through a dedicated angular course first,

01:20.520 --> 01:27.300
this is not a course that teaches you angular from the ground up but I will cover the important basics

01:27.330 --> 01:28.980
and briefly refresh them

01:29.010 --> 01:32.040
so that we're all on the same page. Now with that,

01:32.130 --> 01:33.350
let's jump right into it,

01:33.450 --> 01:38.770
let's create a new angular project and let's start building our course project with it.
