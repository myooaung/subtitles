00:02.580 --> 00:09.390
So with the Angular material module added, let's now move towards the posts module and we don't have that

00:09.390 --> 00:12.970
module yet but now I will create it. In the posts folder,

00:13.020 --> 00:19.410
I will add the posts.module.ts file because here, I want to group all the things required

00:19.410 --> 00:21.040
by my posts.

00:21.180 --> 00:29.840
Therefore I will export a class here which is PostsModule which we also decorate with ngModule,

00:30.090 --> 00:31.020
like this.

00:32.520 --> 00:39.810
Now here I want to declare all the components used in the post related world or feature.

00:40.110 --> 00:45.720
So if we have a look at the app module, that would be the post list component and the post create component.

00:45.870 --> 00:48.500
So let's cut them both from here

00:48.990 --> 00:56.040
and let's now also take their imports, post list component and post create component and let's cut these

00:56.080 --> 01:01.860
two and let's go to the post module and important there,

01:01.880 --> 01:05.980
we need to adjust the paths though, we already are in the posts folder,

01:06.080 --> 01:08.840
so this first part can be deleted.

01:10.280 --> 01:17.570
Now here we add declarations again and we declare the post create component and the post list component.

01:18.570 --> 01:21.240
This adds them to this module,

01:21.350 --> 01:28.860
the question is how do we now connect this module, which explains to Angular which components it comprises,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.190
how do we connect this to the app module? First of all, let's have a look if there is something else we

01:34.190 --> 01:36.340
can remove from the app module

01:36.680 --> 01:43.290
and yes there is, for example the reactive forms module, we really only use that in the post module.

01:43.340 --> 01:48.740
So let's get rid of it here and now let's go to the post module again, add it here,

01:48.740 --> 01:57.050
so let's add our imports array and add the reactive forms module here, make sure to also add the import

01:57.050 --> 01:58.990
from @angular/forms.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.520
And now let's go back to app module,

02:01.550 --> 02:09.380
remove that reactive forms module import here and now let's do that connection by simply importing our

02:09.380 --> 02:13.640
posts module into the app module.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.270
So here, I can add posts module,

02:16.310 --> 02:18.730
make sure to add that import path.

02:19.280 --> 02:24.630
If you now save this and go back to your app, you will actually see an error

02:24.680 --> 02:32.960
though. The reason for that is that our Angular material module is now not exposed to the posts module

02:33.050 --> 02:33.970
which makes sense,

02:33.980 --> 02:41.600
I explained that every module would just keep its context, it would not export its things into other

02:41.690 --> 02:48.500
modules. So the app module where we import our Angular material module doesn't pass that onto the post

02:48.500 --> 02:49.790
module.

02:49.790 --> 02:56.780
Now of course, we still want to use our Angular material related things in the post module and that's

02:56.780 --> 02:57.770
no problem,

02:57.770 --> 03:03.980
we can actually import the Angular material module here too. So the Angular material module now simply

03:03.980 --> 03:05.760
acts as a shared module,

03:05.850 --> 03:12.620
so make sure to add to import and add it here in the imports array and then if you go back, you'll still see an

03:12.620 --> 03:13.400
error.

03:13.610 --> 03:18.040
If we go up, we see that ngIf is also unknown.

03:18.050 --> 03:23.790
The reason for that is that this is actually a default Angular feature but not enabled by default. In

03:23.880 --> 03:29.420
the app module, it is enabled by the browser module which also adds some bootstrapping,

03:29.450 --> 03:36.440
so app startup related things. In the post module, the app has been started but we still add another module,

03:36.590 --> 03:42.220
let's add it at the very top, the common module which is imported from @angular/common.

03:42.350 --> 03:48.590
This adds common functionalities like ngIf and with that, if we save that and we go back, we still get

03:48.590 --> 03:49.530
an error.

03:49.550 --> 03:55.670
Now it's the problem that we can't read router link and the reason for that really just is that we're

03:55.670 --> 04:02.240
now using router features, like router link as it says, which are enabled here because the router

04:02.240 --> 04:07.200
module here is also just exported into the app module

04:07.370 --> 04:15.110
and as mentioned before, things are not shared. So we want to unlock this in the post module and

04:15.110 --> 04:26.380
for that, we could of course add the router module here. Add it like this, save this and we go back and have

04:26.380 --> 04:28.590
a working application again.

04:28.600 --> 04:38.800
Now if I login like this, I can edit this, go to this page and it works as before.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.850
I'm not authorized to do that though, that's interesting and that is just a bug I'll have to tackle, so

04:44.850 --> 04:46.910
let's memorize this.

04:46.920 --> 04:52.920
The important thing is that the addition of router module does now unlock router link again and therefore,

04:53.070 --> 04:55.560
our component is working correctly again

04:55.590 --> 04:57.390
or this part of our app is working

04:57.390 --> 05:03.740
correctly again I should say. So now we also outsourced the posts related things into their own module.

05:03.750 --> 05:08.760
Now let's move on to the auth related module

05:08.760 --> 05:11.200
but before that, let's quickly fix that error

05:11.220 --> 05:11.790
we saw.
