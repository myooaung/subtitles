00:02.310 --> 00:07.220
So let's edit this error dialog we were seeing. Now we had a couple of problems,

00:07.350 --> 00:13.440
the styling and the fact that we didn't see the message. Now the message can't be seen because of the way

00:13.440 --> 00:15.140
this component is created,

00:15.270 --> 00:17.470
we can't set up properties here like this,

00:17.550 --> 00:20.590
we can still pass data into that component though.

00:20.970 --> 00:28.460
I want to display a message but we can pass in data with a different or in a different way. In the error

00:28.500 --> 00:31.180
interceptor where I'm opening the dialog,

00:31.410 --> 00:36.560
we can pass in data by adding a second argument to the open method

00:36.810 --> 00:39.800
and there, we can set a data property.

00:39.810 --> 00:44.370
This allows us to pass in an object which represents the data we want to work in

00:44.520 --> 00:47.390
in this error component.

00:47.400 --> 00:52.920
Now I only want to get one piece of information in there, the message and the message is something I

00:52.920 --> 00:55.630
need to derive in this error interceptor.

00:55.680 --> 01:02.490
I will check if my error, if there the error object which is the response body, if it has a message

01:02.560 --> 01:04.840
property.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.550
If it does, then I want to use that

01:07.680 --> 01:09.900
otherwise I will use a dummy message.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.970
So I will create a new variable,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.620
let errorMessage and set the default to an unknown error occurred.

01:22.820 --> 01:26.130
Now I will override this default if we get a real message,

01:26.240 --> 01:32.810
so then it will take error.error.message.

01:32.860 --> 01:39.220
Now in either way, I got an error message variable which holds a string and I can pass this as data to

01:39.220 --> 01:41.150
my error component.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.200
Now to retrieve that data

01:43.210 --> 01:49.960
there, we have to go to the error component and inject something into it, something which we'll also be provided

01:49.960 --> 01:51.830
by @angular/material.

01:51.970 --> 02:01.690
We pass in that data by using a special decorator, the @inject decorator, not injectable but inject which

02:01.690 --> 02:03.780
you import from @angular/core

02:04.240 --> 02:10.780
and this allows you to then specify a special token and that will just be important for the dependency

02:10.780 --> 02:14.370
injection system Angular uses to identify

02:14.460 --> 02:21.670
this data you're passing around, this special way of injecting is required due to the special way

02:21.670 --> 02:29.170
this error component is getting created with. The token I want to use is the mat-dialog-data token and

02:29.170 --> 02:36.850
you import that from @angular/material, that is the identifier used internally. This will hold data and

02:36.850 --> 02:43.330
I will use that shortcut to store it in a public property of that class which is of type any or we

02:43.330 --> 02:48.620
actually know that it's of type object which holds a message which is a string.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.890
So this is now a field which is available in the error component

02:53.020 --> 02:59.620
and we can output it here therefore, we can output data message in our component template.

02:59.620 --> 03:06.490
If we now save that and we try signing up with a taken e-mail address again, we get an unknown error because

03:06.490 --> 03:10.290
remember for this error, we get no better error message.

03:10.330 --> 03:17.050
Now the styling looks awful but thankfully, the @angular/material dialog gives us some classes that help us

03:17.050 --> 03:17.600
here.

03:18.480 --> 03:25.800
We can add the mat-dialog-title, directive not class, directive to the h1 tag and to the paragraph,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.390
we can add mat-dialog-content.

03:28.610 --> 03:34.980
These selectors added to these elements will lead to a much nicer look as you can tell,

03:34.980 --> 03:36.650
this looks much better already.

03:36.720 --> 03:43.140
Now the paragraph still looks wrong though because mat-dialog-content is incorrectly added to the

03:43.140 --> 03:43.830
paragraph,

03:43.860 --> 03:48.880
it should be added to a wrapping div and you can find these things in the official docs

03:48.990 --> 03:51.570
in case you're wondering where I got this from.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.720
So now with that added, we'll get a little bit of a nicer styling,

03:54.720 --> 03:57.540
the paragraph would still have a different font though

03:57.780 --> 04:05.480
and to change this, we can simply add a class provided by the @angular/material package, a class named

04:05.940 --> 04:14.990
mat-body1. By adding this class here, if we now try this again and use a taken e-mail address,

04:15.020 --> 04:17.630
now we get a nicer font there too.

04:17.690 --> 04:26.220
Now it might be nice to also have some buttons there and we can simply add a normal button by adding

04:26.220 --> 04:32.490
another div which should have the mat-dialog actions selector to position them correctly just as the

04:32.490 --> 04:35.120
content is positioned correctly with that

04:35.250 --> 04:40.710
and here we can add a normal button with the mat-button selector, you already know from the other

04:40.710 --> 04:43.760
parts of this app and there we can simply add an

04:43.780 --> 04:48.800
OK button for example. We can add another special directive to that,

04:48.810 --> 04:54.780
the mat-dialog-close one and this will ensure that this button automatically closes the dialog

04:54.790 --> 04:55.950
if we click it.

04:55.950 --> 05:04.040
So now if I try this one last time here, we get this button and if I click somewhere else, it closes it,

05:04.080 --> 05:05.910
this was not what I wanted to show,

05:05.910 --> 05:09.170
if I now click on OK, we also close the button.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.110
So this is now working

05:11.110 --> 05:12.960
and now we have a nicer dialog,

05:12.960 --> 05:15.530
we get a default message which we display.

05:15.810 --> 05:22.980
Obviously it would also be nice to use or see this error handler in action for other errors where we have

05:22.980 --> 05:24.020
a better message.
