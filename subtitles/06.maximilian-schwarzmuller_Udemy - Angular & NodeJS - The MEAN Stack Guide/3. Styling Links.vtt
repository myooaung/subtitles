00:02.470 --> 00:04.470
We added basic routing but well

00:04.570 --> 00:08.990
as I said, we can probably improve the visuals up here.

00:09.190 --> 00:11.670
So let's work on the styling of our links

00:11.830 --> 00:17.790
and for that I'll add a new file to my header component, the header.component.css

00:17.800 --> 00:18.560
file,

00:18.850 --> 00:24.860
I will now go to my typescript definition of the header component and connect it to that css file

00:24.860 --> 00:28.830
with the styles url, with the style urls property here.

00:28.870 --> 00:34.570
This takes an array where you could add multiple style files but I of course only want to point to that

00:34.570 --> 00:40.300
single header.component.css file we just created and now in there, we can style our

00:40.600 --> 00:43.860
anchor tags for this component here.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.860
So let's style the anchor tags,

00:47.020 --> 00:50.310
let's say we want to have no text decoration,

00:50.560 --> 00:55.980
maybe the color should be white and this looks already much better.

00:55.980 --> 00:58.700
Now of course that bullet point should go away,

00:58.890 --> 01:05.130
so I know that for this component, my unordered list should have a list style of none and I also want

01:05.130 --> 01:08.700
to set the padding to 0 and the margin to 0 here.

01:09.590 --> 01:10.960
If we now go back,

01:11.010 --> 01:17.470
this looks better but now messages and new posts directly sit on, well next to each other and it would be

01:17.480 --> 01:24.430
nice to have some spacing in there and have the new post option on the right because later we will also

01:24.430 --> 01:32.440
add options to or an option to go to the sign up area for example and we can easily add such a thing

01:32.890 --> 01:41.350
by adding one extra element here in our toolbar, another span which we don't give any content but

01:41.350 --> 01:44.770
a class which could be spacer,

01:44.800 --> 01:45.980
the name is up to you

01:46.270 --> 01:53.470
but now we can take that class and style that here in our header.css file and the style you should

01:53.470 --> 02:00.790
assign here is flex 11 auto because the toolbar uses flex box by default and this will actually make

02:00.790 --> 02:06.700
sure that the spacer element takes all the available remaining space between the other elements you got

02:06.700 --> 02:12.730
up there and it therefore pushes new post to the right and my messages to the left and now this looks

02:12.730 --> 02:19.750
much better. Now it would also be nice to have some styling on that last button when we hover over it

02:19.780 --> 02:27.160
or when we, well actually are on that links page and we can achieve this by not using a normal anchor

02:27.160 --> 02:32.610
tag like this but also adding the mat button directive to this.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.630
Now this is a material button, if

02:34.680 --> 02:37.530
we go back, you now see it looks a bit different and

02:37.540 --> 02:41.280
now we got a nice hover effect out of the box which is pretty neat,

02:41.330 --> 02:46.580
it's also a bit smaller than my messages which is also great because this is our brand here on the left,

02:46.630 --> 02:48.110
this isn't.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.940
So now it would just be nice to keep some, well highlighted style,

02:52.990 --> 02:58.030
maybe change the color of it when we are on that create page

02:58.240 --> 03:04.360
and to add this feature, we can go back and use another feature of the angular router, we can add the

03:04.360 --> 03:12.250
router link active direct directive here which will actually assign a new css class to that link whenever

03:12.250 --> 03:13.600
it detects that the route

03:13.630 --> 03:17.710
this link leads to is the currently active route. And now

03:17.860 --> 03:22.870
another cool thing is that angular material actually has a couple of helper

03:22.890 --> 03:26.570
css classes you can use, like mat accent.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.800
This will apply the accent color to the underlying element.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.250
So now with that, you see it's highlighted like this

03:34.270 --> 03:39.170
if we are on the page but if we are not, well then it's not highlighted like this.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.620
So this is a nice effect

03:40.620 --> 03:45.670
for now, we might revisit this later but for now we got this working, we can switch between the pages

03:45.730 --> 03:48.750
and we have a visual feedback about which page we're on.

03:48.880 --> 03:55.120
Let's now focus on this create page again and let's make sure that we cannot just create new posts with

03:55.120 --> 03:57.700
it but also edit existing posts.
