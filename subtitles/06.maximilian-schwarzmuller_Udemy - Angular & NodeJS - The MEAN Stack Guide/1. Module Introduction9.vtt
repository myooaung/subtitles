00:02.170 --> 00:05.030
We are nearing the end of this course,

00:05.140 --> 00:10.090
our app is taking shape but there is one thing we're not doing that much right now,

00:10.090 --> 00:11.680
handling errors.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.550
Now we're actually not doing it at all you could say but we should definitely do that.

00:16.600 --> 00:22.830
Our app doesn't always behave the way we want it to or even if it does, the user doesn't,

00:22.870 --> 00:30.520
so we want to have something in place which displays some kind of error message, hopefully helpful to

00:30.520 --> 00:32.540
the user whenever something goes wrong

00:32.740 --> 00:36.430
and there are of course all kinds of errors that can happen.

00:36.430 --> 00:40.690
Maybe the user just enters an invalid e-mail password combination,

00:40.780 --> 00:42.720
well that's definitely not the end of the world,

00:42.730 --> 00:45.380
we don't want to break our application because of that.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.330
Maybe the user did do something funky and try to delete that post when he wasn't allowed to.

00:51.550 --> 00:58.030
Well even then it's probably nice to show an error message, even though that probably is a case where

00:58.030 --> 01:03.430
we don't need to provide the best user experience because the user was doing something fishy but still,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.360
let's handle errors and let me show you how you could implement such error handling mechanism in your

01:10.360 --> 01:11.820
Angular MEAN stack app.
