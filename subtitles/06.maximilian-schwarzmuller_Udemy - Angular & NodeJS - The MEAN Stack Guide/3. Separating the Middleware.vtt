00:02.360 --> 00:08.990
So we're now using controllers and this already makes our routes files much easier to read.

00:08.990 --> 00:14.670
Now one other thing I want to do is I want to outsource that multer logic into its own file.

00:14.690 --> 00:15.920
We don't have to do that

00:16.070 --> 00:17.600
but technically, it's a middleware

00:17.870 --> 00:23.300
and even though we only used the middleware in the posts.js file here and therefore adding it

00:23.300 --> 00:25.550
there is absolutely fine,

00:25.550 --> 00:27.660
we could be using it in other files too

00:27.740 --> 00:34.460
and I really just want to have my routes in here. So I will grab all that multer related code, including

00:34.460 --> 00:40.790
that mime type constant and cut it and create a new middleware in the middleware folder and I will

00:40.790 --> 00:46.280
name it file.js, you can name the file whatever you want.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.660
I will drop in the code

00:47.670 --> 00:50.380
I just cut, go back to my posts.js

00:50.390 --> 00:56.530
routes file and grab that multer import which I now don't need in that file anymore.

00:56.850 --> 01:02.700
Go back to file.js again and add the import here because here, we do need it. Now

01:02.760 --> 01:07.040
this current setup doesn't create the middleware, it just creates the config for it,

01:07.040 --> 01:08.580
so I will go back to posts.js

01:08.650 --> 01:14.340
and we always use multer like this. So I will actually grab that code,

01:14.340 --> 01:23.250
go back to the file.js file and export this at the bottom, with module exports equal to this line of

01:23.250 --> 01:27.820
code where I initialize multer with our storage config here.

01:27.840 --> 01:35.100
This is what I export in my file.js file and therefore, I can go back to posts.js and import this.

01:35.270 --> 01:42.360
I'll duplicate the CheckAuth middleware import and in this extract file because that seems like a

01:42.360 --> 01:51.380
reasonable name and I will import that from the file.js file and now would just add extract file, like

01:51.380 --> 01:51.970
this.

01:52.840 --> 02:00.790
And with that added, we can of course and we have to do the same for the put route, extract file. And now

02:00.820 --> 02:06.060
all routes are really condensed and we really just have the route setup in that posts.js

02:06.080 --> 02:07.570
file now.

02:07.630 --> 02:08.810
Now with all these changes,

02:08.860 --> 02:10.420
let's see if that still works

02:10.510 --> 02:15.770
and for that, I will first of all delete all the uploaded images because we don't need them anymore

02:16.520 --> 02:20.770
and now we'll go back to my app and there of course, the images will be missing now

02:22.130 --> 02:29.150
and I will simply delete all posts, so that we start from scratch and can't delete that last post because

02:29.150 --> 02:30.920
we didn't create it as it seems.

02:31.220 --> 02:33.890
Let's quickly login as the different user who did this

02:37.820 --> 02:41.220
and now everything is cleared and we saw that deleting worked,

02:41.240 --> 02:43.210
let's now create a new post,

02:43.220 --> 02:44.710
spring is here.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.350
Let's pick our spring

02:47.370 --> 02:50.690
image and add some content.

02:51.580 --> 02:55.300
Saving works and I can see the image here, so this is looking good.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.110
Let's edit this,

02:57.160 --> 03:02.810
let's pick a different image like tools and save that post

03:02.950 --> 03:05.090
and now here, this also works.

03:05.110 --> 03:08.140
So we still seem to have working routes,

03:08.140 --> 03:12.120
for completeness sake, let's also try creating a new user,

03:15.380 --> 03:16.310
works too.

03:16.500 --> 03:23.820
So now we got working routes and with that, we got a cleaner set up on the back-end and we're now prepared

03:24.240 --> 03:26.590
to turn our heads towards the front-end.

03:26.650 --> 03:28.140
What can we optimize there?
