So let's connect that logout button we have in that header component. For that,

00:07.130 --> 00:12.000
I'll add a click listener to that button and execute onLogout.

00:12.210 --> 00:12.960
That onLogout

00:12.960 --> 00:16.790
method of course needs to be added to the header component,

00:16.950 --> 00:25.350
so here I have onLogout. Now onLogout should clear the token and inform all interested parts on

00:25.350 --> 00:30.280
the page about the changed authentication status and for that,

00:30.290 --> 00:32.670
we need to edit the auth service again.

00:32.670 --> 00:34.710
Here we need a new method,

00:35.860 --> 00:41.480
logout or any name you like. In this method I want to do two main things,

00:41.710 --> 00:46.100
I will set this token equal to false or to null to be precise

00:46.100 --> 00:48.420
to clear it and I will set

00:48.440 --> 00:55.920
this isAuthenticated equal to false and then of course, I need to pass that information to anyone who

00:55.950 --> 01:03.830
is interested. So I will use my AuthStatusListener subject and push a new value which of course is false

01:03.860 --> 01:06.850
because the user is now not authenticated anymore,

01:07.310 --> 01:14.380
that is what I want to execute when we call logout. That logout method should be called from within

01:14.410 --> 01:17.610
that onLogout method in the header component.

01:17.990 --> 01:24.080
So there I will reach out to my auth service and then call logout like this.

01:24.840 --> 01:31.550
Now we should be able to save everything and in the restarted app,

01:31.710 --> 01:33.380
if I now do login

01:36.340 --> 01:41.070
and change the page and click logout, we are logged out again

01:41.110 --> 01:46.750
and you see the header updated and we also don't see the buttons. And you can even see that a bit better

01:46.750 --> 01:48.270
if you do login again

01:49.480 --> 01:53.450
and you then expand such a message, so that you can see the buttons and

01:53.480 --> 01:55.790
if I now click logout, they're gone.

01:56.090 --> 01:58.040
So this is now working correctly,

01:58.040 --> 02:00.020
that was relatively easy I guess.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.870
Now we still got a couple of flaws, 

02:02.000 --> 02:08.180
one of them for example is that after logging in, we're not redirected and the same for logging out

02:08.180 --> 02:14.600
by the way. If I'm on a new post page and I click logout, I should be navigated away and I actually

02:14.600 --> 02:16.790
also want to guard this page,

02:16.910 --> 02:21.280
so I want to make sure we can't reach it by directly entering the URL

02:21.350 --> 02:22.810
if we're not authenticated.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.990
So adding this guards and adding redirection,

02:26.990 --> 02:30.820
these are the next things I want to implement in this application.
