With that bug fixed in the last lecture, let's go back to the thing we were working on, modules.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.210
We created the post module already,

00:10.210 --> 00:14.060
now there's one other section we have and that's our auth section,

00:14.230 --> 00:17.360
let's create an auth module too.

00:17.820 --> 00:23.530
Now in that auth module, I'll put my auth related components. By the way, if you're wondering why I don't

00:23.530 --> 00:28.690
put my services in there, it is recommended to inject services on the root level,

00:28.810 --> 00:35.950
thanks to this @injectable provided in root thing, Angular will automatically load this in a very

00:35.950 --> 00:41.770
efficient way and you can get unwanted side effects like different service instances

00:41.770 --> 00:44.710
if you do provide them on a module level.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.830
So really, you shouldn't do that,

00:46.840 --> 00:51.190
let's instead provide or declare our components there.

00:51.190 --> 01:01.180
So in the auth module, I'll export a class, AuthModule and I will add my @ngModule decorator. This decorator

01:01.180 --> 01:03.160
of course needs to be imported,

01:03.220 --> 01:08.980
so let's import ngModule from @angular/core

01:09.010 --> 01:13.800
and with that, let's configure that decorator. Let's add declarations here

01:14.050 --> 01:16.690
and which components do I want to declare here?

01:16.930 --> 01:25.450
Well I want to declare my login and sign-up component, so I will cut it from the app module and move it

01:25.630 --> 01:27.510
to my auth module here

01:28.550 --> 01:32.230
and of course, I will also need to bring the imports then.

01:32.240 --> 01:38.240
So let's go to the top of the that file and use the login and sign-up component import, cut it from the

01:38.480 --> 01:42.980
app module and move them to the auth module.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.350
Here at the top, the paths need to be adjusted again

01:46.370 --> 01:49.250
because we already are in the auth folder,

01:49.250 --> 01:51.900
so now this is looking good.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.000
The red squiggly lines here by the way can be ignored,

01:55.070 --> 01:58.370
this is just an IDE display bug right now,

01:58.400 --> 02:00.770
this file is actually all right.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.090
So now we are declaring these components.

02:03.200 --> 02:11.160
Now they will require some other modules to work correctly, like the Angular material module which we

02:11.160 --> 02:12.690
also should import,

02:12.690 --> 02:14.310
so let's add an import here

02:14.410 --> 02:17.490
import Angular material module from

02:17.700 --> 02:23.490
and now let's go up a level and import the Angular material module from there.

02:23.640 --> 02:30.520
We will also need that common module which I also use before which is imported from @angular/common

02:30.520 --> 02:32.830
to unlock ngIf and so on

02:33.270 --> 02:35.140
and in this module here,

02:35.220 --> 02:42.540
we also use the template driven forms approach. So we can actually remove the forms module from the app

02:42.540 --> 02:49.920
module and remove the import therefore entirely and instead add it to the auth module because this is

02:49.920 --> 02:50.900
where we use it.

02:50.910 --> 02:57.930
So here, I will add my forms module and also the import from @angular/forms.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.550
So now with that, let's give it a try,

03:00.570 --> 03:05.610
let's go back to the app and reload it and we get an error, that the logging component is not part of

03:05.610 --> 03:06.380
ngModule.

03:06.390 --> 03:07.680
Well that makes sense,

03:07.680 --> 03:11.510
we need to add auth module to our app module of course.

03:11.730 --> 03:19.620
So here, let's import auth module and we need to add that import path,

03:19.680 --> 03:27.840
so let's import auth module from ./auth and there, the auth.module

03:28.230 --> 03:29.220
without .ts,

03:29.280 --> 03:35.550
just auth.module with the dot in between, like this.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.920
So now we're importing this and this is looking good.

03:38.920 --> 03:44.880
Now let's try logging in and see if that works or if we got any issues here.

03:45.130 --> 03:46.000
It's looking good,

03:46.180 --> 03:49.150
logging out, signing up, we can navigate to that page.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.530
So our application is now working again

03:51.580 --> 03:54.940
and now we also got that auth module set up.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.090
Now we're not done yet though,

03:57.100 --> 04:02.980
we can use these modules for something cool which will not only affect our code as it is currently doing

04:02.980 --> 04:06.460
it but which will also affect our runtime performance.
