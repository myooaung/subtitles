00:02.100 --> 00:08.330
So before we come to fetching the user input, let's output a post, let's output some dummy content.

00:08.370 --> 00:15.060
Let's say we have a paragraph there, load a button and here we want to output the content the user entered.

00:15.070 --> 00:17.010
Now for now, the user didn't enter anything,

00:17.040 --> 00:20.130
so let's set some dummy content. For this

00:20.130 --> 00:26.160
we need two things, we need to set some content in on add post and we need a place to store that content

00:26.160 --> 00:33.900
in which we then can also refer to from the template. That stored the content in thing is a property,

00:34.080 --> 00:36.560
basically a variable in a class,

00:36.810 --> 00:44.880
you define it without the var, const or let keyword, you just add the name in the class here and the name

00:44.880 --> 00:45.970
can be anything you like,

00:46.020 --> 00:49.320
like for example new post.

00:49.590 --> 00:55.180
Now I'll set this to an empty string by default and in on add post, I will override it,

00:55.380 --> 00:57.530
we referred to it with the this keyword,

00:57.570 --> 01:00.810
this new post and we set this equal to any content you like,

01:00.940 --> 01:08.620
like the users, whoops, escape that, the post like that,

01:08.620 --> 01:13.210
notice that I escaped that in-between single quotation mark with a backslash.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.680
So now we're setting the new post value to this value whenever we click the button.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.910
Now to output the new post, we need to go back to the html file and just as we added the listener directly

01:24.910 --> 01:32.700
in here, we also add output or output hooks directly in the template.

01:32.770 --> 01:40.330
We do that with a feature called string interpolation and you add or use that feature with double curly

01:40.330 --> 01:43.750
braces, opening and closing and in between,

01:43.750 --> 01:51.400
you refer to something which is stored inside your post create component or your component belonging

01:51.400 --> 01:52.050
to the template

01:52.060 --> 01:58.990
in general, that something could be a method and then you would output whatever this method returns or

01:59.050 --> 02:02.250
it can be a property name, like new post,

02:02.290 --> 02:06.190
so here I can just say new posts and refer to that property.

02:06.610 --> 02:11.920
And now what you can see is that when I save this, you don't see anything because we start with an empty

02:11.920 --> 02:13.160
string, a new post

02:13.270 --> 02:19.120
but if I clicks save post, you see the users post here because we change that text and due to

02:19.120 --> 02:20.360
string interpolation,

02:20.440 --> 02:25.870
we told angular hey please output the current value of the text and also when it changes, please

02:26.050 --> 02:31.150
output the new value in this place here in our html code.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.700
So that is string interpretation in place and that is one important building block when it comes to

02:36.790 --> 02:38.230
outputting content,

02:38.230 --> 02:43.570
now let's also dive into one other way of outputting content on the screen.

02:43.930 --> 02:48.580
Let's say we want to pre-populate the text area with some dummy starting text,

02:48.820 --> 02:51.890
let's say we don't start with an empty string here

02:52.090 --> 02:54.850
but with no content.

02:54.850 --> 03:00.090
Now of course if I save this, it reloads and we have no content here until we click the button and let's

03:00.100 --> 03:07.540
say we want to output no content in the text area too. Now in the text area, we can use string interpolation

03:07.750 --> 03:09.930
like this, new post

03:10.120 --> 03:14.570
and if we save that, we get no content in there too.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.910
We could also do something different,

03:17.070 --> 03:23.980
the text area is an input element in html and as such it has a special property we can bind to, not an

03:23.980 --> 03:31.000
attribute, a property, html elements in the dom and in javascript are just javascript objects with

03:31.000 --> 03:32.170
a couple of properties,

03:32.200 --> 03:40.160
so variables belonging to that object which can read and write and one property is the value property.

03:40.180 --> 03:43.990
Now the value property actually can't be set like this,

03:43.990 --> 03:51.660
so if we set this to test here, you see it's empty but we have another feature in angular which allows us

03:51.660 --> 03:58.820
to directly target properties of the underlying objects of the html elements.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.570
We can add the property name and you of course have to know that this element has a value property

04:04.620 --> 04:10.290
but now you do know, you can use resources like the MDN, the mozilla developer network to get complete

04:10.290 --> 04:14.990
references of all available properties, of all available elements

04:15.090 --> 04:22.320
but if you know that name, you can wrap it in square brackets like this and this will now directly target

04:22.620 --> 04:28.270
the value property of the underlying object and bind the value between quotation marks to it.

04:28.340 --> 04:32.230
Now important just as for the click listener or for string interpolation,

04:32.280 --> 04:36.810
this value is now not normal text but actually typescript code,

04:37.050 --> 04:43.620
so if you enter tests here, it would look for a property named test in your component. If you want to output test

04:43.650 --> 04:44.390
as a string,

04:44.430 --> 04:47.060
you need to wrap this in single quotation marks

04:47.160 --> 04:53.630
and now if you save this, you see test as a starting value because we're binding to the underlying value

04:53.640 --> 04:54.770
property

04:54.960 --> 04:59.980
and of course you can also bind this, not to a string but to new post,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.980
now without the single quotation marks because now we want to refer to that property in our component

05:05.010 --> 05:09.380
class and now we see no content there too. This is important to

05:09.390 --> 05:14.050
know, we will use a combination of string interpolation for a simple text

05:14.070 --> 05:19.980
most of the time if we want to output it between opening and closing tags and property binding always

05:19.980 --> 05:24.900
used directly on the elements for outputting data in our template.

05:24.900 --> 05:30.500
Now we can output data, that's all cool but how can we now finally get that user input.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.330
We'll do this in the next lecture.
