00:02.220 --> 00:08.650
Now that we added a basic angular frontend and had a brief refresher on angular,

00:08.820 --> 00:15.870
it's time to really make this a mean course and dive into at least the E and the N of mean

00:16.000 --> 00:21.390
so that covered A, E and N thus far I guess, mongodb will also be added soon.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.460
So the E and the N part,

00:23.520 --> 00:30.060
that's express and node. Node as you probably know and as I mentioned in the first course module is a

00:30.060 --> 00:33.400
javascript runtime that runs on the server,

00:33.480 --> 00:40.620
so that means you can execute javascript code with some extra features and some missing features compared

00:40.620 --> 00:47.330
to the browser javascript version but in general still javascript, you can execute that on the server.

00:47.460 --> 00:53.150
You can create the server that listens to requests and sends back responses with it

00:53.400 --> 00:59.340
and you can handle your server side logic with it and express as I also mentioned in the first course

00:59.340 --> 01:02.970
module simply is a framework building up on node,

01:03.150 --> 01:09.360
so you use it to make node development easier, to get a couple of tools out of the box and you don't

01:09.360 --> 01:15.810
have to reinvent the wheel for everything you want to add to your backend. In the big picture of our

01:15.810 --> 01:21.580
mean stack, the server side is on the right here on the slide, you see node and express are on the server

01:21.580 --> 01:22.230
side,

01:22.230 --> 01:28.770
we use the server for our core business logic especially the parts that are too performance intensive

01:28.830 --> 01:32.480
or security relevant and therefore shouldn't be run on the client,

01:32.490 --> 01:39.870
so in the browser and node express is the important backend for our client side, the angular app is

01:39.870 --> 01:41.940
about the user interface.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.890
Now in order to do anything with the data the user enters and to persist it for example or do any transformations,

01:49.890 --> 01:56.270
calculations, to add user authentication, for all this fun stuff, we need a server.

01:56.400 --> 02:01.020
So let's dive into creating our own server with nodejs.
