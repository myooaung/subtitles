00:02.310 --> 00:04.540
So now that's it for this module,

00:04.620 --> 00:05.850
we achieved a lot.

00:05.850 --> 00:08.170
We added file upload,

00:08.340 --> 00:12.870
I showed you how you could implement a file picker that looks good,

00:13.140 --> 00:19.800
how you can then use it and validate the input, the file which was chosen with your own mime type validator,

00:20.460 --> 00:24.830
how you then also can upload that file and handle it on the server

00:25.110 --> 00:31.020
and of course how you then also can update it by being flexible regarding whether you're getting the

00:31.080 --> 00:36.030
old path which is a string or a new file which should be re-uploaded.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.650
We implemented all of that in this module,

00:38.700 --> 00:40.490
we're still not done with the overall app,

00:40.500 --> 00:45.520
there are more cool features to be added but this was a huge step forward

00:45.750 --> 00:51.880
and in my opinion, it made sure that our application looks and feels quite a lot nicer.
