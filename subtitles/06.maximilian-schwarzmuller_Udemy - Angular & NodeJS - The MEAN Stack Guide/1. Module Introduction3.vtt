00:02.200 --> 00:03.750
Welcome to this module,

00:03.800 --> 00:09.890
thus far we had a closer look at angular and node and we have a first basic connection between these

00:09.890 --> 00:10.720
two ends

00:10.880 --> 00:14.060
but of course one important thing is missing,

00:14.060 --> 00:17.650
we're not storing any data on our server.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.890
We're handling data in our angular application

00:21.290 --> 00:27.860
but that of course does only get us that far because it's gone whenever we reload our app and

00:27.860 --> 00:35.210
that's not that helpful. We need to persist data on the server instead so that our users can load that

00:35.210 --> 00:40.880
data whenever they come back to our webpage even if they come back to it from different machines,

00:40.880 --> 00:41.900
it's a website in the end,

00:41.910 --> 00:42.510
right.

00:42.800 --> 00:49.670
So on our big picture here, we're now working on that mongodb part on the right here and on that

00:49.670 --> 00:52.110
persistence data storage thing.

00:52.220 --> 00:58.490
This is what we'll dive in in this module, you will learn what mongodb is and how you can conveniently

00:58.490 --> 01:00.640
use it from within a nodejs

01:00.660 --> 01:01.770
backend.
