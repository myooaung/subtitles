Hello, everyone, in this quick bonus video, I want to let you know about a few other courses that

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.460
I've created.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.700
There are two or three courses in particular that I think would pair very nicely with your new WordPress

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.510
skill set.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.520
So the first course is available here on You to Me.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.190
And it's titled Learn JavaScript, Full Stack from Scratch.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.370
So this is a twenty seven hour course devoted to JavaScript and it's broken up into three main chapters

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.090
or chunks.

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.890
So the first part of the course is learning the JavaScript language itself.

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.030
In that chapter.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.880
We're not worried about front end browser based JavaScript, nor are we worried about server side JavaScript.

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.690
We're just learning the syntax, the skeleton of a JavaScript sentence and just getting familiar with

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.830
the language itself.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.150
In the next section, we learn about browser based JavaScript.

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.790
And in the final section of the course, we build a simple social network application.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.510
And in order to do that, we need to learn about server side JavaScript using node J.

17
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.120
Yes.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
I'll be honest, this is the most time I've ever spent on creating a course altogether.

19
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.980
If you add up the planning and researching and filming, this course took the better part of two years

20
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.760
for me to create.

21
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.460
Anyways, if you're interested in JavaScript, I recommend checking it out the next course that I want

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.320
to talk about is my newest course and it's called React for the rest of US.

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.080
I chose this title because there are tons of other react courses that already exist, but I feel like

24
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.730
the instructors make react seem as complicated and complex as possible.

25
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.130
So I take the opposite approach in this course.

26
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.430
I try to boil react down to its simplest core.

27
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.490
The idea is, even if you're not a guru in terms of JavaScript and single page applications, I won't

28
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.250
react to still feel accessible and simple to learn for you in this course.

29
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.620
We begin by answering the question what is reacting?

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.650
What problem does react solve in the first place?

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.910
Why are we using it?

32
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.020
After that, we use react to build the single page application front end for a simple social network

33
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.350
app.

34
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.120
OK.

35
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.340
The third course I want to mention is named Get a Web Developer Job Mastering the Modern Workflow.

36
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.430
So this course is about workflow tools, obviously, and also the get version control system, as the

37
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.420
title would suggest.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.340
But really, a lot of the time spent in this course is learning about CSX.

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.830
So mobile, first responsive CSX, how to keep your code super organized, so on and so forth.

40
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.730
OK.

41
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.790
And finally, the last thing I want to talk about is completely free, and that is my YouTube channel.

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.620
So if you search for LERN Web code on YouTube, you should be able to find me.

43
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.680
I post all sorts of tutorials and guides on here and you can also sometimes find the first chapter of

44
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.050
a U to me course posted here for free.

45
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.720
So I'm just shamelessly promoting myself at this point.

46
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.980
But I do encourage you to go check out the channel and subscribe if you like the content.

47
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.850
And I will let you know that in the coming months I'm going to be releasing a free boot camp on YouTube.

48
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.230
The boot camp is not going to teach any one technology in super detail.

49
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.860
Instead, it's going to show you the big picture of creating a Web app.

50
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.830
So we're going to start from scratch and learn a little bit, just a little bit about each technology

51
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.400
involved.

52
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.520
I'm hoping to launch that sometime in the next couple of months.

53
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.250
So please do subscribe, if that sounds interesting.

54
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.100
And that's all I have for you in this bonus video.

55
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.960
Thank you so much for watching.

56
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.980
And take care.
