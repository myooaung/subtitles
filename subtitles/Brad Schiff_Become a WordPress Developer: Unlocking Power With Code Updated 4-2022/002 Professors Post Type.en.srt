00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,610
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,490
In this lesson, we have two main goals.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,940
Number one, we will create a new post type for professors.

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,860
And number two, we will learn how to associate an image with each professor post.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,240
Without further ado, let's jump right in.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,620
OK, so we want to create a new post type for professors.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,710
So the first step is to jump into your text editor.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,110
And instead of your theme folder, I want you to open up the menu or must use plugins folder.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,440
You'll remember that we created this file named University Post typed up.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,950
So this block of code creates the event post type.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,410
And then down here, this block of code creates the program post type.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,300
So if we want to create a professor post type, we can literally just copy and paste this and use it

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,080
as a template.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,730
So copy from the beginning of this comment down to the ending semicolon.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,380
But you'll notice that I'm still within the function closing curly bracket.

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:08,220
So let's go ahead and copy this and then drop down a few lines and paste it in and then let's just change

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,100
it out to be four professors instead of programs.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,600
So let's update this comment, Professor post type.

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,220
And then anywhere else we see the keyword programmer programs throughout this code.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,710
We also want to update that.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,130
Now, if you're using sublime text or Adam as your text editor, I want to show you a trick.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,240
So notice if I highlight the word program here and then if I press command or if you're on windows,

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,830
you would press control D it will select the next instance of the highlighted letters.

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,660
Now, the cool part is that our cursor is now in both locations.

25
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,350
And even though this word is singular program and this one is plural programs because we've only selected

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:01,410
the base of the word program, I can just simply begin typing Pro Vasseur and it gets updated in both

27
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,310
locations.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,090
Cool.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,350
And then we can also do the same thing down here where the word is capitalized.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,600
So let's select just the base of the word leave off the S and then press command or control D several

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,200
times until all of them are selected and then we can just type in Professor Cool.

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,320
So that little tip can save you quite a bit of time in the long run.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,720
Before we save this, let's be sure to give the professor post type a unique icon.

34
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,580
So let's change this from Dash ACoNs Awards to Dash ACoNs.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,590
Welcome.

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,680
Learn more if you're wondering how I chose this value or if you want to choose a different icon yourself,

37
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,390
remember, you can always just Google for WordPress dash icons.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,790
OK, and then one last detail.

39
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,110
When it comes to the professor post type, we will not need an archive.

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,580
For example, there's not going to be a link up in the header that says professors.

41
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,390
Instead, I want visitors of the website to find professors through the related programs that they teach

42
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,090
or through the campuses that they teach at or through the search functionality that we will set up later

43
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,870
in the course.

44
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,560
So back in our code, since we don't need an archive for the professor post type, we can just delete

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,040
this instead of setting this to false because false is the default, we can get rid of that line.

46
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,780
And if we don't need a professor archive, then we also don't need to customize or rewrite the archive

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,380
URL or slug so we can also delete this line.

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,420
And at this point we can go ahead and save our changes.

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,680
And now if we jump into the admin dashboard, we see this new item in the sidebar named Prof's.

50
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,060
Why don't we go ahead and create a few new professor posts right now?

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,750
So add new let's name the first professor.

52
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:08,040
Dr. Miaows A lot pastern, some dummy content, and let's go ahead and create another professor.

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,210
So add new.

54
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:18,260
And let's name this professor, Dr. Bachs, a lot based in some content.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,750
And then let's use this permalink here to preview a professor post on the front end, but you'll notice

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,680
we see Page not found up in the TAB title bar.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,490
And that's because we just created this brand new post type named Professor that our permalink structure

58
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,630
is not aware of yet.

59
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,020
So you know the drill back in our WordPress admin, lets hover over settings towards the bottom and

60
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,160
click on Permalink.

61
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,560
And all we need to do is click save changes down at the bottom to force WordPress to rebuild its permalink

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,230
structure.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:04,050
And now if I go back to this professor, slash Dr. Bachs a lot, page and refresh, we can see that

64
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,550
we're in business now.

65
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,530
At the moment, this screen is using the single file as its template.

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,490
And we can see that that's designed for blog posts, but maybe not.

67
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,970
Professors write this information that I'm highlighting now.

68
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,730
It doesn't make sense for an individual Prof.

69
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,260
Page, so let's create a new template file just for professors.

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,130
So in our text editor, for now we can forget about this.

71
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,480
You must use plugins folder instead.

72
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,700
Let's switch over to our theme folder and in the theme folder, let's create a brand new file.

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,000
And the name of this file does matter.

74
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,540
We need to name it single dash Professor Dot BHP.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,430
As always, I like to type just a bit of test content just to make sure that's the right template file

76
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,230
so we can see that that is indeed controlling an individual professor screen.

77
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:09,150
So instead of typing out a template from scratch, why don't we use our single dash event file as a

78
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,160
starting place?

79
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:17,070
So I'm going to open up a single event and just copy the entire thing into my clipboard and then back

80
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,710
in single professor, go ahead and paste that in.

81
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,780
Let's scroll up to the top.

82
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:30,410
Now, if I save this, we see Dr. Barks a lot and the content, but we also see this event home, Dr.

83
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,500
Bachs, a lot area.

84
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,430
And I don't think we need this metabolics at all when it comes to a professor profile screen like this.

85
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,160
So back in our code underneath the page banner, did we see a div with a class of container and write

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,240
inside that we see the div with a class of Mbox, so let's go ahead and delete the metabolics div entirely.

87
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,190
OK, and now before we learn how to add a featured image or associated image that represents Dr. Bachs

88
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:09,040
a lot, let's first work on establishing a relationship between a professor post and a program post.

89
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,680
Right.

90
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,940
So, for example, let's say that Dr. Barks a lot, teaches in the biology program.

91
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,320
So if I use this edit Professor Link here up in the top menubar, what I'm saying is that in addition

92
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,680
to the title and the main content field, we would also want a related programs field down here.

93
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,550
Now, you'll remember that we already set up a related programs field that we used on our events post

94
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,030
type.

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,230
So check this out.

96
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,440
If we click on custom fields here down towards the bottom of the sidebar here, we can see that related

97
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,890
program, field group.

98
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,650
Let's go ahead and click on that.

99
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,310
And we do not need to make any changes to the field itself.

100
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,720
Instead, what I want to draw your attention to is this location box.

101
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:03,090
So at the moment it reads show this field group only if the post type is equal to event.

102
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Well, now we want to adjust things so that it also displays if you're editing a professor post now,

103
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,770
instead of clicking the and button to add an additional condition check, that also needs to be true.

104
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:25,520
Instead of that, we can use this or feature so we can say if this is true or add rule or if the post

105
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,200
type is equal to and then change this to professor.

106
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,290
OK, let's go ahead and save that change in the published box update.

107
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,400
And now if I go back into professors and try to edit, the doctor barks a lot post cool.

108
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:50,090
We see related programs and I can just go ahead and say that Dr. Barks a lot, teaches biology and then

109
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:56,300
update the post and then I can use the permalink to preview the front end for Dr. Barks a lot.

110
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,310
Cool.

111
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,030
Here we see related programs, biology.

112
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,100
If you're wondering why this already works, it's because we duplicated the single event template.

113
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,920
So back in our text editor and single professor, if we scroll down a little bit, remember, we wrote

114
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,790
this code when we were working on our single event file.

115
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,170
So first we get the field named related programs and then we loop through it down here.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,060
However, since this is a professor profile page, maybe instead of saying related programs, why don't

117
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:38,780
we change this heading level to element to instead read subjects taught, maybe put the S in parentheses

118
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,210
in case the professor only teaches one subject, let's say subjects talked.

119
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,930
Cool, so that feels a bit more customized for a professor profile, and then if we click on this biology

120
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:01,360
link on this biology program page, we probably want to output any professors that teach biology right

121
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,080
about here.

122
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,620
Right.

123
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,190
We want the relationship between professor and programs to flow both directions.

124
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,220
So if we want to make that edit on this screen, we need to jump into our text editor and open a single

125
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,020
program.

126
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,450
Let's scroll down a bit here.

127
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:26,200
We can see the custom query we wrote that pulls in upcoming related events and really we can just recycle

128
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,970
this code.

129
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,920
So in terms of what I want to copy and paste in order to save a bunch of typing, let's place our cursor

130
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,350
at the beginning of this homepage.

131
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,940
Events, query object.

132
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:44,350
So click here and then I'm going to scroll all the way down past the custom query to the end of this

133
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,190
while loop.

134
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,820
So all the way down here where we have a closing bracket for the while loop and then a closing bracket

135
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,330
for the IF statement, I'm going to hold down the shift key on my keyboard and click right here, and

136
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,150
then I'm going to copy all of that into my clipboard.

137
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,630
And then because I want the related professors to be above the upcoming events, what I'm going to do

138
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,490
is scroll back up to the top.

139
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,350
And just right above this section, maybe out a few lines and then let's just paste in our clipboard.

140
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:26,110
OK, let's scroll back up and let's just start customizing this code, so let's rename the custom query

141
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,610
instead of homepage events.

142
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,570
Let's call it maybe related Prof's.

143
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,950
Let's change posts per page from two to negative one.

144
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,950
So that way we pull in all associated.

145
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,740
Prof's we definitely want to change the post type to professor.

146
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,150
We don't need a custom Medicare to order things by so we can delete that for order by.

147
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,260
Let's order the professors alphabetically by their name.

148
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,950
So let's change this from Meadowvale NUM to simply title.

149
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,850
We can leave orders to ascending and when it comes to the meta query, remember we have two filters

150
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,660
here going on that we used to pull in upcoming events.

151
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,970
So filter one, filter two.

152
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,730
In this case, when it comes to pulling in professors, we do not need this first filter that has to

153
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,660
do with the date being greater than or equal to today.

154
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,410
So let's go ahead and delete this first filter.

155
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,840
So just select from the beginning of the word array all the way to the comma right after it.

156
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:41,130
OK, so at this point, the custom query looks good, but remember, we renamed it to related Prof's,

157
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,760
so let's be sure to reference that query name down here in the code.

158
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:51,660
So within this if statement when we are saying only output this code, if the query is not empty, let's

159
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,610
be sure to update this name to related professors.

160
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:02,520
And then right within our while loop, let's update the query name here as well instead of home page

161
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,420
events related professors.

162
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,900
Woops, and I skipped right over this line within the parentheses of the wire loop.

163
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,510
Let's also update the query name.

164
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,020
They're related professors, OK?

165
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,730
And then when it comes to this wire loop, this controls what gets output, the HTML for each item.

166
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,840
We definitely do not want to output a div with the calendar circle date.

167
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,550
Right.

168
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,340
That makes sense for an event, but not for a professor.

169
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,430
So for the moment, let's go ahead and delete this entire div with a class of events summary.

170
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:46,440
So I'm going to begin here and select all the way down to there and instead let's just output a list

171
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:55,260
item with a link and the text that you click on will simply be the title, write the name of the professor

172
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,750
and then the ref should just be the permalink for a professor.

173
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,610
So the permalink.

174
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,410
OK, let's go ahead and save this and see what it looks like.

175
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:14,400
OK, so first of all, we should change this headline to read biology professors instead of upcoming

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,090
events.

177
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,680
There's Dr. Bachs a lot.

178
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,040
But the other thing we noticed is that the upcoming events just completely disappeared.

179
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,120
So first let's update this title and then I will explain why our events disappeared.

180
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,350
So here's the heading level two that reads upcoming blank events.

181
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,630
Let's remove the word upcoming.

182
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,400
So we have an H2 that will say biology or math or English.

183
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,720
And then instead of events, we'll just say professors.

184
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,910
OK, looks good now let's answer the question, why did our upcoming Buyology events completely disappear?

185
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,820
Well, actually, before we get into the explanation of why it disappeared, let me first show you how

186
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,930
to fix things.

187
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,270
So here's our related Prof's code.

188
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,600
Right?

189
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,140
And then down here, this is the custom query for upcoming events.

190
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,380
So in between those two things, right after our related Prof's code is finished, I want you to call

191
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:19,050
a WordPress function named WP Reset Post Data.

192
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,530
So let's go ahead and give that a save.

193
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,660
Cool.

194
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,650
And now our upcoming events is back in business.

195
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:33,920
So now the real question to keep things educational is what does this WP reset post data function do

196
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
and why does it magically fix things?

197
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,710
Well, it's a bit difficult to explain just with words.

198
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,120
So instead, I want you to follow along with this quick demo or this quick example.

199
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,610
So let's scroll up to the very top of this file and right above this get header line.

200
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,900
I want you to call a function named the IDE.

201
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,030
Right.

202
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,940
This is going to echo out the numerical ID onto the page for us.

203
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,310
So in my case, I see No.

204
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,250
Ninety seven, you'll probably see a different number.

205
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,960
But the point here is that that's the ID number for this program page.

206
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,380
Right.

207
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,750
In my case that's the ID for Buyology.

208
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,980
Next, let's try to show the ID number for this Dr. Bachs.

209
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,620
A lot post so in our code.

210
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,970
Let's scroll down a little bit.

211
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,850
Here's the custom query for Prof's.

212
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,110
Here's the list item where we are outputting the title for the professor.

213
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,370
So right after the title, let's say the IDE.

214
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,680
So we can see that Dr. Bachs, a lot has an idea of 104.

215
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,810
Now, again, your I.D. numbers will be different than mine.

216
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:49,380
But the point here is that once we perform our related professor's query and say the post that's going

217
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,240
to hijack the Global Post object and functions like the title and the permalink and the I.D., remember

218
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,270
when we called this the ID function up at the very top of the page, it returned a value of ninety seven

219
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,860
for the biology post.

220
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,740
But then down here that same exact function now returns a value that's tied to the doctor.

221
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,990
Barks a lot post.

222
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:19,530
Now the reason this broke are upcoming events section is because down here in the custom query for upcoming

223
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:26,040
events, we are relying on a function, get the I.D. and in order for this query to make sense and work

224
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,880
properly, you and I need to be able to depend on this function to return the ID of the actual page

225
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,570
that we're on.

226
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,290
Right.

227
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,740
We are on the biology page, so we want that function to return a value of ninety seven.

228
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,180
However, our while loop for the professors highjacked that get the ID function.

229
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,520
So now it's set to one hundred and four.

230
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,950
Hence why this query was broken.

231
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,860
So long story short, the WP reset post data.

232
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,080
This function resets the Global Post object and all of the data that functions like the title and the

233
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,700
ID return, it resets all of that back to the default U.

234
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,010
RL based query.

235
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,680
So the true long story short is whenever you're going to run multiple custom queries on a single page

236
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:21,030
99 times out of 100, you're going to want to run this reset post data function in between the two queries.

237
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,140
OK, now at this point, let me remove those example ID numbers.

238
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,230
And then also up at the very top, remove this, the EDEK.

239
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,400
OK, and that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

240
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,410
I know we got tied up on a bit of a tangent in terms of dealing with multiple queries and resetting

241
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,330
the post data.

242
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,230
But trust me, in our very next lesson, we're going to learn how to spice this up a bit.

243
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,220
So instead of just boring text with the professor's name, we will pull in a photograph of each professor

244
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,980
and we can display that here.

245
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,990
And then when you click on to the professor detail page, we can also display the photograph here and

246
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,980
we will learn how to manage different image sizes and aspect ratio cropping strategies.

247
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,350
It's going to be a lot of fun.

248
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,890
Let's keep it rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
