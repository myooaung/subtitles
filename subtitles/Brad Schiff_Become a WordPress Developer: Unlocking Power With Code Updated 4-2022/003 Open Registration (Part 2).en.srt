00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,610
In this lesson, we will complete our open registration and also learn how to customize the look and

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,970
feel and branding of the login screen.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,640
Without further ado, let's get started.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,530
All right.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,420
Now, before we learn how to customize the login screen, let's first cover something that we probably

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,630
should have addressed in our previous lesson.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,300
So if you view the website in a new private or incognito window where you are not logged in, you'll

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,040
notice that our login button doesn't do anything.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,960
So for our first task in this lesson, let's go update the address value for the login button.

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,750
So over an hour, text editor, let's jump into header up and down towards the very bottom.

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,990
The first link we see within our else block is the login link.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:05,330
So let's just go ahead and update its atrip value instead of a hash tag, let's say P, and we can just

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,280
echo out the results of a WordPress function named WP.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,930
Log in.

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,180
You are out.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,250
And while we're at it, we can also clean up the Eurail for the sign up link.

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,120
I know we just wrote this in the previous lesson and this will get the job done.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,040
But instead of us manually pointing at a specific location instead within this block, we can just echo

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,250
out a WordPress function named WP Registration.

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,500
You are out in WordPress will take care of pointing towards the precisely correct location.

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,310
All right.

23
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,480
So we just updated the address for sign up and log in.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,850
Let's go ahead and save that.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,510
And now we can actually use this login button.

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,420
Cool.

27
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,480
Now let's change gears and learn how to customize this login screen.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,840
The first thing that almost everyone wants to customize or change is the WordPress logo here.

29
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,110
You probably don't want to advertise for WordPress.

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,220
Instead, you want your company logo or at least text of your company name here.

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,810
Now, in just a few minutes from now, we will indeed learn how to remove this WordPress image.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,920
But first, let's address the link value of this object.

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:31,040
So at the moment, if you hover over it, you can see down in the bottom left corner of my browser that

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,460
it wants to take me to WordPress, dawg.

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,540
So if I click on this logo, it takes us to the official WordPress website.

36
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,380
Now, obviously, that's not what we want.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,840
We want our website to feel unique and one of a kind.

38
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,920
So instead, let's modify things so that if you click on this, it takes you to the homepage of our

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,500
website.

40
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,310
So let me show you how to do that over in our text editor.

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:03,920
Let's jump into functions dot, p, p and just to stay organized, let's scroll down to the very bottom

42
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,960
and add a new comment.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,870
Customize login screen, OK?

44
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,420
And what we want to do is add a filter.

45
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,010
And this is a WordPress function that takes two arguments.

46
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,950
The first argument is the value or object that you want to customize or filter or change in some way.

47
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:34,850
In this case, the name of the WordPress filter hook that we're looking for is login under score header

48
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,840
you RL.

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,250
And then the second argument is just a function that returns whatever you want to use instead so we

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,040
can make up whatever name we want for a function.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:54,080
Let's say our header you URL and then down on a new line, let's create a function with that exact name,

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:03,620
our header, you URL, parentheses, curly brackets and then we simply return and then you could manually

53
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,580
type out a U.

54
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,560
RL that you want to link to.

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,580
But instead, why don't we just return the results of a WordPress function named site.

56
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,930
You are URL and just point towards the home page or slash and just to keep things extra secure.

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,460
Why don't we escape this?

58
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,090
You are so rapid in escape.

59
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,080
You add the matching closing parentheses here.

60
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:37,190
OK, now if we save that now if I try to click on this header or logo here, cool.

61
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,290
It takes us to our homepage instead of the official WordPress dawg.

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,880
OK, let's move on to our next change.

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,220
At this point, you might be asking yourself, Brad, why would you bother showing us how to change

64
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,200
this, you R-AL, when we don't even want this WordPress image here at all?

65
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,070
Well, that's a good question.

66
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,670
But in reality, this is not an image file here.

67
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,600
So if I.

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,930
Right.

69
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,280
Click on the logo and.

70
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:08,760
Choose, inspect, we can see that that a or link element does not contain an inline image element.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,700
Instead, WordPress uses a CSI as background image to display the WordPress logo.

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,750
So if you instead want to display your company logo or just plain text there, all you would need to

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:28,920
do is write a bit of success that targets the element that lives within a heading level, one within

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,350
the div with an ID of log in.

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,830
And right over here you can see that exact selector that the official WordPress code is using.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,130
Now, again, this is not a course on success, so we're not going to write the CSFs by hand.

77
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:51,690
But what I do want to show you is how to load your own success on this login page in the first place,

78
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,790
because that can be a bit tricky.

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,320
So by default, WordPress is not going to load your themes CSC file on this login screen.

80
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,400
But it's very easy for us to tell WordPress to please start doing that.

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,090
Let me show you how to do that.

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,850
So over in our text editor, still within functions.

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,210
Let's out a new line down at the bottom and lets say add action.

84
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,280
And for the first argument, the WordPress event we want to hook on to is log in on queue.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,290
I have the hardest time spelling that word correctly.

86
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,530
I always think I'm spelling it wrong, even if I'm spelling it correctly.

87
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,990
So I think that's right.

88
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,020
Anyways, logging on Q scripts.

89
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,680
And then for the second argument, we just make up a function name.

90
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,850
Why don't we call it our login success.

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,370
OK, then let's create a function with that exact name.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,780
So function our login success.

93
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,600
OK, and now within the body of this function, there's no need to reinvent the wheel because earlier

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,400
in the course we've already written in this exact file a bit of code to load a or JavaScript file.

95
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,960
So within functions we can just scroll up and find our function named university files and the first

96
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,080
two lines of code in the body of that function.

97
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,950
Those are JavaScript files.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,210
We don't need those.

99
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,130
But then these next four lines, these are all CSC files, right?

100
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,570
We have our custom Google fonts.

101
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,440
We have our font awesome icon pack, and then we have our two sixths files with the unique styling that

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,610
I've created for us.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,760
So let's just take these four lines of code.

104
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,610
They're all the exact same WP on Q style.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,240
Just select all four of these lines into your clipboard and then back down at the very bottom of this

106
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,750
file within our new empty function called our login access in the body of the function.

107
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,470
Just paste in your clipboard and now let's give this file a save.

108
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,980
You might need to refresh your login screen, but you can see it just received new fresh coat of paint.

109
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,200
So whatever it is that you want to customize, whether it's the background, color, the foreground,

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,710
color, the text or button color or anything, really even the padding or the font size or the font

111
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,680
family, the overall width of this box, whatever it is that you want to customize, all you need to

112
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,060
do is write success in your main theme folder style sheet that overrides the default WordPress styling.

113
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,590
So basically, whatever you want to customize just right, click on it, choose, inspect.

114
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,400
And then with that element selected over on the right hand side, you can scroll down and find the WordPress

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,000
styling.

116
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,790
So for example, these are the default blue colors that WordPress would have used for the login button.

117
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:58,470
And now all you need to do is write CSC that overrides this default selector that WordPress is using.

118
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,220
Now, again, this is not a course on success, but I will point you in the right direction if you want

119
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,430
to start making your own stylistic changes.

120
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,100
If you're looking for an idea of how to get started, just jump into your text editor and within your

121
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:23,400
theme folder, look in the next directory and then modules and then open up the file named Log in DOCSIS.

122
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,910
And here you can see an example of the selectors I'm using in order to override the WordPress defaults

123
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,070
and create my own styling here.

124
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,640
OK, now, before we bring this lesson to a close, there's one more thing I want to cover as of June

125
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,790
twenty twenty, this title here no longer says the name of your website and instead it says Powered

126
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,180
by WordPress, which is obviously not what we want.

127
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,290
So let me show you how to change that back in functions.

128
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:01,230
Let's add a new line and let's say add filter the name of the filter hook that I'm interested in.

129
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:10,930
Is in underscore header title and then for the second argument, let's just make up a name for a function,

130
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,080
maybe our login title, and then let's create a function with that exact name.

131
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,850
And then we just return a value of whatever we want so we could say quotes and then just spell something

132
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,770
out and that works well for a one off unique Web site.

133
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:37,810
But if instead you're building a theme that might be used by a lot of different sites, in that case,

134
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,820
what you want to do is fetch the official site name from the database.

135
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,750
So let's just return, get blog info.

136
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,440
And within the parentheses, the bit of info that we're looking for is name.

137
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,830
OK, so if I save that and jump back to the browser and refresh.

138
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:04,720
Perfect, and that's going to bring this lesson to a close at this point, now that we've created our

139
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,710
own custom log in and log out functionality, and now that we know a little bit about WordPress roles

140
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,460
and permissions, we are now in the perfect position to start giving our random stranger subscriber

141
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,050
accounts a few fun interactive abilities.

142
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,110
So in the next lesson, we are going to work on giving subscribers the ability to take notes while they're

143
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,130
in class.

144
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,220
Right from the front end of our website, they will be able to create or save a note as well as edit

145
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,930
an update or even delete their private notes.

146
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,740
This should be a really fun exercise for learning how to work with user specific content.

147
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,650
So let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
