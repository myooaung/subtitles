00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,820
In this lesson, we will begin creating our very own WordPress theme.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,570
Without further ado, let's jump right into the action.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:13,530
OK.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,430
So in your Web browser, go ahead and visit the home page of your local dev environment copy of WordPress

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,090
and let's visit the admen dashboard of our Web site.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,750
You can always visit the dashboard by going up to your address bar and at the end of your domain, visiting.

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,410
Slash WP dash admen.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,690
Go ahead and log in.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,470
OK.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,070
And if we were not developers, one of the first things you do on a typical WordPress Web site is look

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,720
for a theme that you like.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,350
Right.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,720
So you might head over to the appearance tab.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:56,690
And switch to one of the other themes that WordPress comes with out of the box, or most of the time

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,560
you don't want to be limited to just these themes that WordPress ships with.

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,350
So instead, you might click add new here.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,210
And then you could search through the thousands of free themes or your third main option is to use this

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,390
upload theme button in case you purchased a premium theme from a third party marketplace.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,990
OK, but in this course, we are not going to do any of that because we are not going to use an existing

21
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,470
theme.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,740
We are going to create a brand new theme.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,130
Now, I know at first that might sound scary, creating a theme from scratch, but it's not scary because

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,740
I'm here to guide you through it step by step.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,060
And believe it or not, it's very simple to begin creating a new theme.

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,600
So, for example, if I click on the main appearance tab again.

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,130
Here we see all of our currently installed themes.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,850
And if we want to create a brand new theme that will show up on this screen, all we need to do is create

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,880
a new folder in a very specific location.

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,530
So let me show you what I mean.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,300
Let's go on a little bit of a trip.

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,090
Let's look for the word prest themes folder.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,210
The first step to finding it is just navigating to that WordPress system folder.

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,820
We've already looked at two or three times.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,420
So.

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,800
Right, click on your site.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,900
Click, reveal and finder.

38
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,700
Click into your folder.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,750
And then app.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,370
And then public.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,170
OK.

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,030
Now, everyone in the course, regardless of what you're using for your local dev environment software,

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,950
everyone is going to have these same core WordPress files.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,450
Now, at the moment, we are looking for the Themes folder, which is located in the WP content folder.

45
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,300
So click in to WP content.

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,710
And here we see a folder named Themes.

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,670
Let's look inside that folder.

48
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,680
And here we see one folder for each of our currently installed themes.

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,800
So if we want to create a new theme, all we need to do is create a brand new folder in this theme's

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,460
directory.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,870
So new folder and we can name it anything we'd like.

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,090
Why don't we call it fictional university theme?

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,120
Technically, you could name the folder whatever you want, but just to save yourself a lot of frustration

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,770
just for the sake of being on the same page as me while working throughout the course.

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,840
I want you to name it exactly.

56
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,980
Fictional Dasch University dash theme.

57
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:29,840
OK.

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,260
Now all we need to do is create two new files within this new folder.

59
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,440
And then we will have a real theme that will show up on this screen and that we can activate.

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,700
So let's go ahead right now and create the two files that we need to do this.

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,560
Let's actually open this entire new folder within our Visual Studio Code text editing program on Windows.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,410
You can drag this new folder onto a V.S. code window or on Mac.

63
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,200
You can drag this new folder on top of the V.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,700
S code icon down in your dock or on any operating system.

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,000
You can just use the file open menu, a V.S. code.

66
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,820
And choose your folder instead of a file.

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:19,200
OK, but once you've opened our fictional university themed folder in V.S. Code, then in the left hand

68
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,970
explorer side right here, we can just right click and choose new file.

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,250
You should also see an icon right here that will also allow you to create a new file.

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,760
When you click new file here, we see a place where we can begin typing.

71
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,830
Let's name this new file index dot p HP press enter.

72
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,800
OK, and what do we want to write within the file?

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,520
For now, let's just add a bit of place holder text that reads.

74
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,350
This is our amazing custom theme.

75
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,940
Save again.

76
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,630
All right.

77
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,120
So I said we needed to create two files.

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,920
So we created one of the two.

79
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,450
Let's create the second file.

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,650
So over in the left hand side bar here, we can just right click choose new file.

81
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,150
And we need to name it style dot c.

82
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,540
S.

83
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,340
S press enter.

84
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,970
Now, normally a CSX file only has one responsibility, and that's to tell the Web page what it should

85
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,600
look like.

86
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,620
So you don't have to type this out cause I'm just gonna delete it in five seconds from now.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,890
But normally in a CSX file, you would say that like the color of all, the text should be orange,

88
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,380
right?

89
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,500
You style the content on your page.

90
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,530
Well, we will do stuff like that as well.

91
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,300
But in WordPress, this style does.

92
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,500
CSX file has another responsibility.

93
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,280
WordPress needs us to use this file to give it a bit of information about our theme and the way that

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,150
we give WordPress.

95
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,330
That info is up at the very top of the file here.

96
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,030
We begin a CSX comment.

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,910
So slash and then an asterisk.

98
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,730
That's how you begin a CSX comment.

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,700
And then on another line to close out the comment, it's asterisk and a slash.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,290
OK.

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,260
Now, between those two lines, we can write whatever we want.

102
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,510
So first and foremost, WordPress wants to know what the name of our theme is.

103
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,550
So let's say theme name Colan.

104
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,380
And we don't need the semicolon at the end here.

105
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,290
And now we can make up whatever name we want.

106
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,070
So let's say fictional university.

107
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,100
You might think that we already named the theme when we created the folder name, but in folder names,

108
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,610
you usually want to use dashes instead of spaces.

109
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,780
So this is our chance to use capital letters and have spaces in the name.

110
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,830
You get the idea.

111
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,240
Now, if we save this file and.

112
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,090
Want to point out that it needs to be named styled CSX.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,830
It can't be made CSX or screen DOT, CSX, the name here is very important word.

114
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,460
Press is on the lookout for this specific file name in our theme folder.

115
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,040
OK.

116
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,450
But with this comment in place and we save the file, if we jump back over to our Admon dashboard and

117
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,120
refresh the main appearance theme's screen.

118
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,370
Here we see our brand new theme.

119
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,340
And if we hover over it, we see themed details.

120
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,650
And if we click on that, we can see it looks a bit odd.

121
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,940
Right.

122
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,610
It says fictional university and then version.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,910
And there's no version number.

124
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,860
And also it says by Anonymous instead of our name.

125
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,150
So to fix those two things, back in our text editor on a new line still within our comment, we can

126
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,470
say author don't need the semicolon.

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,790
But author Colon.

128
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,160
And then you can just type in your name here.

129
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,800
And then on a new line, we can also say version.

130
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,470
And then we can just make up a version number, maybe 1.0.

131
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,020
OK.

132
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,670
So if we save this again and then refresh our theme screen.

133
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,710
And click on it again.

134
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,580
Cool.

135
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,600
So now we see fictional university version 1.0 by Brad.

136
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,780
Now all we are really missing is a screenshot or photograph or a preview image of our theme.

137
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,350
Right.

138
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,860
You'll notice that all of the other themes have a preview image here.

139
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:21,040
So to add a preview image to our new theme, all we need to do is go within our theme folder.

140
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,550
Right.

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,370
I named that folder fictional university theme.

142
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,900
And we just need to move an image file to live within this folder.

143
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,000
And the file should be named Screenshot Dot PMG.

144
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,510
Now, I conveniently have a PMG files on my desktop here.

145
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:43,870
You can find this same image file in the resources for this lesson, but I'm just going to move this

146
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:51,950
file into my folder and then I'm going to rename the file to Screen Shot Dot PMG.

147
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:52,690
OK.

148
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,740
Because WordPress is on the lookout for this exact file name.

149
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,710
And you can use your own image here instead of this one.

150
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:06,190
Ideally, you want the photo to be twelve hundred pixels wide by nine hundred pixels tall.

151
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,790
All right.

152
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,390
But with this in place, if we refresh this admin screen again.

153
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,590
Cool.

154
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,690
So now this looks like a legitimate theme.

155
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,910
It's got a preview photo if we click it.

156
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,800
It's got the essential information.

157
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,890
And now we can just go ahead and activate the theme.

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,470
So you can click activate down here at the bottom.

159
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,870
Or if you close this out from this screen, when you hover over a theme, there's also an activate button

160
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,410
right here.

161
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:29,750
OK.

162
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,840
So let's go ahead and activate the theme.

163
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,310
And now if we use this link up here to view the front end of our Web site.

164
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,450
Cool.

165
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,400
So remember, this is what we typed out in our theme's index stop BHP file.

166
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,820
So if we go back to our text editor and jump back into the themes index, stop p HP file, maybe I want

167
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,120
to add the word completely here.

168
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,830
This is our completely amazing custom theme.

169
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,770
Save it.

170
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,260
Refresh our Web site.

171
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:57,970
Awesome.

172
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,190
So now that we have our brand new theme and we activated it, we can see it on the front end of our

173
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,040
web here.

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,330
We really don't have any need for all of these other default themes, like twenty, seventeen, twenty,

175
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,040
sixteen.

176
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:10,660
Right.

177
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,870
Our new theme is all we are ever going to need.

178
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,450
And since we don't want to ever accidentally activate one of these other themes, why don't we just

179
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,040
go and delete them right now?

180
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,170
So back to the folder structure.

181
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,690
Here's our theme folder that contains indexed BHP style and our screenshot.

182
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,310
If we go up a level.

183
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:30,820
OK.

184
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,790
So now I'm looking in the WordPress theme's folder.

185
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,590
We can go ahead and delete the folders for those other themes.

186
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,790
2015, 16 and 17.

187
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,920
So just select them and delete them.

188
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,240
Cool.

189
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,730
So now if I refresh this admin screen.

190
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,660
Perfect.

191
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,690
We just have one theme and it's the one that we created.

192
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,960
Now, before we bring this lesson to a close, I want to address a CSF concern that you might have.

193
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,480
So if you're the type of person who experiments with lessons along the way, you might have already

194
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,860
tried to do the following.

195
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,520
So back in our style, that CSX file underneath our comment lines, you might have tried to write a

196
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,310
bit of normalcy SS so maybe you would target the entire page and say color orange.

197
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,500
But you'll notice that if I save that and refresh the Web site, nothing happens.

198
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,530
We would expect this text to become orange.

199
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,730
But that's not happening.

200
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,900
So don't worry.

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,390
I don't expect the CSF to be loading yet.

202
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,490
I will show you how to correctly load the CSX on the front end of your Web site very soon.

203
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,150
OK.

204
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:39,670
Now, having said that, looking forward to our very next lesson, we will learn how to do something

205
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,180
actually useful here instead of just this boring place.

206
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,290
Hold their sentence.

207
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,680
We are going to look at the heart and soul of WordPress and BHP, which is functions.

208
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,210
If you have no idea what a function is.

209
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,960
That's OK.

210
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,230
That's actually good, because in the next lesson, we are going to start with the very basics.

211
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,850
Should be a lot of fun.

212
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,900
Let's keep it rolling.

213
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,070
And I will see you then.
