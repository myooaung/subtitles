00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.610
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.420
In this lesson I want to show you not just how, but why you would set up a blank template.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.370
Let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.080
So imagine I want to create a new page on my website, but maybe I don't want the exact page template.

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.990
So for example, if you go to the About US page, maybe I don't want it to use the same template.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.190
You know, the page, that HTML template that all my other pages use.

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.670
Maybe I want sort of an empty canvas to work with.

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.140
So let's do this.

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.140
Let's go in to the dashboard and let's add a brand new page.

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:47.500
So under pages I'll click add new, I'll say my cool landing page and I'll just have a paragraph that

11
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.240
says Lorem ipsum.

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.820
Now notice in this right hand area, not under the block menu, but if you actually click on the overall

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.440
page menu right here and we look down a little bit here, we see a template.

14
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.030
So you can click on that and then choose which template you want this page to use.

15
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.090
Now it lists all of the standard templates, and in my opinion, none of these would make sense, right?

16
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.120
It's not like we'd want to use the single program or single professor template for a landing page.

17
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.880
But what if right now we go add a new template file in our theme that's just sort of empty?

18
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.990
Let me explain.

19
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.340
So in our text editor in the templates folder, let's just create a brand new file and I'll name it

20
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.790
empty canvas dot HTML.

21
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.460
Well, just to be clear here, I made up this name.

22
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.990
There's nothing special about the name.

23
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.540
You could literally name the file anything you want.

24
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.970
It's not as if it needs to be a specific name to show up in that template chooser menu.

25
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.160
But anyways, in this new file, the only block we need to include is obviously any content that the

26
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.300
user adds here.

27
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.530
Right.

28
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.700
So if they have a paragraph and then below that, you know, if they added a list or a heading red,

29
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.250
orange, yellow, right.

30
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.500
Any sort of content they add, we want to include that.

31
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.150
Let me go ahead and actually save that so I don't lose the content that I just added.

32
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.380
But back in our text editor, we would just have a block that looks like this.

33
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.390
So an HTML comment, right?

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.420
That's how Gutenberg works in the comment.

35
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.670
It would just be WP post dash content and then a forward slash here for a self-closing tag and that's

36
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.910
it.

37
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.070
Go ahead and save that.

38
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.500
And then back in the editor.

39
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.600
Let's refresh this editor.

40
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.850
That's why I saved my content up in the top, right?

41
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.390
I don't want to lose just a little bit of sample contents if I refresh.

42
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.430
Now under the page menu here under page template, if I choose.

43
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.710
It's falling off the bottom of the screen.

44
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.250
But there it is, empty canvas and click update and then actually go view that page on the front end,

45
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.120
as you might have guessed, is completely empty now.

46
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.910
Yes, if the user is just adding paragraphs and lists like this, it will look horrible, right?

47
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.980
This isn't going to win any design awards.

48
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.210
However, let's not forget that they can add our custom block types.

49
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.330
So for example, let me remove this list.

50
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.840
And let me change the paragraph to be of slash.

51
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.730
If I start typing for banner.

52
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.600
Yep.

53
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.890
Our custom banner block.

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.300
And then inside of that, I'll add a generic heading my custom page, you know.

55
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.050
And then below that I could add either a slideshow or the events and blogs block.

56
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.310
The idea is any of the blocks that you've created, those are available in addition to the default blocks.

57
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.890
So maybe I'll say events and blogs.

58
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520
I can give that a save or update that refresh the front end.

59
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.450
Cool.

60
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.590
So notice we didn't even have to include the header or the footer.

61
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.910
So I'm a big fan of this empty template idea.

62
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.560
I think it really shows the power of the block editor.

63
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.980
Now, if someone wanted to include the heading up here, they could just insert a new block type, maybe

64
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.030
before the banner.

65
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.740
So insert before.

66
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.720
We don't want it to be a paragraph so slash and then if I search for you fictional university header

67
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.160
I can save that.

68
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.560
And refresh.

69
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.960
Now we do indeed have the header.

70
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.540
So the idea, though is that the user is in control of what they're building piece by piece, block

71
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.290
by block.

72
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.590
And the idea is that now it's not a per template basis.

73
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.310
It can even be a per page or per post basis.

74
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.810
And just right now, as I'm filming this, I just came up with an extra credit idea.

75
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.470
If you wanted to, you could adjust our header block.

76
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.170
You could turn it into a jazz powered block, and maybe you could have a little dropdown or checkbox

77
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.460
here that asks, Do you want to include the top left logo?

78
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.630
You know, yes or no.

79
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.120
So they could choose yes or no and then that would control the output, right?

80
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.140
Do you actually display this logo or not?

81
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.290
So the point is there's no limit to how much you want to customize your blocks and how many different

82
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.670
blocks you want to create.

83
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.140
However, in terms of educational value and, you know, unique concepts, I believe this chapter has

84
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.280
come to a close.

85
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.970
I encourage you to try and come up with a few new ideas for blocks and go experiment and create them

86
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.700
using all the concepts from this chapter.

87
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.910
I believe the sky's the limit in terms of what you can create.

88
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.750
As for our block theme, well, we've completed it.

89
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.720
We've set up some features that are fully interactive, for example, adding, you know, headers and

90
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.510
buttons and links and uploading different background images as well as our slideshow.

91
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.510
And we've also learned sort of the more traditional placeholder block approach that I'm a big fan of

92
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.830
altogether.

93
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.900
I think you now have all the tools in your toolbox to go create amazing block themes.

94
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.920
Thank you so much for working through this chapter with me and take care.
