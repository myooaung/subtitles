00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.820
Perfect.

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.690
Hello from slide.

3
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.470
Hello from slide.

4
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello from Slide.

5
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.020
Now we just need to adjust this output to actually look like a slide.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.770
So to save a little bit of typing and to give us at least 50% of the way immediately, let's just borrow

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.210
code from banner.

8
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.150
Dot up.

9
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.090
So jump into banner, dot up.

10
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.910
Just select everything in here.

11
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.390
Copy it into your clipboard.

12
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.320
Back in.

13
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.040
Slide dot.

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400
Get rid of this placeholder and paste in your clipboard.

15
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.810
Okay.

16
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.550
Leave this up.

17
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.800
That fetches the default background image.

18
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.610
We can leave that in place in this HTML down here.

19
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.360
Get rid of the opening div tag and then that means we can get rid of the very closing div tag too.

20
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.890
Now, on this div that has a class of page banner, big image, and then it's got the style that outputs

21
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.850
the background image.

22
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.590
Let's leave this div in place, but let's change its class value.

23
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.370
So hollow out the class value it would instead be.

24
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.940
Hero.

25
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.480
Dash.

26
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.290
Slider.

27
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.340
Underscore.

28
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.000
Underscore.

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.780
Slide.

30
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.770
Okay.

31
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.300
So that div opens here.

32
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.280
But then you'll see all on one line.

33
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.920
It's closing div tag ends on the same line.

34
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.850
That's fine.

35
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.210
But everything below that, let's just give ourselves a clean slate.

36
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520
Now let's drop down so that we have a new line where this div opens and closes like this.

37
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
And inside this div, let's just nest a little bit of content.

38
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.890
So let's have a div opening and closing and give it a class of hero dash slider underscore underscore

39
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.660
interior space container inside that div.

40
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.170
Let's nest another div and this will have a class.

41
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.680
So opening and closing, give it a class of hero dash, slider, underscore, underscore, overlay,

42
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.190
and then a space t dash center.

43
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.620
This has nothing to do with WordPress.

44
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.590
This is just for a specific CC design.

45
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.730
However, inside this inner most div now we can actually output the dynamic content.

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.660
So we would just drop into P and say echo dollar sign content semicolon.

47
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.700
Let's give that a save and now see what it looks like on the front end.

48
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.760
So if I refresh.

49
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.570
You might need to move your cursor off of the slideshow.

50
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.290
But eventually it will start sliding through.

51
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.890
Perfect.

52
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.200
You can also use the dots.

53
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.680
So we only have two slides.

54
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.090
That's why there's only two dots.

55
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.660
But you can also click and sort of drag to animate forward.

56
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.560
Perfect.

57
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.970
There's just two more details I want to take care of before this feature is complete.

58
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.510
So, number one, I want to go adjust our JavaScript so that you can have multiple slideshows per page.

59
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.260
Because what if you wanted a slideshow here, but then maybe up at the very top you wanted another slideshow.

60
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.530
So I'll show you how to make our slideshow JavaScript dynamic.

61
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.180
But first, let's take care of the editor screen so that the edit interface actually has the same appearance,

62
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.420
right?

63
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.400
With the dark, semi-transparent black background around the text content.

64
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.800
So to fix that, we would just go in to our slide JS file and look for the edit component JS X.

65
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.440
So for me, it's around line number 59 and we would just replay those same steps.

66
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.600
So I would get rid of this overall div with the class of page banner, get rid of the closing matching

67
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.110
div.

68
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.220
On this opening div, I would change its class to hero dash slider underscore underscore slide.

69
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.490
Then because its closing div is on the same line, I would drop down inside there.

70
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.520
I'd have a div with a class of hero dash slider underscore underscore interior unit tablets.

71
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.930
Also give that a class of container inside of that div, I'd have a div with a class of hero dash slider

72
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.470
underscore underscore overlay hit tab.

73
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.320
Also give that a class of t dash center and then nested inside that div is where you'd finally have

74
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.170
your inner blocks so you can just move or cut and paste the inner blocks line that we already have right

75
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.590
here.

76
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.910
Just cut and paste that to live inside our new gsx.

77
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.340
And then you can see I still had this unnecessary div down at the bottom with a class of page banner

78
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.050
underscore, underscore content.

79
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.920
So I would just get rid of that line of code, give that a save back on the edit screen if we refresh.

80
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.140
Scroll back down to our slideshow.

81
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.690
Perfect.

82
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.470
Now we've got that exact slide styling going on.

83
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.350
Now for our final detail, let's make sure that our slideshow block is very flexible.

84
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.140
And what I mean by that is what if you wanted to have more than one slideshow on a single page?

85
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.110
We want to make sure that our JavaScript is resilient.

86
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.910
So just for a quick test, let's add a secondary slideshow right about here.

87
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.960
So right below the page banner up at the very top.

88
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.040
So right about here, I will add there it is.

89
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.850
Slideshow.

90
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.480
And actually to save a bunch of clicking, let me undo that.

91
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.410
You know what we can do?

92
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.730
That would be a lot faster.

93
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.940
Just copy and paste this instance that we've already set up.

94
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.430
We can use this icon up here.

95
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.140
So if you hover over it, it reads list view.

96
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.400
Let's click on that and then just click on the overall slideshow.

97
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.160
Here it is.

98
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.600
So that selects it in its entirety.

99
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.430
And then you can just click these three dots here and you can copy and paste, or you can just click

100
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.510
the duplicate option.

101
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.530
So click duplicate.

102
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.920
Cool.

103
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.260
So now we've got two slideshows so you can close the list view.

104
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.320
But the idea is now there's an exact clone of it.

105
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.940
So let's just move one of them up to live right there.

106
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.630
So now we've got our page banner, one slide show, then our events and blogs and then another slideshow.

107
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.930
So if we save that and refresh the front end, you'll see that our JavaScript is not very resilient.

108
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.150
So it's getting confused, right?

109
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.150
There's only two slides per slide show, but now there's four dots on this first instance of the slide

110
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.600
show.

111
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.590
And then if you scroll down, the second slide show is completely messed up.

112
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.040
So this really has nothing to do with WordPress.

113
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.510
But I want to show you how to fix this essentially in our text editor.

114
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:34.060
I just need you to jump in to the CRC folder and then modules and then hero slider dot.

115
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.710
Jess, you can see the code that I originally wrote only looks for a single and sort of the first instance

116
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.750
of an element with this class.

117
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.050
So there are a million different ways you could adjust this code.

118
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.170
But here's what I'm thinking before this if statement but still in the constructor, let's just say

119
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.760
kannst all slideshows equals.

120
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.640
And then it would be document dot, query selector all to select multiple instances and then string

121
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.490
of text dot hero dash slider.

122
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.570
Then right below that we would just loop through that.

123
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.710
So I'd say all slideshows dot for each parentheses to call that.

124
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.590
Inside of that you'd give it a functions function parentheses curly brackets in these parentheses for

125
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.560
the function make up a parameter name could be x, could be unicorn, could be pizza, let's just name

126
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.240
it maybe current slide show.

127
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.640
So now we're just going to loop through whether there's two slideshows on the page or ten inside this

128
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.090
function.

129
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.790
We're going to perform these actions once for each of them.

130
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.630
So what I would do now is just borrow this code.

131
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.440
So I would begin selecting from this count how many?

132
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.340
So I'd place my cursor right there, and then I would just scroll down until the end of Glide Mount.

133
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.540
So I want all of that.

134
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.280
I'd cut it into my clipboard.

135
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.950
We can get rid of this if statement.

136
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.240
We don't need that any longer.

137
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.160
And then in this function that we just set up paste in your clipboard.

138
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:08.630
Cool.

139
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.210
Now let's just make a few adjustments.

140
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.960
So now we want to adjust these selectors to be specific to the current slide show they're working with.

141
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.750
So instead of on this line, for example, dot count, instead of searching the entire DOM, the entire

142
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:30.460
web page instead of document, dot query selector, all this would be current slide show dot query selector,

143
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:31.690
right?

144
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.520
So it's specific to that one.

145
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.910
Then around line 17, we do the same thing, right?

146
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:44.680
Instead of document, query selector here it would be current slide showed up, query selector.

147
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.400
Let's give this a save and test it out.

148
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.870
So back on the home page if we refresh.

149
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.070
Whoops.

150
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.220
So at the end of our code when we actually leverage glide.

151
00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.440
So down here we're creating a variable called lowercase glide, new instance of the glide plug in.

152
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:07.100
We obviously need this selector to be dynamic, right, instead of just looking for the first instance

153
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.180
of this in the dorm.

154
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.970
So when you see new uppercase glide just hollow out this value instead of this string of text, it would

155
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.120
be current slideshow.

156
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.630
Let's give that a save refresh one more time.

157
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.710
And now we're in business.

158
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.120
So each slideshow has the correct two dots, right?

159
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.210
There's two slides in each one, and they both function independent of each other.

160
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:37.130
You can even super zoom out just to see that one can advance without the other and to close out the

161
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.460
lesson.

162
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.070
I won't bore you with this, but I just spent off camera a little bit of time to type in actual text

163
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.890
values and use background images that make sense.

164
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.220
Right?

165
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.880
So an apple, a day free food with the bread image, you get the idea at this point, our front page

166
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.680
template is basically complete.

167
00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.410
I just need to get rid of this bogus banner block that I added but never used, and then also this bogus

168
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.110
query loop block that I never used.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:09.200
So really quick, if I get rid of those two, I'll delete the empty banner block down here and get rid

170
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.650
of this.

171
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.690
Welcome to our site heading.

172
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.520
Let me just use this icon up here.

173
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.960
I'll click on the query loop block as a whole and just choose the three dots.

174
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.150
Remove that cool.

175
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.120
So from top to bottom, we've got our header, our page banner, our events and blogs, our slideshow,

176
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.470
and then our footer.

177
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:35.620
If we save that and refresh the front end, we are in business from this point forward.

178
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.540
In the chapter, we're just going to start creating the actual templates for all of the pages you might

179
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.170
expect.

180
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.570
So single blog posts, single pages, archive screens.

181
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.450
I zoom in a little bit, our custom pages for the my notes feature custom post types, right, like

182
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.860
individual professors, the programs, so on and so forth.

183
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.360
At the end of this, we're going to end up with a whole collection of templates.

184
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:08.440
So remember our templates folder will have an entire collection of HTML files that use our blocks in

185
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.200
different ways, and they will provide sort of the home base that the user can always revert back to.

186
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.610
Let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
