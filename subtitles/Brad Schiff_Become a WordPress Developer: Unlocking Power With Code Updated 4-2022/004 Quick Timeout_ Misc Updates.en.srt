00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:09,450
This lesson is going to be super quick and short, and then I promise in our very next lesson, we will

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,850
indeed learn about custom fields.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,330
OK.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,680
But first, in this lesson, there's just a few miscellaneous things I want to cover.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,610
The first thing that I want to address is excerpts.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,990
So in our previous lessons, we used the word press trimm words function to just pull in the first 18

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,130
words of the main content field for each one of these posts.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,290
But in the real world, sometimes you don't want to just pull in the first 18 words.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,650
Maybe instead you want to create a handcrafted excerpt that you write yourself to show you what I'm

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,350
talking about.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,500
Let's begin with this blog section.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
And then once we mastered that, we can move on to working on our custom post types here.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,660
So first, with the blogs, let's just go and edit this.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,750
We won an award post so I can show you what I'm talking about in the admen click on posts.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,900
You might not have the exact same post titles as I do, but just go ahead and edit one of the posts

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,370
that's being pulled in on your home page at the moment.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,600
OK, now, at first glance, we don't see a field anywhere where we could type in a handcrafted excerpt.

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,040
However, in the right hand side bar, not under the block menu, but under the document menu towards

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,310
the bottom, we do see an area named excerpt.

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,920
And if we click on that here, we see a field where we can enter a handcrafted summary.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,730
I could say our school has won another award this year.

23
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,380
Right.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,510
Doesn't matter what you type.

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,520
Just type something.

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,340
And then if I click update, we still won't see that excerpt here on the front end.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,260
However, now it's just a matter of editing this P HP code to do what we want.

28
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:03,210
So in your text editor within your theme folder, jump in to front page dot p HP and you can scroll

29
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,170
down a bit until you get to the from our blog's headline.

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,850
Here's the custom query.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,290
Here's the while loop.

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,600
Here's the title headline for each post.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,140
And right below it here we see the Trimm words and it will pull in the first 18 words of the main content

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,620
field.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,600
Now, instead of this, let's try pulling in that handcrafted excerpt we just wrote.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,950
So let's hollow out this BHP opening and closing tag.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,140
And instead we can just say the excerpt.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,550
So we see some good news and some bad news for the Post that does have a handcrafted excerpt that looks

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,120
beautiful.

40
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,500
Right.

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,040
But for this post where we didn't assign a handcrafted excerpt, it's going to pull in the first fifty

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,590
five words of the main content field as a fallback.

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,660
Now it is possible to customize that value of fifty five words to something else.

44
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,630
But that will be used as the excerpt length globally on your entire Web site.

45
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,290
And oftentimes you might not want to adjust the global setting or preference.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,360
You might want excerpts of different lengths depending on the post type or depending on the template

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,900
you're on.

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,200
Right.

49
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,390
The home page versus an archive.

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,830
So on and so forth.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,580
So let me show you how I personally handle excerpts.

52
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,600
What I do is combine the power of this excerpt field with that TRIMM words function that we were using

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,170
before.

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,250
So again, let's hollow out this BHP opening and closing tag.

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,670
And this time, let's begin with an if statement.

56
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,120
So I'm going to say if and then parentheses.

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,490
And then let's open up curly brackets and dropdown.

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,020
Let's begin with our condition within these parentheses.

59
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,440
Let's call a function named has excerpt.

60
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,180
This function will only return a value of true if the current post has a handcrafted excerpt.

61
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,480
So if this is true, what do we want to do within our curly brackets?

62
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,410
Let's just display the excerpt, OK?

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,940
But if this evaluates to false, what do we want to do then as a fallback?

64
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,300
Well, right after the curly brackets for that condition, we can just say LS and then it's own pair

65
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,380
of curly brackets.

66
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,350
And now whatever we say here is like our insurance plan.

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,140
So if a post doesn't have a handcrafted excerpt, let's just rely on the first 18 words of the main

68
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,130
content field.

69
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,790
So let's echo out the results of WP trimm words.

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,930
It takes two arguments.

71
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,640
The first is what you want to trim.

72
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,550
So get the content.

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,990
Second argument is how many words you want to limit it to.

74
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,380
So let's say 18.

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,700
So if I save that cool.

76
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,250
This post uses the handcrafted excerpt.

77
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,820
This post doesn't have an excerpt, so it just uses the first 18 words of the content.

78
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,610
Now, from a design perspective, I'm noticing that there's vertical gaps around this excerpt.

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,300
And that's because our the excerpt function handles echoing and outputting the content onto the page

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,900
for us.

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,220
So instead, we can use a function named get the excerpt.

82
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,070
And then right before that, we can just say to echo it.

83
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,370
So if I save that, we can see those awkward vertical gaps that we're being created by the extra P tag

84
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,630
have been removed.

85
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,330
OK.

86
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,280
Now, I like the ability to have a handcrafted excerpt like this.

87
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,880
So we probably want to apply that to our events as well.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,310
But if I try to go edit one of these event posts, for example, Poetry Day.

89
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,600
So in the admen, click on events in the sidebar.

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,590
Then edit Poetry Day, you'll notice that we do not see an excerpt field down here.

91
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,560
And even if I click on screen options in the corner, there is no excerpt checkbox to check.

92
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,340
And that's because when it comes to custom post types that we created, it's up to us to specifically

93
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,670
tell WordPress that our post type should support.

94
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,630
Excerpts.

95
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,410
So right now, I want you to dig into your must use plugins folder and jump into the P p file where

96
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,050
we called the register or post type function.

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,870
So within our top level array, maybe right before the rewrite line, ordering doesn't matter.

98
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,950
But this will work.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,060
What we want to do is use a parameter named supports.

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,160
And then we set that to equal its own array.

101
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,090
OK.

102
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,610
Now, within that array, we don't have to assign values to sub parameters.

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
We can just mention key words that we want to support.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,010
So by default, new custom post types support the title field.

105
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,460
And the main editor or content field.

106
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,450
And then it's up to us to add on any extra features that we want to support.

107
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,540
So, for example, we could say excerpt.

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,560
All right.

109
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,920
Now, as soon as I save this, if I try to edit an event post now down at the bottom of the screen,

110
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,950
I do indeed see an excerpt field.

111
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,380
If you don't see an excerpt field at the bottom of your screen, let me show you what you can do.

112
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,820
So earlier in this lesson, we already learned where to find the excerpt field using the modern WordPress

113
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,150
block at its screen.

114
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,060
However, for reasons we will discuss in just a moment from now, our custom post type is using the

115
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,790
old or classic edit screen.

116
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:31,150
In that case, when you're using the classic ED up towards the top right corner, you can click on screen

117
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,630
options here and you just need to make sure that the excerpt option here is checked.

118
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,080
OK, now, before we move on and actually add an excerpt value here, I first want to explain why our

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,310
custom post type is using the classic ED instead of the modern block editor.

120
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,790
And actually, before I jump into the verbal explanation, I want you to follow along with me.

121
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:01,900
So back in our text editor within our Ayumu Plugins folder in our university post type's file right

122
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,060
above this supports line that we just wrote.

123
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,650
I want you to add a new line.

124
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:13,500
And let's say quotes show underscore in underscore rest.

125
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,240
And then arrow symbol, so equal, greater than and just give it a value of true.

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,380
Be sure to add a comma at the end of this line and hit save.

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,270
Don't worry.

128
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm going to explain what this line means in just a moment.

129
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,790
Once we save that back in the ad, man, if you refresh.

130
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,740
Interesting, right?

131
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,140
So now our custom post type is indeed using the modern block editor.

132
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,380
This is because the new editor in WordPress relies almost exclusively on JavaScript.

133
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,620
So in order for it to work, we need to make sure that our custom post type shows up or is available

134
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,600
within the rest API.

135
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,040
Now, at this point in the course, we have no idea what a rest API is.

136
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,450
So don't worry about that.

137
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,640
Trust me, we will learn all about the rest API in future chapters in the course.

138
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,830
For now, all you need to know is that the rest API makes raw WordPress data available for JavaScript

139
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,640
to fetch.

140
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,480
Right.

141
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,750
And if the modern block ed is powered by JavaScript, obviously that needs to be enabled for our post

142
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,110
type.

143
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,030
One other quick note.

144
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,840
When you include the supports array here.

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,780
If you don't explicitly list Ed, that will also have the post type fallback to the classic editor.

146
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:40,560
So, for example, if I get rid of this editor and then hit save and refresh the edit screen, you can

147
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,750
see we're back to the classic ED.

148
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,410
Now, if you don't have the supports array at all.

149
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,680
So if I deleted that entirely, that will use the modern editor.

150
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:58,440
But just be aware that if you're spelling out what you want to support, you do need to spell out Ed.

151
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,060
If you want to use the modern edit screen, OK?

152
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,840
So with that back in place and still having our show and rest, this is how I'm going to move forward.

153
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,550
So that will give us the modern block editor.

154
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,560
Now, let's get back to the actual task at hand, which is simply assigning a handcrafted excerpt for

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
this post.

156
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,350
So let's just say Poetry Day is going to be amazing and say that.

157
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,050
And then let's just update our home page template to pull in handcrafted excerpts here.

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,140
So now let's jump back to our theme folder.

159
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,130
And within front page dopp BHP.

160
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,160
There's no sense in us typing out all of this BHP logic again.

161
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,390
This if statement that checks to see if there's an excerpt and if there's not.

162
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,880
So why don't we just copy from the beginning?

163
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,090
BHP tag to the closing BHP tag.

164
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,010
Copy that in your clipboard.

165
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,850
Right.

166
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,060
Because if it worked for blogs, it will work for events.

167
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:04,260
And then let's just scroll up to our events, custom query in the loop for events.

168
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,250
And then here is where we used to just output the first 18 words so we can just delete that and instead

169
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,790
paste in our clipboard with this custom conditional logic.

170
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,830
And we should be in business.

171
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,720
Perfect.

172
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,390
So that takes care of excerpts.

173
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,190
Now, let's change gears.

174
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,600
And the next thing I want to work on is this view all events button.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,570
Right now, it doesn't have a real H RF value.

176
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,820
So if you click it, nothing really happens.

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,850
So back in our text editor within front page DOT, BHP right below that event loop.

178
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,690
We were working on is that link that says view all events.

179
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,700
So we just need to update this hash tags so that when you actually clicked on it, it knows where to

180
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,060
go.

181
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:59,040
So let's drop in to BHP and let's echo out the results of the function, get post type archive link.

182
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,810
Remember, this function will automatically get the correct archive.

183
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,000
You are well, it only needs one argument, and that is the custom post type that you're interested

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,180
in.

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,350
So if I save that now, when I click on View all events, it takes me to the events archive.

186
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,190
Perfect.

187
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,920
Now, before we bring this lesson to a close, there's just one more thing I want to work on, and that

188
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,900
has to do with our header navigation.

189
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,920
Why don't we go ahead and make it so the events link actually works.

190
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:35,220
And beyond that, it should stay lit up as yellow when you're on an events based page.

191
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,470
So within our theme folder, let's open up the header dot p HP file.

192
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,680
Here's the events list, item and link.

193
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,320
So first, let's just update the graph value going to BHP.

194
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,500
You could just copy and paste what we use.

195
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,560
Just a moment ago.

196
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:00,330
But it's echoing out the results of gate post type archive link for the event post time.

197
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,100
OK.

198
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,200
But beyond that, we want that link to be lit up as yellow when you're on an events page.

199
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:14,310
So just like we did for the About US link and the blog link within the opening list item tag for events.

200
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,110
Let's go into BHP and let's write an if statement.

201
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,930
So we'll say if and what is our condition?

202
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,730
We want to check for, let's say, if get post type.

203
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,020
So that's a function.

204
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,220
It gets its own parentheses.

205
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,910
If that equals or if that returns a value of.

206
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,930
Event.

207
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,180
Well, then we want this link to light up as yellow.

208
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,640
Now if you're if statement is going to live all on one line, you do not need curly brackets.

209
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,470
So on the same line, we can say what we want to do.

210
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,390
If this is true.

211
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,870
So we just want to echo out a bit of H.T. email.

212
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,370
And we want to say class equals double quotes.

213
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,450
And the class name is current menu item.

214
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,360
Cool.

215
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,610
So let's save that.

216
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,360
And we can see that we're on the event's archived and it's lit up as yellow.

217
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,830
And if I click on one of the individual events, we're on the single page and it's still lights up as

218
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,340
yellow.

219
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,180
Perfect.

220
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,900
That's gonna bring this quick lesson to a close in our next lesson.

221
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,090
We will get to custom fields.

222
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,860
It's a very powerful topic.

223
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,050
Let's keep things rolling.

224
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,230
And I will see you then.
