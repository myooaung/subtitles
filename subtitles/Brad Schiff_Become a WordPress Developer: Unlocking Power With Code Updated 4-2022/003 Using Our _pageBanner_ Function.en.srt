00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,620
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:09,250
In this lesson, we will actually go through and use our new page banner function in all of our templates.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,700
Without further ado, let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,010
So right away, let's jump into our text editor and in our theme folder, let's just go through each

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,890
one of our template files one by one, and remove any of the duplicate page banner code and instead

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,790
replace it with our new function.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,550
So let's just start up at the top.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,040
The first file is archive event.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,890
Here we see the page banner div.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:40,510
So right above that, within this block, let's drop down to a new line and call our new page banner

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,110
function.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,290
And this template file controls an archive screen.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,200
So instead of pulling in a title and subtitle from a post from the database, we just want to use these

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,780
custom text values.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,160
So within our page banner function call, let's provide it an array of arguments.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,490
OK, let's drop down to a new line to stay organized.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,740
Let's say that title should equal and here we have it set to all events, all events.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:18,730
And then let's also target subtitle and say that should equal see what is going on in our world so you

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,000
can just copy and paste that sort of typing it.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,770
OK, this looks good.

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,920
So now we can literally just delete this entire page banner div.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,200
OK, let's give that a save and then let's go test out that page on the front end.

23
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,920
So that was the event's archived screen.

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,290
Still looks good.

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,580
Let's move on to the next file in our text editor.

26
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,910
So the next template is archived program, and let's just do the same thing.

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,360
So right before the page Banner d'Hiv in the AP Block, it's called Page Banner.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,120
This template is using custom text for the title and subtitle.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,630
So let's provide our function and array.

30
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:10,390
Let's say the title should equal all programs and let's say that subtitle should equal.

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,340
And then down here we can just copy and paste this instead of typing it out again.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,360
Copy paste.

33
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,300
OK, and then we can just go ahead and delete this div.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,020
Save it.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,100
Let's go test it out.

36
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,450
So that was the all programs archive.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,000
Still looks good.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,330
Let's move on to the next template file.

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,520
So the next template is archived.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,430
Be right above page banner.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,750
Let's call P function page bannered.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,700
Let's pass it an array of arguments.

43
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,510
Let's say that title should equal and this screen is a little bit different, instead of just custom

44
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,420
static type text, we are running a function named the archive title.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,440
So to refresh your memory, let me show you an example of this function in action on the front end of

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,160
our website.

47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,400
If we click over to the blog section up in the header and then within one of the page metadata boxes,

48
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:19,920
if we click on the bold author name, this screen is powered by archived FTP and this title of author

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,820
Colin Brad is being dynamically generated by this function.

50
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,650
Right?

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,910
Or if we click on to the awards category archive, we see category Colen Awards.

52
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,750
So this function is responsible for dynamically stirring up that name.

53
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,410
So our first instinct might be to just copy and paste this function up here.

54
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:46,500
But remember that when a function begins with the word, the it handles the echoing or outputting for

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,750
you.

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,540
And in this case, up in our array, we don't want to echo or output anything.

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,510
We just want to return a value.

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,460
So long story short, instead of the archived title, let's set our title to equal the results of a

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,030
function named Get the archive title.

60
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,260
Remember that nine times out of ten in WordPress, if you just want to return a value, you can just

61
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,460
begin the same function.

62
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,630
Name with git.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,330
So title equals get the archive title.

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,460
Let's not forget about the subtitle.

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,050
So comma and then let's say subtitle should equal.

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,690
And instead of the archived description, let's say get the archive description.

67
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,330
OK, now with our page banner function call complete, we can go ahead and delete this page banner div.

68
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,930
Let's save that and check out the front end and it still works perfectly.

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,160
If I go back to an author archive screen still looks good.

70
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,980
Let's move on to the next template file.

71
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,380
So we just finished archive.

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,080
We don't need to adjust footer or front page or functions or header.

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,450
So the next file that we want to edit is index P.

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,240
This file controls the home of our blog section.

75
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,460
We see a title of Welcome to our blog and the subtitle of Keep Up with our latest news.

76
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,900
So right above this div up in the block, let's just call page banner, pass it.

77
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,980
An array of arguments title should equal.

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:33,610
Welcome to our blog, let's just copy and paste that comma, then we'll say subtitle equals and just

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,560
copy and paste this text.

80
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,480
OK, now we can go ahead and delete the actual div.

81
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,970
Save that.

82
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,680
Let's go visit our blog.

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Home page still looks good.

84
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,850
Let's move on to the next template file actually before we move on.

85
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,490
Why don't we copy and paste this function, call into our clipboard so we don't have to type as much.

86
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,950
OK, so the next file that we want to update is page past events.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,690
We can see it's using a custom title and subtitle.

88
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,670
So right above it, let's just paste in our clipboard in this block of PHP and let's change the title

89
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:21,340
to past events and let's change the subtitle to a recap of our past events.

90
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,440
Then we can delete this div save that.

91
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,180
Let's go test it out on the front end.

92
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,100
So events and then down here, check out our Past Events archive still looks good.

93
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,810
Let's move on to the next template file.

94
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,670
We already took care of Page in our previous lesson screenshot.

95
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,200
PNG doesn't apply here.

96
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,170
So next, let's jump into single event.

97
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,150
And what's nice here is that this screen doesn't need any custom text.

98
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,160
It can just use the intelligent defaults that our function will work with.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,210
So right above this in the P block, let's call page banner.

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,770
We don't need to give it any arguments and then we can delete this div.

101
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,420
Let's save that and test it out on the front end.

102
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,310
So that was a single event.

103
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,030
So if I click on the New Year, 2016 looks good.

104
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,280
And just to prove to ourselves that our function is working properly, why don't we go back to the events

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,150
home and I'm going to edit Poetry Day.

106
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,850
So click on Poetry Day and I'm going to edit this post to give it a custom background image as well

107
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:38,860
as a subtitle value so we can just use this edit event up here in the top menu for the subtitle down

108
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,220
here.

109
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,090
Let's just say the greatest day of the year.

110
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,060
And for the background image, let me upload a file.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,410
I have a photo of a notebook that I think makes sense for Poetry Day.

112
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,010
Click select image down here and then let's go ahead and update this post, let's use the permalink

113
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,850
here to jump back to the front end and perfect.

114
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,080
Here we see the subtitle.

115
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,880
And in the background we have that notebook photo so we can rest assured that our function is doing

116
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
its job no matter where we call it from.

117
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,260
Let's move on to the next template file, which is a single professor.

118
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,550
Looks like we already set that up in the previous lesson.

119
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,230
So let's jump into a single program.

120
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:37,080
And this screen doesn't need any custom title or subtitle so we can literally just call our page banner

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,730
function.

122
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:44,100
No arguments, need it and then delete this div save it.

123
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,420
Let's give it a quick test.

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,820
Programs click on to a single program like Buyology Perfect and onto the next and final template file,

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,760
which is single dot p right.

126
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,190
This controls individual blog posts.

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,190
So blog posts don't need anything special.

128
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,850
So we can just call our page banner function without any arguments and delete that div.

129
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:18,790
Give it a save, let's go test it out blog, click on our first blog post and it works and that's going

130
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,860
to bring this lesson to a close.

131
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,600
In our next lesson, I want to show you another tool that can greatly reduce duplicate code in our project.

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,520
We're going to learn about a function named git template part, and it has the potential to make our

133
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,310
code so much cleaner.

134
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,510
So that's the plan for the next lesson.

135
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,880
But looking ahead, beyond that, I want to keep you hyped so you can keep steamrolling through the

136
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,890
entire course.

137
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,380
So just a sneak peek after our next lesson, we are going to create a new post type for campuses.

138
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,530
Campuses should be a lot of fun.

139
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:59,380
We are going to use custom fields in order to create a pin on a Google map for each of our campuses.

140
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,390
So that way visitors of our site will be presented with an interactive map that they can pinch, zoom

141
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,820
and scroll around and see pins of all of our campus locations and to get you really hyped.

142
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,570
Even beyond campuses, we've still got live search results powered by Ajax and the new rest API.

143
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,170
Right.

144
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,570
We've got the JavaScript aspect to cover still.

145
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,920
And after that, we're going to learn about user roles, user permissions.

146
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Long story short, we've still got a ton of good stuff to cover.

147
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,960
And I want you to stay excited.

148
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,480
I'll admit that not all of the sections in the course so far have been riveting or completely exciting.

149
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,370
But at this point in the course, you and I now speak the same language.

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,370
We've laid out a rock solid foundation of working with the basic components of WordPress development.

151
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,900
