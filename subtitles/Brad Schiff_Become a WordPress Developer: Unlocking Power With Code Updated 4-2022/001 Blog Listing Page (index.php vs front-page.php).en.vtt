00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.110
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.960
In this lesson, we will begin building the blog aspect of our Web site.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.390
Without further ado, let's dive right in.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.770
So you know that by default out of the box, WordPress makes your home page a generic blog listing.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.310
Right.

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.160
It displays all of your most recent blog posts.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.440
However, in the theme that you and I are currently building, that's not the case.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.160
Right.

9
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.130
We've implemented a custom home page template.

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.220
So in our case, if we go up to the address bar, what I'm trying to say is we don't want the root of

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.180
our domain or the home page of our Web site to be a blog listing.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.340
Instead, if I add on maybe slash blog, we would want a you around like this to be the generic blog

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.810
listing on our Web site.

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.660
So right now, let me show you how to set that up.

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.040
Let's begin by jumping into the WordPress admen.

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.770
And what we want to do is create two new pages.

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.110
So pages add new for this first new page.

18
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.240
Let's name it home and we can leave the body area completely blank.

19
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520
Go ahead and save or publish.

20
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.340
And then let's create a second new page.

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.780
So add new again.

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.000
And let's name this page blog.

23
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.900
And again, we can leave the body area blank.

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.340
Go ahead and publish.

25
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.860
And now this is where things get interesting.

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.860
If you look in your WordPress settings menu towards the bottom of the sidebar, within this settings

27
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.040
pop out menu, click on the reading option.

28
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.820
Now, this very first setting is the one that we're interested in.

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.800
This is where you tell WordPress what your front page or your home page should display.

30
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.610
Now, by default, it's set to your latest posts.

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.740
But instead, we can click this option that reads a static page.

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.470
And now we can manually set our front page and a blog posts page.

33
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.440
So let's use these menus and you can choose from any page that you've created so far.

34
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.590
So let's set the front page to the home page that we just created a moment ago.

35
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.250
And then let's set the posts page to the blog page we created just a moment ago.

36
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.570
Cool.

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.270
Let's go ahead and save our changes down at the bottom here.

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.010
And now, if I go back to the home page of my Web site and refresh, we see that new page we created

39
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.060
just a moment ago named Home.

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.410
And on the other hand, if we go up into the address bar and go to slash blog, the slug for that blog

41
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.480
page that we created just a moment ago is being treated as our generic blog screen.

42
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.600
Now, this is a little bit confusing at the moment because this looks like our home page template.

43
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.910
Right?

44
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.530
And it really is.

45
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.220
And that's because we have all of our home page code in our theme folders, index, dot, p, HP file.

46
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.900
So if things aren't making a lot of sense at this very moment, that's OK.

47
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.030
But let's do something right now that I think will make everything fall into place mentally in our minds.

48
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.090
So here's what I want you to do in your theme folder.

49
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.780
Jump into index dot BHP.

50
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.400
And I want you to copy every line of code in this file into your clipboard.

51
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.970
So to select everything you can press command A or control A and then just copy it into your clipboard.

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.770
And what I want to do now is create a brand new file in our theme folder.

53
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.250
So new file in the root of the theme folder.

54
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.800
And I want to name this new file.

55
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.110
Front dash page dot p HP.

56
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.050
Now, within this brand new front dash page, dot, BHP file.

57
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.800
Go ahead and paste in your clipboard and then save.

58
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.340
Cool.

59
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.320
So we've just created basically a duplicate copy of our index stop BHP file.

60
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.500
And this front page template is what will actually be used for our home page.

61
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.250
Whereas our older index dot BHP file will now be used to power the generic blog listing screen.

62
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.390
So back in index dot BHP, we can just delete everything.

63
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.940
And just as a test, let's say this is the generic blog listing screen template.

64
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.470
It doesn't matter what we say.

65
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.480
Let's just write a little message and save.

66
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.630
So now if we refresh the root of our domain, just our home page, we see our home page.

67
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.880
And this is being powered by front page dot BHP.

68
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.380
If we go up into the address bar and go to slash blog.

69
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.200
This is being powered by Index Stoppie HP.

70
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.330
So let's jump into that file in our text editor.

71
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.980
Let's delete this test message.

72
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.340
And we always want to begin by jumping into BHP.

73
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.240
And why don't we kick things off by including our header.

74
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.530
Right.

75
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.680
Our universal header.

76
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.050
So get header.

77
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.110
And let's also include the universal footer.

78
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.060
So get footer.

79
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.750
And just those two lines will give us this.

80
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.800
And now we just need to add in a bit of meat and potatoes between the header and footer.

81
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.430
Let's begin by adding a banner up at the top of the page.

82
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.090
And instead of manually typing out the H t Amelle to create a banner area, what we can do is just jump

83
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.000
into our page dot BHP file.

84
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.820
And the first bit of H email that we see on this page is a div with a class of page banner.

85
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.200
So why don't we just copy that div Indore clipboard and then back in our index dot BHP file.

86
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.980
In between the header and footer, let's drop out of p p on this line and then drop into P HP on the

87
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.090
beginning of this line.

88
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.870
So then we can have each TMF where the cursor is right now and then just paste in the clipboard.

89
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.590
And then let's edit the text that this large H1 headline outputs.

90
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.580
So within the H1 tags, let's delete this dynamic BHP.

91
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.190
And instead, let's just hard code, a bit of text that reads welcome to our blog.

92
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.140
And then this subtitled text also doesn't need to be dynamic.

93
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.470
So we can delete this place holder text.

94
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.700
And why don't we say keep up with our latest news.

95
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:21.170
Cool.

96
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.340
So let's check that out.

97
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.320
Looks good next.

98
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.560
Let's begin outputting the blog posts right about here.

99
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.930
Now back in our text editor, if we include a little bit of H.T. email right after this.

100
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.780
Dave, hello.

101
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.920
You'll notice that it's aligned to the very left edge of the screen.

102
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.640
And that's not what we want, right?

103
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.260
We want our content to sort of live in the centered portion of the page.

104
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.590
So this is just an H t Amelle and CSF matter.

105
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.860
It has nothing to do with P, HP or WordPress.

106
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.720
So what we want to do is create a container div that our blog posts can live in.

107
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.390
And the job of this div is to center the content as well as add a bit of vertical spacing.

108
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.910
Now I could tell you the exact class names to add to this div, but that would be a lot of typing.

109
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.780
Instead you can just jump into the page DCPI, HP file and right below the page banner div.

110
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.150
You'll notice a div with a class of container container narrow and page section.

111
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:27.060
Now instead of typing all of this out, why don't we just copy this opening div tag into our clipboard.

112
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.430
And then back in index stop BHP, let's just replace our opening div tag and paste that in.

113
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.510
Cool.

114
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.470
So now within this div, if we add a little bit of text that says hello.

115
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.010
Perfect.

116
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.890
So now, instead of just outputting the word hello, let's begin outputting actual blog posts.

117
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:54.340
So delete the hello and open up BHP and within BHP.

118
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.350
Let's begin with a while loop.

119
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:05.170
So while parentheses curly brackets and we're using a while loop because we want to do something once

120
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.940
for each blog post.

121
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.210
So within these parentheses, we need to answer the question, how many times should this loop run?

122
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.530
So let's say keep looping as long as the following is true.

123
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.530
Have posts.

124
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.910
And that's a function.

125
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.830
So give it its own parentheses.

126
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:24.890
OK.

127
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.900
Then within the curly brackets, what do we want to do for each post?

128
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:36.310
Well, we always want to begin by calling a function named the Post because that will get the appropriate

129
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.990
data ready for each post.

130
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.110
And now from here, we are free to do whatever we want.

131
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.030
So I'm going to drop out of P HP so I can type in a bit of each team at all.

132
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.450
So let's be sure to enter back into BHP on this line to close out the while loop curly bracket.

133
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.290
So then between those two lines, we can write each team out.

134
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.080
Let's begin by creating a div.

135
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.460
And let's give it a class of post item.

136
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:09.400
This class will create a border and a bit of vertical space in between each individual post.

137
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.000
OK.

138
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.620
And within this div, let's output a headline with the title for each post.

139
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.350
So why don't we create a heading level two.

140
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.320
And we want this title to be clickable.

141
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.550
Right.

142
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.220
We want it to be a link that takes you to only that one post.

143
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.650
So let's open up in a tag to make it a link, given an H.

144
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.930
Dreft value of just a hash tag placeholder for now.

145
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.970
But within the link, the text that we want people to see is the title.

146
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.140
So let's go into BHP and to output the title.

147
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.320
You just run the the title function.

148
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.070
OK.

149
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.730
And then for the H RF value instead of the place holder hash tag.

150
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.940
Let's go into P HP and use the function named the permanently.

151
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.480
And why don't we go ahead and save this.

152
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.550
And see what it looks like now instead of only displaying a headline link.

153
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.350
I think we should also show maybe the author and date that the blog post was published.

154
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.050
And a quick excerpt from the body content.

155
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.480
So back in our text editor underneath this heading level two, why don't we create a new div that has

156
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.860
a class of Medda box that has nothing to do with P, HP or WordPress?

157
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.540
It's just a CSF class that I created for us.

158
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.520
That will make things look nice.

159
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.150
And within that meta box div.

160
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.080
Let's create a paragraph.

161
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.410
And why don't we say posted by.

162
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.270
And then this would be the author name.

163
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.950
For now you can just hard code your name, but in just a few moments I'll show you how to make that

164
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.640
flexible and pull from real WordPress author data.

165
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.590
So posted by a name on and then a date.

166
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.910
Right.

167
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.340
The date that it was posted.

168
00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.100
So for now I will just hard code that to June 8th of 2017.

169
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.760
I'll show you how to make the date real and dynamic in just a moment.

170
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.910
And then let's say in what category it was posted in.

171
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.280
So maybe in news.

172
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.730
And again, we'll make this category dynamic in just a moment.

173
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.250
OK.

174
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.160
Now, below this metabolics div.

175
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:21.520
Why don't we create another div with a class of generic content?

176
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.450
Again, this is just for styling and design purposes.

177
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:33.160
And within that generic content div, let's drop into P hp and let's output either the content or an

178
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.850
excerpt.

179
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.320
So you could say the content and that would give you the full body field.

180
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.570
Or if you just want to show a little bit.

181
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.990
You can say the excerpt.

182
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.540
Let's save this and see what it looks like on the front end.

183
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.510
Now I'm noticing that I'm not seeing the metal box styling for this paragraph that I was hoping to see.

184
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.110
So if we jump back to the text editor, this metal box div, let's change the class name to remove the

185
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.040
dash.

186
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.890
Again, that has nothing to do with P, HP or WordPress.

187
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.660
It's just a CFS issue.

188
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.260
Cool.

189
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:10.960
So we've got the post title, a little bit of info about the post and then an excerpt next.

190
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:17.020
Why don't we add a button or link below the excerpt that will take you to the full blog post or in other

191
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.060
words, the single view for that post.

192
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.650
So back in the text editor right below this excerpt.

193
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:31.900
Let's just create a paragraph and then let's create an a tag to create a link and let's say continue

194
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.620
reading.

195
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.420
OK.

196
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.960
Let's go ahead and fill out the H ref for the length.

197
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:44.200
So H RF equals drop in BHP, HP and echo out the permalink.

198
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.850
But save that, give it a test.

199
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.540
Cool.

200
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.490
So there's the continue reading link.

201
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:56.970
But if we give that element a couple of CSX classes, it will actually look like an appealing button.

202
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.550
So on that, a tag that we just created.

203
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.740
Why don't we give it a class of BGN, which is short for Button and Beatties and Dash Dash Blue.

204
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.790
Cool.

205
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:16.010
Next stop, before we go ahead and make this information real and dynamic.

206
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.800
Why don't we improve the styling of the headline?

207
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.380
It would look nice if it used a larger font.

208
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.310
And maybe we got rid of the underline.

209
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.110
So back in our text editor, here's that heading level two.

210
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.440
Let's go ahead and give it a class of headline and another class of headline.

211
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.890
Dash.

212
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.380
Dash.

213
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.030
Medium and third class of headline.

214
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.540
Dash.

215
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.260
Dash.

216
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.280
Post.

217
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.630
Dash title.

218
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.850
So if we save that cool, I think that looks a lot better next.

219
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:53.750
Let's make it so that this metabolics info is not fake and hard coded, but instead pulls in real dynamic

220
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.500
information.

221
00:13:54.830 --> 00:14:01.520
So here's that paragraph posted by the author's name on a certain date in a certain category.

222
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.330
So let's hollow out each three of those things one by one.

223
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.190
Let's start with the author's name.

224
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:14.930
So I will delete the hardcoded, Brad, and then instead let's drop into P HP and call a WordPress function

225
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.350
named.

226
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.960
The author posts Lane.

227
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.520
OK.

228
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.690
So if I save that and refresh.

229
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.340
We notice a few things.

230
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.200
So number one, now it's a link.

231
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.750
And if you click on it, it takes you to an archive of all the posts just from that one author.

232
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.520
But the other thing we notice about this link is that my name is not capitalized.

233
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.160
So in order to control how your WordPress username is being displayed here on the front end, what you

234
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.590
can do is go into the WordPress admen.

235
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:52.220
And towards the bottom of the sidebar, we see users and go ahead and click on your profile.

236
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.600
So about halfway down the screen, we see this named section.

237
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.960
Now this is your username and that cannot be changed.

238
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.050
But what I can't change is my nickname Field, so I can change that to uppercase Brad.

239
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:12.710
But once you type that, then you can change this field that says display name publicly as and now you

240
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.330
can choose your nickname instead.

241
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.490
So then if I scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the update button to save.

242
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.180
Now back on the front end of my Web site when I refresh.

243
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.530
That's the name we see.

244
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.220
All right.

245
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.750
Next, let's focus on learning how to work with real dynamic dates.

246
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.130
So back in, our text editor posted by the author on and then a day.

247
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.090
So we don't want a fake hardcoded date here.

248
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:46.010
So let's delete that and let's drop in to BHP to dynamically output the date that each post was posted

249
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.190
on.

250
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.440
So to do that, we're going to use a WordPress function named The Time.

251
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:58.310
Now, if we just go ahead and save without passing any arguments within the parentheses, we see a time

252
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.330
format that isn't very useful or intuitive to the visitors of our Web site.

253
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:09.230
So instead, what we want to do within these parentheses is we can tell WordPress how to format the

254
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.770
date.

255
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.490
So, for example, if I say quotes uppercase F.

256
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.990
That will output the month in which the Post was published.

257
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:27.510
Or instead of an F, if I say uppercase Y, that will output the year in which the post was published.

258
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.360
So you can format the date however you want.

259
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.850
So it's up to us to string together these different codes that represent either the month, year or

260
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.450
day.

261
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.680
Now you're probably thinking, how am I supposed to know these magical codes?

262
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.360
Like, how did I know that Y is the year or the uppercase F is the month?

263
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.730
Well, I don't expect you to memorize that.

264
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:56.170
Instead, if you Google for WordPress, the time one of the first results will be the word codex.

265
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:03.570
And what I do, scroll down to the parameters area and then I look for this link called Formatting Date

266
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.170
and Time.

267
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.710
This screen will show you all of the codes for formatting dates that you will ever need.

268
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.730
So if you scroll down a little bit, here is a super useful graph.

269
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.920
And if I highlight this left hand column, these are the different codes that will give you the month,

270
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.030
year or day.

271
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:27.030
So, for example, here's the uppercase F and that returns the full textual name of a month.

272
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.970
If instead you use an uppercase M, that will give you just the first three letters of the month.

273
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:33.660
Right.

274
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.850
And obviously, here is why.

275
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.330
Which gives us the year.

276
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.030
And up here are the date codes.

277
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.690
So it's up to you how you want to format the date.

278
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.590
But in my case, I want to begin with a numerical representation of the month.

279
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.000
And then I'll have a period.

280
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.150
And then I want a numerical representation of the day.

281
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.780
And then I'll end with just a two digit that represents the year.

282
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:02.220
So back in my text editor within the parentheses for the time, let's say an and then you can either

283
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.960
add a space or a dash.

284
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:04.950
I'll do a period.

285
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.790
Doesn't matter.

286
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.660
It's up to you.

287
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.850
How you want to separate the date, month and year.

288
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.160
But then J the code for the day.

289
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.350
And why is the code for the year.

290
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.070
OK.

291
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.000
So if I save that and refresh the front end of my Web site.

292
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:18.840
Cool.

293
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.520
So that's exactly what I was looking for.

294
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.280
I created these blog posts on May 12th.

295
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:23.950
All right.

296
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:29.070
Now for the final detail of this lesson, let's focus on the category that gets output.

297
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.550
So back in our text editor, instead of hard coding that to the word news, let's delete that and let's

298
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.280
drop in to BHP and call a function named Kit.

299
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.870
The category list.

300
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.660
Now, we do want to pass this an argument.

301
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:52.110
Now, if a post has multiple categories, whatever we type here is what will be separated between the

302
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.400
two category names.

303
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.860
So you could say and or ampersand.

304
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.280
But I just like to include a comma and then a space.

305
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.500
So if we save that and refresh, woops, we don't see anything.

306
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.140
And that's because I forgot my own rule when a function begins with the word Gitte.

307
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.420
That means it's not going to echo or output anything for us.

308
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.890
It's just going to return data.

309
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.680
So right before that function, let's echo it.

310
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.320
OK.

311
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.460
So this post doesn't have a category, so it just says posted in uncategorized.

312
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.890
Why don't I create a test post just so we can see everything in action for the title?

313
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.270
Maybe we won an award based in some dummy content.

314
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.830
And here's the important part.

315
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.250
Over in the sidebar, let's be sure to assign it a category.

316
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.110
So maybe add new category.

317
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.930
I will create a category named awards.

318
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:43.800
Cool.

319
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.510
So that set.

320
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.000
Let's publish and refresh the blog on my Web site.

321
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.130
We want an award posted on June 8th.

322
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.030
And in the category of awards.

323
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.650
That's it for this lesson.

324
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.700
Let's keep it rolling.

325
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.720
And I will see you in the next one.
