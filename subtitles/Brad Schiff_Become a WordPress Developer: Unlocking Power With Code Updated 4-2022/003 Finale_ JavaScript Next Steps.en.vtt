Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.410
This challenge is a bit unique.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.130
It's not directly related to WordPress, nor is it something that you can finish within an hour or so.

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.070
This is more of a big picture next step, or I guess we could call it a career challenge.

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.800
But nevertheless, I am challenging you to learn a modern JavaScript library or framework throughout

6
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.610
this course.

7
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.190
We used the J Query Library for all of our front end JavaScript code.

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.030
Now, while it's true that J query is a library, it's no longer the cool kid on the block and most

9
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.930
people would not consider it an ultra modern library.

10
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.650
So if you want to become as valuable as possible as a developer and you want to have a skill set that's

11
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.800
going to attract all sorts of opportunities into your life.

12
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.180
I really want to point you in the direction of learning a more modern, albeit opinionated library or

13
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.960
framework.

14
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.750
Now, that word opinionated is key here because you might be scratching your head and saying, Brad,

15
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.290
if geo query is not super modern and super trendy, why did you bother teaching it to us in this course?

16
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.550
Well, the answer is simple, J.

17
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.810
Query is the least opinionated solution.

18
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.250
I'm not saying it's not opinionated at all, just that it's way less opinionated than the modern trending

19
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.950
libraries.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.100
I'm about to show you in just a moment from now.

21
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.360
What I mean by this is, gee, query doesn't really have an all encompassing philosophy or way of looking

22
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.170
at the world.

23
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.550
J.

24
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.220
Query is really just an abstraction layer of regular JavaScript that makes it easier to interact with

25
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.880
the DOM.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.630
And this is why I chose J.

27
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.710
Query in this course, because I didn't want to force an opinion on you doing things.

28
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.080
The J.

29
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.930
Query Way is very similar to writing plain regular JavaScript.

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.580
Right.

31
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.640
We were still doing everything manually, step by step, responding to click events, updating the H

32
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.570
t Amelle for an element, adding a class or removing a class.

33
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.800
So on and so forth.

34
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.180
We were making all of our own decisions and doing whatever we wanted.

35
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.590
J.

36
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.900
Query just made the code a little bit easier to write.

37
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.050
An analogy I like to use is that J.

38
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.360
Query is like a Swiss Army knife.

39
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.350
It can do all sorts of different things and it's very convenient.

40
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.620
So for example, if you were going to be stranded on an island and you could only take one tool with

41
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.260
you, maybe you would take a Swiss Army knife.

42
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.950
However, what if you were not going to be stuck on an island?

43
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.810
What if you were in the middle of a field and someone gave you the task of digging a hole?

44
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.350
In that case, it would be silly to choose the Swiss Army knife.

45
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.850
Right.

46
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.590
Forget about that.

47
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.630
Give me a shovel.

48
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.970
I want to use the right tool for the job.

49
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.300
So in situations where you've got really interactive user interfaces, where you are asynchronously,

50
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.090
receiving data from the server and then sending data back to the server and then needing to update your

51
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.590
interface on the fly.

52
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.920
If your Web site's got a lot of that going on, maybe it doesn't make sense to choose the less opinionated

53
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.000
Swiss army knife.

54
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.660
Probably makes more sense to choose an opinionated shovel.

55
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.310
And in this metaphore, there are really three shovels to choose from.

56
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.880
The first is a library named React.

57
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.200
The second is angular and the third is view.

58
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.830
There are way more than just these three, but almost everyone agrees.

59
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.160
These are the big popular three now while.

60
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.300
Query was built to be able to do anything and everything.

61
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.200
And its roots are from way back when the Web was in a different place.

62
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.850
These three libraries react angular and view.

63
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.440
They were built from the ground up to power single page applications, and they can really help keep

64
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.760
your data in sync with what the user sees visually on the screen.

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.300
So, for example, remember when we built the My Notes feature on our WordPress site, we had that one

66
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.350
single screen where you could view all of your notes, create a brand new note, edit and note or delete

67
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.700
a note.

68
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.470
Well, that situation is practically begging for one of these solutions.

69
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.740
But who am I to tell you which one to use?

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.500
I feel like choosing one of these would be like telling you to root for either the Lakers or the Celltex

71
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.830
or that you should be a cat person or a dog person.

72
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.550
Right.

73
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.340
I'm not going to force that opinion on you so there's no right or wrong answer.

74
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.380
But it's up to you to research these three solutions and see which one feels right to you.

75
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:59.110
For the record, personally, I prefer react and I actually have an entirely separate fifteen hour course

76
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.030
dedicated to learning react.

77
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.970
It really needs its own separate course, because these new frameworks like react and angular in view,

78
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.740
they are all fairly opinionated and have their own unique way of looking at the world.

79
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.780
And it takes a good amount of time just to wrap your head around how to use one of these tools.

80
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.330
But having said that, they would all pare very nicely with the WordPress back end anyways.

81
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.690
That's going to bring this video to a close.

82
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:35.510
In summary, I challenge you to learn more about one of the big three tools react angular or view.

83
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:42.230
And not only will that bring this challenge video to a close, but that will bring this entire course

84
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.810
to a close if you made it this far.

85
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.150
I want to give you a huge thank you and congratulations for working through the course.

86
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.910
I know that it was a long journey and a big time investment, but I think the skills and knowledge that

87
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.130
you have gained were definitely worth it.

88
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.660
I hope you feel the same.

89
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.710
So until the next time we meet.

90
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.660
And of course, I wish you the best of luck and keep on coding.
