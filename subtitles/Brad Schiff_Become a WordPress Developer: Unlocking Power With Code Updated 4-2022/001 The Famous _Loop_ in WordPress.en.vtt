00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.470
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:11.630
In this lesson, we will learn about the famous loop in WordPress before we worry about what that means.

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.150
Let's first give ourselves a goal.

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.530
So let's imagine that on the home page of our Web site, we want to output our most recent blog posts.

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.800
Now, before we dig into any code, let's first make sure that we have more than one blog post to work

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.220
with.

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.490
So let's jump over to our admen dashboard and from the sidebar, let's click on posts.

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.450
So at the moment, I just have the one single Hello World demo post.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.380
But let's go ahead and create a few dummy posts right now just so we have multiple posts to work with.

10
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.050
So for the title, let's just say test post and then you can just type out a bit of gibberish or paste

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.670
in some law.

12
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.270
MIP some.

13
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.320
Doesn't matter.

14
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.480
But go ahead and click publish.

15
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.910
And why don't we create at least one more dummy post, so add new?

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.820
I will call it its second test post, add a bit of dummy content and go ahead and publish again.

17
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.390
OK, so now if I click on posts from the Admon sidebar, you can see that I have three posts.

18
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.970
So now we can go ahead and learn how to output those blog posts onto our home page here.

19
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.440
Let's go ahead and jump over to our text ed program.

20
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.560
And in our theme folders index stop BHP file.

21
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
Let's delete all of this test code from our previous lesson.

22
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.590
OK, so we've got a clean slate.

23
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.230
Let's go ahead and jump into P BHP mode.

24
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.860
And then let's create a while loop.

25
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.470
OK.

26
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.580
So the word while and then a pair of parentheses and then right after that, a pair of curly brackets.

27
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.710
OK.

28
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990
So this is our empty skeleton of a while loop.

29
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.380
And now remember, in our previous lesson, we had to do all sorts of things like create a count variable

30
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.010
and manually increment that count and then come up with our own logic.

31
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.030
Like if count is less than a certain number.

32
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.170
Well, this time around, we don't have to do any of that.

33
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670
We are no longer trying to work with hypothetical lists of names.

34
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360
Now we are trying to work with real WordPress content.

35
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.820
And WordPress gives us the exact tools and functions to do that without breaking a sweat.

36
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.090
So within the while, loop parentheses here, all we need to do is use a special WordPress function

37
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.560
named have underscore posts.

38
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.670
And remember to call or run a function.

39
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.750
You include a pair of parentheses.

40
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.240
So forget about programming.

41
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.300
This almost makes sense just from an everyday English standpoint.

42
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.630
How many times do we want to repeat or run this loop?

43
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.050
Well, keep looping as long as or while we still have posts to loop through.

44
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.820
OK.

45
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.990
And then within the curly brackets, what do we want to do?

46
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.990
Once for each blog post.

47
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.640
Well, before we try to output the title or the content of a post.

48
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.170
First we need to call a WordPress function named the Underscore Post.

49
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.200
This is a WordPress function that we can call and leverage, and it does several important things for

50
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.560
us.

51
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.310
Remember in our previous lesson, we had that count variable.

52
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.730
Well, we don't need to do that now because this the post function will keep track of which post we

53
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.990
are currently working with.

54
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.520
So each time our While Loop runs this, the post function will tell WordPress to get all of the relevant

55
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300
information about the next post ready for us to use.

56
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.810
So check this out right after this.

57
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.660
The Post.

58
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.010
And then a semicolon.

59
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.830
Why don't we drop out of P HP and then on this line where we are closing the curly bracket.

60
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.560
Let's drop back into BHP.

61
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.620
And what this does is now in between those two lines where my cursor is now, we are still within the

62
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.400
while loop.

63
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.010
But now we are in each TMF mode.

64
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.320
So let's go ahead and create a heading level to HDMI element.

65
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.270
And inside the headline, if I say hello and then save this and refresh, we see three hello's because

66
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.550
we have three blog posts.

67
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.880
Now, obviously, it's not very useful to just say hello.

68
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.680
Instead, we probably want to output the title of each blog post.

69
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.420
Now watch how easy this is.

70
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.070
In between the headline, Let's drop into P HP and now we can use a WordPress function that is conveniently

71
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.550
named the underscore title.

72
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.790
OK, so we just call this function.

73
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.830
Let's save this and refresh.

74
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.000
Cool.

75
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.130
We've got the title for each post.

76
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.650
Next, let's try to output the body content for each post right below the title.

77
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.320
So back in our code underneath this H two, let's just drop down to a new line and I want to call a

78
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.370
P HP function.

79
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.560
So let's go back into BHP mode, and you might be able to guess the name of the function that we want

80
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.950
to run.

81
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.990
Its name is the underscore content semicolon.

82
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.420
OK.

83
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.330
And then maybe right below this line.

84
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.890
Why don't we add an H team out horizontal rule just to create some sort of visual separation between

85
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.620
each of the three posts in the real world?

86
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.020
We would use CSX to accomplish that.

87
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.090
But this is a quick and dirty solution.

88
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.620
So let's save this.

89
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.100
Looks good.

90
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.290
Let's give ourselves another goal.

91
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.070
Let's imagine that whenever we click on one of the headlines, we want to be taken to a detailed screen

92
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.220
for just that one single particular post.

93
00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.300
So if we want to turn the headlines into links, if you've ever worked with each TMF before, you know

94
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.500
that we just want to wrap this content here in a tax.

95
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.040
OK.

96
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.240
So right before the title, let's open up in each TEFL a tag and then right after the title gets output,

97
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.020
let's close that a tag.

98
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.990
OK.

99
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.250
And then in H.T. Amelle, you give the opening a tag, an attribute named eight ref.

100
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.690
And this tells the Web browser where it should go when someone clicks on the link.

101
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.040
So the question becomes, what do we want to type within these quotes?

102
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.950
What you are l do we want to send the visitor to?

103
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.520
Well, you might have guessed it.

104
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.230
But WordPress has a function that will output the perfect.

105
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.190
You are all here.

106
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:49.130
So within the quotes, let's drop in to BHP and then let's call a function named the underscore perm

107
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.740
as in permanent Purnima Link parentheses, because we're calling the function.

108
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.330
OK.

109
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.020
Let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

110
00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.370
Cool.

111
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.290
So the headlines look like links.

112
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.530
And if I click on this first one, I'm taken to a screen with only that one single post.

113
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.070
And more importantly, noticed the U.

114
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.000
RL up here in the address bar.

115
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.720
WordPress automatically knows what data to query from the database based on the you RL that we visit.

116
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.350
Right.

117
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.250
So this is the permalink or slug for second blog post.

118
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.450
So WordPress knows to fetch or query just that post from its database back on the home page when we

119
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.500
are simply at fictional university dot dev.

120
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:41.040
In this case, by default, WordPress will query or fetch your ten most recent posts when you're on

121
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.000
the home page.

122
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.670
But if we go to one of these detail screens.

123
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.230
For just a single blog post, WordPress will see the permalink or slug in the U.

124
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.850
RL.

125
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.830
It will only fetch your query that one post.

126
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.910
And that way when we try to loop over all of the current posts.

127
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.390
There will only be one single post to loop through.

128
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.640
OK, let's give ourselves another goal.

129
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.940
Now that we are on this single detail screen for just one post, for example, it doesn't make much

130
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.960
sense for this headline to still be a link, right?

131
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.440
Because we are already on the detail screen for this post.

132
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.510
There's no reason to click this again.

133
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.570
So the question becomes, how do we let that remain a link while we are on the home page?

134
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.890
While removing the link once we get to a single detail page.

135
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.480
Well, check this out.

136
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.750
Back in our text editor, I want you to create a brand new file in our theme folder.

137
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.070
We need to give the new file a very specific name.

138
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:51.860
It needs to be exactly single dot p HP presenter and within the new file.

139
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.570
Let's just type out a bit of random dummy text like hello, one, two, three.

140
00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:02.720
And if we save this and refresh here, we see that dummy text when we are on the U.

141
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.240
RL for a single post.

142
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.960
But if we go back to our home page, we see that it is still powered by index stop p HP.

143
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.560
So what this means is that depending on the current, you are l WordPress will be on the lookout for

144
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.230
different file names in our theme folder.

145
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.320
So our home page uses index stop BHP.

146
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.500
But then if we click on one of these single posts, WordPress will look within our theme folder for

147
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.870
a file specifically named Single Dot p HP.

148
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.320
If that file doesn't exist, then WordPress will use index dot BHP as a universal default fallback.

149
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:42.980
OK.

150
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.130
But having said all of that, let's get back to the task at hand.

151
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.770
Remember, on this screen, we just want to show the blog post title and the content, but we don't

152
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.370
want the title to be a link like it is on the home page.

153
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.960
So here's what we can do.

154
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.940
Back in our text editor, let's go back into our index dot BHP file and let's select and copy the entire

155
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.800
contents into our clipboard.

156
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:14.720
And then let's go back into singled out BHP and let's delete this dummy text and then paste in our clipboard.

157
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.160
And now let's simply remove the tags that surround the title.

158
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.590
So let's delete the closing tag and let's delete the opening tag here.

159
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.130
And now let's go ahead and save and refresh.

160
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.450
Cool.

161
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.660
So now on the home page, each headline is a link.

162
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.180
But then once you click on one of those, since you're already on the detail screen, there's no need

163
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.740
for the headline to be a link.

164
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.460
Cool.

165
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:46.940
And we can adjust our singled out BHP file further to maybe remove this horizontal rule line because

166
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.910
there's no need to separate the content from anything below it.

167
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.310
So back in our text editor, let's delete that H.R. element.

168
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.200
Perfect.

169
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:57.800
OK.

170
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.140
Now, at this point, let's change gears.

171
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:06.620
So far in this lesson, we've been working with posts, but WordPress also has pages.

172
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.120
So, for example, let's jump back into the WordPress admen dashboard.

173
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.170
And in the left hand sidebar, let's click on pages and we could try to work with the sample page.

174
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.420
But just to make sure everyone's on the same page, why don't we use the add new button to create a

175
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.290
new page?

176
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.290
Let's give it a dummy title like test page one, two, three.

177
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.730
And then for the content, let's just include a bit of dummy lorem ipsum text.

178
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.320
Then go ahead and publish or save the page.

179
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:37.110
OK.

180
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.430
And now you'll notice this permalink here.

181
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.580
You can always click this to preview the page.

182
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.250
Cool.

183
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.780
So that takes me to a screen with only the content for that one page.

184
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.740
And if we look in that you are Albar, we can see the slug for that page.

185
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.490
However, even though this screen only displays information for that one single page, we see that the

186
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:06.580
headline is still a link, which means that this you órale and this screen is being powered by index

187
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.560
dot BHP instead of single dot p HP.

188
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:19.920
And that's because WordPress only uses the single dot BHP file for individual posts for individual pages.

189
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.470
WordPress looks in our theme folder for a file named Page Dot p HP.

190
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.170
So why don't we go and create that file right now?

191
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.470
So back in our theme folder, let's create a new file.

192
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.910
Let's name it.

193
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.150
Page dot p HP.

194
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.280
And instead of typing out the loop code again, why don't we just go into single dot p HP?

195
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.850
Copy all of this into our clipboard and then paste that into the new page dot BHB.

196
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.090
And just to prove to ourselves that this is indeed the file being used, maybe right above this heading

197
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.810
level two.

198
00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.110
Why don't we create a heading level one that says this is a page, not a post.

199
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.680
Let's save this refresh.

200
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.830
Cool.

201
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.840
So we see this, which proves that we're using page dot p HP.

202
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.860
Here's the title and the content.

203
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.150
If we go back to just fictional university dot dev home page.

204
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.320
This is powered by index stop HP.

205
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.240
And if we click on one of the blog posts.

206
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.920
This screen is powered by single dot p HP.

207
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:32.400
So the important concept for this lesson is that depending on the You Aurélio visit, WordPress is going

208
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.470
to use different files in your theme folder to control what you see on the screen here.

209
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:44.550
And even though we have these different files like Page Index and single, they all have one very important

210
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:51.690
thing in common, and that is that they all use the famous loop, which is this general pattern of doing

211
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.380
something once for each item in a collection.

212
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.590
Even if that collection only has one item in it.

213
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:59.170
OK.

214
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.060
But in the WordPress universe, the loop is a famous term.

215
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.210
Any WordPress developer will know what you're talking about.

216
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.970
If you mention the loop, the loop is at the heart and soul of WordPress, and it's something that we

217
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.880
will use again and again throughout this course.

218
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.930
Now, that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

219
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:25.260
In our next lesson, we will learn how to create a global or universal header and footer.

220
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.730
Should be a lot of fun.

221
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.840
Let's keep it rolling.

222
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.010
And I will see you then.
