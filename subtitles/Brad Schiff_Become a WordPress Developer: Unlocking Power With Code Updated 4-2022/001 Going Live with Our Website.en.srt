1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:09,140
Hello, everyone, at this point in the course, our website is complete, there are no additional features

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,000
that we need to program or code.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,930
However, even though our programming work is complete, this course would not be complete if we didn't

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:26,180
also learn how to actually copy or move or push our WordPress website up onto a real Web host so that

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,670
the entire world can view it right.

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,110
Because as of this moment, our site only exists on our local dev environment and we are the only ones

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,860
that can view it.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:46,760
Now the act of copying or moving or pushing a website up onto the web is commonly referred to as deploying

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,250
and learning how to deploy.

10
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,680
Our website is exactly what we're going to cover in this section of the course.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,080
We're actually going to cover two different strategies for deploying our site.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,190
Now, big picture.

13
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,130
There are way more than just two ways of doing this.

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,170
There are probably hundreds of different ways of moving your website.

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,920
But in my opinion, these are two of the best ways of doing it.

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,840
So we will review what these two paths are.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:21,710
We will cover the pros and cons of each path and also go over a few factors that will help you decide

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,030
which path is right for you.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,650
However, before we discuss those two paths, I do want to address the topic of Web hosting.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,990
Obviously, in order to practice deploying a website onto the web, you need a Web host to push it,

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,320
too.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,590
And usually a Web hosting plan costs money.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,560
So if you don't already have a Web hosting plan and you don't feel like spending money on one right

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,640
now just to practice deployment, I'd recommend skipping this chapter and rest assured that if you ever

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,020
do sign up for hosting in the future, you can always come back to this chapter.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,740
It'll be here waiting for you when you're ready.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,290
If you're looking for advice on which Web hosting company to choose a good place to start is always

28
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,800
the official WordPress dawg hosting page.

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,380
So from the official site, it's usually the final link in the top navigation menu.

30
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,120
Now, you don't have to go with one of these three that they recommend, but what I like to do is just

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,670
go to YouTube and search for one of these host names, followed by the word review.

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,660
That way you can hear real world opinions from real world people about the pros and cons of a particular

33
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,700
hosting company, how fast or slow they are, how their customer service is, so on and so forth.

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,900
Also, if a review isn't favorable, they might suggest a different hosting company entirely.

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,820
And then you can look into that company.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,060
Ultimately, you just need to perform a bit of your own consumer research and deciding which company

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,680
to give your business to is outside the scope of this course.

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,650
Now, if you do already have a Web hosting plan and you want to follow along with this deployment chapter,

39
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,650
I'd recommend creating a subdomain such as practice dot your domain dot com or testing your domain dot

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,040
com.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,050
And that way you can have a playground sandbox to experiment with for this chapter.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,140
And you don't have to worry about accidentally erasing or messing up your existing real site if you

43
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,770
have one.

44
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,320
Now, in terms of creating subdomains or databases or FTP users, unfortunately, I can't walk through

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,740
all of that with you step by step because every hosting company is different and has a different user

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,210
interface or control panel.

47
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:48,770
So we're primarily going to focus on the WordPress specific details in this chapter and the generic

48
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,240
Web host actions.

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,670
Those will require you to do a bit of your own research on your particular hosting company.

50
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,750
OK, having said all of that about hosting, now, let's actually discuss the two paths of moving or

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,060
deploying a site that we're going to cover.

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:13,010
So let's say there's a path A and Path B, path A is simple and Path B is a bit more advanced.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,990
So which one is right for you?

54
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,920
While they each have their own pros and cons path A is as simple as installing a free plug in within

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,870
our local dev WordPress site and this plug in bundles everything up for us.

56
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,640
So it takes a copy of our database and it also bundles up all of our files.

57
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:39,680
Right, our access JavaScript files and it bundles all of this up into one convenient export file.

58
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,230
So then all you need to do is import that file within another WordPress installation that you want to

59
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,210
copy or move your website, too.

60
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,210
So what are the pros and cons?

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,450
Well, the first advantage is that this path is super easy.

62
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,700
There's no other prerequisite knowledge.

63
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,620
So anyone can go with Pathé.

64
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,370
In addition to being simple, it's also very fast.

65
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,970
Once you're familiar with this plugin, you can move or copy a website, I would say within five to

66
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,760
10 minutes.

67
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,680
OK, now the con or the drawback is that making future updates to your website files can be a bit annoying.

68
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,970
Don't worry about the details of Pathé for now, because in our very next lesson, I'm going to walk

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,770
through Pathé with you step by step.

70
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,900
OK, now let's describe Path B as well as its pros and cons.

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,390
So Path B is a bit more advanced and it takes advantage of the git version control system.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,870
Now we are not going to learn get itself in this course because that's completely outside of our scope.

73
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,360
That would be a course in and of itself.

74
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,500
So if you've never used Git before or if you've never heard of Git, you will want to go with Path A

75
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,070
and then if in the future you do learn git, then you can always circle back to this course and try

76
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,120
out path B..

77
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,730
OK, so moving on, what exactly is Path B and what are the pros and cons?

78
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,380
The big advantage is that making updates to your live website files is super easy.

79
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,240
Whenever you code a new feature or make any changes to your files within your local dev environment

80
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:22,460
and then commit and push those changes up to your GitHub or BitBucket repository.

81
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,930
Well, those updated files get automatically uploaded to your Web host server for you.

82
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,780
And this is really luxurious.

83
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,570
It's like the Rolls Royce of deployment setups because now you don't need to bother with FTP programs

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,750
or file managers or mentally keeping track of which files you've changed and then need to upload to

85
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,620
your Web host.

86
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
You don't need to do any of that.

87
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,150
You literally just push your progress up to your git repository like you would anyways.

88
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,760
Only now those updates get automatically synched and uploaded to your live site.

89
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,980
Now, this might not sound like a big deal, but trust me, it's a dream come true.

90
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
So what are the cons or drawbacks to Path B?

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,200
Well, number one is that you need to be familiar with the basics of git and not everyone is.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,270
So Path B is not for everyone.

93
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,660
That's the first drawback.

94
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,100
The other con is the initial set up time.

95
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,910
There is a bit of a time investment up front for the first one time setup.

96
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,110
After that, it's smooth as silk and super quick.

97
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,840
But there is a tiny time investment up front, whereas with Path A you can be up and rolling within

98
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,100
five to 10 minutes.

99
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,040
OK, so that's an overview of Path A and Path B, we're going to walk through each of them in detail

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
in future videos.

101
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,470
But right now you're likely trying to decide which path is right for you.

102
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,320
Well, in addition to the git factor, right.

103
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
If you're not familiar with Git, you should probably choose Path A.

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,260
In addition to that factor, I will give you another question, which is how often do you think you'll

105
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,320
need to make updates to your site files?

106
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,140
So once your website is up on the Web for the entire world to view, how often will you need to update

107
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,800
the code?

108
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,410
If you think that you'll only need to update the files maybe once or twice a year, I would go with

109
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,390
Path A not only because it's simple, but also because it's really fast.

110
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Path B is really only worth the extra effort if you think you're going to be making somewhat regular

111
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,730
or frequent updates to the code files of your live website.

112
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,140
Now, you don't need to make a decision.

113
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,560
You can follow along with both paths if you want to.

114
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,470
Beginning in the next video, I'm going to walk through Path A and then once I'm done with that, I'm

115
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:44,680
going to completely delete my live website just so that I can start over again and demonstrate path

116
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,100
B.

117
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,210
So if you want to experiment and try both paths, that's OK.

118
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,100
But there's no need to do that.

119
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,050
Either one will get the job done.

120
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,080
OK, that is going to bring this lesson to a close.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,430
In our very next video, we're going to begin learning about Path A.

122
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,220
Let's keep things rolling and I'll see you then.
