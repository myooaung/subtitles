00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.210
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.140
In this lesson, we're going to talk about where we go from here.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.000
And what I mean is we need to address the very notion of what a theme is or what it can be or what it

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.690
should be in this new era of full site editing and block themes to explain the issues I'm trying to

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.820
discuss here, let's talk a bit more about the default 2022 theme.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.790
So let's just open up that theme in our text editor.

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:37.140
So in your WordPress installation folder, go into WP content themes and then here's the 2022 folder.

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.360
Just open this up in your text editor.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.830
So if we dig in to the templates folder and then open up maybe indexed HTML, we see that the only thing

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.370
in this file is default core WordPress blocks.

11
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
Now before we go any further in this lesson and I discuss my own personal philosophy of WordPress,

12
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.210
I want to get it out of the way and say that there's nothing wrong with this approach.

13
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.550
Yes, it may not align with the way that I use WordPress and it may not align with the way that my non

14
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.740
developer clients want to use WordPress, but that's just a matter of personal preference.

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.680
So I want to acknowledge that for a sizable percentage of people, this approach of using WordPress

16
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.000
as a page builder tool using the core blocks, this will be wonderful.

17
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.170
And if these are the types of themes that you want to create, that's amazing.

18
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.710
I think there will be plenty of people interested in using those types of themes.

19
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.020
However, you don't need any guidance on how to create these types of themes.

20
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.000
There's really nothing to learn.

21
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.810
It's not as if the complexity of PHP is now gone and it's been replaced with tons of JavaScript complexity.

22
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
There's really just no complexity of any variety.

23
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
Now in these types of themes, you can dig through every file in this folder.

24
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.650
You're really not going to find any PHP, any HTML, any access or any JavaScript.

25
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.150
It's literally just core default block comments and then maybe the teeny tiny bit of HTML that that

26
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.230
block would output.

27
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.710
Now, again, I'm not suggesting that that's bad.

28
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.720
It's not it's quite the opposite.

29
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.910
I think this 2022 theme is amazing.

30
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.090
My point is that it's simply not the type of theme that needs lessons and chapters explaining how to

31
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.570
build it.

32
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.090
You just jump into the WordPress editor and start combining different blocks together, providing a

33
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.930
few intelligently chosen default values, both in the blocks themselves and in the themed JSON file.

34
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
Don't worry, we'll cover this file as we build our block theme together.

35
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000
But that's really it if you're just trying to build a theme like this.

36
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.990
In fact, the majority of the lines of code in this theme actually live in the ANC or includes folder

37
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.390
and then inside this patterns folder.

38
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.790
So what in the world are block patterns?

39
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.510
Well, they're really just like presets for blocks.

40
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.480
Or you can think of them sort of as like a tab trigger snippet in your text editor pattern is just a

41
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.930
preset way of arranging blocks, but that's it.

42
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.400
There's nothing custom going on.

43
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.190
It's just more default core WordPress blocks just arranged and combined in a certain way.

44
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.880
If you've never seen a block pattern before, let me show you how they work right now.

45
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
And the reason I want to show you this is because this is really a lot of the heavy lifting that the

46
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.490
2022 theme is doing.

47
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.710
So even if we forget about this 2022 theme for a moment and we just think about WordPress itself.

48
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.920
So for example, we have this really basic empty theme that we created in the previous video, and you

49
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.120
and I definitely have not registered any custom block patterns yet.

50
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.730
So even in this theme, if we go in to edit a blog post or page maybe below this paragraph, if I try

51
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.640
to add in a new block, if I use this tool so instead of blocks, you can look under patterns.

52
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.040
So WordPress by default has different patterns you can choose from.

53
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.440
So if you scroll through this list, you'll see all sorts of different patterns and we didn't register

54
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.310
any custom ones.

55
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.960
These just exist in WordPress.

56
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.950
So image on solid color with description you can click that and nothing magical just happened.

57
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.040
It simply added in those blocks.

58
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.050
So the HTML comments and a few preset values, it added it right into our post.

59
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.440
And now when WordPress saves this, so if I click update to actually save that into the database, there's

60
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.480
nothing dynamic or interesting going on.

61
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.780
It doesn't have a reference that that's the pattern we used.

62
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.280
It's literally just storing the HTML for these blocks so there's no longer any connection between this

63
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.230
and the pattern that created it.

64
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.410
So for example, here's the database entry for that post.

65
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.760
Here's the post content field.

66
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.750
So there's the paragraph.

67
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.200
And then if you scroll down, this is the code that the pattern inserted into the content and there's

68
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.220
no reference to the pattern that, you know, the preset that inserted it.

69
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.770
It's just the actual blocks that you would use the.

70
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.300
Columns.

71
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.500
BLOCK the cover block.

72
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.900
Is that a big deal?

73
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.750
Is that a problem?

74
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.460
Well, I don't know.

75
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.460
That's for you to decide.

76
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.080
I would never use this approach, because now if a client used that pattern in 700 different posts or

77
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.980
pages, there's no way for us as the developer to make a tiny adjustment to it in one place and have

78
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.130
all 700 posts use the new updates.

79
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.810
Right.

80
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.130
As soon as you insert a pattern like this.

81
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.040
You are completely married to the output, maybe for the types of websites you and your clients are

82
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.490
building.

83
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.780
That's not a problem.

84
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.150
That's really up to you to decide.

85
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.070
The reason I bring this up is just to let you know that that's really most of the heavy lifting that

86
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.780
the 2022 theme is doing.

87
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.910
So it's registering a bunch.

88
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.130
So if you scroll through here, a bunch of, you know, new block patterns.

89
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.760
So you can click through them and look at what each one is doing.

90
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.980
But really, I'll give you a summary.

91
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.570
It's just inserting core WordPress blocks in a certain way.

92
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.630
So let's get back to the actual point of this video.

93
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.260
If this is the approach you're interested in, if you want to build a theme similar to 2022, cool.

94
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.560
Congrats, you don't really need to learn anything else.

95
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.620
You can close this video right now and just start experimenting in the WordPress editor screen.

96
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.430
Right, because that's really all that's going on in every one of these files.

97
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.940
However, and this is really the entire point of this video, if you're anything like me, you might

98
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:40.890
be thinking to yourself, Hey, I don't want to be 100% married to the core WordPress blocks or Hey,

99
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:47.730
I don't want to be 100% married to the WordPress design system and the c est that it outputs, right?

100
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.210
What if you want to use bootstrap or tailwind?

101
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.620
CC or what if you want to use sass and write your own success?

102
00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.740
In those cases, you would need to be in control of the HTML structure that's being used.

103
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.940
Or Hey, I need to be able to query for complex relationships based on meta values or other certain

104
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.750
conditions, and the query loop block just isn't going to cut it.

105
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.300
Or perhaps the biggest concern of all.

106
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.250
Hey, what if my website is going to have 2000 pages or 5000 pages?

107
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:27.090
And what if I don't want every single piece of content on my site to be mixed together with presentation

108
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.600
with zero separation between data and design?

109
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.690
And what if I have these 5000 pages and I want to change the HTML that a certain block type uses?

110
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.860
I don't want to have to go into all 5000 pages manually and hit the update button 5000 times.

111
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.790
I just want to be able to update a code file once and have all 5000 posts use my newest code.

112
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.560
Well, the good news is that is possible using a modern block based approach.

113
00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:01.200
But you do need to set things up in a particular way that might not seem super intuitive at first.

114
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:07.650
Anyways, if you've had any of these thoughts, it means that you can't, at least not 100% follow the

115
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:14.130
2022 theme approach of exclusively using core blocks and built in style options.

116
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:14.800
Right.

117
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.610
We need to take matters into our own hands a bit if we don't want to be completely restricted to WordPress

118
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.640
managing all HTML and CC for us.

119
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.410
So where do we get started?

120
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.390
Well, we're building a block theme.

121
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.230
So let's start breaking down our website in terms of blocks.

122
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.170
Remember, our goal was to convert the fictional university theme into a modern block based theme.

123
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.940
So right now, let me go ahead and switch back to the traditional fictional university theme.

124
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.170
So under appearance, let me switch back to fictional university.

125
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.000
So this is not a block theme.

126
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.410
This is a traditional theme.

127
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.200
And remember, our goal together, step by step, is to convert this into a block theme.

128
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.600
So what should our first step be?

129
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.930
Well, let's just start breaking this design up into blocks.

130
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:07.440
So I think our first step should be to turn this top banner area into its own block.

131
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.300
So this banner block will not include this content, the navigation and the logo.

132
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.070
It will just be the background image and this text and button content here.

133
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.890
I think this will be a good first block to build.

134
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.480
The idea is that we want this content to be very easy to edit.

135
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.510
So we're going to take full advantage of the modern editor.

136
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.420
The block based approach that what you see is what you get click and type approach, and it should be

137
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.710
a great bit of practice.

138
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.980
Now before we jump into that, I do want to say that I'm well aware you could create this layout and

139
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.880
design using the core default WordPress blocks, right through a combination of the WordPress cover

140
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.180
block and the headline block and the buttons block.

141
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.100
You could create something that looks very, very similar to this, but that's not the point.

142
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:01.470
The point is, what if you had a really complex and custom bespoke design?

143
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.420
Something that was way more complicated than this in terms of visual design.

144
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.990
The point is, how would you turn that into your own block?

145
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.410
Right.

146
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.180
If you don't want to use the word press corps blocks, sometimes you need to take matters into your

147
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.920
own hands.

148
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.600
So don't worry so much about the way that this looks, because this does look simplistic in terms of

149
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.380
visual design.

150
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.050
We're focused on how to take matters into our own hands, and that's exactly what we're going to learn

151
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.030
how to do in the next lesson.

152
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.460
I think it's going to be a ton of fun to start this journey of converting this theme into a modern block

153
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:34.790
theme.

154
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.200
So let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
