00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.600
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.640
In this lesson, we will answer the question, where do we begin?

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
So whenever I'm helping someone learn WordPress development, I always say that the first step.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.170
Our first priority should be setting up a dev environment for ourselves so that we can work locally.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.340
Now, don't worry.

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.440
I do not expect you to know what that means in order to explain what that means.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.080
Let's ask ourselves two new questions.

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
What in the world is a dev environment and what does working locally mean?

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.690
Let's start with the dev environment.

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
The best way to explain what it is is to begin with it's opposite.

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.730
The opposite of a dev environment is your real Web site that the entire world can see.

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.930
So in the past, you might have purchased a domain name like your own dot com or dot org, and you might

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.520
have also purchased a Web hosting plan and used WordPress to create a Web site in the industry.

14
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.550
We refer to that real Web site that the entire world can see.

15
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
We refer to that as your live environment or your production environment.

16
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.280
On the other hand, a dev or development environment is a separate copy of your Web site that is usually

17
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.080
configured so that only the owner or developers of the Web site can see it.

18
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.620
So a dev environment is a private safe sandbox or playground to experiment in.

19
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.330
And no one from the general public can see your work in progress Web site.

20
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.140
OK.

21
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.030
So that's a dev environment.

22
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
Now, let's answer our other question, which is what does working locally me?

23
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.940
So local is the opposite of the cloud.

24
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200
Local refers to your personal physical computer.

25
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650
So, for example, right now I want you to picture two things.

26
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.650
Number one, your personal computer.

27
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
And number two, a server that lives a thousand miles away from you.

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.010
Now, the files that make up a Web site usually live on a server that a Web host company maintains.

29
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.240
The Web host company leaves that server computer on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that people

30
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.700
can access your Web site around the clock.

31
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.170
And that means that WordPress and our Web sites usually live on a server, not on our personal computers.

32
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.220
However, it is possible to install WordPress on our personal computers, and that will allow us to

33
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.300
create WordPress Web sites even when we don't have an Internet connection.

34
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.220
Now, granted, these won't be real Web sites because no one else can view them.

35
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.020
It would be like saving a word processing file to the desktop of your computer.

36
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.660
You're the only person in the world who can view that word processing file because it lives on your

37
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.740
physical computer.

38
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.370
OK.

39
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.120
But long story short, that process of working from your computer instead of connecting remotely to

40
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.380
a server somewhere.

41
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.440
That process is called working locally.

42
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.580
Now, if we put these two things together, if we work locally within a dev environment, it creates

43
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.280
the perfect conditions for coding custom Web sites.

44
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.930
Because if we make a typo while coding, it won't be a big deal because no one will see the error messages

45
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.040
except for us.

46
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.420
Also, we won't need to constantly upload new files to a server because anytime we save a file on our

47
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.090
computer, our local private Web sites are just immediately, instantly updated.

48
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.700
And then only when we're finished coding our Web site.

49
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.260
Only then do we push our files up to a real public Web server for the whole world to see.

50
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.130
OK, so if we want to work locally, we need to install WordPress on our personal computers.

51
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.860
But that's a bit trickier than it may sound.

52
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.800
So here's a metaphore or an analogy for you.

53
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.730
If we had a tree that we wanted to plant, we can't just throw that tree anywhere, right?

54
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.240
We can't just throw the tree on cement and expect it to live and grow.

55
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.090
A tree needs a particular environment.

56
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.870
It needs an environment with soil, water and sunlight.

57
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.150
Well, it's the same thing with WordPress.

58
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.720
We can't just plant WordPress anywhere on our computer.

59
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.650
WordPress needs an environment with the following three things.

60
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:41.550
Number one, P, HP, number two, Apache or Engine X, and number three, my sequel or Maria DBI.

61
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.660
Now, don't worry.

62
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.180
I do not expect you to know what any of those things are.

63
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.800
But for now, just know that our personal computers need to have these things in order for WordPress

64
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.400
to run.

65
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.890
Now, most computers do not come preinstalled with these things.

66
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.550
So we need to go out and get them.

67
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.860
But luckily.

68
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.100
These three things are completely free and there are lots of different tools out there that will automatically

69
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.440
install all three of them for us.

70
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.090
Right.

71
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.980
So all of the tools listed on the screen right now, they are free and they all do the same thing.

72
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.670
They give us the metaphorical soil, water and sunlight that WordPress needs in order to run on our

73
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.210
computer.

74
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.310
So we don't need all of these tools.

75
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.780
We just need one of them.

76
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.180
Now, if you've dabbled with WordPress development in the past, you might already have one of these

77
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.310
tools installed on your computer.

78
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.560
If that's the case, you can keep using it.

79
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.960
You do not need to install another one.

80
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.180
But if you're brand new, I don't want you to feel overwhelmed with all of these choices.

81
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.460
So right now, why don't we install local by flywheel together?

82
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.720
Step by step.

83
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.120
This is my favorite tool of the bunch.

84
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.010
And it's super easy to use.

85
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.500
So in a new tab in your Web browser, search for local by flywheel.

86
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.280
As of this recording, the official you are RL is local WP dot com.

87
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.700
OK, then go ahead and click the big free download button and proceed to download the software.

88
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.840
You might have to enter your first name or an email address or basic info.

89
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.210
But the software is completely free.

90
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.250
You will not have to pay even a penny.

91
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.930
The download file is a decent size, so it might take a while to download.

92
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.360
You might need to go grab a coffee while you wait.

93
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.600
But once the download completes, jump into your computers downloads folder and go ahead and begin installing

94
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.290
the program.

95
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.690
And this could take up to several minutes.

96
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.210
So be patient when it completes.

97
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.870
It should then give you this option to create a new site.

98
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.300
Go ahead and click that.

99
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.140
We need to give this new site a name just to follow along with the course.

100
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.100
Why don't you name it?

101
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.870
Fictional university.

102
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.290
Let's click continue.

103
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.680
We can go ahead and use the preferred default options.

104
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.030
So continue again.

105
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.270
And here you get to choose your username and password.

106
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.580
Just choose something that you can remember.

107
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.220
And also enter your email address.

108
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.370
Then go ahead and click add site.

109
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.530
And this might take a few minutes to complete.

110
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.090
But when it does, we now have our own local dev environment copy of WordPress up and running on our

111
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.170
personal computer.

112
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.200
So you can just click this view site button.

113
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.240
If that's not available yet, you might just need to start your Web site up in the top right corner.

114
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.800
But once it's up and running.

115
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.970
Just click view site.

116
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.250
And here we have a brand new, completely fresh copy of WordPress.

117
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.710
Up in the address bar, you can see that it gave us our own fake local dev domain.

118
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.130
Basically told our computer that if we visit this domain instead of looking out onto the Internet,

119
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.740
just look within our own personal computer.

120
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.560
And this means that you were the only one in the world that can view your Web site if you shared this

121
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.390
domain with a friend or family member.

122
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.060
They would not be able to see your Web site yet.

123
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.960
Cool.

124
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:18.040
So you've got your own private playground copy of WordPress that you can experiment with if you want

125
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.330
to log in as the admin of the site.

126
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:29.410
Up in the address bar at the end of this domain, just add slash WP dash ad men press enter.

127
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:35.110
Now here we see that the Google Chrome web browser is confused and thought that I wanted to search for

128
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.520
this instead of visiting it as a domain to get around this up at the top.

129
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.450
We see this message.

130
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.820
Did you mean to go to fictional university DOT local slash WP Admon.

131
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.390
So just click on that because yes, that's what we wanted to do.

132
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.590
Enter the user name and password you chose just a moment or two ago.

133
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.790
Cool.

134
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.210
And here's your typical WordPress admen dashboard.

135
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:04.150
Now let's pretend you've been working and experimenting for a while and you're done for the day to shut

136
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.860
things down.

137
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.530
Just jump back to the local buy flywheel application.

138
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.890
We can click stop site up in the top right corner.

139
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.390
OK.

140
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.300
And then you're free to close the program.

141
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:22.060
Now, let's imagine it's the next day and you're ready to start working on your WordPress site again.

142
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.490
Just open up local by flywheel.

143
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.180
It could take several minutes to load, but once it does, just click on your Web site that you created

144
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.510
here.

145
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:32.230
OK.

146
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.770
And then in the top right corner, we just need to click start site.

147
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.000
Cool.

148
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.350
So now it's running again.

149
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.550
So now back in your browser, you're free to use your Web site again.

150
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.590
You might need to refresh and remember that if you forget this, you are ill.

151
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.370
You can always just click view site right here.

152
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.430
OK.

153
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:56.120
Now, there's only one more super important thing that I need to tell you right now before we move on.

154
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:02.780
I want to show you where on your computer your new Web site files actually live.

155
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.170
So right here where you see your Web site listed, if you.

156
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.530
Right.

157
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.370
Click on that.

158
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.950
If you're on a Mac, you can choose reveal in Finder if you're on Windows.

159
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.550
It will say show in folder or something similar.

160
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.470
Basically, we're looking for the folder or directory where the website lives.

161
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:27.890
So click on that option and that will show you the folder for the current Web site that you're working

162
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.100
on.

163
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.410
If you're wondering where this lives, it's inside your user accounts home directory.

164
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:41.110
If you're on a Mac within your home folder, you will now see a brand new folder named Local Sites.

165
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.720
Right.

166
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.730
And that contains our projects.

167
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.630
If you are on Windows, you will have a new folder named Local Sites within the base of your main user

168
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.170
folder.

169
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.350
So it would be sitting alongside your downloads folder.

170
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.200
OK.

171
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.150
Now, before we bring this lesson to a close, I want to show you where the actual WordPress files themselves

172
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.810
live.

173
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.700
So within local sites.

174
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.290
Within our project folder.

175
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.600
Dig into app and then public.

176
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.790
And here we are.

177
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.860
We are going to be spending a lot of time in this folder, in this course.

178
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.540
These are the system files that actually power WordPress.

179
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:29.270
Perhaps the most important folder is named WP Dash Content.

180
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.630
If you look inside it, we see another folder named Themes.

181
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.650
And inside there is a folder for each theme that you have installed.

182
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:45.050
Now, in this course, we are going to be creating our own brand new theme.

183
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.870
So very shortly we will be setting up a new folder here, and that's where we are going to do a lot

184
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.710
of our work.

185
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.320
Now, at this point, give yourself a pat on the back, because you've completed the first step towards

186
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.000
becoming a WordPress developer.

187
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.420
You now have a local dev environment.

188
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:10.490
But remember that not everyone in this course is using this same local by flywheel setup.

189
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.940
So before we bring this lesson to a close, I just want to stress one thing to you, and that is that

190
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:23.750
even if in future lessons, my screen doesn't look exactly like your screen, that's OK.

191
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:30.530
And even if I'm working in a slightly different folder, like personally in my case, my Web site's

192
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.730
live on my desktop.

193
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.180
Right.

194
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.850
In this lower case, local sites folder.

195
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.380
That's not important.

196
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.420
So just know that throughout the entire course, when you hear me say that, I want you to jump to your

197
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:48.830
project folder or your WordPress folder or your theme folder, just know that you are in the right spot

198
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.850
for you.

199
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:57.440
I just want you to open up your project, jump into it, then jump into app, then jump into public.

200
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.050
Okay.

201
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.230
This is really the only folder that you need to worry about throughout the entire course.

202
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.540
I'm usually going to tell you things like.

203
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.390
Now I want you to jump in to WP content.

204
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.470
Cool.

205
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.110
Now, that's going to bring this lesson to a close.

206
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:18.140
And now that you've set up a local dev environment for yourself, we can really start learning how WordPress

207
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:18.740
works.

208
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:26.690
In our very next lesson, we are going to get our first taste of P HP, which is the language that powers

209
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.790
the heart and soul of WordPress.

210
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.710
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

211
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.270
So let's keep things rolling.

212
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.610
And I will see you then.
