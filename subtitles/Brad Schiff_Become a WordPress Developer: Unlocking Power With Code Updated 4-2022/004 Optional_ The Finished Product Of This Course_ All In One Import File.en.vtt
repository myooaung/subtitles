00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.330
Hello, everyone, in this video, we're going to take a break from the step by step nature of this

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
course, so we're not going to be working on building out our fictional university website.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.020
Instead, I want to show you how you can import the final finished product that we will have at the

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.550
very end of this course.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.770
I want to show you how you can import that into a brand new empty local WordPress installation.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.980
Now, you don't need to do this.

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
I want to stress right away, if you're enjoying the course so far and you've been able to follow along

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.330
and you like the step by step nature of building things with me, by all means, you can skip this video.

9
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.070
You do not need to do this.

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
However, for many people, maybe there's a chapter at the end of the course you're interested in and

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.230
you really only joined this course for one of those later chapters.

12
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.140
And you don't want to have to follow along with the first 20 hours of the course just to get to that

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.100
later chapter.

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.560
Or maybe you're the type of learner that doesn't like the step by step nature of this course.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.380
And you would rather have the finished product that you can start dissecting and working backwards on

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.090
and maybe reverse engineering or just inspecting a certain feature that you're interested in.

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.410
Or another reason you might want the finished product site is yes, this course has always offered the

18
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.060
theme folder that you can download as a zip.

19
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.690
However, the theme folder is not going to automatically give you all of the plugins that we need,

20
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.580
and it's not going to automatically configure all of the settings in the database.

21
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.840
Right.

22
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.300
All of our custom fields, their exact field names and settings, all of the different settings for

23
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.750
various plug ins, all of that is stored in the database and it can require a lot of attention to detail

24
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.410
and patients to follow along with this course video by video, making sure you've set all the same settings

25
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.030
as me and following along step by step.

26
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.180
So in this video, when you import the finished product into a new empty local WordPress dev copy,

27
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.970
it's going to give you everything, not only the theme folder, but it's going to give you my copy of

28
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.380
a finished database.

29
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.370
So all of the plug ins, all of the settings will all be perfectly configured.

30
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.580
Now, again, if you're enjoying the step by step nature of this course, you can skip this video.

31
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.050
However, it might be nice for you to have your one work in progress, copy of the site and then create

32
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.910
an entirely new local dev project and import the final site.

33
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.930
So that way you have a working reference that you can compare your copy to big picture.

34
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.410
There are many different reasons why you would want to install or import the final product.

35
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.620
So let me show you how we can do this.

36
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.170
So in the local app, you can go ahead and create a brand new empty copy of WordPress.

37
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.710
That's what I've done here with this new example.

38
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.880
Anyways, once you've created a new empty WordPress site, it should look like this, right?

39
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.430
Just a generic empty WordPress project.

40
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.160
I have not created a single post page.

41
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.960
I have not customized a single setting.

42
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.760
So the question is, how can we take this new empty WordPress site and import the final fictional university

43
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.960
project into it?

44
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.530
Well, it's actually surprisingly simple.

45
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.400
So go ahead and log in as the admin for your new empty WordPress project.

46
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.140
So in this tab, I'm logged in and we just need to install one plug in.

47
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.050
So over in the sidebar under plug ins list, click, add new up here in the search bar.

48
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.890
Let's search for all in one.

49
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.290
So we're looking for a plug in called All-In-One WP Migration.

50
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
You'll know it's the right plug in if the author is by Serv Mask.

51
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.320
So again, all in one WP migration.

52
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.330
Let's go ahead and install this plug in.

53
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.830
OK, once that completes, then we do also need to click the activate button.

54
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.640
OK, now with that plug in activated in the bottom corner of our sidebar menu, that gives us this new

55
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.380
option down here, all in one WP migration when you hover over it, we're interested in import, right?

56
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.830
We want to import the final finished product of this course.

57
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.360
Click on import.

58
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.220
Cool.

59
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.900
Now, in this main column area, we just import a file, so we just need to go download from you to

60
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.910
me in the resources for this lesson.

61
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.970
Just go download my exported file.

62
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.970
So inside you to me, as of today, in the right hand corner, you can see the different chapters and

63
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.620
lessons.

64
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.590
So for this lesson there should be a little resources area.

65
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.220
If you click on that, then there is a file that you can download.

66
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.970
It's named Finished W Press Dot Zip.

67
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.280
So go ahead and start downloading that.

68
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.620
I think it's about 40 megabytes.

69
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290
Oh, it's actually only about 30 megabytes.

70
00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.650
Cool.

71
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.800
Now, before we go back into WordPress and try to import that file, we do need to extract it because

72
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.020
if you look in your downloads folder or wherever you saved the file, you can see that it's a zip file.

73
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.860
And the WordPress plugin we're using does not understand zip files.

74
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.210
So you should be able to either double click on it on Mac or on Windows just right.

75
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.060
Click on it and choose extract.

76
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.690
OK, but once you extract the zip file, you should now have a file just named finished dot w press.

77
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.610
So this is what we can go import in WordPress.

78
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.720
So from the import screen on that new plugin, just click this import from Chew's file.

79
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.550
In your downloads folder, choose that finished press file.

80
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.050
OK, WordPress is just letting you know this is going to completely change this copy of WordPress,

81
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.390
so it's going to erase everything in this current installation and use all of the new imported data.

82
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.190
So do not do this on a website you care about, only do this within a new empty WordPress or a WordPress

83
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.740
installation that you're OK with it turning into a totally different site.

84
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:17.930
Also, do not import this on a live public production ready website, only do this in a local dev environment.

85
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.810
The reason I say that is because the administrator account on this new installation, their user name

86
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.400
is admin and their password is admin.

87
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.890
Also, there's a guest account where the username is guest and the password is guest.

88
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.070
So those are not very secure usernames and passwords.

89
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.560
But when we're working locally, that's OK.

90
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.530
Anyways, let's go ahead and click proceed.

91
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.760
So this is just going to take a few seconds or maybe a moment or two.

92
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.930
It's already done.

93
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.190
So you can just click finish now to really make sure that everything worked properly.

94
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.270
We do want to maybe go update our permalink structure.

95
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.830
So down in the settings of WordPress, click into Permalink.

96
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.800
It is going to make you login again.

97
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.630
So I was already logged into my old empty WordPress site, but now that plug in has converted this into

98
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.830
the finished product.

99
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.490
Right?

100
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.970
So it's using the database of that finished site.

101
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.740
So now that you imported my backup file, you need to use the username and password that I chose.

102
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.840
So the username is admin and the password is also admin.

103
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.500
So a Mianne go ahead and log in.

104
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.780
From this permalink screen, just go ahead and scroll down to the bottom click save changes, this will

105
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.140
force WordPress to rebuild the permalink using this new domain of this new site.

106
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.600
OK, and that's it.

107
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.430
So now if I use this link up in the top corner to visit my site.

108
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.030
Cool, so just a moment ago, this was a brand new empty WordPress installation, and now this is the

109
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.470
exact final product that you would end up with at the end of this course.

110
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:03.630
And it's fully functional, so I can click on my notes up here and create a new note, new example note

111
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.260
right now, this is great.

112
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.020
Create that cool.

113
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.610
There it is.

114
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.750
Now, I will point out the one feature that's not going to work out of the box when we import the site

115
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.440
is our campus page.

116
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.660
So if I click on campuses, the Google map is not going to work.

117
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.680
And that's because you would need to enter your own Google Maps API key for now.

118
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.730
Don't worry about that.

119
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.920
We talk about this topic in detail in the chapter where we actually build the campus map.

120
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:41.460
Also, maybe I can go into the programs up in the top navigation, click into biology, click on Bachs

121
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.490
a lot, click this heart icon to signal that I like, barks a lot or I can click on it again to remove

122
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.290
my like you get the idea.

123
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.420
So everything is up and running.

124
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.660
Well not everything.

125
00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.360
So yes, the website is up and running, but what about our automated workflow that generates our bundled

126
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.050
files.

127
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.480
So at the moment that is not up and running.

128
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.630
So right now let me show you how we can set that up.

129
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.420
So the first step is just to locate the theme folder on our computers hard drive.

130
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.240
So in the local app, I'm working on this new example project.

131
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.090
So if I right.

132
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:24.780
Click on that project, I can choose reveal in Finder on Windows there should be an option of show an

133
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.760
explorer or something similar.

134
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.010
OK, now that's going to show you where that project folder lives on your computer.

135
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.290
So let's just click into that folder.

136
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.250
And then let's click into the app folder, then click into public.

137
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:48.520
OK, now these are all the WordPress files, we're interested in this folder of WP dash content inside

138
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.760
that we're interested in the folder named Theme's.

139
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:58.950
OK, and now inside here, we're interested in a fictional university theme, so I want you to open

140
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.930
this folder up in LVS code.

141
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.920
OK, now this folder already contains all of the files that will power our automation, but we do need

142
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.130
to actually install all of the NPM packages.

143
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.860
So to do that, just open up your command line.

144
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:20.290
LVS code makes this easy because the command line is already pointing towards this exact folder.

145
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.740
So now we just need to say NPM install.

146
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.640
That's it.

147
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.530
So go ahead and type in this command with me.

148
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.550
Let's press enter.

149
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:40.160
OK, once that finishes, now we just run the following command, npm, run, start, go ahead and press

150
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.670
enter.

151
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.620
OK, and now with that task up and running and watching us, let's test it out.

152
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:55.550
So let's go into our Sarsae folder and then into our main index JS file and maybe down at the very bottom

153
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:01.550
of this file just for a quick test to make sure that things are working, let's have an alert pop up

154
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:08.680
message to just alert parentheses, give it a string of text and say hello, this is a test.

155
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.550
So if we save that, the command line will rebundle up our JavaScript file.

156
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:19.640
And then on the front end of our website, if we refresh perfect, we see that message from JavaScript.

157
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.020
So we know that our success in JavaScript output is now working correctly.

158
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:30.410
OK, now moving on towards the very end of this course, we learn about plug in development.

159
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.960
So you and I will code several WordPress plug ins together in the finished product.

160
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:42.170
Working example of all of those plug ins are included in this version of the bundled or imported site.

161
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:48.770
So if I go to my blog and click on this most recent blog post, you can see this area towards the top.

162
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.750
This is being generated from a plug in that you and I will create together if we scroll down a little

163
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.290
bit further.

164
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.140
You can see it's filtering the word ipsum again.

165
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:01.610
That's a plug in that we're going to create if we scroll down a little bit further here, we see this

166
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.370
multiple choice plug in.

167
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.460
So if I get the question wrong on purpose, we see sorry, try again.

168
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.760
But if I get it correct, cool.

169
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.730
We also see another block type plug in that we're going to create together.

170
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.790
Featured Professor and then finally up in the address bar at the end of your domain.

171
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.830
So yours will be something different than mine.

172
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:29.540
But at the end of it, if you visit pet dash adoption, well, we have a plug in development chapter

173
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.730
where we learn a little bit about working with a custom database table.

174
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:42.230
So this is an example where we have 100000 pet records and we learn how to handle that efficiently instead

175
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.330
of relying solely on the WordPress post types.

176
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.350
Anyways, I'm getting sidetracked.

177
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:53.600
Now, the entire point of this video is just to let you know that this imported or bundled version of

178
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.720
the site has everything you need.

179
00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.880
It has our main fictional university theme, as well as all of the plug ins that will create together.

180
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.320
OK, that's going to bring this video to a close.

181
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.000
Don't forget, in addition to the admin account that has a password of admin, there's also a guest

182
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.720
account with the username and password, both being guessed.

183
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.780
And that would allow you to test out the Minot's feature and the ability of liking a professor with

184
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.930
an example, guest or student account.

185
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.160
I hope this video helps someone out there.

186
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.710
And now let's get back to actually building this site together step by step.
