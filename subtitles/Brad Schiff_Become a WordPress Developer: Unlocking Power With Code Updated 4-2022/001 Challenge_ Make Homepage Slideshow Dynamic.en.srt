00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,300
Hello, everyone, in this extra credit section of the course, I will be giving you various challenges

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,440
for you to work through.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,800
I will not be giving you the exact answers and we will not work through these together step by step.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,810
OK, at this point, I want to take off the training wheels and I want you to work through these by

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,480
yourself.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,260
Now, if you get stuck on a challenge, don't worry, because there's a community of other people all

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,020
working on the same challenges.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,560
So if you get stuck, just take advantage of the question and answer section.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,740
Each extra credit challenge will have its own video.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,230
And so I want everyone to organize your questions around each video.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,090
Basically, when you post a question, instead of just letting the question float in outer space, make

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,620
sure that you link or assign it to the particular video for that challenge.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,140
So that way, if someone struggling with challenge number two, they can view a list of all of the question

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,320
and answer threads just for that one video and challenge.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,580
OK, so hopefully this way everyone can help everyone else stay motivated, stay inspired, brainstorm

16
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,960
solutions together and help each other find typos, so on and so forth.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,730
All right.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,810
Now, having said all of that, let's jump into the action and get started with the first challenge.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:24,120
Challenge number one is an improvement that I want you to make to our fictional university website.

20
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,180
So on the home page, down at the very bottom, right above the footer, we have this slideshow area.

21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:38,570
Now, at the moment, this slideshow lives within our front page template, meaning the slide show is

22
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,410
static and not dynamic.

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,250
So this means that in order to make changes to the slide show, basically you need to be a web developer.

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,950
But it would be nice if anyone on our team or at our company could update the slide show.

25
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,420
Right.

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,650
You shouldn't need to be a web developer to change the text or to make the button point towards a new

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,810
page or to upload a new photograph.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,700
So for your first challenge, I want you to make the slideshow editable from within the WordPress admin

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,510
dashboard.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,060
So what I mean by that is this way, an account person or designer on our team, someone who isn't a

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,520
web developer, could just jump into the dashboard and then there can either be an area in the sidebar

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,340
named homepage slideshow or they can click into pages and click on the home page.

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:32,060
But either way, if they want to update either the title or the subtitle for any of the slides, they

34
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,310
should just be able to edit a text field.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,290
And if they want to change the background image, it should be as easy as just uploading a new media

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,940
file within WordPress.

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,430
OK, now I'm not going to give you the exact answer on how to do this, but I will point you in the

38
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,480
right direction.

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,300
I would say there's two main ways of setting this up.

40
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,410
For your first option, you can just create a new custom post type, maybe name it homepage slideshow.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,930
So that way it would show up as a new item in the admin dashboard in the sidebar.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:11,120
And then for that custom post type, just assign it custom fields such as slide title slides, subtitle

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
slide link text and slide link value and slide photograph.

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,620
In this strategy, each slide would be its own post.

45
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,640
So three posts in this custom post type would give you three slides.

46
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,100
If you wanted a fourth and fifth slide in the slideshow, you would just create a fourth and fifth post.

47
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,810
OK, that's option number one.

48
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,500
The other way that you could set this up would rely on a page instead of a custom post type.

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,260
So, for example, this is the home page.

50
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,240
So in the admin dashboard, if you went into pages and then remember, we have a home page that is set

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,980
to be our front page.

52
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:58,060
But basically within this page, you could set up advanced custom fields that only display for this

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,780
page.

54
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,180
So, for example, instead of page, banner, subtitle and page banner background image, you could

55
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,960
set up fields that correspond with a slideshow.

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,630
However, you might be scratching your head thinking, wouldn't that only work for one slide?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,580
For example, when it comes to our page banner fields, someone can enter a text and then in this field

58
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,720
you can upload an image.

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,560
But then what if you wanted to create another slide and another slide?

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,120
Well, that's a good question.

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,320
If you wanted to, you could set up a fixed number of slides.

62
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,940
So maybe there can only be at most five slides on the home page.

63
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,870
So then you can just set up five copies of corresponding fields, slide image one slide image two,

64
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,890
three, four, five.

65
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,190
Or if you want to make things flexible so that people on your team could add as many slides as they

66
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,960
want to.

67
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,030
In that case, whenever I need to set up that functionality for a client website of mine, I reach for

68
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,740
a premium plug in named Advanced Custom Fields Pro right away.

69
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,580
I want to stress the fact that I am not in any way affiliated with this plugin.

70
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,150
Even if everyone watching this video goes out and buys this plug in right now, I will not make a penny.

71
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,430
Personally, I'm just a big fan of this plugin and I use it on almost all of my client websites.

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,400
So throughout this course, we used the free version of advanced custom fields, but there's also a

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,050
pro version of the plug in.

74
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,540
Now, the pro version has all sorts of features, but really I only buy it for two features.

75
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,070
Probably the biggest reason is the repeater field.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,530
This feature lets you set up a single field or a collection of fields and it makes them repeatable.

77
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,070
So as an example, when it comes to our page, banner, subtitle and page banner background image,

78
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,460
if you wanted users to be able to add more than one page banner per post, you could set up a repeater

79
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,890
field that contains both of these fields.

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,820
And then in the user interface right here, there would be a plus symbol.

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,460
And if you clicked that, it would just create a new duplicate copy of both fields for you so you could

82
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,590
put in a subtitle, upload an image, click the duplicate button, and then you'd have a new pair of

83
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,830
fields where you could type in a new subtitle and upload a new image.

84
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,410
And you could just keep repeating it as many times as you want, all within a single post.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,300
So this has the potential to be super powerful, but obviously it comes at a price, right?

86
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,270
This is the pro version, so it's not free, but I feel like the pricing is pretty fair as of this moment.

87
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,940
The personal version is twenty five Australian dollars, which I believe is a little bit under 20 US

88
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,630
dollars.

89
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,090
And if you're working on a client website, you can just include that in your bill to the client and

90
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,030
you can use the personal version on as many websites as you want, but you can only receive automatic

91
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,480
updates from one project or one site.

92
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,720
So if you want to avoid having to manually update your plugins and you want to use this on all of your

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,480
websites, the price does become a bit steeper.

94
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,190
But the personal version is a great place to start.

95
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,040
Now, I did mention that the pro version comes with all sorts of features, but I really only buy it

96
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,060
for two features.

97
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,060
So the first reason was the repeater field.

98
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,560
And the other feature that I love is the flexible content field.

99
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,120
This is probably my favorite feature that any plugin has ever offered, and that's because it's a developer's

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,020
paradise.

101
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,860
This feature in and of itself doesn't do anything.

102
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,880
It's worthless unless you bring your own value as a developer to it.

103
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,840
So what I mean by that is when someone is on a poster page authoring screen, right.

104
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,210
So if someone's in the admin and they're creating a new poster page, basically it adds this ad row

105
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,750
button.

106
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,240
And when they click that, it gives them a choice of what type of content they want to add to the page.

107
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,590
And you as the developer decide what these options are.

108
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,450
So maybe your first option could be to column layout and then the next option could be three column

109
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,270
layout, and then the next option could be slideshow, and then the next option could be data table

110
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,410
or featured.

111
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,130
Professor.

112
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,360
Right.

113
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,310
You can make up whatever features you want and you get to spell out the exact fields and user interface

114
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,950
that each type of content should use.

115
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:21,220
And then also as the developer, you get to control the exact HTML that gets output for each one of

116
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,720
those.

117
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,580
It's difficult to explain in a quick fashion, but basically this is the most powerful and flexible

118
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,550
feature I've ever seen in WordPress.

119
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,020
In my opinion, this single feature makes WordPress a premiere content management system.

120
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:41,430
It puts WordPress right up there or above things like Drupal and Joomla and crafts CMS.

121
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,020
I can't say enough good things about this feature.

122
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,630
In fact, other content management systems have actually copied and tried to imitate.

123
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,840
This feature, so I would pay the 20 U.S. dollars just for this feature alone, but I don't want to

124
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,550
sound like a used car salesman.

125
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,090
It's totally up to you.

126
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,080
Hopefully that gives you a lot of different ideas to play with.

127
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,480
And I do want to emphasize the point that if you don't want to spend even another dollar right now and

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,550
you're not interested in the advanced custom fields pro version, that's OK.

129
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,960
You don't need to use it.

130
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,840
Remember, option number one was to just create a custom post type named homepage slideshow, and you

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,580
could set that up with the free version of advanced custom fields without any problems.

132
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,940
OK, that's going to do it for this first extra credit challenge.

133
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,330
Let's keep things rolling and I will see in the next one.
