00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:02.670
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.970
In this lesson, we will create a new post type for campuses at this point.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.730
So far, we've created post types for events, programs and professors.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.350
Right.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.410
So now we want to create a new post type named campuses.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.990
So let's jump into our text editor.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.800
And instead of our theme folder, I want you to jump in to the M.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.980
U or must use plugins folder.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
And let's jump into this file in order to avoid extra typing.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.130
Why don't we just duplicate or copy and paste this code for the event post type pranks?

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.150
So let's copy and paste these 15 or so lines.

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.350
And then maybe just right above that, let's paste it in.

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.370
And now we can just change the word from event to campus.

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.540
So on this comment line, campus post type for the actual code name or variable name for the post type.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200
Let's change that to single campus.

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.890
Don't need that to be plural.

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.330
Let's set the archive.

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.720
You are well to be campuses as in plural.

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.050
OK.

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.710
Next we can edit all of the different labels.

21
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.670
So this should be plural and capitalized campuses.

22
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.370
Add new campus.

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.930
Can you just copy and paste the word right.

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.080
But this one should be plural.

25
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.720
So campuses.

26
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.690
And finally, let's choose a new Dasch icon or menu icon.

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.210
So instead of Dasch icons calendar.

28
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.190
Let's go with Dasch icons.

29
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.780
Dash.

30
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.230
Location.

31
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.860
Dash.

32
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.310
Opt.

33
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.200
OK.

34
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.250
Let's go ahead and save this.

35
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.280
And if we jump back into the admen, we now see this brand new post type named campuses.

36
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.300
And the icon looks like a map with a pin on it, which will fit the theme of our different campus locations.

37
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.350
So right now, why don't we go ahead and create a few new campus posts.

38
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.790
So add new.

39
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.980
Why don't we title this campus downtown West?

40
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.380
Let's give it a bit of dummy content.

41
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.140
Why don't we give it a subtitle of a beautiful campus in the heart of downtown?

42
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.960
Gail, let's go ahead and save or publish that.

43
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.610
And while we're at it, why don't we create another new campus?

44
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.250
So add new let's call this down town east.

45
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.980
Give it some dummy content.

46
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.500
Not all of the campuses need a subtitle.

47
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.050
So let's just go ahead and save or publish this one.

48
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.060
And then let's click on the main campuses, link in the sidebar to see a list of all of our campuses

49
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.730
so far.

50
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.410
So we've just got the two.

51
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.440
But you could imagine that our university maybe has five or 10 different campus locations throughout

52
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.090
town or throughout the city.

53
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.370
So if we've got different locations all throughout the city, it would be nice if on the front end of

54
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.300
our Web site, we had an interactive Google map with a pin for each one of our campus locations.

55
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.730
Now, in order to pin a location on a map, we're going to need to know more than just the title of

56
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.810
a post and a bit of dummy content.

57
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.280
Right.

58
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.700
So if I click on downtown West, what I'm trying to say is that in addition to the title field and the

59
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.510
content field, we need a new custom field down here where you can drag around and zoom around on a

60
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.330
Google map and then click where you want the pin to be, and then it will save the latitude and longitude

61
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.490
in the address into our database.

62
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.360
So we know what to do when you want to add a new custom field.

63
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.020
We can make use of our advanced custom fields plug in.

64
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.280
So down towards the bottom of the sidebar, let's click on Custom Fields and let's create a new field

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.730
group.

66
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.020
So add new button.

67
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.070
Why don't we name this group map location?

68
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.110
OK, so that's the group name.

69
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.330
But we need to create the actual field.

70
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.710
So add field.

71
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.000
Why don't we also just name the field map location?

72
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.610
And then here's the important part for the field type choice instead of text.

73
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.810
If we look down a bit, we see an option named Google Map.

74
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.020
Right.

75
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.560
So let's set the field type two Google map.

76
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.810
We don't need any field instructions.

77
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.450
I do think we should set this to be required.

78
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.500
So required.

79
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.280
Yes.

80
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020
You shouldn't be allowed to create a campus unless you provide a location for the campus.

81
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.240
Let's go ahead and keep scrolling down.

82
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.720
All of these other default values will work just perfectly.

83
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.280
But if we scroll down, I do want to make sure that we fill out the location box.

84
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.340
So let's say show this field group only if post type is equal to.

85
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.950
And let's set this to campus.

86
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.090
Right.

87
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.800
Because we don't need to set a map location for a blog post or a traditional page.

88
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.300
So campus.

89
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.020
And then let's just scroll up and save or publish our new field.

90
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.630
OK, let's go test it out.

91
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.330
So if we click on campuses again and let's try to edit downtown West and if we scroll down to find our

92
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.180
new custom field here, we see map location, but we see an error message on the map.

93
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.210
First of all, this error is totally normal.

94
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.930
And to be expected in order to talk to the Google Map Service on a Web site, you needed Google Maps

95
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.070
API key.

96
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.710
Now, you might be thinking, but hey, I've embedded Google Maps on a Web site before, and I didn't

97
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.350
need an API key then.

98
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.970
Well, in reality, you were probably just importing an eye frame that pointed towards a Web page that

99
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.950
lived on Google servers.

100
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.190
Instead of that, we want to actually be able to talk to the Google map service using JavaScript.

101
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.660
But Google is going to ignore us unless we have an API key.

102
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.070
So at this point, you might be wondering what in the world is an API key?

103
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.100
I don't want to get off on too much of a tangent, but an API key is just a string of letters and numbers.

104
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.280
You could almost think of it as a password, but you don't always need to keep it a complete secret,

105
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.460
like a real password.

106
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.630
Basically, it's a secret handshake that we're gonna make with the Google servers.

107
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.940
So it will let us actually communicate with the Google Maps service.

108
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.730
Now, at this point in the lesson, I want to show you how you can create your own Google Maps API key

109
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.890
right now in a new tab.

110
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.550
I want you to visit console dot developers, dot Google dot com.

111
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.670
You'll need to be signed in with a Google account.

112
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.320
OK, but once you're logged into an account and you visit this, you are.

113
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.420
Well, then I want you to create a new project.

114
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.140
You might see a button to create a new project down in the main content area or towards the top here.

115
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.320
If I click on this button to switch which project I'm working with here, we see new project.

116
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.210
So I can go ahead and click on that.

117
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.640
We need to give our project a name.

118
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.780
The name does not matter.

119
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.240
It's just for your own organization purposes.

120
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.270
Why don't we name it WordPress theme dev and then go ahead and click create.

121
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.610
OK.

122
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.650
It might take five or 10 seconds to complete.

123
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.460
But now I want to be sure to switch over to that new project so I can click this.

124
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.590
Click on that new project.

125
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.470
You can either double click it or click the open link.

126
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.350
And now you can see that I'm working with the new project.

127
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.230
And actually, before we go any further and we learn how to create an API key for Google Maps in this

128
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.860
project.

129
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.560
Before we get to that, I don't want to waste your time.

130
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:42.010
So I want to let you know right now that you must enable building in your Google account in order for

131
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.480
your API key to work.

132
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.420
Now, it makes me sick to my stomach that you would need to enter any sort of billing information within

133
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.760
the context of an educational course.

134
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.660
But unfortunately, Google has put us in a bit of a tough situation here.

135
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.990
So when I first created this WordPress course a couple of years ago, you could absolutely use the Google

136
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.340
map service for free.

137
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.950
You didn't need to enter any billing information.

138
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.620
And as long as you weren't making millions of requests per month, it didn't cost a single penny.

139
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.840
So back then, I thought this was the perfect exercise for an educational WordPress course.

140
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.410
But fast forward to today and now I absolutely do not recommend or support using Google Maps.

141
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:29.200
Having said that, because the campus map was part of the course when the course launched and was part

142
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.660
of the course when some of you first purchased the course, I don't feel like it's fair for me to remove

143
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.550
the map feature from the course.

144
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.560
So where does that leave us now?

145
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:45.430
Well, it still won't cost you a single penny to set up this map feature, but you will have to have

146
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.620
some sort of credit card or debit card or payment info on file with Google.

147
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.770
Now, I completely understand if you're not comfortable with that.

148
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.860
If that's the case, then you can still have your campus post type and we can still learn how to relate

149
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.360
a campus to a program or an event within the context of WordPress.

150
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.940
But you can just skip the map feature.

151
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.110
That's one option.

152
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.090
The other option is to go ahead and enter billing information into your Google account.

153
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.900
Now, don't quote me on this because Google changes their policies all the time.

154
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:22.960
But as of this recording, they claim that your first 12 months are free and or if you stay under a

155
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.300
certain quota limit with your API keys, that again, it will be free in just a moment.

156
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.620
When we setup our API key, I will show you how you can set up a quota.

157
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:39.190
And I set really strict quota limits just to make sure that I never go over the free limit to make sure

158
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.740
that my account never actually truly gets billed.

159
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.540
Right.

160
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:49.090
Because let's be honest, unless you're creating an app like Uber or Lyft or Door Dash or some sort

161
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.460
of application that truly needs map functionality, and that's going to be generating revenue because

162
00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.070
of map functionality, unless that's the case, I don't think it makes sense to pay even one cent or

163
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.560
one dollar to work with a Google map.

164
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.960
Having said all of that, if you're comfortable using a Google service like this, let me show you how

165
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.800
to move forward.

166
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.130
So once you've selected the new project that we created, we want to enable API is and services.

167
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.400
So let's click that.

168
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.950
OK, now Google has a bunch of different API.

169
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.730
We can search from right now.

170
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:32.440
We need to enable three different API is the first one we want to search for is maps JavaScript API.

171
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.610
Here it is.

172
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.170
Maps JavaScript API.

173
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.190
Lets click on that.

174
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.660
OK, and then we just click this enable button.

175
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.730
OK.

176
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.980
We do need to go back and enable two other A-P eyes so you can click this logo on the top left to go

177
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.230
back to sort of the home page for this project.

178
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.130
And then I'm going to click this button again, enable API and services.

179
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.710
This time we're going to search for one named Places API.

180
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.230
Here it is, places API.

181
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.220
Let's click on that.

182
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.320
Let's go ahead and click.

183
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.980
Enable.

184
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:06.680
OK.

185
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.910
We need to enable one other third final API so we can just use the search bar up here.

186
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.890
Let's search for geo coding API.

187
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.240
So in the results here, it is geocoding API.

188
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.210
Let's click on that.

189
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.630
Then let's click enable.

190
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.900
OK.

191
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.860
Now that we've enabled all three API that our project needs now we can actually create the key.

192
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.560
So be sure to click this logo up in the top left to go back to sort of the home page for our project.

193
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.000
And then from there, we need to click on credentials here in the sidebar.

194
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.550
Be sure to go back to the home of your project before clicking on credentials in the sidebar, because

195
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.490
we don't want it for just that final geocoding API.

196
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.830
We want it for our project in general.

197
00:11:53.540 --> 00:12:00.120
OK, but from this screen, we're going to click create credentials that should open up a menu and then

198
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.680
we're going to click this API key option.

199
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.460
OK.

200
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.390
And this is our API key.

201
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.350
I want you to select this value and copy it into your clipboard.

202
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.070
We're going to use this in our WordPress theme files in just a bit.

203
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.670
So make sure that's copied into your clipboard before moving forward.

204
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.150
And then we want to click this restrict key option.

205
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.470
OK.

206
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.550
Down here, we see application restrictions and we can choose different options here.

207
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.810
We want to click on this H.

208
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.870
TTP refers option.

209
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.840
OK.

210
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.400
Then if we scroll down a bit further, we can click this, add an item.

211
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.860
And this is where we say which domains are allowed to use the API key.

212
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.090
This would be whatever domain your local WordPress Web site has been using.

213
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.070
So most likely that's fictional.

214
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.960
Dasch University DOT local.

215
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.300
So fictional.

216
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.250
Dasch University.

217
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.690
Dot local.

218
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.270
OK, let's click this done button here.

219
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.590
Next, under this API restrictions header, I do want to restrict the key and then I can choose which

220
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.340
API is.

221
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.340
I'm just going to select these three that I currently have.

222
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.210
So geocoding maps, JavaScript and places.

223
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.890
OK, then I'm going to click save.

224
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.420
OK, now this next step might not be entirely necessary.

225
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.370
However, this helps me sleep at night.

226
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:30.450
So if some troll comes to my campus map screen on my Web site and they refresh the page five billion

227
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.360
times, I don't want Google sending me a bill.

228
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:39.930
So what I want to do now is add a quota to these services in my account so you can click on Dashboard

229
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.720
to go back to sort of the main screen.

230
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.320
And then if we scroll down towards the bottom here, we see our different API eyes.

231
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.030
Let's just click on each one.

232
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.100
So I clicked on geocoding API and now in the sidebar, we can see quota's.

233
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.780
So let's click on quota's.

234
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.400
This is just my own paranoia because I don't want Google billing me even one penny.

235
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:05.280
But I would just set these numbers to be very small so that we never go over the free threshold credit

236
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.750
that Google gives you every month.

237
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.530
So requests per day, I would just edit that to maybe 50.

238
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.320
Uncheck and limited, but 50.

239
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:19.460
Click the confirmation hit Save, and then I'm not going to bore you by showing you that every single

240
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.010
time, but do take the time to go through.

241
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.600
I'm gonna do this off camera, but I would set all of these to some very low number.

242
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.800
Be sure to scroll down on this page and do the same thing for these options as well.

243
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.350
OK.

244
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.170
That was just one of our three services.

245
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.530
So I would recommend clicking this link to go back to your main screen.

246
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.150
Scroll down.

247
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.190
So we took care of geocoding quotas.

248
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.520
I would then click on maps, JavaScript API.

249
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.520
Click on quota's in the left sidebar.

250
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.430
Do the same thing.

251
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.820
And then also come back and do the same thing for places API.

252
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.390
You probably don't need to do this, but I don't trust Google at all.

253
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.180
OK, at this point we're almost done.

254
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.100
But you do need to add Google billing before your API key will actually work.

255
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.030
So in this top left icon here, you can click on that.

256
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.620
And then that opens a menu.

257
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:12.980
You will need to click on billing here and add some sort of payment information into the Google account.

258
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:13.900
OK.

259
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.200
Long story short, though.

260
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:23.000
Once your project is associated with some sort of billing info, we are ready to take our API key and

261
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.680
jump back into WordPress.

262
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.090
So remember earlier I told you to copy that key value into your clipboard?

263
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.890
Hopefully it's still in your clipboard.

264
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.700
Otherwise, you can click on credentials here and go find it again.

265
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:40.410
But anyways, with that value in your clipboard, let's jump back into our text editor.

266
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.430
We can forget about the MSU plugins folder.

267
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.100
For now, let's jump back to our theme folder.

268
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.880
And I want you to open up functions.

269
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.180
Dot p HP.

270
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.240
Let's scroll down to the very bottom and drop down to a new line.

271
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.900
And let's say add filter.

272
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.950
And for the first argument, we want to target that advanced custom fields, plug in and let it know

273
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.620
that we have a Google Maps API key.

274
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.080
So let's say HCF, which stands for Advanced Custom Fields Slash.

275
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.570
And then let's look in fields.

276
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:23.390
We are interested in the Google map type of field and we're dealing with the API.

277
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:23.760
Okay.

278
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.400
Now, the second argument is just the name of a function that we are going to create.

279
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.190
So we could name this whatever we want.

280
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.240
Why don't we call it university map key.

281
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:35.960
OK.

282
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.790
Now if we are telling WordPress to run a function with this name, we better make sure and actually

283
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.020
create that function.

284
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.600
So let's say function and let's reuse that name.

285
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:53.030
University map, key parentheses, curly brackets within the signature for this function, within the

286
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.020
parentheses.

287
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.460
Let's give it a parameter of dollar sign API.

288
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.900
The advanced custom fields plug in will make this data available to us.

289
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.720
So now we can use it within the body of our function.

290
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.530
So let's just target that data or that array, I should say.

291
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:17.420
Let's look inside that array for a property named Key and then we're just gonna set that to equal quotes.

292
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.520
And then at this point, you can just paste in the Google Maps API key that you generated.

293
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:22.910
Right.

294
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.320
Or that Google gave to you.

295
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.170
So let's add a semicolon at the end of that line.

296
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.930
And then while we're still in the body of the function, let's just return that API array.

297
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.560
So basically, the plugin gave us this piece of data to work with.

298
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.400
We manipulated a property of it and then we'd return it right back.

299
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.410
So let's go ahead and save that.

300
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:50.420
And now if we jump back into the WordPress admen where we were editing the downtown West campus, remember,

301
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.050
previously we saw an error message on that custom map field.

302
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.320
But now if we reload or refresh the page.

303
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.120
Scroll back down.

304
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.110
Awesome.

305
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.640
The Google map is working.

306
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.990
If yours isn't working, you might just need to wait five or 10 or 20 minutes.

307
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.390
Once you've added your billing information to Google for Google to realize that your key should now

308
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:18.720
be valid, let's test it out and try to pin a location for this downtown west campus.

309
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.240
So in this textfield right above the map, you can just begin searching for your local city or town

310
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.300
or wherever you want to create this fictional university.

311
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.970
I'm going to pretend that it's in New York City.

312
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:39.380
So maybe I'll search for Manhattan, New York, then I can click on this suggestion.

313
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:46.780
And I'm saying this is downtown West, so I'm going to place a pin maybe towards the west side of this,

314
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.900
maybe right here.

315
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.020
Doesn't matter.

316
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.150
It's just totally made up.

317
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.950
But here we can see the pin.

318
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.310
So now let's go ahead and save this post.

319
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.460
And then let's go assign a location for downtown east.

320
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.770
So click on campuses, let's edit this one, downtown east.

321
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.560
Let's search again for Manhattan.

322
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.420
They will say that the eastern campus is over here.

323
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.000
Let's go ahead and update or save that post.

324
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.440
OK, so we now have two campuses with map locations.

325
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.690
So now the question becomes, if I jump to the front end of the Web site, you could imagine that if

326
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:34.270
we clicked on campuses up in the header, we would want an interactive Google map with the different

327
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.160
pins to all of our campuses.

328
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.890
So the question is, how in the world do we create that?

329
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.360
Well, that's exactly what we're going to learn how to do in our next lesson.

330
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.010
Let's keep things rolling.

331
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.180
And I will see you then.
