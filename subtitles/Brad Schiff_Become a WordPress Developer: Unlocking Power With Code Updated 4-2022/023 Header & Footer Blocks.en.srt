00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,190
In this lesson, we're going to set up the header and footer for our block theme.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,200
Let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,260
So right away, if we look at the finished product of what we're trying to build, we see that, yes,

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,370
this is our page banner.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,820
But up here, this content that doesn't exist in page banner, this is sort of the global header for

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,080
the entire website.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,660
So it has the logo or the link back to the home page and then it has the navigation and then our, our

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,660
custom buttons and our custom search overlay icon.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,750
So in this video, we're going to leverage the IP class that we set up in our previous lesson to set

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,830
up this global header.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,920
And down at the very bottom, the global footer, we're going to set them up as blocks that you can

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,010
include in any template you want, so on and so forth.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,770
So to get started implementing those in this copy of our website or this theme that we're building,

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,480
let's jump into our functions.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,890
TCP IP file.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,260
So functions TCP IP.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,320
Here we have that new placeholder block instance.

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,940
Let's just set up another one.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:12,540
So new placeholder block semicolon, let's give it a name of header.

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,050
We can save that in our our blocks folder.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,940
Let's just copy and paste in duplicate the contents of events and blogs dot js write that placeholder

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,360
block.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,560
So I'll just copy everything in that file, create a brand new file and name it heterogeneous paste

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,490
in those contents.

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,540
Let's change the name of the block to header.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,010
Let's change the title so the human readable and just be uppercase header.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,760
And then all we need to change is the placeholder text.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,670
So on this line, let's just change this to say a header placeholder.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,070
Let's give that a save.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,310
And now we just need to create a matching file.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,860
So in the our blocks folder, new file header, TCP IP.

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,580
In this new file, there's no sense in reinventing the wheel.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,020
So right now, I want you to dig in to the theme we created in the earlier chapter.

35
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,780
The original fictional university theme.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,120
And in that theme folder, we're just going to open up, header, dot up.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,630
Now, we don't want to just copy the entire file.

38
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,440
Let's start selecting from the opening header tag that has a class of site header and then just scroll

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,220
down and just select until the header element closes.

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,360
So essentially that is the entire file, but we don't need any of the dock type or the head or the body

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,780
tag.

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,030
So just the header element.

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,350
Copy that.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,830
Back in our empty header, not be file.

45
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,210
Just paste in your clipboard.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,890
Let's give it a save.

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,190
Now, back in our template editor.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,060
We can refresh and above our banner block.

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,550
You can see I currently have this hello paragraph.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,900
Let me delete that paragraph block and then I can use maybe this icon to insert a new block up in the

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,340
top left the blue plus symbol and let's search for header.

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,490
There's actually already a default WordPress block called header, so you could rename our title to

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,320
our header, but really you'll know that it's ours because it has the generic icon.

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,290
Why don't we just go ahead and change that to our header?

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,550
So back in Heterodox, you could change this to our header or you know, fictional university header

56
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,700
refresh in the template editor one more time.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,960
I mean delete that paragraph again, insert and I can search for header and there it is fictional university

58
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,350
header.

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,340
So just click that.

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,270
Woops, because I didn't place my cursor before I used this button, it placed it at the very bottom.

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:49,980
That's okay.

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,630
We can just use this toolbar that appears when you hover over a block and just use the up arrow.

63
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,970
So click that a few times.

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,460
Or don't forget, you can always use this tool as well.

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,360
This list view icon that I'm highlighting right now, you can use that.

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,030
There's our fictional university header and then you can just click and drag it to be up at the very,

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,690
very top.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,170
Perfect.

69
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,040
Cool.

70
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,020
So we've got our placeholder, then our banner.

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,150
Let's go ahead and save that and then refresh the front end of our website.

72
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,440
Perfect.

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,950
Now, before we move on and set up the block for our global footer, let's first talk about the quote

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,380
unquote, official way that you might have handled this header and footer block situation.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,780
Because I want to make it abundantly clear, this approach that we're taking, this is my own personal

76
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,920
philosophy approach.

77
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,250
This is definitely not the standard approach.

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,280
The reason I'm taking my own approach is because I don't want to create a theme that is literally nothing

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,710
but WordPress core default block types.

80
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,070
Right?

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,700
I want to create my own custom bespoke theme with my own HTML, my own CSS asked, my own custom queries,

82
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,020
so on and so forth.

83
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,230
Right.

84
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,990
We've already talked about that topic several times.

85
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,050
However, I do want you to be aware of the way that you would handle sort of a global header and a global

86
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,880
footer if you were building a theme that was more like the 2022 default theme.

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,860
So let me show you something.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,950
If you open up the 2022 default theme.

89
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,000
Here it is.

90
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,100
I just want you to be aware that you can have a folder in your theme called Parts.

91
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,110
So inside of the 2022 theme, you'll see that in that folder they have something called, for example,

92
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,320
header on each html footer dot HTML.

93
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,370
Let's look at header.

94
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,560
So there's nothing new here.

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,640
This is literally the exact same thing that you would find in a template file.

96
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,140
Right.

97
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,180
It's the HTML comments that represent Gutenberg block types.

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,810
These are all just default WordPress block types.

99
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:55,040
The idea is that you can have a combination of all of them in this part file and then you can include

100
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,580
one of these parts files in one of your main template files.

101
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,190
So for example, if you look in the templates folder and open up any of these, for example, archive

102
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,370
that HTML, you'll notice that the very first comment is just saying, hey, pull in the global header.

103
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,020
It's called a template part.

104
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,880
Pull in the one called header.

105
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,150
So that's going to pull in this file header on HTML.

106
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,090
So anyways, I just want you to be aware of this sort of quote unquote standard or official way of setting

107
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,980
up sort of a global header and footer.

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,010
Personally, with my own philosophy in the way that I use WordPress and the way that my clients want

109
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,970
to use WordPress.

110
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,870
I don't see much use at all in setting up template parts because at the end of the day it's still nothing

111
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,090
but just default block types.

112
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,800
Right.

113
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:49,010
If I'm going to be creating my own custom bespoke HTML and C SS, then I'm not going to have, you know,

114
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,910
tons of different blocks all laid out in my global header file.

115
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,660
I'm probably just going to have that one header block that you and I just set up.

116
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,920
Anyways, big picture, there's a hundred different ways that you could organize your code.

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,340
This was just something I want you to be aware of at this point.

118
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,520
Let's switch gears back to our block theme that we're building and let's go set up a block for our global

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,150
footer.

120
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,950
So if we look at the finished product of what we're trying to set up, it'll look something like this.

121
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,640
So let's just go into our functions dot AP file.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,520
And I'm just to be clear, I'm back in our block theme that we're building in this chapter.

123
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,160
And let's just set up a new instance of our new class, you know, new placeholder block.

124
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
So my call and give it a string of text of just footer.

125
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,850
Now we can just to save a lot of typing, just duplicate everything in header dogs into your clipboard,

126
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,040
create a new file in our blocks.

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,580
Let's name it.

128
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,270
Footer Dot.

129
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,990
Jess.

130
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,520
Paste in your clipboard.

131
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,720
Just change this block name to footer.

132
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,110
Let's change the human readable name to fictional university footer.

133
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,040
Finally, just change the placeholder value to say footer placeholder.

134
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,510
Give that a save.

135
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,520
We do want to create a new file named Footer TCP IP.

136
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,980
Now, in this file, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

137
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,430
Just jump into the original fictional university theme.

138
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:19,530
Open up footer TCP IP and in this file, just select the entire footer element that has a class of site

139
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:19,950
footer.

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,500
So from this opening footer tag down to right here when it closes, we absolutely do not need the IP

141
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,570
tag or the body tag or the HTML tag, just the HTML footer element.

142
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,910
So copy all of that into our clipboard.

143
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,720
Back in our block theme footer, TCP IP paste in your clipboard, give it a save and we're ready to

144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,380
test it out.

145
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,320
So in our template editor refresh.

146
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,580
Down at the very bottom here.

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,540
Let me insert a new block.

148
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's search for the word footer.

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,810
There it is.

150
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,190
Fictional university footer.

151
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,150
There's the placeholder.

152
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,340
Let's give this a save.

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,320
And if we go, refresh our front end and then scroll down to the bottom.

154
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,550
Perfect.

155
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,820
And for the final step in this video, and this has nothing to do with WordPress or programming, but

156
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,330
I'm going to take a minute or two to set up the original headline text values for the banner.

157
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,690
So back in the editor, this first large headline would be welcome.

158
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,050
And then we'd want a medium sized headline that says, We think you'll like it here.

159
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Then I want a generic heading of the small size.

160
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,620
Let me push that up to right there.

161
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,160
And it should say, why don't you check out the major you're interested in?

162
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,620
Maybe I'll make the word major.

163
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,340
Bold.

164
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,040
And then the button should say, find your major.

165
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,660
Let's save this.

166
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
And if we refresh the front end.

167
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,940
Cool.

168
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,950
Let's choose a different background image really quick.

169
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,690
And let's make sure that this button actually points where we want it to.

170
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,490
So we want it to go to slash programs.

171
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,200
If you actually tried to visit our programs page right now, you wouldn't see the content.

172
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,140
And that's just because we haven't set up, you know, the equivalent page dot template in our case,

173
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,800
because we're building a block theme that would be page dot HTML.

174
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,110
We haven't set that up.

175
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,400
We will in just about a lesson or two.

176
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,610
But that doesn't change the fact that we would absolutely want this button to point towards slash programs.

177
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,990
So how would we set that up?

178
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,760
Well, you can just click on the button, use this link icon right here.

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,650
Now, typically, you'd search for a page or post, right?

180
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,430
So, for example, if you search for the word about us, we have a page called About US.

181
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,270
And as soon as you clicked on that, well, that'll give you a value.

182
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,680
That will absolutely work.

183
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,000
In our case, there is no page or post named programs.

184
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,270
That's just the slug for our custom post type.

185
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,410
So I'm just going to type in slash programs.

186
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,420
And then this was the confusing part.

187
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,580
You actually have to push enter on your keyboard to actually use that as the value.

188
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,680
Now, if your WordPress installation doesn't live at the root of your domain, you could just include

189
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,730
the full HTP domain address here instead of just slash.

190
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,650
Either way, I'll click confirm.

191
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,800
We can save that I refresh in the bottom left corner when I hover over this button.

192
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,290
Perfect.

193
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,300
It's going to take me to slash programs.

194
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,770
Now let's talk about what we're going to do in our next lesson before we use this PHP placeholder block

195
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,930
approach that we used for our header and footer.

196
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:54,100
So before we use that on the remaining portions of our block theme, I first want to set up one last

197
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,940
piece of interactive Gsx block functionality.

198
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,570
And what I'm referring to is our slideshow.

199
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,270
So if we look at the finished product in this tab, I want our end users of this block theme to be able

200
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:14,020
to add a slideshow like this to any page, any post in any template, wherever they see fit, and they

201
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,140
could even have multiple slideshows per page.

202
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,810
The good news is we can recycle our generic heading and our generic button blocks.

203
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,620
Whoops.

204
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,340
In the finished product that I was just showing you, I had forgot to add the button to each slideshow.

205
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,590
But you get the idea.

206
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,380
So we can reuse our heading and button blocks.

207
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,430
And in terms of the background image area, well, we can reuse at least 80 to 90% of our banner block.

208
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,040
I think this will be a fun feature to build.

209
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,010
So let's keep our momentum rolling and I'll see you then.
