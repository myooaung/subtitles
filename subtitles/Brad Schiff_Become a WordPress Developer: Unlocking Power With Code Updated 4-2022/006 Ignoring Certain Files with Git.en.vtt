00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.080
Did you chose Path Beag or this more advanced way of deploying a WordPress Web site?

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.080
It's because you are already familiar with the basics of the get version control system.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.170
And if you'd like Gitte and you've made it a central part of your workflow, this means that at the

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.890
end of every day, or maybe even several times a day, you are committing your progress into your local

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.190
get repository and then pushing that up to a service like Get Hub or BitBucket.

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.460
So if that's already a habit of yours and it's something that you're doing on a regular basis, it would

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.920
be silly to not take advantage of that.

9
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.970
So why don't we set things up so that your repository is your single source of truth, meaning instead

10
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.340
of having to manually upload files to your Web host to power your live Web site.

11
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.260
Instead, let's set up your GITTE hub or BitBucket repository to automatically upload your most recent

12
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
files and changes up to the Web host for you.

13
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.520
Or in other words, anytime you update the master branch on your get hub or BitBucket repository, you

14
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.090
will also effortlessly be updating your live Web site.

15
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.660
OK.

16
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.410
And that's exactly what we are going to set up in this lesson.

17
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.020
Without further ado, let's get started.

18
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.700
OK, so the first step, if you have not already, you need to create a repository for the folder or

19
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.960
directory that is powering our local dev environment, WordPress.

20
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.560
And just to be clear, I do not mean our theme folder.

21
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.590
I mean the overall WordPress folder.

22
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.180
Let me show you what I mean.

23
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.140
So within the local app, you can right click on your project, choose, reveal in Finder, dig into

24
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
that folder, dig into app and then go into public.

25
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.380
So this is the folder you would want to turn into a repository.

26
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.780
You'll know you're in the right directory if you see folders like WP Content, WP admen and WP includes.

27
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.410
So usually what I like to do if I go back up a folder.

28
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.460
This is the folder that I would want to create a get repository out of.

29
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.480
So if I open up this folder in my V.S. code text editor.

30
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.260
Right.

31
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.190
So now on the left hand side bar, V.S. Code, I see folders like WP Admen, WP Content, WP includes.

32
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.890
I would just want to turn this entire folder into a get rebo.

33
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.530
So if I open up the command line in VSS code, you can just type get in.

34
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.620
Now you don't need to use the command line if you usually use the get hub graphical user interface app.

35
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.820
That's totally fine.

36
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.750
Just do whatever you normally do to create a new get repo, OK?

37
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.270
But just a quick note.

38
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.600
I do recommend having a get ignore file that ignores the node modules folder.

39
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.290
Remember in our theme folder we have the node modules folder and as long as our theme folder has the

40
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.530
package dot Jason file, which is like a recipe.

41
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.040
Well, we're always just one npm install command away from fetching all of those node modules from the

42
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.880
Internet again.

43
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.830
So there's no point in backing those up or including those in version control.

44
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.540
So what I like to do in the root of this new get rebo folder is just create a new file and give it the

45
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.970
exact name of DOT Gimmicked Ignore.

46
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.750
And then in that new file, I just say node underscore modules and then you can end with a forward slash.

47
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.400
Go ahead and save that.

48
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.270
OK.

49
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.630
With that in place now you'll see if I go into WP content and then themes and then our fictional university

50
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.710
theme noticed that the node modules folder is grayed out.

51
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.010
So it is not going to bother backing up those potentially hundreds of megabytes of files that we don't

52
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.800
need to backup.

53
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.870
Also, while we're in this get ignore file, we might as well also ignore the rather large files that

54
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.900
the all in one migration plug in from a couple of lessons ago.

55
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.130
We would want to ignore the huge files that it generates.

56
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.590
So on a new line, I would just say a I one w and dash backups forward slash.

57
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.150
Let's give that a save.

58
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.270
Cool.

59
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.920
So now within the WP content folder, we see that all in one migration backups folder is great out and

60
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.670
no longer being backed up by get.

61
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.670
OK.

62
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.600
Now that we've done that, you would just commit all of your new files and changes into get.

63
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.070
And then just push it up to a remote.

64
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.530
Get hosting service.

65
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.950
I'm not going to walk through the process of pushing a get repo up to a remote because if you're using

66
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.190
path B, you're supposed to be familiar with the basics of get.

67
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.600
Having said that, you will want to be using either get hub.

68
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.490
Or BitBucket, both of these services are excellent and they both offer free private repose.

69
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.160
So when you set up your rebo on either get Hubb or BitBucket, make sure that it's private.

70
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.870
We absolutely want a private rebo, not a public rebo, because remember, our WP config file contains

71
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.120
our database username and password.

72
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.440
So we would absolutely never want that file to be publicly viewable.

73
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.180
So I can't stress that enough.

74
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.230
Make sure your repo is private, but then go ahead and push your repo up to your service, which is

75
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.550
either GitHub or BitBucket.

76
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.610
OK, once you've done that and your repo now lives in your GitHub or BitBucket account, that means

77
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.460
we're ready to move on to the next step, which is to set things up so that anytime you update your

78
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.090
get Hobb or BitBucket repo, your updated files will get automatically uploaded to your Web hosting

79
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.050
account for you.

80
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.870
Now, in order to set this up, we are going to want to use a third party deployment service.

81
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.770
And there are tons of these different services out there to choose from.

82
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.420
Let me show you just a few.

83
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.040
So first, there is deploy HQ.

84
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.930
This is actually what I'm going to use in this course as a demo because they have a nice free plan.

85
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.420
Even in addition to the free trial, there's a permanent free option where you can have one project

86
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.900
and make 10 deployments per day all for free.

87
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.100
OK, there's another deployment service named Deploy Bot.

88
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.000
We use this service at my last job for all of our projects.

89
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.830
I have nothing but good things to say about deploy bought, but we are not going to use it in this course

90
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.920
because they do not offer a free account.

91
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.120
And I don't want you to have to spend any extra money right now when you're learning.

92
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.400
OK, and then an example of another service is F.T. Ploy.

93
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.480
F.T. Ploy is a bit barebones.

94
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.660
It doesn't have as many features as the other services, but it does offer a nice free plan.

95
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.910
The free account gives you one project and you can make unlimited deployments per day.

96
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.180
Now, there's way more than just these three services out there.

97
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.160
But this gives you a good idea that there's a lot to choose from out there and you're free to make your

98
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.820
own decision.

99
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.210
But just for the sake of following along with me in this course, I encourage you to give deploy HQ

100
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.750
a try.

101
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.650
So right now, go ahead and pause this video and sign up for a completely free deploy HQ account.

102
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.530
And just for the record, I am not in any way affiliated or partnered with Deploy HQ.

103
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.750
I'm just a fan of their service and they conveniently offer a free account to learn with.

104
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.940
Anyways, go ahead and pause this video and then resume it once you've signed up for a Deploy HQ account.
