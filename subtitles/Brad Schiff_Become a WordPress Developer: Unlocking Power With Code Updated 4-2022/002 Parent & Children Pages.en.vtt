00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.400
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.240
In this lesson, we will learn how to adjust our theme templates to account for parent and children

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.960
pages.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.450
So, for example, imagine under our About US page, we want two new children pages named our history

5
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.250
and our goals.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.080
Now, before we update our theme to reflect parent child page relationships.

7
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.620
Let's first go and actually create the two children pages over in the word press admon area.

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.840
So let's add a new page.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.200
Let's title this one our history paste in a bit of dummy content.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.910
And here's the important part.

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.200
Over in the right hand side bar, not under the block menu, but instead under the document menu.

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.610
Well, down towards the bottom, we see page attributes.

13
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.490
And if we click onto that, we can then choose a parent.

14
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.720
So instead of no parent, let's set it to be about us.

15
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.260
OK, then let's go ahead and publish this page.

16
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
And just for good measure, let's create another new page and let's call this one.

17
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.710
Our goals, dummy content over in the sidebar.

18
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.540
Tell the parent to be about us.

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.080
Let's save that.

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.830
OK.

21
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.870
So we've created the two pages, but now we need the front end of our Web site to actually reflect those

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.820
parent child relationships.

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.550
So, for example, if we use this permalink here to visit the Our Goals page, our focus for this lesson

24
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.380
is this breadcrumb box.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.630
Now, at the moment, it is entirely hardcoded.

26
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.560
Right.

27
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.530
So this shouldn't say our history.

28
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.490
It should say the name of the current page, which is our goals.

29
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.800
So right now, let's dig into our theme code and make this breadcrumb box dynamic.

30
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.030
So in our text editor within our theme folder, let's open up page dot, BHP.

31
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.570
And from the top, if you look below this page banner div, you'll then see a container.

32
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.160
And right below that, this div with a class of meta box.

33
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.230
That's the breadcrumb box.

34
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.480
So you can see towards the end of this div we have hardcoded our history.

35
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.470
So why don't we begin by deleting that, hardcoded our history.

36
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.370
And instead we can drop in to P.H. P to output the title of the current page.

37
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.570
So let's just call the function named the title.

38
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.000
Cool.

39
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.130
So that makes this text dynamic.

40
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.180
Next, let's set things up so that this entire breadcrumb box only appears on child pages.

41
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.780
Right.

42
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.480
Because it makes sense that we would want a link back to the parent page.

43
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.870
But once you are back on the parent page, there is no need for this box.

44
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.300
So back in our text editor, we only want to display this metal box div or this breadcrumb box div if

45
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.630
the current page being viewed is a child's page.

46
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.830
Now, the first step to achieving that is by using something in BHP called an if statement.

47
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.780
So do this with me right above this div with a class of metabolics, right above that.

48
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.610
Let's add a new line and let's drop in to BHP.

49
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.370
And within BHP, let's write our first if statement.

50
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.860
So we just type out the word if.

51
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.260
And then a pair of parentheses.

52
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.550
And then a pair of curly brackets.

53
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.370
OK.

54
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.000
Now, whatever we place within the curly brackets will only occur if whatever we place within the parentheses

55
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.690
is true.

56
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.020
So let's work through an example in the curly brackets.

57
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.810
Let's maybe echo out a phrase that says the sky is blue.

58
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.920
OK.

59
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:06.760
And now within our parentheses on this line, let's say if two plus two equals sign equals sign four.

60
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.530
So this will always be true.

61
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.860
Right.

62
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.500
Two plus two will always equal four.

63
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.250
So because our condition within these parentheses is true, BHP will run whatever we place within the

64
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.270
curly brackets.

65
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.100
So save and refresh.

66
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.110
Here we see the sky is blue.

67
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.030
But if we change our condition to two plus two equals seven.

68
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.650
That is false.

69
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.980
Right.

70
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.270
So because it's false, the code in the curly brackets will no longer run.

71
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.660
So now you can see we are missing.

72
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.560
The sky is blue.

73
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.690
So what we want to do is come up with a condition instead of two plus two equals something.

74
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.540
We want our condition to be if the current page has a parent page.

75
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.060
Right.

76
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.320
Because if it does, that means it's a child page.

77
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.350
Now, in order to find out information about a page like that, we are going to need to review a WordPress

78
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.890
topic named Post I.D..

79
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.350
So what in the world is a post I.D.?

80
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.650
Well, the easiest way to explain that is to jump into your WordPress admon screen and begin editing

81
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.990
any existing post or page.

82
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.290
And I want to direct your attention up to the address bar.

83
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.250
Whenever you're editing a post or page towards the end of the U.

84
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.410
RL, you will see a number.

85
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.530
And that is the unique numerical I.D. for that poster page.

86
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.580
In my case, my our goals page has an idea of twenty four.

87
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.400
And if I go check out the main about US page.

88
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.220
In my case, it has an I.D. of 16 in your WordPress Web site.

89
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.220
It might have a different I.D. number, but that's not important.

90
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.540
What is important is that each page in Post has this unique number.

91
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.590
And back in our code, we can use that unique I.D. number to find out information about a page or post.

92
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.430
So right now, I want to show you a few WordPress functions we can use that are related to post I.D..

93
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.610
So for the time being, let's delete this if statement.

94
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.860
So now we just have this empty BHP section, and I want you to type this out with me.

95
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:23.020
Let's go out the results of a WordPress function named Get the Eye Deep and notice the I and D are capitalized.

96
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.080
But if we save that here we see a 16 on the about us page.

97
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.090
And if we go back to the our goal screen, we see a twenty four.

98
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.990
Cool.

99
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.350
So this get the idea function will give us the I.D. of the current page that's being viewed.

100
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.020
But that's not exactly what we're interested in.

101
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.860
We want to know if the current page has a parent page.

102
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.780
So instead, let's do this.

103
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.160
Let's delete this line.

104
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.190
And instead, let's echo out the results of a WordPress function named WP.

105
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.680
Get post parent Aidid.

106
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.010
And this function will do exactly what it says it will do.

107
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.630
So within the parentheses, we give it an idea for a page or post.

108
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.660
And this function will respond by giving us back the I.D. number for that pages parent.

109
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.710
So, for example, if we were on the our goals page and we wanted to find the idea of this page's parent,

110
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.570
well, this page itself has an idea of twenty four.

111
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.350
But instead of hard coding that number, we want this to be dynamic.

112
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.510
So to get the idea of the current page.

113
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.590
Remember the function.

114
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.280
Get the I.D..

115
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.770
So altogether, what this line of code is saying is get the idea of the current page reviewing and then

116
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.280
WordPress.

117
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.960
We want you to use that number to look up the I.D. of its parent page.

118
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.440
So if we save this and refresh, we see a 16.

119
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.540
And remember, that's the idea of my parent about us page.

120
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:04.570
And if we go to that about us parent page, the number we see is zero.

121
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.290
And that's because this page about us doesn't have a parent.

122
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.870
So this function WP get post parent I.D., it will return zero.

123
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.570
If a page doesn't have a parent and if a page does have a parent, we just get the idea of that parent

124
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.170
page.

125
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.250
Now that behavior will play very nicely with an if statement.

126
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.750
Let me show you what I mean.

127
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.170
Let's bring this full circle and get back to an IF statement.

128
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.300
But before we go ahead and delete this line, I want you to copy part of it to your clipboard.

129
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:40.930
So beginning from the W at the start of this function name and then all the way right before the semicolon.

130
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.570
Let's copy this part in your clipboard.

131
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.970
So we don't have to type it again in a few seconds.

132
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.870
Cool.

133
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.440
So now let's go ahead and delete this line and let's put everything together.

134
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.500
So let's write an if statement.

135
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.050
If parentheses curly brackets within the curly brackets.

136
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.610
Let's go out and say I am a child page.

137
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.620
Now, within the parentheses, right after the F for our condition.

138
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.360
I want to show you something neat.

139
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.020
So we already tried.

140
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.200
Two plus two equals.

141
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.660
And then four would be true.

142
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.250
And then some other made up.

143
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.840
No, this would be false.

144
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.360
But obviously we don't always want everything to be a mathematical equation that evaluates to true or

145
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.020
false.

146
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.050
ENPI, HP and many other programming languages.

147
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.640
There's a special boolean value if you say true.

148
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.230
That will obviously evaluate to true.

149
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.420
So we see.

150
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.800
I am a child, Paige.

151
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.760
You could also say false.

152
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.620
But beyond that, what's neat is simply a value of zero.

153
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.500
We'll evaluate to false.

154
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:49.370
Right.

155
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.580
So now we do not see.

156
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.670
I am a child, Paige.

157
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.970
And any number such as one or any number that's larger than that.

158
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.590
We'll evaluate to true.

159
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.990
I am a child page.

160
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.770
So here's the cool part for our condition, we can just paste in our clipboard because remember, this

161
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.740
function will give us the I.D. of the parent page.

162
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.760
And if the page doesn't have a parent, it returns a zero.

163
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.670
And if it's a zero, that evaluates to false.

164
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.210
Cool.

165
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.090
So now we finally have a bit of code that will only run if the current page is a child page.

166
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.800
So we're on the our goal screen and we see I am a child page.

167
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.680
Go to the main about us parent page.

168
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.390
We don't see that message.

169
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.520
So now all we need to do is move this div with the class of metal box.

170
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.470
This is that little breadcrumb box.

171
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.580
Let's just move this H.T. Amelle to live within the IF statement.

172
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.870
So let's do this.

173
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.460
Let's delete this echo.

174
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.820
I am a child page.

175
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.210
And right above it on this line.

176
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.890
Right after the curly bracket.

177
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.290
Let's drop out of P HP.

178
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.080
And down this line when the curly bracket ends right before that, let's go back into P HP.

179
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.370
So now on this line where my cursor is, we can have regular old HDMI out.

180
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.030
So now let's just cut and paste this metal box.

181
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.440
Breadcrumb box.

182
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.700
Cut it.

183
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.490
And then let's paste it right here.

184
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.450
Cool.

185
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.470
So let's save that.

186
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.690
And I'm on the about a screen.

187
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.430
Now, we no longer have that breadcrumb area.

188
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.450
But if I go back to the our goals page.

189
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.200
Cool.

190
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.010
There it is.

191
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:33.600
The next thing we should work on is adjusting this so that the words about us are not hard coded.

192
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.150
Right.

193
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.100
Because what if we were on a child page that didn't belong to about us?

194
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.840
For example, down in our footer, remember, we created a privacy policy page.

195
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.430
So let's click on that.

196
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.020
And what if we had a child page that belonged to privacy policy?

197
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.150
Well, in that case, we wouldn't want our template to have this about us.

198
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.750
Title hardcoded.

199
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.390
Instead, we would want this to dynamically pull in the name of the parent page.

200
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.540
Now, before we write the P HP code to achieve that.

201
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:10.900
Why don't we first go and create an actual privacy policy child page so that things will be easy to

202
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.340
test and see if they're working.

203
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.300
So back in the admen section, I will use the add new button.

204
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:24.220
And let's just create a new page and maybe call it cookie policy paste in a bit of dummy content.

205
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.950
And the important part is that we want to set the parent to privacy policy.

206
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.800
OK, so let's save this.

207
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.850
And now if I use this permalink here to view that new page.

208
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.180
Cool.

209
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:43.880
So there's the title Cookie Policy, but this back to about us link doesn't make any sense.

210
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.510
Instead, it should say back to privacy policy.

211
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.830
So right now, let's right a bit of P.H. peek code to make this dynamic.

212
00:12:52.070 --> 00:13:01.100
So let's delete this hardcoded about us and instead let's drop in to BHP and let's echo out the results

213
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:06.260
of a WordPress function named get the title.

214
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.180
Now, this function name sounds very similar to the function.

215
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.010
This just the title.

216
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.850
The difference between these two functions is that the title will output the title of the current post

217
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:27.320
or page, whereas get the title allows you to pass in an I.D. number in these parentheses and it will

218
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.670
give you the title for that post instead of just the current post that you've looped through.

219
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.960
So we don't want to hard code a numerical I.D. here.

220
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.500
We want this to be flexible.

221
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.250
Let's just place an X just as a temporary place holder.

222
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.280
And we will circle back to this in just a moment.

223
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.130
For now, let's shift our focus onto the H.

224
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.030
RF attribute.

225
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.300
We want to replace this hash tag with a U.

226
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.630
RL that points to the parent page of the current page.

227
00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:01.550
So within those quotes, let's drop into P HP and let's echo out the results of a function named Get

228
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.080
Permalink.

229
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.700
So this function is similar to get the title instead of being limited to just the current page, a post

230
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.660
that we've looped through.

231
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.170
We can pass it a number or an I.D. and it will give us the permalink for that post or that page.

232
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.320
So let's also just place an X here as a placeholder.

233
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.440
And now all we need to do, instead of having an X here in here, we just need to use the same I.D.

234
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.320
number that we created up here with these two functions.

235
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:30.920
Right.

236
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:38.120
Remember this WP get post parent I.D. function will give us the I.D. of the current page's parent page.

237
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.110
Now, this code that I'm highlighting right now is a lot to type.

238
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:48.380
So we probably don't want to have to type that out again here in here instead, right above this F line.

239
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:55.430
Why don't we create a variable that stores this numerical I.D. and then we can just access that variable

240
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.240
again and again.

241
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.660
So let's create a variable and we can make up the name.

242
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.810
Let's call it the parent.

243
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.430
The name doesn't matter.

244
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.600
We're just making something up that we can remember.

245
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.430
And we just want it to equal the number that this function generates.

246
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.380
So it lets just copy and paste this or you can even cut and paste it.

247
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:15.790
Right.

248
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:22.040
So now the parentheses for the if statement will be empty and we can say that our variable equals that.

249
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.340
And now we can use this variable in three places.

250
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.440
We can use it as the condition for our IF statement.

251
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.300
So we can say if our variable.

252
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.150
Right, because if it's a zero that will evaluate to false.

253
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.230
It'll work just the same as this is just less typing this time around.

254
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.390
And then, as you might have guessed, we can use that same variable where our X place holders are.

255
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.660
So right here, let's delete the ex and just say the parent.

256
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.590
And let's do the same thing for this ex.

257
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.380
So get the title and then the parent.

258
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:02.920
And then if we save this and refresh our cookie policy page, which is a child, the privacy policy,

259
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.490
when I refresh now we see back to privacy policy here.

260
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.200
And if I click on that.

261
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.940
Cool, it successfully takes me to the parent page.

262
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:19.920
And if I go up into the address bar and visit the about us, our history sub page or child page.

263
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.550
Cool.

264
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.990
We see back to about us.

265
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.900
And if we click it, the link indeed works.

266
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.750
Now, at this point, you might be asking yourself, how are visitors of the Web site supposed to navigate

267
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.160
to the child pages?

268
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.550
Right.

269
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.470
We're on the about us parent page.

270
00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.280
And nowhere do we see links to the two children pages.

271
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.710
Well, that is the exact issue that we are going to fix and work on in our next lesson.

272
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.310
We will learn how to add a sidebar menu right about here that automatically includes links to any and

273
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.750
all children pages.

274
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.670
It should be a lot of fun to code out.

275
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.080
Let's keep things rolling.

276
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.810
And I will see you in the next lesson.
