Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.780
In this video, I want to talk about the different ways in which you can work through this course.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.130
Let me explain what I'm referring to.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.800
So as of March 20, 22, I've just added a multiple hour long new chapter about something called block

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.960
themes and full site editing.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Those two concepts are new in the world of WordPress for the better part of two decades.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360
The concept of what a WordPress theme is has stayed relatively the same.

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
Sure, it's evolved over the years, but the heart of how themes worked always stayed the same.

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.220
Well, until now, with WordPress version 5.9 that launched in the beginning of 2022, these two new

10
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.310
concepts of foresight, editing and block themes have completely changed what a theme is and what a

11
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.120
theme isn't.

12
00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.840
With that in mind, some of you may be tempted to only want to learn the newest features and concepts,

13
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.500
and so you may be tempted to skip way ahead to the new chapters on full site editing and block themes.

14
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.330
And while I completely understand that temptation, I still 100% encourage you to work through the entire

15
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.850
course.

16
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.010
Here's why.

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.580
You may hear some people lately saying you don't need to write up to create WordPress themes any longer.

18
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.640
And while that's technically true, if you just want to create super, super, super basic themes,

19
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.070
it's far from universally true.

20
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.390
Let me explain.

21
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.840
So first of all, before we even get into the concept of simple sites versus complex sites, if you're

22
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.750
new to WordPress, it's hard enough to learn all of the vocabulary and concepts of, you know, different

23
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.550
post types and custom fields.

24
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.970
And I can't imagine learning all of that for the first time while simultaneously trying to learn about

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.060
these new concepts of block themes and full site editing.

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.120
So right away, I think there's value in working through the traditional chapters of this course so

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.270
that you can first master all of the core concepts right before getting overwhelmed with the new features.

28
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.020
But even beyond that, if you want to create really custom blocks or themes and you want to use your

29
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.790
own HTML and see RSS, and especially if you want to use your own custom queries that rely on relationships

30
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.620
between different pieces of content.

31
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.310
For example, a professor has a relationship to a certain subject they teach, and that subject has

32
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.920
a relationship to a certain campus that it's taught at.

33
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.150
Or really just.

34
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.290
If you want to implement any sort of actual complexity into your site and theme, you are still 100%

35
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.030
going to need to learn PHP and sort of the more traditional way of doing things.

36
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.240
Or even if you do want to build the theme that's super, super simple, the traditional chapters in

37
00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.720
this course, they will familiarize you with the overall WordPress template hierarchy and all of those

38
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.230
file names and concepts they all carry over to.

39
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.060
When you're creating a new block theme.

40
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.940
Now, big picture, if you do really want to skip ahead to the new block theme and full site editing

41
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.010
content, you are free to do that.

42
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.230
But if you go that route, I would at least recommend you first walk through the plug in development

43
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.090
chapters in this course.

44
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.760
The plug in development chapters will at least teach you about the basics of creating your own custom

45
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.050
block types and the basics of modern JavaScript in WordPress.

46
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.480
However, if you're not in a huge hurry, if you're not in a big rush and you just want the deepest

47
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.970
possible understanding of WordPress development, I encourage you to just work through the course in

48
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.780
its entirety.

49
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.750
I'm excited to have you come along on this journey with me.

50
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.010
Now let's get to work.
