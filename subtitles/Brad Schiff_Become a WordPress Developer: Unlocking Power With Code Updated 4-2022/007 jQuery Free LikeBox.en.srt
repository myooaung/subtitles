Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,230
This video is a quick update that I'm filming in June of 2020.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,440
So in this chapter, you and I just completed the life feature for Professor Page.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,570
However, we wrote this JavaScript using J query.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,060
So right now, I want to provide you with an alternative version of the file that does not use J query.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,580
So the file we're looking at right now.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,390
This is what we wrote together and this uses J.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:29,980
Query.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,220
But in this window, this is a version of the same module that I wrote that doesn't use J.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,690
Query.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,360
You can find this file available for download in the associated resources for this lesson.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:50,310
This new file is a 100 percent compatible drop in replacement for our existing like Dot J.

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,970
S file.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,000
So I can just select everything in this new file copied into my clipboard back in the existing like

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,300
J.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,920
S just delete everything pasted in hit save.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,250
As long as your NPM run dev task is running in the command line, that will automatically rebundle things

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,490
up.

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,300
I can refresh to make sure my event handling is not doubling up and if I click this like box it toggles

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,010
the like or removes my like.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,400
And if I click it again it adds it back on.

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,420
Perfect.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,390
Now in terms of the JavaScript, there's really nothing new to review in this code that we haven't already

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,700
reviewed in the other two.

25
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,180
J.

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,720
Query free lessons.

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,600
So once again, in the constructor, I'm wrapping things in an IF statement because I only need to run

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,470
this JavaScript.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,250
If we're on a page that contains an element with a class of like box, I've set the WordPress nonce

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,910
access code just once up here globally.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,810
So then that way down below in the create request and in the delete request, I don't have to provide

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,590
it each time.

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,890
Other than that, the code largely stayed the same.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,570
OK.

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,840
That's going to wrap up this video.

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,620
I strongly encourage you to download and use this drop in replacement file as not including Jake Query

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,770
in our project will result in a smaller final bundled file that our visitors need to download.

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,870
OK, let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next one.
