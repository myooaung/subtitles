00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.650
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.020
In this lesson, we're going to focus on the remaining templates that are block theme needs.

3
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's jump right into the action.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.690
So here's what I'd like to begin with up in the navigation, if I click on programs.

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.320
Well, it looks like a blog listing, but you can see the quote unquote blogs that are listed are biology,

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.000
English and math.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.080
Now, those are indeed the programs that I have on this Web site.

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.320
Now, visually, they are displayed like a blog post.

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.340
And that's because a block theme is very similar to a traditional theme in the hierarchy or the way

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.740
that it chooses which template file to use.

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.050
So just like with a traditional theme, the indexed or indexed on each HTML template, that file is

12
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.320
used as the generic or fallback template for any URL that doesn't have a more specific template provided.

13
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.110
So for example, it's trying to display our custom post type of programs using the indexed HTML template.

14
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.710
So to fix this and make this page actually look like a list of programs instead of a list of blog posts,

15
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.800
all we need to do is create a specific template named archive dash program.

16
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.760
Right.

17
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
In other words, a template for this specific custom post type.

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.260
So let's go do that right now in our text editor, in our block theme within our templates folder.

19
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.220
We would just create a new file, a name of archive dash and then the custom post type name.

20
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.470
So Archive Dash program.

21
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.160
So this is the exact same name that you would have in a traditional theme.

22
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.750
Only now it's ending in dot.

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.590
Each HTML code now in this file.

24
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.810
Let's begin with the header in the footer and then we really just need to customize the block in the

25
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.260
middle.

26
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.590
So I would just jump into single that HTML.

27
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.960
Just copy that.

28
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.350
You don't have to type this in again.

29
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.600
Paste it into our brand new file.

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.960
And in this middle block, even though we haven't created the new block yet, let's look for a block

31
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.650
named program archive.

32
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.740
Let's give that a save.

33
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.260
And now let's just go create a new custom block type with this name program archive.

34
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.740
So I would start out in functions dot up just create a new placeholder block new placeholder block semicolon.

35
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.340
The name is Program Archive.

36
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.870
Let's give that a save.

37
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.060
Now we just go into our blocks, create a new file named program.

38
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.070
Archive dot Jess.

39
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.800
In this file, we can save a ton of typing by just borrowing code from a similar file.

40
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.700
So I would just jump into footer dot J.S., copy everything in there, paste it into the new empty program

41
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.140
archive JavaScript file.

42
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.170
Let's change the block variable name here to program archive.

43
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.330
Change the title to fictional university program archive.

44
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.970
And finally change this placeholder text.

45
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.730
So program archive.

46
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.450
Placeholder.

47
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.860
Let's give that a save.

48
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.720
And now finally in the Our Blocks folder, we need a new file named program.

49
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.540
Archive TCP IP.

50
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.050
Now again, this file is where we don't reinvent the wheel.

51
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.900
This is where we borrow code from our original theme.

52
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.030
So I would just switch to that window.

53
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.890
Fictional university theme.

54
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.930
I would look for the file specifically named archived dash program.

55
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.630
Dot up in that file.

56
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.230
We don't need the header, so I would just select from page banner.

57
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.380
Down to this closing date, we do not need the footer.

58
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.580
So just copy that.

59
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.780
Back in our block theme window in this empty new file.

60
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.630
Just paste in your clipboard up at the very top.

61
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.030
Be sure to have an opening p tag.

62
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.740
Let's give this a save.

63
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.690
And now if we go refresh this slash program's URL.

64
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.280
Perfect.

65
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.210
Now it actually makes sense for a list in alphabetical order with all of our posts from the programs

66
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.810
post type.

67
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.200
So now what's the next logical template we should work on?

68
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.630
Well, if you actually click on one of these links.

69
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.220
So biology that takes you to the single URL for just that post.

70
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.130
And you can see this is using the template for a single blog post, not a single program.

71
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.280
So to fix this, we would just go into our block theme.

72
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.680
In the templates folder, we would just create a new file named single dash program dot HTML.

73
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.240
In that new file, we just want the header, the footer and then the middle block.

74
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.430
So again, I would just jump in to single out HTML and copy this so I don't have to type it in.

75
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.620
Just paste it into the new file.

76
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.350
Let's change the name of the middle block.

77
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.890
So it would be single program.

78
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.530
Let's give that a save and go create that new block.

79
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:12.680
So in functions dot php, new placeholder block semicolon, single program.

80
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.050
Let's give that a save.

81
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.980
And then in the our blocks folder, it's a new JavaScript file.

82
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.400
Single program dot J.S..

83
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.730
Just borrow code from any of the other simple placeholder blocks.

84
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.480
So for example, header or footer dot jesus paste that into the new file.

85
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:41.590
Let's just change the variable name to single program fictional university single program in single

86
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.940
program placeholder.

87
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.140
Let's give that a save.

88
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.910
Finally, just create a P file.

89
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.690
So in the our blocks folder new file single program dot p.

90
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.260
This is where we borrow code from the original theme.

91
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.240
So switch back to that window.

92
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.600
Look for a file called single dash program.

93
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.120
Dot up at the top.

94
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.170
We do not need the header.

95
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.420
I would just begin selecting at the start of this while loop I'd scroll down to the very bottom.

96
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.410
And the last thing I want is this closing up curly bracket.

97
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.430
I don't need the footer, so I just copy that into my clipboard back in our empty file pasted in at

98
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.940
the top.

99
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.930
Make sure that we have a P tag just like this.

100
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.700
Let's give that a save.

101
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.400
If we refresh this single URL.

102
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.540
Perfect.

103
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.550
So we now have a little bit of intro content.

104
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.140
The breadcrumbs makes sense for a program we have related professors.

105
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.220
So that additional query based on metadata or relationship data that's working biology is available

106
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.160
at these campuses.

107
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.840
Perfect.

108
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.710
Why don't we go ahead and actually click on one of the professors?

109
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.640
So this is the single use rule for a professor post type.

110
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.670
Let's go ahead and set up the template for a single professor so that it's not using the single template

111
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.840
for a blog post.

112
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:12.230
So back in our theme in the templates folder, I would just create a new file named single dash professor

113
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.580
dot html.

114
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.810
In this file, I would just borrow the code from single program.

115
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.300
Just paste it in on this middle line.

116
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.530
Change this to single professor.

117
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.230
Give that a save, then go into functions.

118
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:35.210
Dot B Create a new placeholder block semicolon with a string value of single professor.

119
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.630
Save that and we just go into the blocks folder.

120
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.520
New file single professor dot Jess.

121
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.790
We can just borrow the code from single program paste today and change this to single.

122
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.870
Professor fictional.

123
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.950
University single.

124
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.390
Professor.

125
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.840
Change the placeholder value.

126
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.720
Save that.

127
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:04.210
Finally, the last step create a new file in our blocks named single professor TCP IP.

128
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.340
This is where we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

129
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.020
So back in our original theme, I would jump in to single professor TCP IP.

130
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.090
We don't need to get headers, so I would start with the while loop down at the bottom.

131
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.680
I would end with the closing curly bracket.

132
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.380
Copy that.

133
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.120
Back in our new empty file.

134
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.660
Just paste it in up at the very top.

135
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.780
Be sure to have the opening IP tag and let's test that out.

136
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.920
So if we refresh.

137
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.580
Perfect.

138
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.840
There is the professor portrait image, the heart feature where you can like a professor and then down

139
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.410
at the bottom.

140
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.020
Subjects taught biology in English.

141
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.890
Perfect.

142
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.690
At this point, this process we've been working through is getting very repetitive.

143
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:53.300
So I'm not going to bore you by walking through every single template that you would set up.

144
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.210
But I am going to walk through one more example, and that is the My Notes page.

145
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:06.680
So when you click on my notes, the URL of my notes, this is a WordPress page with the slug of my notes.

146
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.250
Now the actual content of the page is irrelevant.

147
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.560
You might remember that the interface that's supposed to appear here, that's powered by the template

148
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.520
file itself.

149
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.560
So this will be our last example.

150
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.490
Let's go ahead and set up this template for the My Notes page in feature.

151
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:30.140
So back in our block theme in the templates folder, we create a new file named page dash.

152
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.140
And now this is just like a traditional AP theme.

153
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.820
It's page dash and then it's the URL slug of the particular page you're interested in.

154
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.450
So that would be my dash notes.

155
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:48.920
And then the extension is dot html in this file, I'm just going to borrow the typical header footer

156
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.840
middle block so I don't have to type it out.

157
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.580
Paste that in.

158
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:58.130
Let's change this to be simply called my notes.

159
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.290
Let's give that a save and go set it up.

160
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.760
So in functions dot BHP.

161
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.040
So I have a new placeholder block.

162
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.100
So my column, the string value is my notes.

163
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.780
Save that in our blocks, create a new file my notes dot jess I would borrow code maybe from header

164
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:26.420
not just paste it in let's change the names of my notes, fictional university, my notes and finally

165
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.280
my notes placeholder.

166
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.890
The last step is in our blocks.

167
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.920
New file named My Notes Dot up.

168
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.450
Let's go find the code that we would copy and paste right here.

169
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:45.170
So in our original theme, I would look for the file named page my notes dot P in this case because

170
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.560
I do want to keep this if check to make sure that you're logged in.

171
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.670
And if you're not logged in, I want to redirect you away from the My Notes page.

172
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.300
Well, because of that, I'm just going to select everything in this file.

173
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.690
So control A or command A, select it all, copy it all.

174
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.750
Back in the empty file we're working with.

175
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.950
Go ahead and paste it in.

176
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.190
But then let's just go ahead and get rid of this git header line.

177
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:13.340
So I'll delete that and then we'll also scroll down to the bottom and get rid of the get footer line.

178
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.450
Cool.

179
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.810
Let's go ahead and save that and then test it out.

180
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.700
So if I refresh the my notes page.

181
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.320
Cool.

182
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.620
I'm logged in with a user account, so I should be able to create a new note.

183
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.250
So I'll see.

184
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.800
Example new note number for Lorem ipsum.

185
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.580
Create the note.

186
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:34.980
Bolt.

187
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.340
There it is.

188
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.670
You can refresh just to prove the point that it actually saved.

189
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.230
I can edit it.

190
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.380
So if I add maybe a few exclamations, click save.

191
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.100
Cool.

192
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.680
I can also click delete and if I refresh just to prove the point, cool, it's actually gone.

193
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:56.820
However, in this window I'm using Firefox a different browser and I'm not logged in, but if I manually

194
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.280
type in the URL of my notes and push enter to actually visit it, you can see it just redirects me back

195
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.000
to the home page.

196
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.810
Perfect.

197
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:10.740
So the idea here is that that custom logic that we already wrote in PHP, we don't need to throw it

198
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.380
away just because we're creating a block theme now.

199
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.810
We can absolutely still leverage it.

200
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.300
And in my opinion, we're not really losing out on anything because it's not like the end user would

201
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.290
necessarily want to totally customize this interface.

202
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.250
Right.

203
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.290
I don't think there's much value in the end.

204
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:35.550
User using full site editing to drag the submit button here to set above the input fields, you know,

205
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.540
or to change the font size of this, create new note text.

206
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.860
So in other words, I realize this placeholder block system, this is 100% just my own personal approach,

207
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.270
my own personal philosophy.

208
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.610
But I've had excellent luck using this approach at this point in the lesson.

209
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.100
We've repeated that process enough times now that I think you're familiar with it, and I think there's

210
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.270
no educational value.

211
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:06.690
And it would just be boring to record myself creating those placeholder blocks for every single template

212
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.070
that you can imagine.

213
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:15.090
So it's totally up to you if you want to finish 100% converting our original theme into a block theme

214
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.990
and you really want to set up templates for every single URL.

215
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:26.250
Well, the downloadable zip file for this lesson will include every single template that was in our

216
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.150
original theme.

217
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.820
So in other words, if I go back into verse code and look at the original theme we built together,

218
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.270
right?

219
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.000
We set up templates for everything imaginable.

220
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.580
Archive Campus Archive Event.

221
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.520
We had page past events, single campus, single event, so on and so forth.

222
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.990
So if you really want these, that's okay.

223
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.340
I will include these.

224
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.710
I will perform the boring work of converting all of these into block types, and you'll be able to find

225
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.680
those in the downloadable zip associated with this lesson.

226
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.760
Having said that, that is going to bring this lesson to a close.

227
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:06.690
Now, looking ahead to our next lesson, I want to show you how you can restrict which block types can

228
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:12.120
be used in the full site editor versus in the typical post or page editor.

229
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:12.930
Right.

230
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:19.380
In other words, maybe when the user is editing a blog or a page, you would want to let them use any

231
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.760
block type imaginable.

232
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:26.820
But maybe when they're using the full site editor and editing a template, you want to limit which blocks

233
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.960
they're allowed to use.

234
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.870
Well, we can absolutely set that sort of thing up.

235
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.640
It's not very complicated at all.

236
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.730
It's just a little bit of code in functions dot php.

237
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.350
I think that'll be fun to set up.

238
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.960
Let's keep things rolling and I'll see you then.
