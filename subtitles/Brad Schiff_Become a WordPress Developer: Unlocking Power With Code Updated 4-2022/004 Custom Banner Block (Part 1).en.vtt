Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.960
In this lesson, we're going to start working on our banner block.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.970
Let's jump right into the action.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.770
So we are not going to be able to finish the entire block in a single lesson.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.750
So our more specific goal for this particular lesson is to just get the admin side of the block to look

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.880
like this stylistically.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.380
So basically we just want this exact h html and cc in the editor screen, right?

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
In the spirit of the what you see is what you get philosophy in this lesson.

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.830
We're not going to be worried about making it.

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.440
So you can actually click on the text and edit it or click on the background image and provide a new

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.850
uploaded background image will add those features in future lessons.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.250
In this lesson, let's just get sort of a static copy of this html insists to load on the admin block

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.090
editor screen.

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.870
Cool.

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.950
So how do we move forward?

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.950
Well, there are many different ways that you can organize your files and folders and code while creating

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.210
your own block types.

18
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.220
So which approach are we going to take?

19
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.080
Well, let's talk about that.

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.340
If you are going to distribute your theme and make it available to lots of people, you do not want

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.820
to include custom block types in your theme.

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.840
You would instead want to build your blocks as plugins.

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.050
That way, if people want to switch to a different theme, there is no theme lock in, right?

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.030
All of your blocks would still work because there are plug ins even if someone switches to a different

25
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.330
theme.

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.070
However, we've already learned in this course how to create a custom block type as a standalone plugin,

27
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.910
right?

28
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:53.220
So we've already built the are you paying attention quiz block and we've already created the featured

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.640
professor meta value relationship plug in block.

30
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.000
We set those up in a completely independent fashion so that their success, their JavaScript, their

31
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.540
entire code will work no matter which theme you're using.

32
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.810
We've already spent the time to absorb those ideas, and I think in this chapter it would really just

33
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.180
slow us down to build things that way.

34
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.930
In other words, blocks that are our own independent plug in.

35
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.340
So it's really up to you to be aware of which type of theme you're building.

36
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.220
Are you building a theme that you intend to either give away for free or sell to a lot of people?

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.290
Or are you building a theme where it's for a client and it's a very custom bespoke theme and there's

38
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.090
really no distinction between the website itself and the theme, right?

39
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.140
If you're building a bespoke WordPress website for a client, a lot of times the theme is the website,

40
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.660
you know, with 100% certainty.

41
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.670
There will never come a time where, you know, the non web developer, owner of the website just going

42
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.680
to go in and switch to a different theme.

43
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.940
That will never happen.

44
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.610
Now that's the approach I'm taking with this fictional university theme and website, but it's totally

45
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.210
up to you.

46
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.180
Depending on your project, it might make more sense to make your blocks available as plug ins, but

47
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.760
that's not the route we're going to take in this chapter.

48
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.900
In this chapter, right within our text editor, our files and folders, I'm just going to include all

49
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.210
of our blocks in our theme folder.

50
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.120
This approach is going to save us a lot of time, and more importantly, it's going to let us use all

51
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.890
of our brain horsepower on understanding block themes and full site editing.

52
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.490
Right?

53
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.880
Instead of wasting brain horsepower on constant context, switching between different plugin folders,

54
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.310
you know, different windows of vs code, activating and registering the different plug ins, so on

55
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.000
and so forth.

56
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.440
So just be aware of that.

57
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.040
I encourage you to follow along with this approach I'm going to use.

58
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.350
And then at the end of this chapter, if in the real world you're going to be building themes that you

59
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.900
distribute to lots of people, that's fine.

60
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.620
You will have learned all of the block based theme concepts.

61
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.960
You'll understand full site editing, and it should be very easy for you to take those concepts and

62
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.470
then simply split them up into plug in folders like we've already learned how to do back in the chapters

63
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.260
when we built these to block plug ins.

64
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.280
Cool.

65
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.090
So right now let's move forward and let's start creating our first custom block in our fictional block

66
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.900
theme folder.

67
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.020
Let's go ahead and create a subfolder.

68
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.340
Now, the name doesn't matter.

69
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.450
You could make up any.
