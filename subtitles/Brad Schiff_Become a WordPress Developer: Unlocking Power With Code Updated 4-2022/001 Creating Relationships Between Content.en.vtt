00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.380
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.500
In this lesson, we are going to create a brand new post type named program.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.470
A few examples of a program post would be math, biology, English.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.400
And we are also going to learn how to create a relationship between a certain program and a certain

5
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.150
event.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.470
So, for example, on the home page here, we see an event named Poetry Day.

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.220
And you could imagine that we would want to associate that with the English program or Major or the

8
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.600
Science of Cats event.

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.320
We would probably want to relate that to the biology program.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.110
And then once we've established that relationship between one post and another, then it's a piece of

11
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.990
cake to create HDMI links so visitors can hop back and forth between all of the related content.

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.600
But first things first before we worry about creating relationships.

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.560
Let's first go and create that brand new post type of program.

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.910
So in your text editor, instead of your theme folder, I want you to open up the AMMU or must use plugins

15
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.480
folder.

16
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.030
And you'll remember we created a P HP file where we registered our event post type.

17
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.380
And now that we've created one post type, it's very easy to create another.

18
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.620
We can literally just copy and paste this code.

19
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.880
Now we don't want to copy and paste the actual function itself.

20
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.210
We are interested in the register post type function.

21
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.580
So just select from the very beginning of that down to the ending semicolon down here.

22
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.620
Copy that.

23
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.200
And then just drop down a few lines and to stay organized.

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:48.610
We can add a P HP comment and maybe say program post type and maybe right above this one we can add

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.640
a comment to stay organized and say event post type.

26
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.340
OK.

27
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.190
But then down here for the new program post, I just paste in your clipboard and now we can just go

28
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.510
through and change a few key values.

29
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.690
So this first value of event, let's change that to program.

30
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.370
Right.

31
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.450
That will be the post type keyword in terms of the features that we want to support.

32
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.520
Title and editor makes sense.

33
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.050
But I don't think programs will need an excerpt so we can delete that.

34
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.840
This line controls the u r l slug for the archive that will show all programs.

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.260
So let's change this from plural events to plural programs.

36
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.760
OK.

37
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.290
The next thing we want to customize would be the labels values.

38
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.610
So just change the plural name from events to programs.

39
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.480
Add new item should be add new program.

40
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.120
Edit program all programs.

41
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.910
Singular name, just program.

42
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.070
And then for the menu icon.

43
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.460
Remember, if you want to choose one yourself, you can always just Google for WordPress Dasch icons.

44
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.660
But in this case, I think one that will make sense is named Dasha Cong's Awards.

45
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.310
OK.

46
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.560
So that's all we need to do.

47
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.360
So as soon as we save this.

48
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.530
Back in our word, press, admen, we now see this brand new item in our sidebar named programs.

49
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.910
So right now, let's go ahead and create maybe three or four dummy sample programs.

50
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.020
So add new let's title this first one math.

51
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.280
Just paste in a bit of dummy lorem ipsum content.

52
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.680
Go ahead and save that.

53
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970
Let's create another program posts.

54
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.240
So click add new call this one biology.

55
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.020
Save it and let's create one more.

56
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.150
And I will name this one English.

57
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.030
And now, at the moment, if I try to use this permalink to preview or view this new post.

58
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.930
We don't see any content.

59
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.740
And up in the title for this tab, we see Page not found.

60
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.080
The problem here is that we just registered a new post type that uses a new U.

61
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.940
RL or permalink structure.

62
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.130
So all we need to do to fix things is tell WordPress to update its permalink system.

63
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.400
So in the ad, men hover over setting's towards the bottom of the sidebar and then click on Permalink

64
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.800
as.

65
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.790
And as soon as we click save changes on this page, that will force WordPress to regenerate all of its

66
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.090
perma links, or you are Elles.

67
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.050
And as soon as we refresh this example English program post cool, we see English and the main content

68
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.530
field.

69
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.050
Now, at the moment, we can see that this screen is using the generic blog post template.

70
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.740
Right.

71
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.500
Because we can see a link here back to the blog home.

72
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.420
So right now, this screen is being powered by single dot p AHP.

73
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.200
But we probably want to go ahead and create a dedicated template file just for individual program posts.

74
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.030
So in our text editor, we can forget about the must use plugins folder for now.

75
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.120
Let's switch back over to our theme folder and let's go ahead and create a brand new file in the root

76
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.260
of our theme folder.

77
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.960
And let's name this new file, single dash program, Dot p HP just to test things out.

78
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.420
You can type one, two, three.

79
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.490
And if you refresh, you can see.

80
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.910
Cool.

81
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.230
Our English program page is indeed using that template file.

82
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.530
So back in our text editor instead of just one, two, three.

83
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.700
Why don't we copy and paste the contents from single dash event as a guide or a starting point.

84
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.600
So jump into single event and I'm just going to copy everything into my clipboard and then back in the

85
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.940
brand new single program, just paste it in.

86
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.660
So if you scroll up to the top, the first thing we want to customize is the meta box div.

87
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.930
So for example, instead of this link here saying events home, let's change it to all programs and

88
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.570
then have it linked to the program archive screen.

89
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.600
So here's the text that reads events home.

90
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.880
Let's just change that to all programs.

91
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.510
And then here's the H ref.

92
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.780
Right.

93
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.150
So that's where users will go when they click on the link.

94
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.360
So currently it's get post type archive link.

95
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.160
And then let's just change the argument from event to program.

96
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.910
Cool.

97
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.400
So let's say that I'm on the English program page, but now I can click on this.

98
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.870
All programs link to see a full listing of all of them.

99
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.080
So English, biology, math.

100
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.120
However, we can see that this screen is using the generic blog listing style.

101
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.650
Right.

102
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.050
This formatting and information makes sense for blog posts.

103
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.870
But when it comes to programs, we don't care who they were posted by or the date that they were created

104
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.200
on.

105
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.730
At the moment, this U.

106
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.810
RL of slash programs is being powered by the generic archive.

107
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.390
Dot p hp file.

108
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.050
So why don't we create a new file that is only responsible for the program's archive to back in our

109
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.890
text editor.

110
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.860
Let's create a brand new file in our theme folder.

111
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.420
Let's name it.

112
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.790
Archive dash program DOT BHP.

113
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.470
You can always type.

114
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.550
Hello World.

115
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.870
Just as a test to see if that file is indeed powering the U.

116
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.520
RL that you're hoping it does.

117
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:39.320
And instead of typing things out from scratch, why don't we use archive event as a starting place to

118
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.610
jump and archive event?

119
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.030
BHP copy everything into your clipboard.

120
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.090
Back in the program archive pasted in.

121
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.580
But scroll up to the top.

122
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.860
Let's change this large headline.

123
00:07:51.890 --> 00:08:02.570
So instead of saying all events, let's say all programs and let's change the subtitle to there is something

124
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.890
for everyone.

125
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.140
Have a look around.

126
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.990
Let's say that, OK.

127
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.850
Looking good.

128
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:16.880
But when it comes to actually formatting and displaying the programs, we definitely don't want to display

129
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.140
them as events.

130
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.320
I think in this case we would just want to list with nothing but the title of each program.

131
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.180
So back in our new archive program, THP File.

132
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.880
Here we see the while loop.

133
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.030
Let's go ahead and delete the div.

134
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.350
Right.

135
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.700
That's being output once for each item.

136
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.570
So that begins here and ends here.

137
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.100
OK.

138
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.770
So now we have a mostly empty while loop.

139
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.520
And on this line, right after the the post line, let's create an H.T. email list item.

140
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.400
And then within that, let's create a link.

141
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.060
And the text that people will click on should just be the title.

142
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.130
So let's drop in BHP and say the title.

143
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.160
Let's give the link element and atrip attribute.

144
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.890
And we want to drop into BHP and call the permalink.

145
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:10.700
OK.

146
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.130
Now this line of code will be repeated once for each program.

147
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:20.510
But when it comes to H t Amelle, we probably want this list item to live within an unordered list.

148
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.360
So right above this while loop BHP code, I'm actually going to delete.

149
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.850
This empty line here, right above this block of BHP.

150
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.980
Let's open up in each TSL unordered list tag.

151
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.390
OK, and then right after this block of P HP that's going to loop, let's close out the unordered list.

152
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:49.800
Now, just in terms of styling and graphic design, why don't we give the unordered list a class of

153
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.230
Lync dash list.

154
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.830
And another class of men list.

155
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.110
This has nothing to do with functionality.

156
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.350
It will just make things look nice with a bit of CSX.

157
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:01.880
OK.

158
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.070
So let's save that and check out our new archive.

159
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.450
Looks good.

160
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.040
Next.

161
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.960
Let's go ahead and delete this text down here.

162
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.800
That is about events and not programs.

163
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.780
So dot the very bottom of our new archive file.

164
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:23.370
We can go ahead and delete this paragraph of text and also the H.R. horizontal rule element next.

165
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.520
Why don't we order the programs alphabetically?

166
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.750
And let's also be sure to set the posts per page to negative one.

167
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.700
So even if we had 80 or 90 or 100 programs, they would all be listed on this one individual page.

168
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:45.840
So to adjust this query, our first instinct might be to go into our archive file and right before the

169
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.060
while loop write a custom query.

170
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.990
But we know that from previous lessons, if you're almost satisfied with the default, you are ell based

171
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.530
query.

172
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.070
You don't need to completely overwrite it with a brand new query.

173
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.760
Instead, you can just suddenly manipulate the default query.

174
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.320
So let's go that route.

175
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.870
To do that, instead of our template file, let's jump in to our theme folders, functions, dot, p,

176
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.490
HP and down at the very bottom of this file.

177
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.150
Remember, we created this function named University.

178
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.610
Adjust queries.

179
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.300
This is where we manipulated the event archive query.

180
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:29.580
And you'll remember that we wrapped that entire bit of code in an IF statement so that we only manipulate

181
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.860
the query if we are not in the back end.

182
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.280
Admen and we are on the event post type archive.

183
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.050
And it's the main query.

184
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.870
So in this case, if we want to manipulate the program's query, what we can do is just write above

185
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.860
this if line.

186
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.740
Let's just create a new if statement.

187
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:55.400
And in the parentheses for our conditions, let's begin with exclamation is admen.

188
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.950
This function is admen will return true if you're in the back end admen portion of the Web site and

189
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.700
then we can check for the opposite of that with an exclamation in front of it.

190
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.180
So this will only evaluate to true if we are on the front end of our Web site, let's say, and and

191
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.650
check for another condition.

192
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.480
Let's say is post type archive.

193
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.510
And for the argument, let's say program.

194
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.270
Right.

195
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.520
Because that's our post type.

196
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.400
Let's tack on one more condition check.

197
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.560
And only if this is the main query.

198
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.710
OK, so now we've created the perfect condition check.

199
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:40.590
So then within the body of this if statement, if we get back to the task at hand, remember, we want

200
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.930
to order this alphabetically.

201
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.270
And we also want to override the default posts per page of 10 to infinity.

202
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.230
So within our IF statement, let's begin by looking inside the query object that WordPress will pass

203
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.130
to our function.

204
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:04.680
And let's call the set method and let's start by targeting the order by parameter and set it to title

205
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.160
so that they will be organized alphabetically by the title.

206
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.010
It's on a semicolon target query object again.

207
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.280
Call the set method.

208
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.200
Let's set order to be sending instead of descending.

209
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.570
OK.

210
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.900
And finally, let's target query one more time.

211
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.740
Call set and let's say posts per page.

212
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.780
And the default is 10.

213
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.330
But instead let's set it to negative one.

214
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.800
So even if we have 100 programs, they will all be listed at once.

215
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.360
So let's save that.

216
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:40.320
Cool.

217
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.040
Looks good.

218
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.320
So at this point, we've got the basics of our program post type up and running.

219
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.210
We've got a list of programs.

220
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.260
And if you click on one, here's a detailed screen for just biology.

221
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.420
Now, let's try something interesting.

222
00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:02.190
Let's try to create a relationship between this biology program and the event.

223
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:08.880
If I click on events, let's try to relate the Science of Cats event with the biology program.

224
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.500
Let me show you what I mean.

225
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:18.210
So if we go into our admen dashboard and if we click on events in the sidebar, here is the science

226
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.380
of Cats Post.

227
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.870
And wouldn't it be nice if this event post had another custom field down here?

228
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.200
Named related program.

229
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.320
And then you could choose from all of the program posts.

230
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.790
And that way on the front end of the detail from the science of cats.

231
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.950
We could have techs down here that says related program biology.

232
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.820
And then you could click that to be taken to the biology program page.

233
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:50.450
And then on each program page, we could have a section that says upcoming biology events or upcoming

234
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.590
math events.

235
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:58.130
OK, but the key here is the custom field that we need to create that lets you pick which post you want

236
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.470
to relate with the current post that you're editing.

237
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.970
I realize everything I might have just said over the last minute or two might be hard to follow.

238
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.700
But let me put it all into perspective for you.

239
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.450
So follow along with me towards the bottom of our sidebar.

240
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.520
Let's click on Custom Fields and let's go ahead and create a new field group.

241
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:23.390
So add new let's title it related program.

242
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.810
And then in terms of fields, we just need one field.

243
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:36.830
So let's click this ADD field, let's title it related program and then maybe in parentheses X, meaning

244
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.470
you can choose to relate it to more than one program.

245
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.990
If you want to for the field name, why don't we get rid of the parentheses just so it's easier to remember

246
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.530
and type.

247
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.280
OK.

248
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.600
And now here's the really important part for the field type option.

249
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.840
We definitely do not want the default of text.

250
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.000
So let's click on this field type.

251
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.840
And if you look down a bit, you'll see an area called relational.

252
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.040
And underneath that section, let's click relationship.

253
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.870
OK.

254
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.890
Next, we can leave the instruction field blank.

255
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.730
Next, we can leave required, set to know.

256
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.160
Now, the next option is important.

257
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:22.760
Filter by post time, since the purpose of this field is to establish a related program.

258
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.180
We would only be interested in program posts here.

259
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.920
So if we click on this field.

260
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.150
Be sure to click.

261
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.280
Program from the list.

262
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.040
Next.

263
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.190
We don't need to filter by taxonomy for the filters option here.

264
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.670
Let's go ahead and get rid of post type and taxonomy.

265
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.830
So just leave search checked.

266
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.610
OK.

267
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.280
All of these other options look OK by default.

268
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.590
We can definitely leave the return format to post object, the default setting here.

269
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.330
Let's continue to scroll down.

270
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.870
And now we're interested in the location section.

271
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:04.790
So we see show this field group only if and let's say if the post type is equal to.

272
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.450
And then for this third field, let's change it to event.

273
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.400
Right.

274
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.920
If we're editing a generic blog post or page, we don't need to see this custom field to relate it to

275
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.550
a program.

276
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.460
So we're limiting it to just event posts.

277
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.730
Now, let's go ahead and scroll up and click publish.

278
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.040
OK.

279
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.670
Now, this is where things get fun.

280
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.270
Let's go try to edit the Science of Cats event again.

281
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.740
So events.

282
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.770
The science of cats.

283
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.070
Scroll down a bit.

284
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.720
Check out this new custom field, it's named related programs.

285
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:47.530
And this Left-Hand column will let us choose between any and all program posts at the moment.

286
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.710
We just have the three, right.

287
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.410
Biology, English and math.

288
00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:56.740
So if I want to relate this post to biology, just click on it and you can see that gets moved over

289
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.910
to the right hand column.

290
00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.100
So if I wanted to relate this post to multiple programs, you can just click on all of them.

291
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.760
But obviously, I don't want those so I can click here to delete those.

292
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.160
OK.

293
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.680
So I'm happy with this column.

294
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.400
I only want to relate this event post to the biology program and now I can go ahead and save this post.

295
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.600
And now the question becomes, how do I use that custom field value on the front end of our Web site?

296
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.190
Right.

297
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.840
So on this, the science of cats detail screen.

298
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.320
How would I output a bit of text down here that reads This event is related to the biology program?

299
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.610
Well, that's exactly what we're going to learn how to do in our next lesson.

300
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.960
Let's keep it rolling.

301
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.070
And I will see you then.
