00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,280
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:10,420
In this lesson, we're going to set up the HTML preview for a professor within the edit screen.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,210
Let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,500
So in the previous lesson, we set up this area for the public front end.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,730
But now in this video, back on the edit screen, we want to include that same template for the professor.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,080
Right.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,370
Sort of a preview right here.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,270
And it will update each time you change this to a different value.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,090
Now, trust me, I know that I've said the following about 50 times in the course so far, but perhaps

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:43,330
out of all the examples, it rings the truest here, and that is that there are no less than a hundred

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,440
different ways that you could set this up.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,240
There are so many different ways that you could blend JavaScript in B to get the job done here.

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,720
I believe they all have their own pros and cons.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,680
If you're aware of a perfect approach here, please do let me know.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,090
But right now I'm going to explain the approach that I'm going to take and why.

16
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:11,440
So because this block here is a react component and we have the power of X at our fingertips.

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,490
Our first instinct is probably to try and rebuild the same HTML interface.

18
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,250
Right.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:27,280
So this layout using X, so we would pull in the dynamic values from JSON, from the rest API and use

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,840
JSC for the overall HTML skeleton to put it together.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,910
And while that approach would work, it's far from ideal because we'd then be duplicating our code.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,920
I really do not want to have to spell out the exact same HTML layout or template once in.

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,480
And then once in Jacks.

24
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,280
I just want to spell out the template once and now whether that's B or I don't really care, but I only

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:06,250
want to spell it out that one time now JSON JavaScript are super cool, but ultimately we do want server

26
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:13,990
side rendered HTML for our public front end for search engine optimization reasons, for accessibility

27
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,200
reasons, so on and so forth.

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,450
Now if we were not talking about block types and we were just talking about WordPress websites in general,

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,230
there is a way to define a template in JSM and then also have it work for server side rendered HTML.

30
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,600
But that's completely outside the scope of this course and what we're trying to build in terms of block

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,170
types.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,090
If that sounds like something you're curious about, though, you might want to perform a Google search

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,520
for something called Front Tity.

34
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,390
So it's a react framework for WordPress, but this is a completely separate topic and really you would

35
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,750
need to build your entire website and strategy around front.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,810
Anyways, the reason I even bring front party up at all right now is because it would allow you to define

37
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,350
your templates just once in acts.

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,590
And then not only have that being used on the client side, but also the server side rendered HTML.

39
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,660
However, we're not going to build an entire website with frontages.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,090
We're just building a block type.

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,920
Also, most Web hosts, or at least most affordable basic web hosts are not going to let you run a node.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,560
Jessopp alongside your WordPress site.

43
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,150
In other words, unaffordable basic web hosts.

44
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,630
There is no way to have your JSM be used on the server side.

45
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,110
This is my super long winded way of saying that even though it might not feel like a modern, trendy,

46
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:46,960
cool best practice, I'm going to use the P p rendered HTML for our On the fly prevue within the editor.

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,580
OK, so we've established that we're going to recycle and leverage our generate professor HTML function

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,300
again here.

49
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,690
But now the question is how do we want to deliver the results of that into our react component to display.

50
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,770
For example, remember this command in the console, you don't need to do this, but if I run this command

51
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,910
that's going to give us this JSON or this array of objects and if you expand one, it has these default

52
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,720
properties.

53
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:25,600
But you and I could very easily use P p to add on a new property and we can name it something like Professor

54
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:33,480
HTML and just have it be that big string of HTML and then we could immediately access that and use that.

55
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,900
However, I'm not going to go with that approach because what if we had 70 or 80 professors?

56
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,740
And when we initially load this list for all of the professors, do we really want all 70 or 80 of the

57
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,130
objects to have that extra property with potentially five or 10 kilobits of HTML?

58
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,350
Well, no, we would not want that.

59
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,570
We only need to load that HTML for this specific one that you choose.

60
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:09,930
Or click on so what I'm going to do is just create my own totally new custom rest API endpoint.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
Let me show you how we can set that up.

62
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,570
So in our text editor jump into featured professor.
