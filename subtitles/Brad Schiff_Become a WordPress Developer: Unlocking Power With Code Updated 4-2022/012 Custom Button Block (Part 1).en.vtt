Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.390
In this lesson, we're going to start building our custom button block.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.310
Let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.440
So here is our template editor.

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.820
Here's our banner block.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.710
And you could imagine that maybe right about here someone would want to add a button.

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.700
Now, yes, WordPress does have a core or default block called Buttons and you could use that, but

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.870
that's not the point here.

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.240
So imagine that we wanted to build something way more complex than just a link, right?

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.980
Maybe you would want to take matters into your own hands and create your own custom block.

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.270
So really we're just practicing the process of creating custom blocks.

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.500
Try not to get too focused on the fact that it's just a button.

13
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.350
Anyways, here's how I would get started.

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.630
We've already done most of the heavy lifting.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.090
For example, if we jump into our functions dot AP file and you scroll down to the very bottom, well,

16
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.000
we can just create a new instance of J BLOCK.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.760
So new line, new J as X block, parentheses, semicolon.

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.120
Let's give it a name of generic button.

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.280
Let's give that a save before we even go create the new JavaScript file.

20
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.070
Before we forget, let's go into our banner file.

21
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.050
So in our blocks, banner tags and in the edit component.

22
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.110
So it's around line number 34.

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.310
Let's not forget to update the allowed blocks that you can nest inside of Banner BLOCK to include our

24
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.090
new button.

25
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:44.470
So in this array, just comma and then quotes the namespace our block theme slash generic button.

26
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.270
Give that a save.

27
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.930
Cool.

28
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.130
We can close this file.

29
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.990
Now let's just go ahead and create our new JavaScript file in our blocks.

30
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.030
In that folder, let's create a new file name in generic button.

31
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.550
Jess We can save a ton of typing by just jumping into generic heading, selecting everything in this

32
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.670
file, copying it into our clipboard, and then just paste that into generic button up at the very top.

33
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.540
We can leave the namespace the same, but let's update the block name.

34
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.960
So instead of generic heading, it would be generic button.

35
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.350
The title would be generic button.

36
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.510
These attributes look great.

37
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.480
We are going to need to store the text and the size.

38
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.400
A bit later we'll add an attribute called color, but we can cross that bridge when we get to it.

39
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.010
Let's go look at the edit component.

40
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.090
Really, all we need to change here is on the rich text component.

41
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.500
Let's set the allowed formats to just be an empty array.

42
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.820
So empty square brackets.

43
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.210
Let's change the tag name from H1 to an element.

44
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.170
Write a link or a button and then let's change the class name.

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.460
So the base class should be beaten instead of headline.

46
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.590
And then instead of headline dash, dash, this would be BTN Dash Dash.

47
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.130
Okay, now let's go look at the save component.

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.360
So we do not need this function called create tag name.

49
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.280
We can delete that function and we actually don't need to return rich text here.

50
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.520
The only reason we needed to use rich text like this in our save component is if you actually have inner

51
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.130
nested elements like a strong tag for bold or an m tag for italic.

52
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.670
Right?

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.550
In this case, we're not allowing any bold or italics or nested HTML, so we don't need to use rich

54
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.020
text content here.

55
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.640
Instead, we can literally just return an element.

56
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.340
Let's set the ref to just a placeholder.

57
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.660
Hash tag will deal with the link value a bit later on for the class name.

58
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.570
I would just borrow this code so I would select from class name until the end of the curly brackets

59
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.380
just like this.

60
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.970
So paste that here inside the opening and closing a tag.

61
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.000
So right here it would just be curly brackets, props, not attributes, dot text.

62
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.610
Let's give this a save and test it out.

63
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.010
Well, actually, before we can expect anything to happen when we save this file, we do need to go

64
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.860
into our package JSON file and on our start script or start task.

65
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:25.630
Just scroll over to the very end of the line at a space and let's say our blocks slash generic button

66
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.970
dot Jess cool with that save in place now start up a fresh instance of NPM run start.

67
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.980
So let me go back into the template editor and refresh.

68
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.080
And just click anywhere, maybe in the empty space of the banner block.

69
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.090
Now you have this plus symbol here.

70
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.340
Let's choose generic button.

71
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.970
So then you can just start typing.

72
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.760
Click me.
