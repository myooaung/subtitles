Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.770
This should be a pretty short lesson, and I just want to make a couple quick edits to our campus post

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.950
type and then we can change gears in our next lesson.

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:21.130
OK, so first let me navigate to an individual campus screen so campuses and then maybe click on downtown

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.760
West.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.440
All right.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.500
Now, the first thing I want to do is make an edit to the template that powers this screen.

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.350
So in our text editor, let's jump in to single campus and back in the browser, you'll notice that

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.980
the last thing on this page is this programs available at this campus section.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.090
So back in our text editor, if we scroll down here, we see the related programs query and here's the

11
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.790
end of the related programs, HTML.

12
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.370
But then even below that, we see another custom query that's pulling in events.

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.910
Now, the reason this is here is because we created this single campus template by duplicating single

14
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.960
dash program.

15
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.140
Now, if you want extra credit or extra exercises to work on, you can go ahead and try to create a

16
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.470
relationship between campuses and events.

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.110
But for the sake of keeping this course moving forward and not being too repetitive, I'm not going

18
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.680
to walk through that right now.

19
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.050
So that means there's no reason for me to have this extra query in my template.

20
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.120
If we're not actually using it, it's just going to slow down our website.

21
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.650
So I'm just going to go ahead and delete this custom query as well as the while loop code.

22
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.170
OK, so now the final in this section is our related programs, and we can still leave reset post data

23
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.090
just to be safe.

24
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.390
OK, so we got rid of that unnecessary code.

25
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.750
That was our first goal.

26
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.450
My only other goal for this lesson is if we jump back to the all campus archive screen, I want to make

27
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.350
sure that even if we had 20 or 100 different pins and campus posts that they would all display on this

28
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.920
screen because remember, by default, WordPress is only going to query 10 posts at a time.

29
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.100
Now, in actuality, we only have two posts, but I want to make our code flexible.

30
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.020
So in order to tell our campus archive to query all campus posts, let's go into our functions file.

31
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.860
And in this functions file, let's scroll down to the very bottom.

32
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.800
And if you scroll up just a tiny bit from the bottom, you'll see we have a function named University

33
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.270
Adjust queries.

34
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.450
And you might remember that this block of code is customizing the program query and this block of code

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.900
is customizing the event archive query.

36
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.480
So why don't we just go ahead and duplicate this block of code that's for programs and change it a bit

37
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.430
to be for campuses.

38
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.040
So select this copy.

39
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.990
It may be right above it.

40
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.350
Paste it in the statement condition.

41
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.280
We are saying if you are not in the admin, so if you're on the front end of the website and the current

42
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.350
post type is and let's change it from program to campus, and as long as it's the main query, if all

43
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.430
of that is the case, then do this.

44
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.490
So in this case, we do not need to worry about ordering by title so we can delete that.

45
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.720
And we don't need to set the order to be ascending so we can delete that.

46
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.390
But we do want to leave this line in place.

47
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.630
Right.

48
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.670
We want posts per page to be negative one because that will pull in all posts.

49
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.640
However, just to test this out, just to make sure that this is targeting the right screen and you

50
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.350
are, well, why don't we temporarily set this to one and save this?

51
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.420
And then if we refresh the screen, hopefully once we refresh, there will only be one pin.

52
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.360
Cool, so we just see one pin for one post, so that means this code is indeed working.

53
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.570
So now let's just set it back to negative one and now we can sleep at night knowing that this archive

54
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.660
screen is flexible and will work just fine even if we have 40 or 50 campuses.

55
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.550
And that's going to bring this lesson to a close.

56
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.120
I promised it would be short.

57
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:25.280
Now, in our next lesson, we are going to change gears and start working on our live search results

58
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.260
powered by JavaScript.

59
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.240
And this is probably going to be the most exciting and fun to work on part of the course.

60
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.730
Let's keep it rolling and I will see you then.
