00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.520
Hello, everyone, in this lesson, we will set up an interior page template, what in the world do

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.330
I mean by that?

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.530
Well, for example, this is our home page, but when someone clicks on a generic page, like about

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.270
us up in the header or privacy policy down in the footer, we will need a generic page template to power

5
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.150
those pages.

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.890
So in this lesson, we will work on integrating this custom design of ours into our themes.

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.040
Page file.

8
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.010
Now, in case it wasn't clear from the last lesson, by the end of this course we will have made everything

9
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.350
on this home page dynamic and be pulling from real WordPress content.

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.310
But for the time being, let's leave this static home page as a placeholder and let's focus our attention

11
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.020
on interior pages.

12
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.350
OK, now let me show you what I'm referring to when I say interior page template.

13
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.580
So in that new folder that we downloaded in our previous lesson, University Static Master, if we look

14
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.870
inside that folder, there is a file named Interior Dash Page Dot HTML.

15
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.100
And if we go ahead and drag that file onto a new tab in our Web browser.

16
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.350
We see a template that we can use for the majority of our WordPress pages now before we start integrating

17
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.660
this HTML into our theme.

18
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.340
Let's first jump in to our WordPress admin area and let's create a couple of new pages just so you and

19
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.650
I are synched up.

20
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.750
So from the sidebar, let's hover over pages and click add new.

21
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.630
For starters, let's create a page named about us and for the content.

22
00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.790
Let's just say this is the about page content and then maybe paste in a bit of lorem ipsum dummy text

23
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.870
and then let's save or publish this, OK?

24
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.560
And now let's go set up a privacy policy page.

25
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.540
We can actually just go back to the main dashboard.

26
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.960
And under the pages screen you can see that WordPress has already created a privacy policy, but it's

27
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.310
in a draft state.

28
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.880
So if you just click into privacy policy, it already has a bit of placeholder content that WordPress

29
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.300
added.

30
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.210
We just need to publish this.

31
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.830
So up in the top right corner, let's click publish.

32
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.380
And now we can use this permalink to preview the page.

33
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.760
So here we see the title and here we see the content, so it's working, but it doesn't look quite right.

34
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.570
This is not a very pretty page template, right.

35
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.330
So instead, we want to use this as our page template.

36
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.660
So to do that, I want you to open up the folder that we downloaded in the last lesson and open up interior

37
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.700
page HTML in a text editor.

38
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.520
All right.

39
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.350
So towards the top of the file, right after the opening body tag, we see this header element and we

40
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.020
already integrated that in our previous lesson.

41
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.180
So let's scroll down below that.

42
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.890
And right when that header element ends, we see a new div begin that has a class of page banner.

43
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.040
So this is where we want to begin copying and pasting.

44
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.460
So let's place our cursor at the very beginning, right before that div opens up and then let's scroll

45
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:37.820
down, keep scrolling, keep scrolling and around line 60 or 70 you'll see a div of the class of page,

46
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.350
section, page, section beig and that corresponds with this area in the template.

47
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.360
We don't need that for now.

48
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.970
For now.

49
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.120
Let's just copy and paste over this top section.

50
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.120
So back in the text, Ed, I'm going to hold down the shift key on my keyboard and click right here.

51
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.450
Cool.

52
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.840
Now with that selected, let's copy it into our clipboard and then we want to paste it into a file that

53
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.300
lives in our theme folder.

54
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.930
So within your WordPress theme folder that we've been working in, go ahead and open up page in your

55
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.790
text editor.

56
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.610
OK, so we still want to begin with our header.

57
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.110
We still want to end with our footer and we still want to use the while loop in between.

58
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.890
But we don't want to output this test placeholder HTML that says this is a page, not a post.

59
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.270
OK, so let's delete that line of HTML and let's also go ahead and delete the H2 html headline below

60
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.430
it and we can also delete this, the content function, OK.

61
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.040
So at this point we still have a while loop.

62
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.410
We are still calling the the post function, which will get all of the appropriate data ready for us

63
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.140
from the WordPress database.

64
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.050
We're still closing out of here and opening up here, which means right where my cursor is right now,

65
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.980
we can add HTML.

66
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.490
So just go ahead and paste in your clipboard.

67
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.690
And if we save this and refresh in the browser within our WordPress site, back on the privacy policy

68
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.930
page, we've got that template in place.

69
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.230
And now we can just start hollowing out some of the static content and replace it with WordPress functions

70
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.450
that will pull in dynamic content.

71
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.440
For example, let's begin with this large page title headline.

72
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:36.820
So F at the very top of page P within this page banner section here we see an H1 headline with a hard

73
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.910
coded value of our history.

74
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:48.750
So let's just delete our history and instead drop into P and call the function named the title.

75
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.790
Cool.

76
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.500
So if we refresh now we see privacy policy, which makes sense since that's the page we're on next.

77
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.090
Let's work on hollowing out this main content field area.

78
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.100
So back in the text editor, if we scroll down just a little bit here, we see a div with a class of

79
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.690
generic content.

80
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.880
And what we want to do is just delete and hollow out all of the paragraphs inside it.

81
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.980
OK, and instead of those hard coded paragraphs, we just want to drop into P and call the function

82
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.800
named the content.

83
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.450
And if we save and refresh, perfect.

84
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.290
Now we see this is the privacy policy content.

85
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.760
Next, let's address this sidebar menu of links that we see here.

86
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.160
We are not ready to set this up yet.

87
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.670
So for the time being, why don't we just comment it out?

88
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.080
Let me show you what I mean.

89
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:54.880
Back in page P on this line where we just called the the content function right above that, we see

90
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.200
a div that has a class of page links.

91
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.720
So this is the div that is creating that sidebar menu.

92
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.800
And if we want to comment it out right above it, we can just say less than symbol, exclamation, dash,

93
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.490
dash.

94
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.070
So that begins the comment and then let's end the comment right when the div ends.

95
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.010
So it's just dash dash greater than to end the comment.

96
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.370
So this way we leave this code in place so we can work with it in just a couple of lessons from now.

97
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.630
But on the front end of our website, it's now hidden.

98
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.440
Cool.

99
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.230
We can circle back to that menu a bit later on.

100
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.400
But for now, the next thing I want to address is this subtitle.

101
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:43.060
In a future lesson, we will learn how to set up a custom field so that each page can have its own unique

102
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.020
subtitle here.

103
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.140
But for now, why don't we replace this hard coded text with a message to ourselves so we don't forget

104
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.510
to implement that feature later on.

105
00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.700
So back in page of our theme folder, up at the very top, within this page banner section, we see

106
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.090
a paragraph with that hardcoded content and let's delete that and replace it by just saying, don't

107
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.650
forget to replace me later.

108
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:11.370
Cool.

109
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:19.450
Also, regarding the plain black background of this top area, if we look at that same area within our

110
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:24.940
static template that we are copying from, we see that it's supposed to use a background image of the

111
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.480
ocean.

112
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.810
So we need to get that image to work within our theme.

113
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:36.250
And if we jump back into our text editor up at the top of page FTP, within this page banner div, we

114
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:42.670
see an inline style that is trying to load an image named Ocean JPEG.

115
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:48.820
And the reason this isn't working is because we don't have a folder named Images at the root of our

116
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.410
domain.

117
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.770
In reality, our.

118
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:57.360
Images folder lives within our theme folder, so let's do this, let's hollow out these parentheses,

119
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:05.170
so delete this image is ocean jpeg and in these parentheses let's drop into PHP and then echo out the

120
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:13.420
results of a function named Get the file you I and we are calling a function.

121
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:19.600
So parentheses in this function will automatically provide the beginning part of the euro that will

122
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.510
look in WP content themes and then our theme name.

123
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.260
So now we can just say quotes.

124
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.070
Look in the images folder for Ocean JPEG.

125
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.760
Cool.

126
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.130
So let's save this and refresh.

127
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:41.380
Now, in a future lesson, we will set things up so that in the admin edit page screen you can upload

128
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.660
a unique image for each page.

129
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.980
But for the time being I think this placeholder ocean image will do the trick.

130
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.630
OK, moving on.

131
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.970
That leaves us only with this little breadcrumb area that we still need to address.

132
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.580
We will circle back to this section at the very end of this lesson.

133
00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.790
But for now, let's not worry about it.

134
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.970
What I do want to worry about right now is the title of this page that we should be seeing up here in

135
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.890
the title of this browser tab.

136
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.650
Now, the fact that we are seeing the are of the page here instead of a legitimate title means that

137
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.590
we are missing the title tag that usually lives in the head section of a website.

138
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:25.510
So if that's the case, your first instinct might be to jump into your text editor and hop into our

139
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.770
theme folders header.

140
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:36.250
And your instinct might be to go inside this header element and create a title tag and say my little

141
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.850
title.

142
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.820
Now, technically, that works, so we see the title here, but that's far from ideal because you want

143
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.010
the title to be unique or specific for each page or post that you're viewing.

144
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.120
So let's delete this title line.

145
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:59.230
And instead, since we are already giving WordPress control over our heads section with this WP head

146
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:07.840
function, what we can do is jump into our theme folders, functions, file and tell WordPress to automatically

147
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.090
generate an appropriate title tag for each screen.

148
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.680
So the question is, how do we tell WordPress to do something?

149
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.550
And the answer is that you add an action.

150
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:24.190
So down here, we've already added one action and this is the event we wanted to hook on to when our

151
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.390
goal was to load 6000 JavaScript files.

152
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.470
But in this case, we have a different goal.

153
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.390
So let's drop down to the bottom here and let's add a new action.

154
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.490
So we call the add action function.

155
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:45.490
And the name of the WordPress event that we want to hook on to is after set up theme.

156
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.560
And then let's pass this function.

157
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.020
A second argument, and this is just the name of a function that we are going to invent in about a second

158
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.850
or two from now.

159
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.920
So we get to make up this function name, let's name it, university features.

160
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.160
So we make up a name and then we just have to create a function with that name.

161
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.700
So right above this new line that we just wrote, let's create a new line and let's say function.

162
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.440
We want to create a new function.

163
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:19.330
We want it to be named university features, parentheses, curly brackets.

164
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:27.610
And when you want to enable a feature for your theme, the function that you call is add theme support.

165
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.460
Now, there are all sorts of different features that you can enable with this function, so we need

166
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.380
to tell WordPress which feature in particular we're interested in, in this case, its title tag.

167
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.600
OK, so with this new code in place, if we save this file.

168
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:51.200
And refresh the front end of our website, look up here in the top of my browser tab privacy policy,

169
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:58.640
which makes sense since we're on that page, but if we change the Eurail and go to about us, cool,

170
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.030
the title tag gets automatically generated by WordPress.

171
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.350
Now you'll see that it's followed by a dash and then the name of our website.

172
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.960
If you ever want to change this top level name of your Web site, just go into the settings general

173
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.250
screen of WordPress.

174
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:21.230
OK, moving on, now that we have an about US page and a privacy policy page, it would be nice if those

175
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.970
links in the header and footer actually did something.

176
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:31.700
When you click on them now, in a future lesson, I will show you how to create real dynamic WordPress

177
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.940
menus that you can control and manage from the admin appearance menu screen.

178
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:43.200
But for now, let's just manually add those links within our header and footer themed files.

179
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.830
Let's start with the About US header link.

180
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:53.630
So in our theme folder within heterodoxy HP just a bit down from the top here we see the About US link.

181
00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:02.510
So let's delete the placeholder hash tag and technically we could just say slash about us and that works

182
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.180
if you're using a developer domain like we are fictional university dot dev.

183
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:13.550
But if you're using something like map or X amp, you might not be using a real developer domain.

184
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.590
And in that case, you don't want your links to just point to the root of the current domain because

185
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.000
you might have multiple WordPress sites all living on your one localhost.

186
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:32.390
So instead, a more reliable way of creating links is to drop into PHP and echo out the results of a

187
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.720
function named Site You URL.

188
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.610
And that will automatically give you the root you URL of your current WordPress site.

189
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:47.420
And then anything we include as an argument gets added on to it so we can just say about us, let's

190
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.200
save that.

191
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:56.810
And now even if I go back to my homepage, when I click on this about us link, we are in business next.

192
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:02.000
Why don't we set things up so that if you click on this logo in the top left corner, it takes you back

193
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.990
to the home page.

194
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.620
So up at the top of heterotopia HP, just a couple of lines down from the opening header tag, we see

195
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.830
this, each one with a class of school logo text.

196
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.780
And all we need to do is change.

197
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:20.840
This links ATRA value, so delete the placeholder hash tag and then there's no sense in typing out that

198
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.770
same code again.

199
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:28.810
So let's just copy and paste what we set up down here from the opening to the closing tags.

200
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.350
Copy that.

201
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.230
Back up here in this ATRA value, paste it.

202
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.860
Except this time we don't want to link to the about us page so we can simply call the function and not

203
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.840
pass it any arguments whatsoever and that will give us the route or home you URL.

204
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.240
So I'm on about us and if I click that logo we're on the homepage.

205
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:50.840
Cool.

206
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.110
Now let's do the same thing for a few of the links in the footer.

207
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.660
So this should take us back to the home page about US and privacy policy.

208
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.420
So in the text editor, jump into your themes.

209
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.970
Footrot be the first one that we see should link us back to the home page.

210
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.120
So here's the element and here's the address.

211
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.140
So just delete the placeholder hash tag and then paste in your clipboard.

212
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.510
This should point towards the home page.

213
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.840
So let's delete this argument so the parentheses are empty.

214
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.650
OK, and then down here, let's set things up for the about us link in the footer.

215
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.560
So delete that paste in our clipboard.

216
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.400
Perfect.

217
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.690
Let's scroll down a little bit.

218
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.850
Here's the privacy policy link.

219
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:40.280
So delete that placeholder paste in the clipboard, change about us to privacy policy.

220
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.970
Cool.

221
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.050
So if we save that now we can use the links in the footer to jump around.

222
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:51.740
OK, so at this point we now have a basic interior page template up and running.

223
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:59.090
Now we can circle back to this little breadcrumb box here because this box makes zero sense on a top

224
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.460
level page like privacy policy.

225
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:07.430
However, imagine we want to have some pages or children pages on our site.

226
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:15.380
So, for example, maybe on our About US page, we want to have two children pages, our history and

227
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.310
our goals.

228
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:22.250
Well, in our very next lesson, that's exactly what we're going to learn about parent and children

229
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.330
pages and how to work with them on the front end of our website.

230
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.160
I know this lesson we just worked through and the one right before it, they were not tons of fun.

231
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.380
There are probably two of the most boring lessons in the entire course, but we had to get up and running

232
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.420
and working with the same page templates.

233
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.630
So you and I are in sync from here on out.

234
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.060
There won't be as much mindless copying and.

235
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:49.910
Hasting We're going to get back to truly educational content, so let's keep things rolling and I will

236
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.310
see you in the next lesson.
