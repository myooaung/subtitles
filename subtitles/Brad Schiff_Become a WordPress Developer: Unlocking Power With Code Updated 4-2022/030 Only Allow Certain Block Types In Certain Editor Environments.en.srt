00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,670
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,360
In this quick lesson, we're going to learn how to restrict different block types in the page in post

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,230
editor versus what's allowed in the full site editor.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:21,610
Now, obviously, by default, WordPress allows any block type in either of those environments, but

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,010
if you're using WordPress as more of a content management system, I think it's very likely that there

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,360
may come a time where you want to restrict which blocks are allowed.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,970
Let's jump into the action and I'll explain.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,630
So imagine you are editing a blog post or page, or maybe your client is.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:48,790
And in this editor screen you do indeed want to let your user add any block type that they want, right?

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,530
So all of the default core blocks, all of our custom blocks, so on and so forth.

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,030
But let me switch tabs.

12
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,960
If they're using the full site editor screen to edit a template, maybe you want to restrict which blocks

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,590
are allowed.

14
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,060
Maybe you only want to allow the custom block types that we have created.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,280
So in other words, you wouldn't want to let the user just add a random paragraph here.

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,580
Now, these were just my examples, but the idea is what if you want to restrict a different set of

17
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,920
block types for the page in Post Editor versus the full site template editor?

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,750
That's what I'm going to show you how to set up.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,500
Right now, there are a million different useful ways that you could implement this.

20
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,640
That's up to you.

21
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,900
But here's the concept.

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:40,180
We just dig in to our themes, functions, TCP IP file all scroll down to the very, very bottom and

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,620
let's write a brand new line.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,200
And we're going to say add filter semicolon in the parentheses.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,060
We give it four arguments.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,860
So A comma, B comma, C comedy, let's fill in the C and D first.

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,830
So C is just a priority, let's say ten.

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,730
So it gets called last for the D placeholder, let's say two.

29
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,700
This is how many arguments the function will use.

30
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,570
Okay?

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,370
And then we know what to do with A and B.

32
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,230
So A is the name of a word press filter hook that we want to hook on to.

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,310
So this would be allowed block types all and then the B value.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,200
This would just be a function that we make up.

35
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,810
So quotes all.

36
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,220
Name it.

37
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,040
Make up a name of maybe my allowed blocks.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Cool.

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,220
Let's just go create a function now with that name.

40
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,230
So function my allowed blocks.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,060
Now we included a two here saying that the function will have two arguments.

42
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,790
So let's have two parameters here in these parentheses.

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:50,710
Dollar sign allowed block types comma dollar sign editor context.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,220
Now within the body of our function, what do we do?

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,530
We're just going to return.

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,180
Allow to block types.

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,160
Now, if we just did this.

48
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,880
Right without modifying it or changing it in any way, we would essentially be doing nothing.

49
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,190
In other words, the default allowed block types that WordPress is already allowing.

50
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,170
We're just passing that through.

51
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,700
However, within this function, we're free to modify it if we want to.

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,150
So if you wanted to allow the exact same set of restricted block types in all environments, right?

53
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,680
In both the Page and Post Editor and the full site editor, you would just return an array here.

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,460
So you could say return array and then you would just list out your block types.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,720
So quotes.

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,720
Our block theme is the namespace, you know, slash header and then comma our block theme slash footer.

57
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,340
You would list out any and all blocks that you want to allow.

58
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,430
However, what if you wanted to allow one set in the page in post environment and one set in the full

59
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,210
site editor?

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,430
Well, we would just write an if statement.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,910
So if parentheses curly brackets for the condition.

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,970
I would say if PHP has a function called empty that I'm going to call in the empty parentheses.

63
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,540
I'm going to look at dollar sign editor, underscore context, look inside that.

64
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,660
So dash greater than four post at the very start of this condition right before the word empty.

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,460
In the parentheses I'll add an exclamation just because I want to check for the opposite.

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,580
So altogether, I'm basically saying if there is a post, that means you're working with a page or a

67
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,090
post.

68
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,540
So in here, if you didn't want to restrict which block types are allowed on pages and post, you could

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,010
just return allowed block types without modifying it.

70
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,420
So return allowed block types.

71
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,370
Okay.

72
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,940
Then after this, if statements are right about here due to the nature of, you know, programming,

73
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,780
when you return something further execution of the function ends.

74
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,300
So we don't even need to write an else block.

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,290
We can just return something else here if this is not true.

76
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,030
You could also write comments to yourself.

77
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:17,830
So right here you could say if you are on a page or post editor screen and then down here you could

78
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,750
say if you are on the full site editor screen.

79
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,290
So then here you can just return a different array.

80
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,310
So return array, semicolon.

81
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,960
I won't bore you by typing out a bunch of different blog types, but imagine I'll just say it.

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,610
Maybe our header and footer blocks.

83
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,330
So our block theme slash header comma our block theme slash footer.

84
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,940
Let's give that a save and test it out.

85
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,090
So in the page in Post Editor, I should still be allowed to insert any block type I want.

86
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,150
So if I click the plus symbol here, cool.

87
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,400
I still see all of the choices that you would imagine.

88
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,490
However, back in the full site editor, if I refresh and I try to add a new block here.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,570
Yup.

90
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,350
You can see my only choices are those two that we spelled out the header and footer.

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,910
And even if you click this browse all button right here, nothing else shows up.

92
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,510
That's it.

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,030
There are an infinite number of ways that you can use this logic and this feature that we just set up.

94
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,530
It's up to you to get creative or use it in a way that makes sense for your projects.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,630
But I definitely wanted to show this to you because I think it's a very common feature that you're going

96
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,530
to want to set up.

97
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,600
And just a quick edit here at the end of the video, I want to give you sort of an extra credit idea.

98
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,750
So if you were working on a project and you found yourself wanting to restrict the block types based

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,390
on the current post type, you could write a condition like this, you know, if parentheses, curly

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,590
brackets for the condition.

101
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,530
And imagine if you only wanted to set up a custom block type list for the professor post type.

102
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,220
You could say dollar sign editor context.

103
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,480
Look inside that for post, look inside that for post type and only if that equals professor.

104
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,830
Well then you could return a different array of allowed block types.

105
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,750
Also, just to be clear.

106
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,230
It's not as if you can only spell out your block types.

107
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,530
You can spell out core block types.

108
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:26,220
So for example, you could return an array where you only allow, you know, core dash, paragraph comma,

109
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,250
you know, core dash and list or core dash heading.

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,470
That's going to bring this lesson to a close.

111
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,450
In our next quick lesson, I want to show you how to set up a completely blank template.

112
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,710
In addition to how to set that up, I want to show you why you would set it up.

113
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,940
I'll give you a hint.

114
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,000
I think it can be very useful for creating landing pages or just any sort of really custom page.

115
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,810
I think it'll be fun to set up.

116
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,380
Let's keep things rolling and I'll see you then.
