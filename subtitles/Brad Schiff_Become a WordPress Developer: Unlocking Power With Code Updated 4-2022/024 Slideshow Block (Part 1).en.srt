00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,540
In this lesson, we're going to build our slideshow.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,180
BLOCK Let's jump right into the action.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,720
So there are a million different ways that you could set this up.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,260
But let me explain my thought process.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,570
So looking at the finished product of what we're going to build, here is the slideshow and I'm going

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,020
to set things up so that there are three layers of blocks.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,440
So the overall outermost, you know, overall parent block will be called slideshow.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,380
And it can have in this case, for example, there's three slides nested inside the slideshow.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,760
Then each slide is essentially just a banner block, right?

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,790
And it can have text and buttons, in other words, those blocks nested inside of it.

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:54,480
So there will be generic headlines and generic button blocks nested inside a slide block, and then

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,270
all of the slides are nested in the slideshow.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,240
If that doesn't make perfect sense yet, that's okay.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,920
I think once we set up sort of the basic skeleton, it'll start to be clear.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,380
So where do we begin?

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,270
Well, let's start with the outermost parent block, which is the overall slide show block.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:18,690
So to get started, as always, let's jump into our functions dot, AP, file towards the bottom.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,990
We do not want a placeholder block for this lesson.

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,620
We absolutely want a JS block because there's going to be interactivity, you know, from the admin

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:35,640
editor Gutenberg side, technically you could write plain JavaScript instead of gsx, but I think you'll

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,660
find that when your blocks have any sort of complexity or any amount of HTML, aside from just one element,

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,800
like our placeholders, you're going to want the convenience of JS processing anyways down here at the

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,220
bottom.

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,370
Let's just set up a new instance of JS X block.

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,260
So new j x block, parentheses semicolon.

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,600
Let's make up a name of slideshow and then let's give it a second argument.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,180
So comma of true this means we do indeed want a render callback so we can give this file a save.

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:21,870
And now in the our blocks folder, create a new file and name it slide show dot js to save a little

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,560
bit of typing.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,260
And because I don't believe in ever truly memorizing all of this, let's just borrow or copy and paste

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,000
from our banner dot js file.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,960
So if we jump into that file, we don't need to copy the entirety of this file, but I would just grab

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,730
all of the import lines and then this very first register block type call.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
So just down to about line 19.

36
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,250
So I'd copy that piece into our new empty JavaScript file.

37
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,110
Let's change the name.

38
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,380
So around line seven, register, block type instead of banner, it would be slide show.

39
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,720
Let's change the title to uppercase.

40
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,580
Slideshow.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,810
Our slideshow does not need image I.D. or image URL.

42
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,690
That makes sense for the individual slides, but not the overall parent slideshow so we can get rid

43
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,680
of those attributes.

44
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,770
Okay, now below this, let's add a function for edit component and save component.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,010
So let's start with save components.

46
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,760
So function save component, parentheses, curly brackets.

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,970
The only thing we would need to save into the database is just any nested content.

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,990
So whether you add two slides to your slideshow or ten slides to your slideshow, the nested slides

49
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,800
are the only thing we need to return from within our save function here.

50
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,620
So we would just return.

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,480
And then they self-closing inner blocks dot content just like this.

52
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,950
Okay, next, let's set up the edit component functions, function edit, component, parentheses,

53
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,940
curly brackets.

54
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,160
Let's have an overall div.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,620
So first of all, return parentheses so we can have multiple lines of gsx.

56
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,730
And now I want to div so I'll just type div and then hit tab on my keyboard.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,000
So now this is the UI that you'll actually see in the block editor screen.

58
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,780
So let's have two things inside our div.

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,850
First, let's have a paragraph sort of a label and it can say slideshow.

60
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,500
And then right below that we'll just have the actual nested slides.

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:40,910
So an inner blocks component, self-closing and let's give it a prop of allowed blocks equals curly

62
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,050
brackets, an array, so square brackets and then quotes.

63
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,090
The namespace for all of our blocks is our block theme and then slash.

64
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,630
And now we haven't created this new block yet, but essentially the only block type that I want to allow

65
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,940
in the slideshow is a slide.

66
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,960
So let's make up a name here, a slide in just a moment.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,950
We can go create the block type named slide first.

68
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,870
Let's add a little bit of styling to our overall div just to avoid confusion.

69
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,560
So for example, when you're in the editor screen and you've inserted a slideshow, I think it would

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,560
be nice if the overall parent block had a bit of padding so that you could see maybe a gray background

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,410
color so that you could tell the banners that you were inserting were sort of nested in that parent

72
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,010
slideshow.

73
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,760
BLOCK You don't have to add this, but I think the user interface would get fairly confusing without

74
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,180
this.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,790
So here's what I would do on the opening div tag.

76
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:48,290
I would just say style equals curly brackets, another pair of curly brackets for the actual style object

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,280
and then the DJ's version of background dash color is background, just uppercase C color, all one

78
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,410
word call and let's set that to a string of text of hashtag three, three, three.

79
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,670
Com.

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,530
Let's give it a nice amount of padding.

81
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,040
So padding string of text 35 pixels.

82
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,930
Okay next let's style are sort of label paragraph a little bit.

83
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,620
So style equals curly brackets, double pair of curly brackets.

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,340
So text a line, string a text center.

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,710
Come on, let's bump up the font size, font size, maybe 20 pixels, comma, color string a text just

86
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,750
hashtag f, f, f.

87
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:30,830
Okay.

88
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,020
Before we save this file back up at the top, let's get rid of some of these imports that we don't actually

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,320
need.

90
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,150
So we didn't use API fetch.

91
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,990
We can get rid of that.

92
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,940
We didn't use any of these components.

93
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,280
We can get rid of that on this line.

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,320
The only thing we're using is inner blocks.

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,630
So you can get rid of these three items here.

96
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,090
And finally, we did not use use effects so you can get rid of that line as well.

97
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,750
Cool.

98
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,280
Let's save this.

99
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,890
But before we go, add it to our package dot JSON file and actually, you know, bundle it up and expect

100
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,270
to see it in the admin.

101
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,750
Let's first go create our second custom block in this lesson because remember we've said the only block

102
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,240
type that's allowed is slide.

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,900
So let's go actually create a block type named slide.

104
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,200
So back in functions, drop down at the very bottom, you could just duplicate this line we wrote a

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,700
few moments ago, changed the name from slideshow to slide.

106
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,140
Let's give that a save back in the sidebar.

107
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,300
In our blocks, create a brand new file named Slide dot Jess.

108
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:45,070
Now Slide is absolutely a copycat of banner JS Even more so than slideshow because think about it,

109
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,210
slide is the element that's going to have a background image.

110
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,130
And also it's the block where you're allowed to insert only headlines and buttons.

111
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,070
So it's very much just a duplication of banner.

112
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:05,800
JS In a perfect world, you could spend the time to create sort of an abstract ad class that both slide

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,170
JS and banner dot JS inherit from.

114
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,240
In this course, we're not going to worry about staying 110% organize like that.

115
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,780
So I'm just going to jump into Banner Dot JS this time.

116
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,780
I am indeed going to select the entire file.

117
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,660
So yes, that includes the edit component save component functions just absolutely the entire file.

118
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,530
Copy that pasted into our new empty slide that JS up at the very top.

119
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,230
We really only need to change the name of the block.

120
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,430
So our block theme instead of banner, let's call this slide.

121
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:45,370
Let's change the title to Uppercase Slide and that's really all we need to change.

122
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,000
So let's go ahead and give that a save because remember, it's already programmed to only allow the

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
block types of heading and button.

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,930
Cool.

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,220
So be sure to save this file.

126
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,370
And now we can just go into our package dot JSON file and add those two new blocks.

127
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,420
So at the end of this start line, the very end here, I would just say space, our dash blocks look

128
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,820
for slideshow and then a space our dash blocks slash look for slide.

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,890
Let's give that a save.

130
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,480
And then in your command line be sure to start up npm run start.

131
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,290
So now back in the browser in the block editor screen, if I refresh and scroll down a little bit,

132
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,600
maybe right below events and blogs, if I want a slideshow here, I'll start searching for slide.

133
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,050
There it is.

134
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,310
Slide show.

135
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,000
So I insert that.

136
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,810
Cool.

137
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,100
There's sort of the outer wrapper to signify that this is a slideshow.

138
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,250
And then there's the symbol to add.

139
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,190
You click on that.

140
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,070
The only option is a slide.

141
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,940
So it didn't even bother to ask us which type of block type you want.

142
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
The only allowed type is slide, so it can make that assumption.

143
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,120
Now, inside this slide, click the icon.

144
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,220
You can add headings and buttons.

145
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,410
So let's add a heading of the medium size and say.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,120
Slide number one example text.

147
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,080
And then I'll click off of that on this overall slide.

148
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,440
Click the symbol here to add a button, let's say learn more and I'll make that a medium sized button.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,520
Click on it.

150
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,290
Maybe I'll make it dark orange.

151
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,740
Cool.

152
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,200
Let's add at least one more slide.

153
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,660
So now you would click on the overall gray background area for the slideshow as a whole.

154
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,720
There's a plus symbol right about here.

155
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,230
The bottom right corner, we can click that.

156
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,670
Now we've got two slides.

157
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,850
Let's add a headline here.

158
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,580
So I'll see slide number two, example, text.

159
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,030
Make that medium sized.

160
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:57,140
Let's add a button, learn more exclamation, and I'll make that medium and I'll leave this as blue.

161
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,010
Let's not forget the actual background images.

162
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,120
So if I click on the background image for this one and then open up the sidebar, I can click Choose

163
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,720
Image.

164
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,450
Let's imagine I want this second one to use the frog and let's imagine I want the first slides.

165
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,980
If I click on the background image, choose, choose, image, maybe I want this building.

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,050
Cool.

167
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,120
Let's go ahead and save this.

168
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,520
And now I don't expect anything to appear on the front end yet because we haven't written any callback

169
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,240
functions.

170
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,650
In fact, I believe if you refresh the front end right now, you'd see an error message.

171
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,670
Yep.

172
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,750
Don't worry.

173
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,090
We'll write the callbacks in just a moment.

174
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,880
But to prove that we're saving all of this data and loading it successfully from the database, we can

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,530
refresh this edit screen.

176
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,480
Scroll back down.

177
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,440
Perfect.

178
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,580
It saved our text, our colours, our background images, everything.

179
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,950
So now all we need to do is maybe fine tune this HTML a little bit to have sort of the dark gray background

180
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,660
that sits right about here.

181
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,160
Remember, if you look at the finished product, the slideshow has sort of this transparent background

182
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,180
color box.

183
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,620
So we'll add that.

184
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,190
And we also need to adjust the output each HTML which can live in our app to have these three dots here

185
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,500
as the slideshow navigation.

186
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,360
Right.

187
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,370
They signify which slide you've currently navigated to.

188
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,750
So back to the copy that we're working on together.

189
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,610
We're currently getting this error message on our home page.

190
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,390
So let's go work on the PHP, render callbacks and let's begin with the outer parent element, which

191
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,920
is the overall slideshow.

192
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:44,740
So back in our text editor in the Our Blocks folder, just create a new file named slideshow dot page

193
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,110
P.

194
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,640
So in this file we would include the wrapper HTML output for the slideshow as a whole.

195
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,720
Now this HTML structure that the slideshow JavaScript hooks on to or looks for that has nothing to do

196
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,710
with WordPress.

197
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,710
But the overall idea here is you could imagine if you wanted to use Bootstrap and some of the bootstrap

198
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,950
JavaScript like their slideshow or a similar feature.

199
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,620
The idea is you need to output each HTML with a specific pattern or using certain classes.

200
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,290
Now we've already written that structure and pattern of that each HTML, so there's no sense in reinventing

201
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,800
the wheel.

202
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,740
So right now I'm going to open up my text editor for the original fictional university theme from an

203
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,330
earlier chapter in the course.

204
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,560
And we need to jump in to front page dot P in that file.

205
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:41,170
If you scroll down around line number 81, we're looking for this div with the class of hero slider.

206
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,950
So this is the HTML structure, the pattern, the class names that are going to give us the JavaScript

207
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,510
slideshow, right?

208
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,890
We're using a JavaScript package called Glide to Power the slideshow.

209
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,230
So there's a million different ways you could do this.

210
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,650
But here's what I'm going to do.

211
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,260
Begin selecting from the start of this hero slider div.

212
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,400
So right here.

213
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,930
And then let's scroll down.

214
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,380
It ends right before the get footer.

215
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,950
So I'm going to select everything down to this chunk of HTML with copy that into our clipboard and then

216
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,340
back in our empty slide showed up AP file that we just created, paste it in and now let's just hollow

217
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:22,940
it out a bit.

218
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,370
So essentially we only want sort of the outer wrapper and any interior content that you see repeating

219
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,270
more than once.

220
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,860
Let's hollow that out.

221
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,660
So I'll give you a hint around line number four, we see this class of hero slider underscore, underscore,

222
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,440
slide.

223
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,470
Now because the slide show previously had been hardcoded to have those exact three slides, you'll see

224
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,390
there are three instances of that.

225
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,180
So just delete all of those.

226
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,090
So I'm going to begin deleting from the first one.

227
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,790
The indentation is not perfect, so this can actually get a bit confusing, but I'm going to delete

228
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,430
from line four and then where you see the three closing divs in a row, just delete all of that.

229
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,810
So that's the first hero slide out of three and then just delete the other two as well.

230
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,690
So from here and then three closing divs in a row and then this one with the three closing divs in a

231
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,110
row.

232
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,880
So now the idea is this remaining closing div.

233
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,820
This is for this glide slides.

234
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,460
So all of our slides will live inside of that.

235
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,360
Then there's this div that has the navigation circles.

236
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,700
So if you have three slides, there's going to be three dots.

237
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,380
If you have ten slides, there'd be ten.

238
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,160
So this is the closing div for the slider bullets.

239
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,700
This is the closing div for this glide track.

240
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,400
And then this is the overall closing div cool.

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,080
This looks good to me.

242
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:55,280
So the idea though is that inside here, glide slides, that's where we would output the nested content.

243
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:03,140
So just drop into P here and just say echo dollar sign content semicolon.

244
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,520
Let's give that a save.

245
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,520
Now if we refreshed the front end, we'd still see an error message and that's because we need to provide

246
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,660
a callback file for slide itself.

247
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,200
So in the our blocks folder, just new file, name it, slide dot up.

248
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:29,570
Now just for a quick test, let's just have maybe a heading level one that says hello from slide.

249
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,230
If we save that, we should see that repeated three times.

250
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,630
So if we refresh the homepage and scroll down.

251
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,000
Perfect.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Hello from slide.

253
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,680
Hello from slide.

254
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,610
Hello from Slide.

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,200
Now we just need to adjust this output to actually look like a slide.
