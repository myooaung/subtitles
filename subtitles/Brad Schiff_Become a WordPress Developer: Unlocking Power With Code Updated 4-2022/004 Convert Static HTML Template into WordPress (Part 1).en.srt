Hello, everyone, in this lesson, we will learn how to convert a static HTML and CFS page into a living,

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,380
breathing WordPress theme.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,360
So up until this point in the course, the WordPress theme and site that we've been working on has zero

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,040
style or design to it.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,380
Now, this isn't very realistic, is it?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,600
Because in the real world, we're never going to make any money if our websites are this ugly.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,180
So we need to add design and art direction to our theme.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Now, we could start writing CSFs together and try to create something that looks nice, but this isn't

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,850
a course about success in this course.

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,840
We want to stay focused on WordPress and a little bit of JavaScript.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,660
So in order to avoid getting bogged down in CSFs and design for the next 20 hours, what we're going

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,900
to do is download a little bit of HTML and success that I've already written for us.

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:11,450
But it could just as well be HTML insist that you or your coworker wrote the actual HTML and CSS itself

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,290
doesn't matter.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,820
What matters is that we learn how to integrate it into a living, breathing WordPress theme.

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,890
OK, so right now let's go and download my starter code.

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,170
I want you to open a new tab in your web browser and visit this Eurail.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:38,780
So it's GitHub dot com slash learn web code slash university dash static anyway's.

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,330
Once you're on this page, we just want to use this green clone or download button that we see here.

20
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,640
And once you click on that then we are interested in this download zip button.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,350
And once you go ahead and extract that zip file, you will have a folder named University Static Master.

22
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,760
Now this time around, it doesn't matter where you place this folder because the folder isn't going

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,510
to have anything to do with our WordPress site.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,540
We're basically just going to copy and paste stuff from this new folder into our WordPress themed folder.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
OK, but first, let's just go ahead and look within this new folder.

26
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,820
And the first thing I want you to do is find the indexed HTML file and preview it in your Web browser.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:32,050
So in this empty Google tab, I will just drag index HTML on top of it and this page is just static

28
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,090
HTML.

29
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,100
This file has zero in it and has absolutely nothing to do with WordPress.

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,010
So none of the links are real.

31
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,080
They don't go anywhere.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,190
None of the buttons do anything.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,060
It's our job now to copy and paste this HTML into our WordPress theme and then sort of hollow it out

34
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,260
and program it to pull in real user generated WordPress content like posts and pages.

35
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,960
So we want to start moving over some of this HTML into the WordPress theme that we've been working on

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,340
that lives at fictional University Dot Dev.

37
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,530
And the question of the moment is where do we begin?

38
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,880
Well, it's just personal preference, but I always like to begin with the header.

39
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,790
So in this case, the part that I'm highlighting right now, we've got the logo in the top left and

40
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,670
the navigation links and buttons in the top right.
