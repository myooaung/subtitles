00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:10,110
In this lesson, we will learn about a more advanced way of going live with a WordPress website.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,040
Now, in this more advanced path, we are not going to use a plug in to do everything for us.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,750
Instead, we are going to learn how to do things manually by hand.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,450
Why would we do this?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,530
Well, one, it's a good opportunity to learn more about WordPress.

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:35,360
And too, it will allow us to implement automatic get deployment so that making future updates to the

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,050
code files of our live website is a piece of cake.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,570
OK, now the act of moving or copying a WordPress website manually really only involves two parts.

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,020
Part one is the WordPress database that stores all of our posts and content and settings.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,810
And part two is all of our files.

12
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,010
The WordPress system files our theme plug ins and any photos that we've uploaded through the WordPress

13
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,030
media system.

14
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,190
In this video, we are going to start with part one, moving the WordPress database.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,040
And then in our next video, we will cover moving our files, and that's when we will learn how to set

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,320
up automatic get deployments.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:25,070
OK, but first, before we learn how to copy and move our database, I'm going to begin by completely

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,480
deleting my live Web site that I set up with The Simple Path.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,930
A, I'm going to completely delete it so that I can start over from scratch and move the site again

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,990
with Path B, if you followed along with Path A, you will probably want to do the same.

21
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,470
Right?

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,580
We basically want to hit a reset button and get a clean slate so we can learn how to move things the

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,640
more advanced way.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,370
So in order to delete this live Web sites, files and its database, we need to log in to our Web hosting

25
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,930
account.

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,100
So in a new tab visit site, ground or whatever Web hosting company you're using.

27
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,770
And actually, before I show you how to delete everything, I do want to stress the point that there's

28
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,770
no sense in deleting a perfectly good Web site unless you want to practice the more advanced path.

29
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:19,280
B and again, if you're not already familiar with the basics of the git version control system, then

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,710
Path B doesn't make sense for you right now.

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,870
OK, so I just want to make that clear.

32
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,410
Not everyone needs to learn about Path B, but if you feel like it's right for you, then let's go ahead

33
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,630
and delete this Web site so we can start all over again.

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,020
So within your Web hosting account, just look for the file manager for the domain that you're working

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,410
with.

36
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,620
It's located in a different place, depending on your Web host.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,520
But the file manager where we can delete our files.

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,770
OK, click into your main domain folder here, OK?

39
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,310
And now let's click into the public underscore HTML folder.

40
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,970
And now within this folder, we just want to delete everything so you'll know that you're in the right

41
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,010
directory, that you want to delete everything.

42
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,630
If you see folders like WP Admin, WP content and WP includes.

43
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,590
So I'm just going to click just once, not a double click, just a single click on this first folder

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,950
or file and then scroll all the way down to the bottom and hold shift on the keyboard and click this

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,540
very last file or folder.

46
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,730
So that selects everything that I'm just going to.

47
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,030
Right.

48
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,080
Click and choose.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,590
Delete.

50
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,930
Go ahead and confirm.

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,490
OK, cool, so we've deleted all of our files, now we just need to go and delete the existing database.

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,030
Now, this will definitely be different depending on your Web host company, but you're just looking

53
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,350
for either database or something called my sequel or Maisky.

54
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, OK.

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,040
From this screen, if we scroll down a bit, we can see towards the very bottom an existing database

56
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,710
that we have towards the very right hand corner.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,750
We see these three dots and if you click on that, we can then choose delete.

58
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,920
So let's go ahead and do that.

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,040
Let's delete the database, click, confirm.

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,220
Cool.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,200
So now we've deleted both our files and our database.

62
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,010
So at this point I have a completely empty, clean slate.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,290
We've basically got a brand new fresh web hosting account now and now we can go ahead and learn how

64
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,290
to move our local dev environment copy of WordPress up onto our Web hosting account.

65
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,680
OK, and this time around, we're going to do it in a more advanced Hands-On manual way.

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,090
Remember, there are two main parts to this.

67
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,320
Number one, the database, and number two, all of our files.

68
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,520
And in this video, we are going to begin with the database, right?

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Because within our local dev environment copy of WordPress.

70
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:53,980
So my fictional Dash University Dev local website, this website's database contains all of the posts

71
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,180
and pages and settings and all of our data.

72
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,640
So instead of having to manually recreate each post and professor and campus, we just want to copy

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,280
that database onto our Web hosting account.

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,540
So the question becomes, how can we create a copy of the database that's powering this local website?

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,290
Now, if you have prior experience with HP and databases, but maybe not WordPress, specifically,

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:29,290
your first instinct might be to look for something called my admin or open up a MySQL client like SQL

77
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,750
Pro for Mac or Heidi Ezekial for Windows.

78
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,250
However, even though those tools are great when it comes to WordPress specifically, not only do we

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,970
need to create a copy of this database, but we also need to perform a basic find and replace on the

80
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,840
database.

81
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,070
We need to find any and all instances of this domain.

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:59,240
We need to find all instances of that in the database and replace that with the live Web site domain.

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:08,790
So in my case, I want to find fictional university dot dev and replace it with Brad s dot you cite.

84
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:16,390
Now, again, you could use one of those tools I mentioned just a moment ago, my admin or SQL Pro or

85
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,560
Heidi Escudo.

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,190
But you're still going to have to open that export a database file in a text editor and manually perform

87
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,930
a find and replace.

88
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,280
Now that works OK.

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
And I've done that in the past.

90
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,620
But if your database is fairly large and your computer is not super powerful, that can really bog down

91
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,630
your text editor.

92
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,870
So instead, let me show you my preferred way of creating a copy of my local database and how to perform

93
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,990
the find and replace all in one simple step.

94
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:54,640
OK, so from your local dev environment copy of fictional university login as the administrator and

95
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,960
then in the admin dashboard, I want to install a new plug in.

96
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,570
Don't worry, this is not some all in one plug in that's going to do everything for us.

97
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,840
This is a very focused plugin that just performs a very specific task for us.

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,240
So from the sidebar, hover over plug ins and click add new.

99
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,970
And in the top right search field, let's search for WP, my great D.B..

100
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,090
This is the one I'm interested in.

101
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,310
It has the exact name of WPE Migrate Debe, it's created by delicious brains.

102
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,660
So let's go ahead and install it.

103
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,140
And then click, activate.

104
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,010
OK, and with that new plug in activated, now, if we hover over the tools item in our sidebar, we

105
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,100
have this new option named Migrate Debe.

106
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,990
Let's click on that.

107
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,600
OK, let's be sure to leave this first option selected, we do not want to run a find and replace on

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,280
this actual database, right.

109
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,110
Instead, we want to export or create a copy of this database and we can perform a find and replace

110
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,580
on that copy of the database.

111
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:19,880
So for this first field, we want to find any instances of slash, slash, whatever your localhost domain

112
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,500
is, and we want to replace that with slash slash.

113
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,980
And then in my case, it's Brad s dot s g edu dot site.

114
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,880
For you.

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,100
It will be different, right?

116
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:39,530
It'll be whatever domain name you're using or whatever practice or testing subdomain you want to use

117
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,160
right now.

118
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,370
Just be sure to not include the HTTP or https.

119
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,250
OK, we just want slash and then your actual domain.

120
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,340
OK, so cool, this first row will ensure that the database works within its new live environment.

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,470
We actually do not need this second row.

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,980
Ideally, you could perform a find and replace for the absolute file path, but this is not necessary.

123
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,170
Only certain plug ins make use of this field and it's not an absolutely essential part of WordPress.

124
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,200
So I'm actually just going to click the X here to remove that row.

125
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,850
OK, so we're just performing this one global find and replace and let's go ahead and click export.

126
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,890
Cool, you can see that that automatically downloaded a file for me, so you can either click this X

127
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,530
to close this or I think you can just click anywhere in the background of the page.

128
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,880
Yep.

129
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,770
And now if you check out the downloads folder on your computer, perfect.

130
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,170
We've got a brand new file that is a copy of our MySQL database.

131
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,900
This contains all of our posts and professors and campuses, all of our WordPress data and settings.

132
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,220
So now back on our Web hosting account, we just want to create a new database and then import this

133
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,740
file.

134
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,470
So back in my Web browser, remember earlier in the lesson, this is where we deleted our existing database.

135
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,940
And so now from this same screen, let's just click this create database button.

136
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,520
OK, so now we have this empty shell of a database, so it exists, but it's completely empty.

137
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,590
So now we just want to modify it by importing that file that we just exported from our local WordPress.

138
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,140
In order to do that, we're looking for something called P p, my admin.

139
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,120
So you can see here it is for me, but every Web host is different.

140
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:48,360
So just look around for my admin and you'll know that you found it because it should look something

141
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,340
like this.

142
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:56,190
OK, in this left hand sidebar here, you can see that randomly generated name of the new database,

143
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,060
the new empty database that my Web host just created.

144
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,100
For me, yours will almost certainly have a different name, but go ahead and click on that and the

145
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
left hand side bar.

146
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,760
OK, now, at the moment, this database is completely empty.

147
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,740
So what we want to do is import up here.

148
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,970
There's an import button.

149
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,410
Let's click on that.

150
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:24,470
OK, and then right here, we can choose a file to import, so click on that and then select the new

151
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,790
file in our downloads folder that we just created a moment ago.

152
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,370
Right.

153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,990
This is our copy of the database.

154
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,970
Let's choose that.

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,780
OK, then down at the very bottom of the page, we can click the go button.

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,440
Cool, so the import was successful, and if you've ever been curious about how WordPress stores all

157
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,090
of your data, well, this left hand column gives you a good idea.

158
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,980
So the database is made up of individual tables with certain responsibilities.

159
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,630
So there's a table named WP Posts, which contains all of our posts.

160
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,540
If you click on it, then you can see all of your data.

161
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,010
Right.

162
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,120
And it almost looks like a giant spreadsheet.

163
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,260
Each row is a post or a revision of a post, and you can see they have different columns like ID, the

164
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,620
date, even post content.

165
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,490
So this is the main body field where the actual content for a post lives.

166
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,530
And back in the left hand side bar, there's also a table for users.

167
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,560
So all of the user accounts, there's a table just for options.

168
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,270
There's a table just for comments.

169
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,650
You get the idea.

170
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,150
Anyways, at this point, we have successfully copied the database from our local dev environment and

171
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,910
pushed it up onto our Web hosting account.

172
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,480
And remember, there's only two aspects of moving a site.

173
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,860
No one is copying or moving the database.

174
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,490
And number two is the act of copying or moving all of your files.

175
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:53,920
Right.

176
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,880
So all of the WordPress system files, all of our theme files, any plugins that we've downloaded,

177
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,840
any photographs that we've uploaded to the WordPress media system.

178
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,590
And in our very next lesson, not only will we learn how to move all of those files, but we are going

179
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:17,620
to do it in a nice, luxurious, automated way that leverages the git version control system.

180
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,920
This is going to be a lot of fun to set up.

181
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,890
So let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
