00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:11,140
In this lesson, we will set up a traditional search that does not feature live or on the fly results,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,630
but does work even if a user doesn't have JavaScript enabled in their browser.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,380
The reason we would do this is we want our website to make sense for 100 percent of visitors.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,560
And even though 99 percent of people that come to the site will have JavaScript enabled, that's still

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,460
not everyone.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,460
So, for example, if you come to the website and you click the top right search icon, obviously if

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,140
you have JavaScript, you can perform a live search, no problem.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,020
But if you didn't have JavaScript enabled or if for some reason you had a network or Internet connection

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,630
issue and the website's JavaScript just failed to download for some reason.

11
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,470
Well, in that case, if you click this icon, absolutely nothing would happen.

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,290
And that could be very confusing for a lot of visitors.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,770
So what we're going to set up in this lesson is for people without JavaScript, if you click on this

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,940
link, it's going to take you to a traditional old fashioned search page, and that will be our fallback

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,260
or insurance plan.

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,450
So 99 percent of people will still be able to perform a live search.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,060
But for the other one percent, we have the fallback traditional search page.

18
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,140
Now, before we worry about creating a separate search page, I first just want to give you an example

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,350
of how traditional WordPress searching works.

20
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:40,600
So right now, follow along with me up in our address bar at the very end of the route of our URL or

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,720
the homepage you URL, you can add on questionmark lowercase s for search and then just say equals whatever

22
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,810
you want to search for.

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,230
So I could search for biology and we see biologies.

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,930
Cool the biology program, Dr. Bachs a lot because it contains the sentence.

25
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,380
I love biology.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,210
OK, so the search worked, but you'll notice that everything looks like a blog post, right?

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,400
Even though this is the biology program and even though this is a professor post type, it looks very

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,260
blog.

29
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:24,940
And this is because at the moment, this search results screen is being powered by index P p of our

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,830
theme folder.

31
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,740
That's why we even see up at the top.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,260
Welcome to our blog.

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:37,600
Well, luckily, if you have a file in your theme folder named Search HTTP WordPress, we'll use that

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,900
to format and display this search result screen.

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,490
And a bit later on in this lesson, we will indeed set up a search dot file.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,110
But first, let's focus on something that's even a bit more important than the formatting of this result

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:00,520
screen, and that is that we can't expect visitors of the website to know that they can tack on a question

38
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,820
mark.

39
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,110
S equals whatever they want to search for up in their address bar.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,590
Right.

41
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,530
The average visitor has no idea that they can do that.

42
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:15,280
So we need to provide a form, a traditional form that they can fill out and then click submit.

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,130
And then when they submit the form, it will take them to a neutral just like this, where they can

44
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,210
see the results.

45
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,420
So what we're going to do for people that have JavaScript disabled when they click the top right search

46
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,960
icon, we will link them to a new page that contains a search form.

47
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,400
Now, before we worry about adjusting this icon to link to a page, let's first go ahead and create

48
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,890
a brand new page that can contain the search form.

49
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,910
So let me show you what I mean right now.

50
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:53,740
Let's jump over to the admin dashboard and in the sidebar, let's hover over pages and click add new

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,520
for the title.

52
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,560
I will say search and I can leave the body area completely empty.

53
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,400
And then let's go ahead and publish and save that, OK?

54
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,480
And then we can use this permalink here to preview that on the front end.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:19,600
And now within this new page, maybe right about here, let's add a bit of HTML that creates a search

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,100
form.

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:28,030
Now, at the moment, this screen is being powered by page dot BHP, but we don't want to modify that

58
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,110
generic template that gets used for all pages.

59
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:39,400
So instead, let's go create a new theme file that is only used for this new page or this New York URL.

60
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,330
So over in our text editor within our theme folder, let's create a brand new file.

61
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,840
And if we give it a name of page dash and then match the slug of this new page.

62
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,330
So just search.

63
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,120
So page, dash, search, dot HP then it will.

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,030
We used for just that one page, so if I say hello, one, two, three.

65
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,800
That's what we see for that you are.

66
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,140
Now, obviously, this is not what we actually want.

67
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,970
So instead of that, why don't we just copy and paste the contents from the generic page PDF file and

68
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,860
then just modify it as needed.

69
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,570
So within page, I'm going to copy everything into my clipboard and then back in page dash search pasted

70
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,630
in OK.

71
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,140
And then down towards the very bottom of this.

72
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,790
I'm interested in this div generic content area where at the moment we see the WordPress function named

73
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,080
the content.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,710
Now this search form page doesn't need to have any actual WordPress body content, so why don't we delete

75
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:57,570
this block and instead this is where we can create an HTML form that visitors can submit.

76
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:05,760
OK, so opening and closing form tag and then within the form element, let's add an input where visitors

77
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,650
can type in their search phrase.

78
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:17,130
So we could say input type equals text, but in modern HTML there's actually a type named search.

79
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,110
OK, let's close out that input and then right below that let's add a submit button.

80
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,510
So create another input.

81
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,460
This time I will give it a type submit and then we can control the text of the button by saying value

82
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,580
equals and then whatever you want the button to say.

83
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,160
So I will say search, OK, and if I save that, we can see that in the browser.

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,870
We've now got the basic skeleton for a search form.

85
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,150
Right.

86
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,650
User can click here and type and now we just need to adjust the form a bit so that it plays along with

87
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,500
the WordPress search urofsky.

88
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,440
So if you've never worked with an HTML form before, let me show you what I mean.

89
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:09,410
If we give the TextField this first input, if we give it a name attribute and we name it the field.

90
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,660
Right.

91
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,430
Just make up some name for it.

92
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,500
And now if someone searches for biology and submits the form up in the address bar, we can see that

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,330
it added on Questionmark.

94
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,640
The field equals biology.

95
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,100
So we can see that in order to play along with the WordPress search, you are a format.

96
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,400
We just need to make two adjustments.

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,710
So first, we can just name that input field lowercase s instead of the field.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,220
And then the second change that we need to make is instead of adding this on to the end of the search

99
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,180
page, Eurail, instead of that, we just want to add on this to the end of the route, you R-AL or

100
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,660
the home page, you are out.

101
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,960
Now, both of those changes are very quick and easy to make.

102
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:05,370
So back in the code, let's name this input simply lowercase s and then on the opening form tag, if

103
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:14,040
we say action, this is where we can control the euro that it gets sent to now by default in HTML form,

104
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,950
just submits itself to its own neutral.

105
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:26,970
But if we say P, P and then ATCO out the results of site U, RL and then within these parentheses we

106
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,280
just say quotes forward slash.

107
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:37,470
This will generate the home page you url for our WordPress installation and just a quick WordPress security

108
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:37,860
tip.

109
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,920
Whenever you manually echo a U.

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:48,300
RL that's coming from your database, we should really wrap this within another function named Escape

111
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,660
U.

112
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,750
RL or FC U RL.

113
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,060
So then you could just cut and paste this function to live within the escape function.

114
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,510
I'm not going to get into the why or how this improved security because honestly that would be a three

115
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,740
to five minute rant.

116
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,700
If you're curious, you can definitely Google the WordPress FSC u RL function, but this is considered

117
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,470
a security best practice.

118
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:20,640
So if you wanted to go back through our header file and use this function any time we used the site,

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,780
you URL function, that would earn you some extra credit security points.

120
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,580
And it definitely wouldn't hurt.

121
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,860
Really quick, though, I will tell you that this isn't going to prevent your site from getting hacked

122
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,030
in the first place.

123
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,120
This is more to protect the visitors of your site.

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,090
If your site has already been hacked or compromised or if one of the admins of your website has gone

125
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,690
rogue.

126
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:50,070
OK, but moving on, at this point, we've told the form to add this onto the root of the euro instead

127
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,840
of the current page that you're on.

128
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,530
And we've also changed the field name to lowercase s.

129
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:03,480
Now, the one other thing I want to do on this opening form tag is give it another attribute named method,

130
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,500
and we want to set this to get if instead.

131
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,390
We set this to post, then whatever the visitor types into our field would not get added at the end

132
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,470
of the euro.

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,180
OK, so a method of gett will make sure that the contents of the form end up in the euro.

134
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,640
A lot of Web browsers will default to a value of git, but we always want to be sure to explicitly state

135
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,580
this as well.

136
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:39,170
OK, now if we go ahead and save this and then if I go back to just Google search and now if I search

137
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,070
for Matt.

138
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:49,620
Cool are form automatically generated this are for us, which successfully performed a search for math.

139
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:56,690
Now before we worry about the styling or formatting on this result screen and before we worry about

140
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,610
the styling of our form.

141
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,240
Right.

142
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,570
Because this is not going to win any design awards.

143
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:09,020
But before we get to that, we need to make sure that visitors of our website have a way of navigating

144
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,340
to that search page.

145
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,990
So right now, let's adjust this top right search icon so that if JavaScript is disabled, it takes

146
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,890
you to slash search.

147
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,790
So in order to make that change to this icon, I'm going to dig into our header file and in our HTML,

148
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,770
I actually have two copies of that search icon, one for the mobile layout and one for desktop.

149
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,560
So we're just going to make a minor change in two locations.

150
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,560
The first, just a few lines below our header element.

151
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:52,100
We see a span with a class of JSC search trigger and it contains an eye element with the search icon.

152
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,570
So let's do this.

153
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,070
Let's just convert this span that represents the search icon.

154
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,930
Let's convert it from a span into an attack, a link element.

155
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:10,670
So instead of opening span, let's just say a and then for the closing tag instead of spane, say A,

156
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,480
and then we want to be sure to give it an eight Dreft attribute.

157
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,290
Right.

158
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,030
That points towards slashed search.

159
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:25,270
So within the quotes for ATRA, let's open up HP and echo out escape.

160
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:33,560
You are out and within those parentheses, let's say site you are URL and we want slash search.

161
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,460
OK, now this element only shows up in the mobile layout and then I have another copy of the search

162
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,450
icon down below for the desktop layout.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,090
So in order to save a bunch of typing, let's just copy this.

164
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,810
Each Reath attribute and value till the end of the quotes.

165
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,880
Let's copy that into our clipboard.

166
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:59,000
And then if we scroll down a bit towards the bottom of the header element, here we see another spane

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,300
with the search icon.

168
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,850
So again, let's change this from a span into an a tag.

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,340
And then within the opening tag, let's paste in our clipboard.

170
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,410
Cool.

171
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:18,160
Now if we save this and now if I click the top right search icon, you can see it temporarily brings

172
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,260
up the overlay for a split second.

173
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,010
But then it takes me to the slash search page.

174
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,500
Now, if JavaScript is enabled, this is not what we want for visitors with JavaScript.

175
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,010
We want to ignore the default behavior of clicking on a link.

176
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,130
Now, doing that is very easy.

177
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,200
So let's jump into our text editor and let's open up our search JavaScript file.

178
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,050
So within the jazz folder and then the modules folder, let's hop in to search J.S. And if we just scroll

179
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,690
down to our open overlay method.

180
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,470
Here it is, this is the method that gets called when you click on that top right icon and right at

181
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,390
the very end of this method.

182
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,940
So down here, we can just say return false.

183
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,110
And this will prevent the default behavior of a or link elements.

184
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,110
So if we save that and make sure that your golpe watch task is running.

185
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,140
Now, if I click this top right icon and I have JavaScript enabled, cool, it doesn't take me to a

186
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,070
separate page.

187
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,980
It just pulls up the overlay and I'm free to perform a search.

188
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,280
However, now let's pretend that we are a visitor with JavaScript disabled.

189
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,720
So to simulate that, you could just go into your search jass file and temporarily delete everything.

190
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,100
So this way I can pretend that I have JavaScript disabled and now if I click the top right icon, it

191
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,750
takes me to search.

192
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,590
Perfect.

193
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:59,040
OK, so now that visitors with JavaScript disabled have a way of actually getting to this page.

194
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,120
Now let's focus on the design and styling and formatting.

195
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,370
Although really quick before I forget, I'm going to go back into my search jazz and press, undo command

196
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,110
or control Z to get all the code back.

197
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
I don't want to lose this code.

198
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,110
Let me save that.

199
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,850
OK, cool.

200
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,580
Now let's get down to styling our search form so that it actually looks nice.

201
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,450
So back in our text editor within Page Dasht Search.

202
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,740
Here's the form that we created just a few moments ago and within the opening form tag, let's give

203
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,630
it a class of search dash form.

204
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,340
This has nothing to do with WordPress.

205
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,310
It's just for access styling reasons.

206
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,890
OK, and then for accessibility reasons, maybe right above the search field.

207
00:15:50,550 --> 00:16:01,410
Let's create a label element and within the label, let's say perform a new search, OK.

208
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,340
And then in order to associate a label with an input so that if a user clicks on this, it automatically

209
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,470
focuses the input field.

210
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:18,990
All you need to do on the opening label, say, for S and then whatever you say that it is for, you

211
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,890
just need to provide a matching ID on your target.

212
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:28,310
So then on this input we can say ID equals X, you just want these to match.

213
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,390
OK, so if we save that.

214
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,750
It should look something like this, and clearly we are not done yet, so first let's make this label

215
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:45,980
text a bit larger and then after that, let's adjust the sizing of the input so that it uses up the

216
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,990
full width of this box with just enough space left over for the submit button.

217
00:16:52,610 --> 00:17:00,980
So first, let's give the label element a class of headline and a second class of headline.

218
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,350
Dash, dash medium.

219
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,340
All right.

220
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,400
And then in order to make the search field, take up all of the available width and just leave a tiny

221
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,640
bit of space on the right edge for the submit button in order to make that happen, I want to wrap them

222
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,870
in an outer div.

223
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:27,710
So right before the first input, let's say, dear, and give it a class of search form row and then

224
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:35,000
you could indent the two inputs and then right after them, let's close out the div tag and then finally

225
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,520
let's give classes to the two inputs.

226
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,120
Again, this is just for sixths reasons.

227
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,170
This has nothing to do with WordPress.

228
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,610
So let's give this one a class of S and let's give the submit class of search submit.

229
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,520
Cool.

230
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,860
So if we save that.

231
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,240
This is starting to look a lot better and just for good measure, why don't we give the search field

232
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,860
placeholder text?

233
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,630
So on the first input, we can just say placeholder equals and you could enter whatever you want.

234
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,480
But I'm going to say, what are you looking for now?

235
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,640
When someone first comes to this page, they see that there, but as soon as they click on it, they

236
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,990
can perform a search and then if they click the submit button, it takes them to the search results.

237
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,890
Perfect.

238
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,940
And that's going to bring part one of this lesson to a close.

239
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,490
In the next video, we will learn how to format this search result screen.

240
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,720
So that way all of the results don't look like a blog post.

241
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,290
Right.

242
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,420
This is a professor post type.

243
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:52,470
So it should show a little thumbnail of the professor with the name overlaid on top of it instead of

244
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,220
this generic one size fits all blog ish format.

245
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,600
So let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next video.
