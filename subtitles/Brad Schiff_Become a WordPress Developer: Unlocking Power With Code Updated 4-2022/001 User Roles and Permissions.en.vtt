00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.750
Hello, everyone, in this section of the course, we are going to learn about user roles and permissions

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.580
first.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.650
We will review the way that WordPress handles roles and permissions by default right out of the box.

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.510
And then after that, we will learn how to customize WordPress to operate exactly the way that we want

5
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.970
it to.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.860
So without further ado.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.250
Right now, let's jump into an example of why roles and permissions are so important in the first place.

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
So a lot of larger Web sites require a team effort.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
One single person cannot handle creating, inputting and updating all of the content.

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.230
So let's imagine that we have a co-worker that's going to help us manage this university site.

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.520
So we need to get them access to the admen dashboard.

12
00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.390
Now, some people just share their main admen user name and password with everyone on their team.

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.360
But that is a potential security nightmare.

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.620
Ideally, we want each person on a project to have their own unique username and password account.

15
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.140
So follow along with me right now.

16
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.760
Let's go create a brand new account for our hypothetical co-worker.

17
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.290
So to create a new user account, you can either hover over new up in this top, add Minbar and then

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.460
choose user.

19
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.840
Or if you just jump into the main admin dashboard down towards the bottom of the sidebar, we see users

20
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.610
and then choose add new.

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.330
So first we need to choose a user name.

22
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.550
Feel free to make up whatever user name you want, but I'm going to pretend that my cat is my co-worker.

23
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.550
That's going to help me manage the site.

24
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.230
So Kitty Doe, then we need an e-mail address.

25
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.230
If you have an alternate email address that is different from your main admin account, you can use

26
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.950
that here.

27
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.650
Or since we are really only doing this as a test, you could enter a really long fake gibberish email.

28
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.190
But I would only do that if this Web site is only ever going to live on your local host.

29
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.680
If you're working on a real Web site, you would someday like to push up live onto the Internet.

30
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.960
Then I recommend spending the time to create a real email address that we can use here.

31
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.410
OK, then these next three fields are optional.

32
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.820
We can leave them blank.

33
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.630
OK.

34
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.230
And the next thing I want to draw our attention to is the password.

35
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.130
By default, WordPress will generate its own random password for the user and then send it via email.

36
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.040
But in this case, I don't want to have to worry about retrieving an email so you can just click show

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.520
password and then just feel free to type in and create whatever password you can easily remember.

38
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.510
All right.

39
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.740
And finally, perhaps the most important thing on this screen is the role by default out of the box.

40
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.740
WordPress offers us these five choices.

41
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
A subscriber basically cannot do anything.

42
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.990
All they can do is manage their own profile info.

43
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.920
So things like their own first name and last name, one level above a subscriber is a contributor.

44
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.390
A contributor is someone who can create a rough draft for a post or page, but they can't actually publish

45
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.480
it so that the entire world can view it on the Web site.

46
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.450
And then one level above that is an author.

47
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.710
Authors are allowed to sign in and actually create and publish content, live up onto the Web site for

48
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.970
the whole world to see.

49
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.660
However, an author can only make changes to a post if they are the ones that created it in the first

50
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.260
place.

51
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.070
An author cannot change someone else's content.

52
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.410
An editor, however, can.

53
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.190
An editor cannot only create their own content, but they also have permission to edit and delete other

54
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.050
people's posts and pages.

55
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.170
And then finally, an admin has full, complete access to do whatever they want to the Web site.

56
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.700
And even if you completely trust someone, you might not want to make them an administrator unless they

57
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.950
are fairly tech savvy because it gives them the potential to really mess up a Web site.

58
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.090
So let's imagine that we invite our co-worker to be an editor.

59
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.760
So I chose the editor role and then just click add new user and they receive the new account.

60
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.290
Now, let's go ahead and try to log in as that new user account.

61
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.210
There's actually no need to log out out of our main admin account.

62
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.620
Instead, what we can do is just open up a new private browser window.

63
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.790
So in Google Chrome, that's referred to as a new incognito window.

64
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.460
So within this new window, if we visit our Web sites, you are well.

65
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.500
For me, that's local host.

66
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.310
Three thousand.

67
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.600
You can see that even though I'm logged in as the admen within my main browser window.

68
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.280
That's using my normal browser mode because this is using private mode.

69
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.250
We can log into a completely separate account.

70
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.000
So right now, WordPress considers this window a stranger.

71
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:29.690
But if we just go to slash WP admen, well, then we can log in as that new user account.

72
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.140
Cool.

73
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:41.910
So since this user is an editor and not an administrator, they don't have access to screens like appearance,

74
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.950
plug ins or settings.

75
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.480
But they do have full access to all six of our post types.

76
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.060
Right.

77
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.150
Blog posts, pages, campuses, events, programs and professors.

78
00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.200
And if that's what you want, you want this co-worker to be able to manage all of the post types.

79
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.010
Then you could almost stop here.

80
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.510
And this lesson is over.

81
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.890
However, in the real world, you don't always want to give someone editor access to all post types.

82
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.450
So as an example, let's imagine that we only want this co-worker to be able to manage the event posts.

83
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.950
So basically, we want this user to be an event planner and nothing more.

84
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.270
So the question becomes, how do we only give them access to that one post time?

85
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.140
Well, the answer is that we can just create our own brand new role.

86
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.590
So out of the box, WordPress starts with those five roles.

87
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.110
We saw a moment ago, subscriber, contributor, author, editor and admen.

88
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.980
And you and I can just create a brand new custom role and give it only the exact permissions that we

89
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.490
want.

90
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.640
So how do we go about creating a brand new role?

91
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.460
Well, if you know me, you know that I always try to use as few of plugins as possible.

92
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:07.380
However, there is a user roles and permissions plugin that is just so perfect and makes life so much

93
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.010
easier.

94
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.930
I can't help but recommend it.

95
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.230
It's completely free and it's an industry standard.

96
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.870
So let's go install the plug in right now.

97
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.020
So back in my main window where I am the ad man, lets hover over plug ins and then click add new.

98
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.200
And then in the top right corner.

99
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.340
Let's use the search bar to search for members.

100
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.490
So this is the plug and we're interested in.

101
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.290
You'll know that it's the right plug in if it's by member press.

102
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.480
And as of this recording, it has over 200000 active installations.

103
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:50.520
I believe if you search for members role editor, then it will show up as the first results.

104
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.170
Yep.

105
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.730
Here it is.

106
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.630
So let's go ahead and install now and then be sure to click.

107
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.650
Activate.

108
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.880
All right.

109
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.370
And now let's get back to the task at hand.

110
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.490
Let's create a new custom user role that can only manage the event post time.

111
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.250
OK.

112
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:13.360
And to begin using the new plug in in the left hand side bar, we now see members.

113
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.530
So if you hover over that, then we can click on roles.

114
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.420
Just a quick note before we go on any further.

115
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.240
When I first created this course, we used this same plug in, but it went by a different name.

116
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.230
Also, back then, you navigated to this role screen by hovering over the users menu in the left hand

117
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.920
side bar.

118
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:42.000
So if in a future video lesson you see me trying to navigate to this roles screen, please don't try

119
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.190
to find this screen from the user's menu.

120
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:51.090
Just know that you can always find this screen under the members menu in the sidebar so its members

121
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.410
and then roles, you can see all of the roles that you currently have.

122
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.760
At the moment we just have the default five that word press comes with.

123
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.530
And instead of modifying any of these, let's just create a brand new role.

124
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.460
So in the sidebar, under users, let's click add new role.

125
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.700
We can name this role whatever we want.

126
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:18.210
The name does not matter, but I'm going to call it event planner, since the only thing I want this

127
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.390
role to have access to is the event post time.

128
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.220
OK.

129
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:29.070
And as you can see, we simply grant or deny this new role, different permissions and abilities.

130
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.700
We are currently viewing the tab for general capabilities.

131
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.850
But if we wanted to grant this role permission to create blog posts, we could click on this or for

132
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.700
the page post type, we could click on pages.

133
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.130
However, we notice that we don't see a tab for our custom post types.

134
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.670
Right.

135
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.240
Things like events, campuses, programs and professors.

136
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:58.410
And this is because by default, when it comes to permissions and capabilities and WordPress, custom

137
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.220
post types are treated like generic blog posts.

138
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:09.390
Meaning if we clicked on the posts and checked the boxes to grant permission to this new role, that

139
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:16.080
would actually also grant permission to our for custom post types, because new custom post types by

140
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.030
default inherit the permissions and abilities from generic blog posts.

141
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.830
So what we need to do right now is go and edit the code where we registered the events post type.

142
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.660
So over in your text editor, instead of your theme folder, I want you to jump in to the M.

143
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:40.460
You must use plugins folder and within this file where we registered our different post types.

144
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:47.370
Let's scroll down until we find event and we basically just want to tell the event post type that it

145
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.370
should not behave like a blog post when it comes to permissions and capabilities.

146
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.330
Instead, it should require its own unique permissions and capabilities.

147
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:05.460
So maybe right before this supports line, let's just add a brand new line and let's say capability

148
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.530
type and let's set it to equal event.

149
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.200
Be sure to include a comma at the end.

150
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:20.400
Now, without this line, sort of the unspoken context and WordPress is that capability type is post

151
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.850
by default, which means as long as you have the permissions required to create a blog post, you also

152
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.980
have the permissions to create an event.

153
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:36.930
So by setting this to something unique like event, well, now we need to explicitly grant these custom

154
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.500
event permissions to each role as we see fit.

155
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:47.670
Or actually, I should say that this line of code creates new unique capabilities for event.

156
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:54.360
But then in order to actually enforce and require these permissions, we need a new line where we say

157
00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.320
Map, Medda cap, which stands for capabilities and set that to equal.

158
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.840
True.

159
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.900
Without this line of code.

160
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.140
We would need to program our own custom logic for when these new capabilities should be required.

161
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.440
So, for example, if you were building some weird, crazy Web site that defied all normal logic, maybe

162
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:22.200
for some weird reason you would want to set things up so that on the fourth day of the month, if your

163
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.930
user name starts with the letter s, then everyone on the Web site is allowed to edit events.

164
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.240
That's how flexible WordPress is.

165
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.550
It would allow you to set something like that up.

166
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.070
But most of the time, we do not need that.

167
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.460
So this line of code is our way of just saying, hey, WordPress, can you please reasonably require

168
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.290
event related permissions in order to edit and manage event post types?

169
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.150
Can you require the right permission at the right time?

170
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.810
In a sane fashion for us automatically.

171
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.230
OK.

172
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.990
So it's going to automatically map and require the right capabilities at the right time.

173
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.650
Cool.

174
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.510
Now let's go ahead and save this.

175
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:07.020
And with these two lines of code in place, if we jump back into the admen panel and refresh this screen

176
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.970
where we were trying to create a new role since I refreshed it looks like I need to type in the title

177
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.300
again.

178
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:18.570
So I will say event planner, but thanks to that new code that we just wrote, we now see a tab.

179
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:25.490
For events, so we can click on that and let's just go ahead and grant our event planner role.

180
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:31.650
All of these permissions so they can create their own events and they can edit and delete other people's

181
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.370
events.

182
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.660
All right, then, let's be sure to click, add, roll to save our progress.

183
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.210
And now let's go edit our co-workers account to assign them this new role.

184
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.110
So in the sidebar, under users, I will click all users.

185
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.900
Here's my kiddo coworker account.

186
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:50.800
Click on that.

187
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.670
Scroll down to the very bottom and we see this rolls area.

188
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.260
So I'm just going to d select Ed and then choose event planner.

189
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.360
Go ahead and update that.

190
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.240
And then back in my private window.

191
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.390
This is the window where I'm logged in as the co-worker.

192
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.390
I used to have access to all of the post times.

193
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.400
But now as soon as I refresh, I only have access to events.

194
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.240
Perfect.

195
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.730
And why don't we go ahead and test it out really quick?

196
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:27.100
So if I try to add a new event, maybe give it a title of math party, lorem ipsum dummy text.

197
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.770
Let's set the event date for September 2020.

198
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:42.000
It doesn't need a subtitle, but let's be sure to relate this program to math, since I called it math

199
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.540
party.

200
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.000
And then if I go ahead and publish that.

201
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.280
And then pull up the front end of the Web site.

202
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.000
And search for math.

203
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:53.950
Cool.

204
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.170
There we see under events, math party.

205
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.240
So things are working perfectly.

206
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:04.540
However, back in our main window where we are logged in as the admen, you might have noticed that

207
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.470
we no longer see events in our sidebar.

208
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.280
And that's because we only explicitly granted event permission to the event planner role.

209
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.350
But we probably also want to grant it to the administrator role.

210
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.450
So let's do that right now by looking under the user sidebar and clicking roles.

211
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.510
And then let's edit the administrator role.

212
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:31.030
Click on events and then go ahead and grant all of the capabilities.

213
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.670
Let's go ahead and update that.

214
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.170
And sometimes you need to refresh the page again.

215
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.830
But once I do, you can see I now have access to events again as the ad man.

216
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:44.880
Perfect.

217
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:50.730
Now, before we bring this lesson to a close, I want to cover something that blew my mind when I first

218
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:57.780
learned about it, and that is that the members plug in makes it super easy to assign multiple roles

219
00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.160
to a single user.

220
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:05.040
The reason this is so cool is you can create a bunch of different super specific roles.

221
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.320
And then depending on the co-worker that you want to invite into your project, you can combine the

222
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.330
roles to create the perfect recipe for their unique set of responsibilities.

223
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.130
So let me give you an example.

224
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.100
We've already created the event planner role.

225
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.450
Now let's go create another new role named campus manager.

226
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.070
So that would be someone who can only manage the campus post type.

227
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.460
I know this might seem a bit repetitive, but practice makes perfect.

228
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:39.120
So to set that up first, let's go back into our text editor and within the file where we register all

229
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.370
of our different post types.

230
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.690
Let's scroll down and find campus.

231
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.170
Actually, for me, I think it's up at the very top.

232
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.870
And anywhere in this, associates have array.

233
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:58.590
Let's just add on capability type equals and it doesn't need to match what the post type name is.

234
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.720
It just needs to be something unique.

235
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.150
But just to make sense, I'm going to say campus comma.

236
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:11.590
And then let's also say map cap equals true, OK?

237
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:18.000
Now, as soon as I save that, we can go back into the Admon dashboard and create a brand new role.

238
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.220
So to do that under the user side, Bartletts click add new role.

239
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.160
Let's name it campus manager.

240
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.960
Thanks to the code that we just wrote.

241
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.650
We see a campus tab here.

242
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.560
Let's click that.

243
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.540
Let's grant all of the capabilities.

244
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.340
And then click, add, roll.

245
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:38.990
OK.

246
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.380
And now if we invited a second or third or fourth co-worker into the project, we could obviously assign

247
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.150
them the campus manager role.

248
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.540
But what I think is super cool is we can also give this role to our existing Kitty Doe account.

249
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:59.140
So under users, if we click all users and click on the coworker account that we created at the beginning

250
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.870
of this lesson, scroll down to the very bottom.

251
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.930
And maybe we want this user to be an event planner and a campus manager.

252
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.800
So when I first found out that you could combine multiple roles, I was so excited because for the longest

253
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.190
time you could do this and other content management systems.

254
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.360
But there was no super easy, intuitive way of doing it in WordPress.

255
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.850
So let's go ahead and click update user.

256
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.610
And then back in my other private window where I am logged in as the co-worker.

257
00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.740
If I go back into the admin panel and refresh.

258
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.950
I now also have access to campuses.

259
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.070
This might not seem that cool or like that big of a deal at first, but trust me, it opens up the door

260
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.590
to an infinite number of possibilities.

261
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:52.430
You can create as many different roles as you need to and then perfectly mix and match and combine them

262
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.900
on a user by user basis, which I think is super useful.

263
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.740
Now, before we close this lesson out, just because practice makes perfect.

264
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.470
Remember that what we just did will remove the campus abilities from the admin.

265
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.460
And I like to make sure that my admen always has full access.

266
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.140
So just go back into roles.

267
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:19.480
Edit the administrator and just make sure to give it campus permissions or campus capabilities.

268
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:22.580
Cool.

269
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:27.980
Now, you might need to manually refresh, but as soon as I do, you can see campus's is back in business

270
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.740
for ADD.

271
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.220
And that will bring this lesson to a close in our next lesson.

272
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:41.630
We will learn how to setup open registration so that anyone can come to our Web site and sign up for

273
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:42.500
a new account.

274
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.330
Now, at first, the account won't have permissions or capabilities to do anything.

275
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.790
But in future lessons, we will learn how to give them special little abilities that will not hurt the

276
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.320
security of our site.

277
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.180
So let's keep things rolling.

278
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.070
And I will see.

279
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.440
And then.
