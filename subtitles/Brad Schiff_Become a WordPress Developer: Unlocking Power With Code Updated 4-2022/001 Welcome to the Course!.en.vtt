00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.720
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.400
In this video, I want to give you a bird's eye view so you know what to expect.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.770
Big picture.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.830
The goal of this course is for you to learn how to code completely custom websites with WordPress.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.360
We are going to build the site together for a fictional university.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.800
And along the way, we will slowly but surely become a WordPress developer.

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.060
First, I will have you install WordPress on your personal computer so that you have a private playground

8
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.810
copy of WordPress that you can practice and experiment with.

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.510
Next, we will take our first look at the programming language.

10
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.570
This is what powers the core of WordPress.

11
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.740
But don't worry, you don't need any prior experience with PHP.

12
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.510
After that, we will learn how to code and create a brand new theme.

13
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.600
After that, we will learn how to create custom post types.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.090
There is an entire world of WordPress beyond just posts and pages.

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.780
For example, let me show you the admin dashboard for our finished product in this course.

16
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.380
In my sidebar, we see posts and pages just like in a normal WordPress installation.

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.380
But I've also got campuses and events, programs, professors, notes, likes, and each of these post

18
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.820
types has its own unique set of fields instead of just a generic title and body field.

19
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.390
So, for example, if I click on professors and then if I click to edit, my professor named Dr. Barks

20
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.840
a lot.

21
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.600
Yes, we do have the generic title and body field, but we also have page, banner, subtitle and page

22
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.620
banner background image, which if we view this post on the front end, those fields control this background

23
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.110
image that is unique to just this Prof.

24
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.710
Page.

25
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.760
Here we see the page banner subtitle just for this one, professor.

26
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.480
And also if we scroll down a bit, we see this related programs field.

27
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.620
So in this left hand column, you can choose from the different programs or majors that are available

28
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.710
at this school and you move them over here to say which one this particular professor teaches.

29
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.150
And then this relationship between professor and program gets reflected on our front end.

30
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.760
So on this Prof page, if I scroll down, we see subjects taught biology.

31
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.000
This allows us to create relationships between different pieces of content and this opens up all sorts

32
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.140
of possibilities.

33
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.580
So, for example, if I click on campuses up in the header, we've got this interactive Google map with

34
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.570
pins on it and each pin is a campus post.

35
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.050
So, for example, we've got our downtown west campus.

36
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.340
And if I click on that.

37
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.800
It takes me to that detail screen for just this one campus, and if I scroll down, we can see programs

38
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.250
available at this campus math.

39
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:18.110
So long story short, custom post types and custom fields allow us to programmatically relate different

40
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.230
content together in really compelling ways.

41
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.870
OK, after that section of the course, we will move on to learn about JavaScript.

42
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.350
Our first big JavaScript project in this course is to power our live search results.

43
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.250
So, for example, I can either press the esky on my keyboard, ask for search, or just click this

44
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.780
search icon up in the top.

45
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.140
Right.

46
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.850
And that opens up this full screen transparent overlay.

47
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.270
And my cursor is automatically placed in this search field so I can just start typing for whatever I'm

48
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.110
searching for.

49
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.790
And on the fly in real time, we get our search results.

50
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.890
And not only that, but they are organized by the content type.

51
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.360
So I searched for biology here.

52
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:14.150
We have any related blog posts or pages, programs, professors, related campuses and even any upcoming

53
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.620
events that have to do with biology.

54
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.410
Now, there's really two main aspects to the JavaScript here.

55
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.280
Part one is the JavaScript to power the actual user interface.

56
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.820
Right, opening and closing the overlay and responding to click events, things like that.

57
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.960
And then the other aspect of the JavaScript is actually communicating with the WordPress server on the

58
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.670
fly in real time.

59
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.510
Right.

60
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.030
Because when someone searches for something, we need to send that search string to the server.

61
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.940
And then on the other hand, we also need to receive this incoming data from the server.

62
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.140
And all of this needs to happen in real time.

63
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.080
So this is a great exercise to learn all about JavaScript.

64
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.450
I think you're going to love this portion of the course.

65
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.100
Just a bit of a spoiler.

66
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.540
The WordPress rest API is what makes all of this possible and very elegant to set up.

67
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.300
OK, then in the next section of the course, we will learn about user roles and permissions.

68
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.390
So if you want to have multiple people help maintain the website, you do not need to give everyone

69
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.150
administrator access.

70
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.860
So, for example, if you wanted to invite a friend or a co-worker and the only thing you wanted them

71
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.310
to be able to do is manage the event post type, you could set that up, or if you wanted someone to

72
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.360
be a campus manager, you could restrict them to only be able to change those type of posts or you can

73
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.400
mix and match different permissions.

74
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.360
Maybe someone should be able to post into the blog and manage programs, but that's it.

75
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.570
The possibilities are endless and learning about roles and permissions will really open up new collaboration

76
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.110
doors.

77
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.930
Moving on, in the next section of the course, we will allow open registration.

78
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.380
So, for example, if I log out, I'm currently signed in with my admin account, but I can click log

79
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.230
out and then if I visit the website again, you can see that if a stranger visits the website, they

80
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.930
can log in or even sign up.

81
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.270
So with open registration, any random visitor can sign up for a basic account.

82
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.150
And once someone with a basic account signs in that gives them access to two new features.

83
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.520
The first feature is my notes.

84
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.360
And in this portion of the course, we really sink our teeth into the word press rest API.

85
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.600
We basically create our own mini single page application.

86
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.420
So if a student brings their laptop into a lecture hall, they can take a note biology, note number

87
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.970
five and take a few notes.

88
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.450
Write Lorem ipsum class was amazing.

89
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.930
Click create note.

90
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.910
On the fly, it gets added here and saved into the database, they are free to create another note.

91
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.180
Mark, note number one, did you know that two plus two equals four?

92
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:19.520
That's true.

93
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.920
Go ahead and click.

94
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.430
Create.

95
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.990
OK, and then from their existing notes, they're free to make edits, they can click this to change

96
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:36.030
the title click save all of this gets saved into the database on the fly and they can also delete one

97
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.810
of their notes.

98
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.000
In real time, the other feature that basic logged in users did has to do with liking a professor.

99
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.030
So maybe if I navigate to the doctor barks a lot.

100
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.350
Professor Page, you'll notice this little heart box.

101
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.960
Currently it says one to indicate that one other person has liked doctor barks a lot and notice the

102
00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.940
heart is hollow.

103
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.330
But if I click on it.

104
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:09.320
The heart fills in to indicate that I personally have liked this professor and you can see their light

105
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.720
count went up by one and thanks to JavaScript and the rest API, all of this happens on the fly.

106
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.450
So if I immediately decide that actually I don't like this professor, you can just click it again to

107
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.670
toggle or remove your like.

108
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.200
And all of this data is getting saved into the WordPress database.

109
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.680
After this section of the course, I show you how to push or deploy your website, live up on to the

110
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.530
web so that the entire world can view it.

111
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.190
And if you don't have a Web hosting account to practice with, that's OK.

112
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:50.510
This course gives you access to a free three month educational hosting plan, and it really is free

113
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.220
in the truest sense of the word.

114
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.240
You do not even need to enter a credit card or any form of payment.

115
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.770
So there's no way they can automatically bill you at the end of the three months.

116
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:08.270
So that way everyone has access to a Web post so you can practice deploying a site live and it's not

117
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:08.990
mandatory.

118
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:15.420
But if you're familiar with the git version control system, you are really going to love the automatic

119
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.260
get deployment set up that I can show you.

120
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.000
And finally, we end the course with a few extra credit challenges.

121
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.420
So there's the bird's eye view of the course.

122
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.060
I'm really excited to get things rolling.

123
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.450
My goal for this course is to give you lots and lots of small victories each time we finish a small

124
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.390
little feature or section and things work the way we want them to.

125
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.830
I want you to relish that small victory, because each time we write code and accomplish something with

126
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.130
it, we are moving closer to our career goals.

127
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.130
And that's something to feel good about.

128
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.180
So let's get some momentum rolling.

129
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.650
Let's get things started.

130
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.760
And most importantly, let's become a WordPress developer.
