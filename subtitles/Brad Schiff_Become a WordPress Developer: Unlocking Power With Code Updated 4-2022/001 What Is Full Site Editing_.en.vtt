00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.320
In this lesson, we're starting an entirely new chapter about something in WordPress called Full Site

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.950
Editing.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.270
If this is your first time hearing about full site editing, that's okay.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.350
Right now, our goal is to begin to answer the questions of, number one, what in the world is full

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.220
site editing?

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.420
And number two, what in the world is a block theme?

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.960
Well, I think instead of jumping right into a technical explanation, I think it's more intuitive to

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.300
just look at a sneak peek preview of the finished product of what we're going to be building together

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.350
in this chapter.

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.160
So right now on screen, this used to be the fictional university theme, the traditional theme with

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.720
AP templates.

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.400
However, off camera I've recreated it as a block theme and it now supports full site editing.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.580
I realize we don't know what those terms mean yet, but right now let me walk you through some of the

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.690
new features that this approach enables or supports.

16
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.720
And don't worry that I built this off camera.

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.320
The entire point of this chapter is for you and I to rebuild this together step by step.

18
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.990
But right now, let's get a big picture overview of why it's interesting or useful in the first place.

19
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.340
So for example, in the past with the traditional theme, how would you change the homepage content?

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.980
Maybe you'd have to edit the actual PHP template files, or maybe you created an actual page in WordPress

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.350
named Home Page and then you could edit the WYSIWYG main body content.

22
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.850
But even doing that is not super intuitive for the end user.

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.510
So when you have a block theme instead of a traditional theme that supports full site editing, watch

24
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.740
how easy this is.

25
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
You would just go into your dashboard under appearance.

26
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.990
Click Editor.

27
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.450
By default, it's going to pull up the front page or home page template and now you can just start clicking

28
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.870
to edit.

29
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.120
So imagine if I wanted to change this content.

30
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.470
I can just click right here if I want to get rid of the exclamation or ad three, whatever.

31
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.050
I can change this subheadline.

32
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.100
Can change this.

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.720
We put it back.

34
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.440
You get the idea.

35
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.260
If I want this button to be medium or small or large, if I want to change the color for the button,

36
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.100
just click on it.

37
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.800
Use this button to slide out the right hand sidebar.

38
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.070
Maybe I want it to be light orange or blue.

39
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.110
Let's go with light orange instead of dark orange.

40
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.040
So I click save.

41
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.240
Well, let me actually add a change here so we can see it on the front end.

42
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.090
So if I had three dots click save refresh.

43
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.250
Perfect.

44
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.390
We see the light orange button in the new text.

45
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.570
Also down below on the home page you can see we've got our upcoming events from our blogs and then a

46
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.290
slideshow.

47
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.930
So what if I wanted the slideshow to sit above this event in blogs area?

48
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.270
Well, you can scroll down in the editor.

49
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.980
Here is the slideshow area.

50
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.070
Just use the editor screen arrow to move that up.

51
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.490
Click save back on the front end.

52
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.120
Cool.

53
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.850
So now you've got the Welcome Banner slideshow and then the events in our blogs.

54
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.160
I think you're already starting to see the pictures.

55
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.740
So the idea is that changes that in the past you might have had to make in a theme file.

56
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.220
Now you can just make directly from the WordPress editor, hence the name full site editing.

57
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.250
Let's say I'm not happy with these changes that I just made.

58
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.930
They are sort of weird changes.

59
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.500
So you can just go back, click on templates here.

60
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.450
Here's the front page template.

61
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.350
I can just click this icon and click Clear Customizations and it's going to go back to its default appearance

62
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.100
and settings.

63
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.390
Cool.

64
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.070
Let's walk through another example.

65
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.550
So let's go to an individual blog post screen or a single blog post screen.

66
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.400
So if I visit a blog post, imagine I want to add to the very bottom of this template file.

67
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.660
So right below the footer right about here, what if I wanted a slideshow to sit here or that upcoming

68
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.340
events and blog posts area.

69
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.840
What if I wanted that to sit here?

70
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.390
Well, in the past you would have no choice.

71
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.170
You would need to go in to single that AP right.

72
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.800
And edit the template file, but with a block theme.

73
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.580
Check this out.

74
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.000
We just go into the template screen here, look for the single post template.

75
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.460
Let's click on that to begin editing it because there's nothing truly dynamic or customizable about

76
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.770
the header, the footer or just the body content.

77
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.780
I just have placeholder blocks here.

78
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.330
We'll learn more about this approach of mine later on, but imagine right before the footer, I wanted

79
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.160
to add something so I could just click this.

80
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.170
Let me begin to search for slideshow, so I'll insert my custom slideshow.

81
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.480
BLOCK Just for this example, let's create a slideshow with two slides just so we don't spend too much

82
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.750
time.

83
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.200
So I'll add my first slide with a heading and I'll say The sky is blue.

84
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.690
Let me make that a medium sized heading.

85
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.430
Below that we can add a clickable button and we won't worry about where it's actually linking to.

86
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.460
But let's just say learn more.

87
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.520
Now, if we click on the slide itself.

88
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.340
So this area with the black background notice on the right hand side bar, we can choose an image.

89
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.120
So you can choose one of your existing images or you can upload a new one.

90
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.560
I'll just click a random one.

91
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.650
Cool.

92
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.260
Let's add slide number two.

93
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.760
So you click on the overall grey area.

94
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.750
That's the parent slideshow as a whole.

95
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.380
If I click on that, you can see there's a button down here to add a second slide.

96
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.950
So I'll just say slide number two.

97
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.480
We can leave that as a large headline.

98
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.450
Let's add a button that says Amazing and let's make that button orange instead of default blue.

99
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.450
Let's add a background image for the slide.

100
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.230
Let's go with this building.

101
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.120
So if I click save and then go refresh this individual blog post screen.

102
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.470
Cool.

103
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.750
So there is the blog post content.

104
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.370
And then down at the bottom there is our slideshow with our two slides.

105
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:25.180
The point here is that we modified this single blog post template without ever having to go into our

106
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.680
text editor, and we did so in a way that's still consistent with the design language and branding of

107
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.120
our theme, right?

108
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.980
These are the exact same slideshow styles that you would have seen on the homepage.

109
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.200
For one final example, I want to show you how we can really get creative here.

110
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.940
So imagine we were the end user or owner of this site and not a web developer.

111
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.150
And imagine we wanted to create a landing page.

112
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:59.680
So maybe just an interesting banner image area, a bit of text, and then no footer and no navigation

113
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.090
links.

114
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.420
Just a landing page, right.

115
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.890
Well, check this out.

116
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.760
If we go into WordPress, let me go back to the overall dashboard.

117
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.800
Let's create a new page.

118
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.300
So add new page.

119
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.070
I'll name this page.

120
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.350
Example, landing page.

121
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.490
Now, here's the cool part.

122
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:22.480
Under page template, I'm going to choose something called Brad's blank canvas.

123
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.640
Now, the name doesn't matter.

124
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.820
I just made this name up.

125
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.710
But if I select that, well, it's essentially giving me a blank slate.

126
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.880
So check this out.

127
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.330
If we add a paragraph that just says Lorem ipsum in, publish this page and then view it.

128
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.060
Cool.

129
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.870
So there's no header, there's no footer.

130
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.240
There's just a little bit of content.

131
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.360
However, due to the nature of a block theme and the way that I've set up my specific block theme,

132
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.730
we can use the power of composition, right?

133
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.490
And just start adding whichever blocks we want.

134
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.500
So let me get rid of Lorem ipsum.

135
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.760
Imagine if you did want the navigation up at the top.

136
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.370
Well, I have a block called Header.

137
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.660
But if you don't want that, you don't have to include it for this specific page.

138
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.790
So maybe we just want a banner area.

139
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.860
So I named it homepage banner.

140
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.740
I probably should have named it something more generic, like just banner.

141
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.570
But I can click that.

142
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.460
We choose a background image.

143
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.990
How about this dog?

144
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.290
Let me add a heading landing page.

145
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.160
Below that, we can even add a button.

146
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.790
Learn more.

147
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.070
Make it dark orange.

148
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.960
And then maybe we don't even want the universal site footer at the bottom of this page.

149
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.300
Maybe we just want upcoming events and blogs or, you know, any other block.

150
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:48.700
So maybe if I just search for events and blogs, add that if I click update and go refresh.

151
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.170
Cool.

152
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.890
It was that easy to create a completely custom template, right?

153
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520
There's no site wide navigation at the top.

154
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.880
There's no footer at the bottom.

155
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.650
We just created a landing page.

156
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.260
Or, you know, you could have added any content you wanted.

157
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.130
So over the last five or 10 minutes, we've seen that you could very easily edit the homepage, right?

158
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.670
We learned how to edit this content and rearrange this content.

159
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.220
We've edited the single blog post template and we just set up a custom landing page template and we

160
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.640
did all of this without digging into our text editor.

161
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.640
So I am fully aware we have not answered the technical question of what is full site editing or what

162
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.810
is a block theme, right?

163
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.690
We have an answer to those questions from a technical or code perspective, but hopefully we've answered

164
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.520
them from the why would you even bother perspective, right?

165
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.740
Hopefully you've seen how the features that they enable are interesting or cool, or you could see how

166
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.160
they'd be useful for your clients or your end users.

167
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.550
From here, in our very next lesson, we are going to begin answering the questions from a technical

168
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.300
