00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.110
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.770
In this lesson, we will continue to build the blog section of our Web site.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.150
So up in the address bar, if I add on a blog at the end, here's the generic blog listing screen that

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.310
we created in our previous lesson.

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.850
And in this lesson, we're just going to continue building this out.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.690
Now, the first thing that I want to focus on is pagination.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.330
Now, by default, WordPress will show your ten most recent blog posts.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.540
But what if we have more than 10 blog posts?

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.840
Well, then we would need some sort of pagination links down here that take you to the next 10 and the

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.640
next ten.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
Now, at the moment, I only have four total blog posts.

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.900
And instead of going to create ten or 20 dummy posts right now to test out pagination, let me show

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.740
you what we can do.

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.030
Instead, if we jump in to our WordPress admin, lets look within the settings menu and then click on

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.370
the reading option.

16
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:13.430
So this field here blog pages show at most this controls how many blog posts get displayed per page.

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.640
So instead of ten, if I set this to two and then click save if we refresh our generic blog listing

18
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.030
screen.

19
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.650
Now scroll down a bit.

20
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.930
You can see that it only loads to blog posts, right?

21
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020
So then we would want pagination links here to take you to the next two.

22
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.130
So let's go ahead and add those links right now.

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.270
Let's jump into our text editor and in your theme folder, Open Up Index Dot P and we want to add the

24
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.800
links at the bottom of the page.

25
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.560
So let's scroll down to the bottom of this template and let's add the links right before this final

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.850
closing div.

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.140
So that way the links are still horizontally centered within this container div.

28
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.840
So right above this closing div line, I want to write a bit of P now.

29
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.880
I could open up again, but I can see that it's already opening and closing here.

30
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.810
So why don't we just add a new line right below this line and now we're free to write whatever we want.

31
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.470
Now watch how easy it is to create pagination links.

32
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.140
We just echo out the results of a WordPress function named pagination underscore links.

33
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.120
That's all it takes.

34
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.760
So if we save that and refresh.

35
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.230
Perfect, so we are on the initial just blog page or in other words, were on the first or number one

36
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.670
page of results, but then you could click on to or next go to the next page of results.

37
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.390
So up in the euro now, you can see its blog page, too.

38
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.740
And this will show us to new blog posts.

39
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.130
And now that's it.

40
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.650
So there's no link to a third page and you can click one to go back or previous to go back to the first

41
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.130
page.

42
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Or if we wanted to, we could create two new dummy posts and then there would indeed be a three to go

43
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.480
to the next page.

44
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.800
You get the idea.

45
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.070
But really, that's all there is to creating simple pagination links.

46
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.020
So now that we added that to the template and we tested it out, it works.

47
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.790
It looks good.

48
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.660
Let's go back into our WordPress settings and bump this back up from two to the default of 10 save changes.

49
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.020
Refresh the front end of our website so we don't see any pagination links because I don't have more

50
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.220
than 10 posts.

51
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.110
So pagination isn't needed.

52
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.290
But now we can rest assured, knowing that once we create enough blog posts, those links will work

53
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.080
just fine.

54
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.820
All right.

55
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.170
Now let's change gears.

56
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.090
And the next thing I want to work on is the single DOT template.

57
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.520
Right, because that's the template that's used.

58
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.630
If you click on one of these blog posts and visit the Eurail, that is for just one single particular

59
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.290
post.

60
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.830
Now we can immediately see that this template needs our attention.

61
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.200
Right.

62
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.720
Things don't look quite right.

63
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.790
So let's fix this up right here.

64
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.240
Right now, back in our text editor.

65
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.060
Let's jump into single dot p.

66
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.980
Let's begin by giving this template the same top banner area that all of our other templates use.

67
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.960
Now, we can save ourselves a lot of typing by just borrowing code from page dot because single and

68
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.770
page dot are very similar to one another.

69
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.150
One is used for individual posts and the others for individual pages.

70
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.390
So obviously we can borrow quite a bit from Page Dot.

71
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.150
So let's jump into that page file and let's begin by copying this page banner div into our clipboard.

72
00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:01.030
And then back in single dot p, let's paste in that code right below this, the post line, right,

73
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.440
because this function, the post gets the relevant data ready.

74
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.910
So then right below that we can add whatever HTML we want before we paste in our clipboard.

75
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.660
We can actually go ahead and delete this heading level two and also this section where we are calling

76
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.430
the the content function.

77
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.090
OK, so now we can go ahead and paste in our clipboard.

78
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.010
That code will dynamically pull in the title of the current blog post.

79
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:34.120
So if we save that and refresh perfect, we've got the banner area and here is the real dynamic title

80
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.980
for now.

81
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.640
Don't worry about this subtitle.

82
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.830
We will implement that in a future lesson.

83
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.720
For now, let's focus on adding the actual content for this blog post.

84
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.740
So back in our text editor below this page banner div, we are going to want a new div that will horizontally

85
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.070
center our content and I don't expect us to memorize the class for that div so we can just jump in to

86
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.170
page dot p and here's that div that I'm referring to.

87
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.160
So it's got all of these classes that will apply the appropriate styling.

88
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.500
So let's just copy and paste this opening div into our clipboard and then jump back into the single

89
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.470
file that we are working on and then just paste in our clipboard right below this closing div.

90
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.700
Cool.

91
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.290
So we just opened up a new div.

92
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.890
Let's be sure to close that same div out and then within that div let's open up a new line and let's

93
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.820
do two things.

94
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.070
First, let's say metabolics will go here.

95
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.760
That's just a note to ourselves.

96
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.740
Will add that in, in just a moment from now.

97
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.180
And then below that line let's open up a brand new div, OK, and then close out the div and let's give

98
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.380
this new div a class of generic dash content, OK?

99
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.950
And within this new div is where I'm going to output the blog post content.

100
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.080
This generic content class will make sure that it gives the paragraphs and different heading levels

101
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.400
the perfect styling.

102
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:09.010
So within this div we can just drop in and use the function named the content.

103
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.790
Cool.

104
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.670
So if we save that and refresh, there's the dynamic body content for the post.

105
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.310
Now we just need to set up the metabolics.

106
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.070
And what I have in mind for the metabolics here is sort of a combination of what we see on the generic

107
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.540
blog listing screen.

108
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.320
Right.

109
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.810
Remember this beige metabolics that we set up here with the author, the date in the category.

110
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.160
Let's combine that with the metabolics we see on children pages.

111
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.240
So, for example, if I go up into the header and click on about us.

112
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.220
And then click on one of these children pages, remember here, this metabolics has a nice link that

113
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.200
takes you back to the previous page.

114
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.110
So on individual blog posts, this back link could say blog home and this beige area can have the author

115
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.380
the date in the category.

116
00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.170
Cool.

117
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.070
So let me go back to an individual blog post screen.

118
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.870
Second test post and let's get to work on this metabolics.

119
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.670
So back in the text editor at the moment, I'm in single.

120
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:19.190
But let's jump over into page B and right below the page banner and then this generic container div

121
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.660
right below that.

122
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.060
This section is the metabolics.

123
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.810
Now, we don't need any of this at the beginning or the end.

124
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.700
We just want the actual div that represents that metabolics.

125
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.120
So go ahead and highlight from the opening div to this closing div and copy that to your clipboard and

126
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.110
then let's jump back into the single dot BHP file that we're working on.

127
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:49.610
And let's just replaced this metabolics will go here, line with our clipboard in case that in and then

128
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.350
you'll notice an eye element, that's what's creating the home icon.

129
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.810
Now, right after that icon is the text that says back to and then it would normally say the parent

130
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.670
page name.

131
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.480
But in our case, instead of saying back to a page, we want it to just say blog home.

132
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.890
So before we delete the words back to let's delete this P here that's responsible for getting the name

133
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.110
of the parent page.

134
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.500
So from the opening to the closing tags, let's delete that.

135
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.300
And now we can go ahead and replace this back to to just say log home.

136
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:31.460
OK, so that means that for this hyperlink, this element, we just updated the text that you click

137
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.760
on.

138
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:37.080
But now let's be sure to update the Eurail that defines where you should go when you click it.

139
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.370
So for the value of this attribute, we're already going into P, but let's just go ahead and delete

140
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.070
what's there.

141
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.440
This code will echo out the permalink for the parent page, but that's not what we want.

142
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.850
So let's delete that.

143
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:56.480
OK, so now I've just got a blank canvas for this RF value and we just want to point towards our main

144
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.160
generic blog listing U.

145
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.210
RL and remember, that's our domain and then slash blog.

146
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:11.060
So to output that, let's say, echo the results of a function named site, underscore you URL and that's

147
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.570
a function.

148
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:17.320
So parentheses and then quotes and now we can just say slash blog.

149
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.080
Cool.

150
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.540
And this function will make sure that the euro that's generated is absolute instead of relative.

151
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.480
So that way the link will work no matter where you're coming from.

152
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.730
OK, at this point, let's save that and see what it looks like.

153
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:30.930
Cool.

154
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.960
So we're almost there.

155
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.200
We've got blog home and if I click it, it takes me back to the blog listing screen.

156
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.930
And then if I click back on one of my blog posts, all we need to do now is instead of outputting the

157
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.510
title again here in the Bay Area, instead of that, let's output the author, the date and the category

158
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.680
for the blog post.

159
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.630
So we don't need to rewrite that code.

160
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.190
We can just copy and paste it.

161
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:59.480
Remember, we already wrote that code back in our index file, so jump into your index file.

162
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.170
And about halfway down in that file, we have a div with a class of metabolics.

163
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.850
Now we don't need to copy and paste that development, nor do we even need to copy and paste the p html

164
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.300
tag.

165
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.730
But we do just want to copy and paste all of the content that lives inside that P tag.

166
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.190
So copy from the word posted all the way to the end of this closing tag.

167
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.400
So I will copy that into my clipboard.

168
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.670
And then let's go back into the single file that we're working on.

169
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.840
Here's the metabolics div that we're focusing on, and all we need to do now is just delete this area

170
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.430
that's echoing out the title.

171
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:42.530
So now our cursor is simply within this spane element right here and just paste in your clipboard.

172
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.790
Perfect.

173
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.090
So that will give us the author the date in the category.

174
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.910
So save that and then refresh.

175
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.530
Perfect, and that means that our job of fixing up the single DOT template is complete.

176
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.190
Things are looking good now at this point, you might be wondering about this author link and this category

177
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.600
link.

178
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.800
So, for example, I assign to this blog post to a category named Awards.

179
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:17.280
And if I click on that awards link, notice up in the address bar that takes us to slash category slash

180
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.350
awards.

181
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.610
And this screen will only show blog posts from that category.

182
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:28.280
And you might be thinking to yourself, if we're on a category archive screen like this, do you really

183
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:35.330
want to say welcome to our blog or would it make more sense for this title text here to say awards category

184
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.520
archive or posts about awards or something along those lines?

185
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.610
Or for another example, back in the metabolics?

186
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.350
What about the author link?

187
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:53.090
So if I click on that link up in the address bar, we see author Brad and this screen obviously will

188
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.610
only show blog posts from that author.

189
00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:02.540
And again, we would probably want this to say something like posts by Brad or author archives or something

190
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.050
custom.

191
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.350
Right.

192
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.110
Not just welcome to our blog.

193
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.470
Well, in our very next lesson, we will learn how to do exactly that.

194
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.170
Should be a lot of fun.

195
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.760
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
