00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:08,440
In this lesson, we will learn how to associate an image with a post in WordPress.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,010
This is referred to as a featured image.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,170
Let's dive right into the action.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,310
In this case, I want to associate an image with each professor.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,380
So if I click on programs up in the header and then click on Biology, I can click on Dr. Bachs a lot

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,330
under the biology professors.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,830
OK, and now that I'm on a professor page, I can use this link up in the header menu bar edit professor.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,430
And I said I want to associate an image with this professor.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,370
So sometimes your first instinct might just be to use the add media button to add a photograph into

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,990
the main content box.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,540
However, in this case, that's not what we want.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
We don't want to edit the content.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,140
Instead, we want to programmatically assign a one on one relationship between this post and an image.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,050
Now, depending on which WordPress themes you've used in the past, you might be familiar with a box

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,020
that usually sits right about here named Featured Image or Post Thumbnail.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,850
So our goal for this lesson is to enable that feature by default.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,010
Themes do not support featured images in order to enable featured images.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,620
Let's jump into our text editor and in our theme folder, I want you to open up functions dot p hp.

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,100
Now, in a previous lesson, we already created a function named University Features and within this

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,520
function.

22
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,800
This is where we can tell WordPress what sort of features we want our theme to support.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,890
So right below this ad features support line.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,590
Let's just add a new line and call ad thene support again.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,900
And this time let's give it an argument of post Dasch thumbnails in WordPress.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,520
Featured images are also sometimes referred to as post thumbnails.

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,080
OK.

28
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,420
Let's go ahead and save this now.

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,940
That alone will still not enable featured images for our professor post type.

30
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,340
The code we just wrote will indeed enable featured images for blog posts.

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,190
But when it comes to custom post types, we have to go the extra mile or extra kilometer.

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,930
So for the next step, we can temporarily forget about the theme folder.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,770
And instead, I want you to jump in to our M.

34
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,270
U or must use plugins folder.

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,180
So within this file where we register our different post types, let's scroll down to the bottom for

36
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,560
the professor post type and let's focus on this supports parameter and within the array for that, let's

37
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,580
add on a comma and add on thumbnail.

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
Not post thumbnail.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,510
Just simply thumbnail.

40
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,040
OK.

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,430
Now let's save that.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,930
Perfect.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,800
There we have it.

44
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,230
Let's go ahead and test this out.

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,430
So set featured image, let's select a file to upload.

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,390
I've already got a JPEG on my computer named Barks a lot.

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,830
You're obviously free to use any photographs that you want to use from your computer.

48
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,350
If you do want to follow along and use the same images as me, you should be able to find these photos

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,260
in the attached resources for this lesson.

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,740
So I will select this photo of a dog.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,210
And then in the bottom right corner set featured image cool.

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,990
There it is.

53
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,230
Let's go ahead and update this or save the post.

54
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,790
And while we're at it, why don't we edit the other professor that was named miaows a lot.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,750
Someone to click on, professors to view a list of them.

56
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,440
Here's Dr. Miaows a lot before we add an image.

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,790
Why don't we also say that miaows a lot teaches biology.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
So add that as a program.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,190
Cool.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,820
And then let's set a featured image for miaows a lot to upload files, select file.

61
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm going to use this photo of a cat.

62
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,330
You're free to follow along or use your own image in the bottom right.

63
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:08,990
Click set.

64
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,890
Featured image.

65
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,210
Cool.

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,810
There we have it.

67
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,700
Let's update or save that post.

68
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,970
And the logical question now is how do we actually use that image on the front end of our Web site?

69
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,840
So if I use this permalink to view the individual screen for Dr. Miaows a lot, you could imagine that

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,450
we would want to output that image right about here.

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,400
So let's do that right now.

72
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,470
This screen is being powered by a single dash professor.

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,010
So back in our text editor, we can forget about the IMU plugins folder for now.

74
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:48,280
Let's switch back to our theme folder and let's jump in two single dash professor dot p HP.

75
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,870
Down here we see a class of container.

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,350
And within it we see a deal with a class of generic content.

77
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,910
And this block of P HP is what's responsible for outputting this text here.

78
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,110
The main content.

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,480
So right before the content.

80
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,970
Why don't we output the featured image?

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:12,680
We can just say the post thumbnail and it's a function semicolon.

82
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,250
And this function will create an H t AML image element and pull in the feature the image source.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,020
So let's save that.

84
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,520
Cool.

85
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,450
There's the image.

86
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,640
I think it will look better, though, if the image maybe only took up one third of the width.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,820
And then the text sat side by side and took up two thirds of the width.

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,410
Right.

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,330
So just a typical to call them layout.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,730
So to achieve that in our code.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,820
Why don't we actually delete this entire block of P HP here with the post thumbnail and the content.

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,980
So we can get a fresh start.

93
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,020
OK.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,700
So now you've just got this empty generic content div and within it, let's drop down to a new line

95
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:02,240
and let's create a new div with a class of row and group and include closing tag.

96
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:11,900
And then within that brand new div, let's create one div that has a class of one third and close out

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,560
that div.

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,870
And this is where the featured image will live.

99
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,550
We will add that in just a second.

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,240
You can add spacing around the device if that helps you stay organized.

101
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,110
But right below this did.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,910
Let's create another div with a class of two thirds.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,490
Close it out.

104
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,590
And this is where the content will live.

105
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,530
So now you've got this two column layout.

106
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
First column.

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,870
Second column within the first column.

108
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,880
Let's output the feature image.

109
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,680
So the function is the post thumbnail.

110
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,560
And then within the second column, let's output the main content.

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,380
So p hp the content.

112
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,080
Let's give that to save.

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,460
Cool.

114
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,110
I think that looks a lot better.

115
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,440
And now that we've added the featured image to this professor profile screen, let's go back to a program

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,040
post.

117
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,570
So, for example, if I click on to the biology program down in the related professor's area instead

118
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:18,140
of just a boring plain text list, I think it would be nice if we pulled in the featured image for each

119
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,830
professor.

120
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,750
And then overlay the transparent bit of text with their name on top of the image.

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,490
So let's go ahead and set that up right now.

122
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,730
The theme file that controls this screen is single dash program.

123
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,240
Let's scroll down a bit until we see the related professors custom query.

124
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,540
And right below that in this while loop.

125
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,340
That's where we control the H.

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,670
TMF that gets output once for each professor.

127
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,180
Now, before we output the image here, I first want to add a few CSF classes to these elements to get

128
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,590
the styling just right.

129
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,890
So on this list item, let's give it a class of professor card.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,260
Underscore.

131
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,250
Underscore.

132
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,760
List item.

133
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,920
And then right after the closing list item tag.

134
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,630
And right before the opening.

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,370
A tag.

136
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,510
Let's drop down to a new line.

137
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,010
Just to stay organized.

138
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,460
And we can also drop down at the end of the a tag line.

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,870
In terms of the contents of the element, let's actually delete that.

140
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,020
And in between the opening and closing tags.

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,910
Dropped down to a new line.

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,660
On this opening, a tag, we can keep the H ref in the permalink, but right before that, let's go

143
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:44,310
ahead and give this element a class of professor card.

144
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,030
OK.

145
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,180
And then within the tag, I want to create two new elements.

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,350
One is the image of the professor and the other is a span with their name that will be overlapped or

147
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,570
overlaid on top of the image.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,150
So first, let's create an image.

149
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,730
And then right below that, let's create a span tag to get the styling right.

150
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,470
Let's give the image a class of professor card.

151
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,020
Underscore, underscore image.

152
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,300
And let's give this span class of professor card.

153
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,460
Underscore.

154
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,750
Underscore name.

155
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,920
OK.

156
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,680
Now within the span we just want to output the title.

157
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,980
Right.

158
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,360
That's the professor's name.

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,560
So go into BHP and call the title.

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,880
And then on this image element, let's just give it a source attribute that points towards the U.S.

161
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,650
role of the featured image.

162
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:51,070
So to do that, we're gonna need to drop in to BHP and let's call a function named the post thumbnail.

163
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,740
You are well, and that's a function.

164
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,020
So give it its own set of parentheses.

165
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,830
OK.

166
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:03,040
And before we save this, if we are creating multiple list item elements, we probably want them to

167
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,510
all live within a single you l or unordered list element.

168
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:15,030
So right before this, while loop begins up here, let's go out and unordered list element.

169
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,960
Just the opening tag.

170
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:26,260
And let's give it a class of professor cards, as in plural semicolon at the end of that line.

171
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,590
And then right when our list item element closes.

172
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,760
So, yeah, we have this one curly bracket that closes out the while loop.

173
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,920
Let's go right underneath that line.

174
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,310
But notice not underneath this if statement curly bracket.

175
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,520
So in between the two curly brackets, let's just echo out a closing unordered list tag.

176
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,220
And be sure to have a semicolon at the end.

177
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,260
OK.

178
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,700
Let's go ahead and save that.

179
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,020
Perfect.

180
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,790
We see Dr. Barks a lot.

181
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,620
And Dr. Miaows a lot.

182
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,260
There's a nice little hover effect and if you click on one of them were taken to their detailed screen.

183
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,430
OK.

184
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,920
Now, at this point, let's change gears a bit and talk about the size of the image.

185
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,390
So, for example, if I.

186
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:11,720
Right.

187
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,350
Click on the image and choose open image in New Tab.

188
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,460
In that new tab, you can see that the image is almost 5000 pixels wide by three thousand pixels tall,

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,400
right?

190
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,040
There's the full resolution.

191
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,140
Now, that is way too large.

192
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,110
We are not going to display the image full screen.

193
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,280
So there's no reason to force the visitors of our Web site to download an image.

194
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,570
That's that huge.

195
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,080
Right.

196
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,810
That's just going to waste their data plan or their bandwidth.

197
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,600
Also, when it comes to the size of this image, you can imagine that on the professor detail screen,

198
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,810
we might want the image to be taller than it is wide.

199
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,530
Right?

200
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,730
Maybe portrait instead of landscape.

201
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,970
So portrait on this screen.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,370
But then back on the program page.

203
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,490
In this instance, we're happy with the images being in landscape wider than they are tall.

204
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,340
Now, before we get into the code that controls the size of images, I first want to show you something

205
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,360
right now.

206
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,730
I want you to open up the folder or directory where your WordPress site lives.

207
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,560
And then I want you to go into the WP content folder and let's go into a folder that we have not inspected

208
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,390
until this very moment, a folder named Uploads.

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,950
By default, WordPress keeps things organized by year and then month.

210
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,850
OK.

211
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,790
But the reason I'm showing you this folder is to point out that by default, you'll notice there's five

212
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,730
copies of each image that we've uploaded.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,130
So, for example, when it comes to barks a lot.

214
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,230
Here's the original high resolution, very large copy of the photo.

215
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,780
But then WordPress automatically generates all of these different sized copies.

216
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,740
So here's one.

217
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,750
That's about a thousand pixels wide.

218
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,820
About eight hundred pixels wide.

219
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,900
Three hundred.

220
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,870
And finally, a tiny 150 by 150.

221
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,480
That's cropped to be a perfect square.

222
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,310
So we've got the original image.

223
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,660
And then WordPress automatically generates four resized copies.

224
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,710
But luckily, in our theme, we can tell WordPress to automatically generate another copy of the image

225
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,960
that is any size that we want.

226
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,160
So check this out.

227
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,540
Back in our text editor, let's jump in to our functions.

228
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,400
Dot p HP file.

229
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:39,040
And within our function that is named university features right below this ad theme's support post thumbnails

230
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,560
line to add a new line and call a function named ad image size.

231
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,390
So, for example, first, let's create an image size that is the perfect landscape aspect ratio for

232
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,590
a professor photo.

233
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,160
So in this case, the photo does not need to be very large at all.

234
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,550
Right.

235
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,330
So within our ad image size function, we need to pass it.

236
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,680
Several arguments.

237
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,110
The first argument is a nickname for this image size.

238
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,790
We can name this whatever we want.

239
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,320
But just to make sense.

240
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,920
Why don't we call it Professor Landscape?

241
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,650
You could call it pizza or unicorn.

242
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,830
And then the next argument is how many pixels wide the image should be.

243
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,770
Let's say 400.

244
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,860
The next argument is how many pixels tall the image should be.

245
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,270
Why don't we say two hundred and sixty?

246
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,910
And the final argument is if you want to crop the image or not.

247
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,570
So by default, this is set the falls.

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,710
And what that will do is just constrain the image to either the maximum width or height that you've

249
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,340
defined.

250
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,650
However, if we want the image to be exactly this wide and exactly this tall.

251
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,430
Well, the only way to really enforce that is if you cropped the image.

252
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,090
So if you're willing to crop the image, you can set this to true.

253
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,070
And by default, WordPress will crop in towards the very center of the photograph.

254
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,800
We will learn more about cropping in just a moment.

255
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,530
But for now, we've successfully created a new image size.

256
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,870
Let's go ahead and create another size for Professor Portrait.

257
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,560
Right.

258
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,440
Because back on a professor detailed screen, maybe we want the image to be taller than it is wide.

259
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:30,130
So back in our code, let's just call the ad image size function again.

260
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,510
Let's give this size a nickname of Professor Portrait.

261
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,350
How wide should it be?

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Let's say 480.

263
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,700
How tall should it be?

264
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,590
Let's say six hundred and fifty.

265
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,750
I'm just making these numbers up, by the way.

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,210
And let's say that it also is allowed to crop to match those sizes perfectly.

267
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:52,840
Okay.

268
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:59,380
Now, if we save this and then jump back to our uploads folder, you'll notice that there's still only

269
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,360
five copies of each image.

270
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,320
And that's because WordPress will use these rules or new sizes for future images that we upload.

271
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,770
But WordPress isn't going to go back and retroactively create the new sizes for these images that we've

272
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,940
already uploaded.

273
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,770
So let me show you a quick example.

274
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,050
If I go into my Admon dashboard and maybe create a brand new professor.

275
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,670
So add new professor.

276
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,900
Let's name this professor, Dr. Frogh person.

277
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,780
Let's add a bit of dummy text for the content.

278
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,990
Let's say that Dr. Frogs' lesson teaches math.

279
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:42,730
But most importantly, if we give him an image set, featured image and upload a new file of a frog.

280
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,910
You can find this image and the resources for this lesson.

281
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,340
There it is.

282
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,390
Let's go ahead and click set featured image down on the bottom right here we see the frog.

283
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,210
Let's go ahead and publish or save this new post.

284
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:55,990
OK.

285
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,700
Now back to the topic at hand.

286
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,960
If we go back to our uploads folder, you'll see that there are seven copies of that new frog image.

287
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,360
So here's the original high resolution.

288
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,690
These are the four copies that WordPress creates by default.

289
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,100
But most importantly, here we see the 400 by 260 and the four eighty by 650.

290
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,680
Right.

291
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,730
These are the custom portrait and landscape sizes that we just created.

292
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,060
Now, at this point, you might be thinking to yourself, that's cool.

293
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:31,540
But it's kind of frustrating that WordPress won't retroactively create the new sizes for these old images.

294
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,460
Well, you're not alone in thinking that millions of other people have had that same thought.

295
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,280
And luckily, there's a plug in that will retroactively create the new sizes for us.

296
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,600
So check this out in the sidebar.

297
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,100
Let's hover over plug ins and click add new.

298
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,960
Let's use this field to search for a plugin that is named re generate thumbnails.

299
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,140
And here's the plugin that I'm looking for.

300
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,560
You'll know it's the right one.

301
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,730
If it has over a million active installs.

302
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,340
So let's go ahead and install this.

303
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,540
And then let's activate that new plug in that we just installed.

304
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,530
Perfect.

305
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,890
And now if we hover over the tools item towards the bottom of our sidebar, we see this new option named

306
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,140
Region Thumbnails.

307
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,000
And once we click it, we're taken to this screen and now we can just click this button down here.

308
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,250
And WordPress will automatically, retroactively create their new sizes for all of our previously uploaded

309
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,970
images.

310
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,380
Now, this process might take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer.

But once it completes, if we jump back to our uploads folder, you'll see that WordPress created the

312
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,560
new two sizes of portrait and landscape for our original cat photo and dog photo.

313
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,220
Cool.

314
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:57,910
So at this point, now the question becomes, how do we actually use those custom resized images on

315
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,410
the front end of our Web site?

316
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,760
And that is the exact question that we are going to answer in our next lesson.

317
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,290
Let's keep things rolling.

318
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,520
And I will see you then.
