Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,380
In this lesson, we're going to learn about a file named themed JSON, which lets us configure how the

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,460
editor works.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,130
Let's jump into the action theme.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,100
JSON can control so many different things.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,100
So really the question becomes, where do we begin?

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,640
Well, I'm going to start with the width or the horizontal size of our content, right.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
And the way that that's handled in the editor.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,580
So if, for example, our theme doesn't even have a theme dot JSON file yet and because of that, WordPress

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,790
is currently using its default or standard or fallback values for the way that the editor handles the

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,960
width of our content.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,120
So right now, you can do this with me.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,260
Let's open up one tab with our full site editing template editor.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,920
So I'll open that up in one tab and then in another tab.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,320
Open up just any blog post or page.

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,510
Cool.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,770
So here's a blogpost.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,680
And then in this tab, here is the full site editor.

19
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,240
I want you to pay attention to the way that WordPress is handling the width of our content.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,450
In other words, it's not taking up the full horizontal space of your browser window.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,840
It's centered in sort of the middle portion of the screen.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,330
And that's true for both the page and post editor and the full site editor.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,110
However, check this out within our theme folder.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,780
I want you to go ahead and create a brand new file just in the root of our theme folders, a new file

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,000
and give it the exact name of theme dot Jason.

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,660
Press enter.

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,200
For now, we can leave the file empty, but just go back into WordPress and if you refresh the full

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,310
site editor screen.

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,880
Notice that now the blocks are taking up the full available width and if you refresh your blog post

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,620
or page editor refresh, it's also taking up the full width.

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,330
Now it's just personal preference.

32
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,150
There's a million different ways that you can configure WordPress.

33
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:07,660
Personally, in my opinion, I want the full site editor to use the full available width.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,260
Right.

35
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:14,020
Because if I'm going to let users insert a banner or a header, I want it to be sort of what you see

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,750
is what you get.

37
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,170
I want it to take up the full available width.

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,430
However, when you're actually writing an authoring blog posts, this would be a terrible editing experience.

39
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,260
Right line length becomes so long that it's impossible to read and work with.

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,710
So when you're working with a blog post or page, I want the content to only take up sort of the middle

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,450
800 pixels or so.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,630
So how do we customize this?

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,720
How do we change this?

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,660
Well, that's where Theme Jason comes into play.
