Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.420
In this lesson, we're going to work on the events and blogs area.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.280
Let's jump into the action.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.170
So right now I'm looking at the finished product that we're going to be building together.

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.980
And essentially this area on the home page, there's two columns split that has the most rapidly upcoming

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.190
events in the two latest blog posts.

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.650
So moving this over into the theme that we're building together, that's our focus for this lesson.

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.230
Now, due to the dynamic content that are in these areas, there are so many different ways that you

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.990
could approach this, and I don't want to just immediately jump in to the approach that I personally

10
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.830
am going to take.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.740
So I want to first show you a few other options.

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.250
If you wanted to use more of the typical or default, you know, 2022 block theme approach.

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.170
So back in the template editor, for example, let me delete this other instance of the banner block.

14
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.560
What you could do is insert the WordPress default block type called columns.

15
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.460
There it is columns block, you know, and you could insert a 5052 column split.

16
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.800
And then let's look at what we're trying to build.

17
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.390
So events and blogs.

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.530
So for the blogs area, you could use the query loop block.

19
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.570
So on this column, you could click here, search for the query loop block.

20
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.050
You get the idea and you could sort of build that out.

21
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.430
However, to get this exact HTML and CSS output, well, that query loop block really wouldn't be an

22
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.940
option.

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.830
Also, I don't want to let my end users customize this layout.

24
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.560
We'll talk more about that angle in just a moment.

25
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.320
But let's look at the upcoming events area.

26
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.920
So you really couldn't use the query loop block for that area because the query that pulls in these

27
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.470
two events is too complex for the query loop.

28
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.170
BLOCK So yes, the query loop block can query just for a specific post type of events.

29
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.050
But then in our query, we need to look at today's date, make sure that the event date, not the posted

30
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.660
on date, but the event date of an event is in the future and then, you know, reverse order that for

31
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.490
the most rapidly approaching events.

32
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.700
So what you could do perhaps is use the WordPress columns block and then insert your own custom block

33
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.350
types for each area.

34
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.100
But even then, let me zoom out a little bit on the finished product.

35
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.210
You wouldn't get this design or layout where the background colors fill the full entire width, but

36
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.390
there's this inner max width area, right?

37
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.420
That's not the way that the WordPress default columns work.

38
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.700
Now, I experimented with this.

39
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.480
You can click on the columns area as a whole and then in the bottom right corner click advanced and

40
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.110
you could give your specific instance of this columns, block a class, and then you could get super

41
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.530
creative and target that class and write totally custom, you know, grid powered success to try to

42
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.600
recreate this exact layout.

43
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.610
Believe me, I went that route.

44
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.060
But then I realized that WordPress still has its own opinions about mobile media query breakpoints.

45
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.340
In other words, once the screen gets much smaller than this, I want that area to snap down to a single

46
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.570
column layout like this.

47
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.730
But WordPress has its own success opinions about its media query breakpoints.

48
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.990
So I guess long story short, here is early on when you're building a theme, you need to decide which

49
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.250
type of themed or building.

50
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.300
Are you trying to give the end user as much control as possible?

51
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.900
In other words, like the 2022 default theme where they can insert the date exactly where they want

52
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.920
it and, you know, say which font it should be and what font size it should be.

53
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.620
So really, are you building the type of theme that uses and relies on the default WordPress blocks,

54
00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.130
or are you building something more custom and bespoke that has its own unique looking design and you

55
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.280
really need to control the HTML, CSS as custom queries, so on and so forth.

56
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.320
So try to make that decision early on.

57
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.990
And if you're going to build sort of a 2022 type theme, then you're going to be marrying yourself to

58
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.870
the WordPress CC Right.

59
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.590
And the way that their column system works, so on and so forth.

60
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.970
Personally, I don't want to marry myself to the WordPress CC, so I'm not going to use this columns

61
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.320
block whatsoever.

62
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.600
And really, if we take a step back and think about this area, if we look at the finished product,

63
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.600
I don't think there needs to be any interactivity whatsoever in the editor screen.

64
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.800
Let me explain.

65
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.570
So in our banner block, we absolutely wanted there to be interactivity, right?

66
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.820
We want the user to decide how many headers they want, how many buttons they want, the size, the

67
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.750
text content, the color of the button, so on and so forth.

68
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.680
But in this area, there's two columns split.

69
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.990
I don't really think there are any choice.

70
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.540
The user needs to make.

71
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.850
So it almost doesn't even need to be a block type.

72
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.350
However, I do want to make this a placeholder block type in the editor screen because you could imagine

73
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.060
that the user would want to include this on pages other than just the home page.

74
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.930
Right?

75
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.700
What if they wanted to include this content?

76
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.340
So this block I'm highlighting on an interior page or a generic single blogpost template or the archive

77
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.230
screen or the 404 screen.

78
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.070
Right.

79
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.030
I think there's a ton of value in making blocks available, even if there's nothing to customize or

80
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.720
change.

81
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.610
Sort of just a placeholder block.

82
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.280
And so that's what we're going to build in this lesson.

83
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.120
This is going to remain powered by PHP.

84
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.720
There's not going to be any admin JavaScript interactivity.

85
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.920
But the idea is that you can drag and drop it wherever you see fit.

86
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.730
Right.

87
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.110
Maybe the end user wants this to sit below the slideshow on the homepage.

88
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.660
Or maybe they don't want this area at all.

89
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.150
Hopefully my approach or my philosophy here makes sense.

90
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.650
If it doesn't, I think it will by the time we finish this lesson.

91
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.720
So where do we get started?

92
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.060
Well, let's actually begin in our functions dot AP file and I'll explain why.
