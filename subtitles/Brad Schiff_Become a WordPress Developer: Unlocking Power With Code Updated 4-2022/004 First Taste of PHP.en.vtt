00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.340
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:11.530
In this lesson, we will get our first taste of pee, HP, which is the language that word press is

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.130
written in.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.790
Now, working with a programming language might sound intimidating at first, but that's why we're going

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.290
to walk through this together step by step at a nice pace.

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.230
So without further ado, let's get started.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.100
OK.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.640
In our previous lesson, we set up a local dev environment copy of WordPress for ourselves.

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.730
And now the question becomes how and where can we get our first taste of the P.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.140
HP language?

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.760
Well, in our previous lesson, we also learned how to find the files and folders that power this site.

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.800
So, for example, if you're using local by flywheel, you can just.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.190
Right.

14
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.960
Click on your site right here and choose reveal in Finder.

15
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.740
Or if you're on Windows, it should say show in folder or open explore or something similar to that.

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
Go ahead and click into that folder, then click into app.

17
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.480
Then click into public.

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.150
And these are the WordPress system files that power your site.

19
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.140
Now, before you and I worry about doing anything useful, like maybe creating our own brand new theme,

20
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.730
before we get to that, let's first start simple.

21
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.290
For now, let's just create an experiment file in this folder where we can try a few simple tests and

22
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.750
dip our feet into the P HP waters.

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.640
Now, it's important to point out that you can not use a word processing program to create a new P HP

24
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.870
file or make edits to an existing P HP file.

25
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.280
Instead, you need a dedicated text editor program.

26
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.010
Now, most computers do not come with a text editor program out of the box, but luckily the industry

27
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.680
standard and most popular text editing program is completely free to download and use.

28
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.690
So right now, in a new tab, I want you to search for Visual Studio Code.

29
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.170
As of this recording, the domain is code dot visual studio dot com.

30
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.410
Obviously, this is not the only text editing program in the world, but I strongly, strongly encourage

31
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.170
you to use this as your text editor.

32
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.320
There are many reasons why this is the most popular editor, but the biggest reason I recommend it is

33
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.310
because a bit later in the course when we need to work with the command line.

34
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.360
Well, V.S. Code has a built in command line and it's always automatically pointing towards your current

35
00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.040
project directory, which will save us from having to manually navigate around our folders in the command

36
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.370
line.

37
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.270
It's also nice to not have to jump back and forth between two different program windows.

38
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.280
Write your text editor and your command line, your text editor and your command line.

39
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.730
It's nice to have them both just in one program.

40
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.210
So right now, go ahead and pause this video while you download and install VNS code.

41
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.950
Once you've installed and opened V.S. code, then you can come back and resume this video.

42
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.720
Okay.

43
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.980
Now, once you do that, once you've opened up V.S. Code here, you'll see a welcome screen.

44
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.990
We actually want to create a new empty canvas or a new file where we can begin typing.

45
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.080
To do that, you can either use the file menu and then choose file new or you can just press control

46
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.850
n on your keyboard on windows or command an on Mac.

47
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.170
Essentially, we just want a new file where we can begin typing.

48
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.830
OK, so in this blank canvas, why don't we type out.

49
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.850
This is a test.

50
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.500
OK then let's go ahead and save this as a P HP file into our WordPress system folder.

51
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.750
So click file save or control s or command s and we need to save this file into a very specific location.

52
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.700
We want to save it into that folder where all of the WordPress system files live.

53
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.380
So within your user account home folder, click into local sites.

54
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.770
Then click on the name of your site, then app and then public.

55
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.870
OK.

56
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.820
And this is that same directory that we've already seen twice now with the different WordPress files

57
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.660
and folders.

58
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.030
So let's save our new file into this folder in the name of our new file.

59
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.280
Only matters in the sense that we don't want to overwrite any of the existing WordPress files.

60
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.150
So why don't we name our new file X bereavement?

61
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.580
And this is the important part.

62
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.000
Dot p HP.

63
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.940
So save it as experiment dot BHP.

64
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.410
Cool.

65
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.840
So now in that same folder with all of the WordPress files by scroll down to the bottom, there is our

66
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.840
brand new little experiment, DCPI, HP.

67
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.110
Now, let's try to view this in the Web browser.

68
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.930
So back in your browser, if you visit your local dev environment copy of WordPress.

69
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.340
If you're using flywheel, remember, you can always use the view site button.

70
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:33.640
But at the end of this, you r-al add on, make sure there's a forward slash and add on experiment dot

71
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.310
p hp press enter.

72
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.570
And you can see we are viewing that brand new file that we just created.

73
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:48.410
Now I want to point out that this is not how you add new pages or you are URLs to award press Web site.

74
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.280
So you would never do this in the real world on a live public Web site.

75
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.060
We are only doing this for educational and testing purposes.

76
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.270
At the end of this lesson, we are actually going to delete our experiment DCPI, HP file.

77
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.070
However, for the time being, this is a great place to try and write our first bit of P HP code.

78
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.980
So why don't we jump back into our text editor and let's delete the.

79
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.550
This is a test message.

80
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:27.520
And instead, let's write a tiny bit of h t N.L. so we can then see how p HP fits into the equation.

81
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:38.870
So just as a test, let's create a heading level one HDMI element and say this page is all about Brad.

82
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.400
And then maybe right below that, I want a less important headline that reads all about Brad.

83
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.370
OK, let's save this and refresh the page.

84
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.780
All right.

85
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.460
So nothing too exciting here.

86
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.190
This is just a bit of each demo heading level one and a heading level two.

87
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.310
But remember, we are not editing an H t AML file.

88
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.650
We are editing a P HP file.

89
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.300
So if this is just H.T. Amelle, what does P HP look like and what can it do?

90
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.830
Well, check this out.

91
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.500
Maybe on a new line above this code.

92
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.180
Typed this out with me.

93
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.010
Less than symbol.

94
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.860
Questionmark P HP.

95
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.560
And then a space.

96
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.390
And then a question mark.

97
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.640
And then greater than symbol.

98
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.800
So what does this code mean?

99
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.190
Well, this first chunk that I have highlighted right now.

100
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.700
This begins BHP mode and this chunk ends P BHP mode.

101
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.300
OK.

102
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.090
So in between those where my cursor is right now, that means we are in p hp mode.

103
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.330
Now when we are not enpi HP mode like down here.

104
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.620
Right.

105
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.520
Because this closes p p mode.

106
00:07:51.910 --> 00:08:00.790
This code down here is just regular old HDMI all but up here while we are in p p mode we can write magical

107
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.440
beautiful p HP code.

108
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.580
So check this out.

109
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.780
Type this out with me.

110
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.870
Echo echo is how you output things to the page while you're in p p mode.

111
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.640
So echo and then let's write two plus two.

112
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.510
Then let's save this and refresh in the browser.

113
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.470
And there we see for now, you might be underwhelmed.

114
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.660
You might be wondering what is so exciting about two plus two equals four.

115
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.680
Well, it's exciting because we could never do that in regular old H.T. demo.

116
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.920
Each team doesn't have a brain.

117
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.700
You just type out exactly what you want and that's exactly what you get.

118
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.340
BHP, on the other hand, has a brain.

119
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.860
It is a legitimate programming language.

120
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.690
We can give it equations.

121
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.910
We can tell it to talk to databases.

122
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.830
We can have it resize images or send out automatic emails.

123
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.830
We can make P HP do just about anything for us.

124
00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.820
And what's cool is that the general public that's visiting our Web site.

125
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.400
They don't see our P.

126
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.310
HP code.

127
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.530
They only see the final product.

128
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.800
So, for example, here in the Web browser, if we view the source of this page view, page source.

129
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.230
So here we can see the H.T. Amelle code.

130
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.930
But notice we don't see two plus two.

131
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.370
We just see four.

132
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.570
This is because P HP is a server side language.

133
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.740
And that means that all of our P HP code runs on the server.

134
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:34.070
And then only the result of that code, not the code itself, gets sent to the visitors of our Web site.

135
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.640
So in other words, the server is what's calculating two plus two, not people's Web browsers.

136
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.750
Let's jump back into our text editor because practice makes perfect.

137
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.200
I want to show you that we can jump in and out of HP mode as many times as we need to.

138
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.400
So, for example, maybe after this heading level one, but before this heading level two.

139
00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:04.490
So maybe in between those two lines, I want to drop in to P HP mode and maybe echo out the results

140
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:11.210
of five times five K and then I'll be sure to close out or end P HP mode.

141
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:12.710
OK.

142
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.960
And if I save this and refresh.

143
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.100
Cool.

144
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.960
So in between the two headlines we see.

145
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.860
Twenty five.

146
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.270
So back to the code.

147
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.450
You can see that in a P HP file we can seamlessly jump back and forth between P.

148
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.350
HP hdmi l.

149
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.970
P hp h.

150
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:29.480
Temo.

151
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.380
All right.

152
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.540
Now before we end this lesson, I want to have you type out one more P HP example.

153
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.420
All right.

154
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.360
So on this page, you can see that my name is included twice here in here.

155
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.780
Now imagine I legally changed my name in the future.

156
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.450
I would have to update my name in both places.

157
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.480
Now, just updating it in two spots isn't too bad.

158
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:57.080
But imagine if the page listed my name 100 times or 300 times updating it and all of those places would

159
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.670
be very time consuming.

160
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.880
So it would be nice instead of having to hard code my name.

161
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.880
If we could just include a place holder for my name.

162
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.450
Right.

163
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.390
So, for example, if instead of Brad right here, it just said blank and instead of Brad right here,

164
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.790
it said blank.

165
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.810
And then we could somehow programmatically replace all of the blanks with my name.

166
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.170
Well, there's no way to do that with regular old HDMI oil, but we can do it with P HP.

167
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.340
So check this out.

168
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.030
Up here on this top line right after two plus two.

169
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.220
While we are still in P HP mode.

170
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.410
Let's add a semicolon.

171
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:39.740
The semicolon tells BHP that we are done with this task and that we want to move on to a new task.

172
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.950
So we could begin typing right here where my cursor is.

173
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.750
But just to stay organized.

174
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.730
I'm going to drop down to a new line.

175
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.850
OK.

176
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.530
And right now, I'm still in P HP mode.

177
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.780
And what I'm going to do right now is create a variable that stores my name.

178
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.400
So type this out with me.

179
00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.780
Dollar symbol.

180
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.990
My name equals quote, Brad.

181
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.020
And then just to be safe, why don't we add a semicolon at the very end of the line to tell P HP that

182
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.640
we are done with this task.

183
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.920
Now, let's go over this code that we just wrote.

184
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.690
So the $ symbol is how you create a variable in P-H p.

185
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.900
And then this text that comes right after the dollar symbol.

186
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.820
This doesn't matter what you type.

187
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.110
I just made this up.

188
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.450
There's nothing magical about my name.

189
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.460
Instead, we could have typed unicorn or pizza.

190
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.110
Right.

191
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.890
It really doesn't matter what we type here.

192
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.230
Just as long as it's something we can remember.

193
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:47.540
So this line of code basically creates a sticky note in P.H. PS Memory with my name written on one side

194
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.490
and then on the back of that sticky note.

195
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.840
It says, Brad.

196
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.740
Now, what's cool is we can reference this throughout the rest of our page.

197
00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.760
So now instead of literally typing out blank here, we can just use BHP to reference this.

198
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.190
My name variable.

199
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.510
So let's delete this first blank.

200
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.960
So this page is all about.

201
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.860
And then we want to output whatever the value of my name is.

202
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.330
So place our cursor here.

203
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.060
And then we want to enter into P.H. P mode.

204
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.690
OK.

205
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.600
And remember, Echo is how we output something onto the page.

206
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.310
When we are in p p mode.

207
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.750
And then we just type out the variable name.

208
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.650
So dollar sign my name.

209
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.190
OK.

210
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.100
And then let's be sure to close out of P p mode.

211
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:35.870
Cool.

212
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.610
So on this line we start out with H Temo.

213
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.590
Then we enter into p p mode to get that variable value.

214
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.840
Then we close out of P HP.

215
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.390
So then we're back into H.T. AML mode.

216
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.010
So we can close out the headline.

217
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.770
Let's go ahead and do the same thing for this line.

218
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.450
So let's delete blank.

219
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.940
And then instead of typing this out again, let's just copy and paste it.

220
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.280
So select this BHP section.

221
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.160
Copy it pasted right here.

222
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.330
OK.

223
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:11.460
Now, if I save this and refresh, we don't see any difference because my name still equals Brad.

224
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:22.050
But now if we change this variable to equal John Doe and save cool, it gets updated in both locations.

225
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.860
Now, again, it's not very impressive because it's in only two locations.

226
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.620
But imagine if your page was way more complex.

227
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.500
And that name was referenced hundreds of times.

228
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.670
You get the idea.

229
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.720
And that's actually going to bring this example to a close.

230
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:43.530
Now, I do want to point out that what we just did in this lesson has absolutely nothing to do with

231
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.430
WordPress.

232
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:52.410
This experiment dot p HP file that we just created is not in any way connected to the core of WordPress.

233
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.210
However, WordPress is written in the P.

234
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.600
HP language.

235
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:03.770
And at this point in the course, you are now familiar with the basics of P HP, right?

236
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.910
You know how to enter p HP mode.

237
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.460
You know how to close p HP mode.

238
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.150
You know how to create variables using the dollar sign.

239
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.930
And you know how to output content to the page using Echo.

240
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.080
And with just that little bit of P HP knowledge in your tool belt, you are now ready to start writing

241
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:29.760
WordPress code, or in other words, you're ready to use P HP to tell WordPress what to do.

242
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.590
And this is where things get fun.

243
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:40.500
So in our very next lesson, we are going to use P HP Code to create our own brand new custom WordPress

244
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.040
theme.

245
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:47.400
But really quick, before we jump into that next lesson, I want to talk about our experiment dot p

246
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.450
HP file.

247
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:55.440
If everything in this lesson made sense, I encourage you to actually go ahead and delete our experiment.

248
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.970
DCPI, HP file.

249
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.010
You don't need to delete it.

250
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.620
You can keep it for reference if you'd like to.

251
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:08.610
I just want to make sure that you're aware that it's not normal to have random extra files sitting in

252
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.550
the core root folder of WordPress like this.

253
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.270
We only did this for educational testing reasons.

254
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.760
So I would strongly encourage you to delete this file, but it's not going to hurt anything.

255
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.610
So if you want to keep it there for reference, that's OK.

256
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.930
Anyways, I'm looking forward to creating a theme with you in the next lesson.

257
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.460
So let's keep things rolling.

258
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.600
And I will see you then.
