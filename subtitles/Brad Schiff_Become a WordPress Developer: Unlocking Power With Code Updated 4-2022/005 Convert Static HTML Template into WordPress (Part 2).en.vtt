1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.460
Well, it's just personal preference, but I always like to begin with the header, so in this case,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.580
the part that I'm highlighting right now, we've got the logo in the top left and the navigation links

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.050
and buttons in the top right.

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.800
So if we want to move or copy and paste this into our theme, why don't we open up that new folder that

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.290
we downloaded just a moment ago and let's open this indexed HTML file in our text editor.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.440
All right.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.660
So this is the HTML that is creating this page.

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.540
And if we're interested in this top header part, all we need to do is look right below the opening

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
body tag here and we see a header element.

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.960
So let's just place our cursor at the very beginning of that header tag and then scroll down a bit.

11
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.740
And you'll see that that header element closes right here, so I'm just going to hold down the shift

12
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.230
key on my keyboard and click at the end of it here.

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.950
Cool.

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.790
And now with that code highlighted, let's just copy it into our clipboard.

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.790
And now we want to paste it into one of the files in our WordPress theme folder.

16
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.940
So I know this is getting a little bit confusing.

17
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.770
That's why I'm using one text editor with a light color scheme and another text editor with a dark color

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.270
scheme.

19
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.880
Right.

20
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.450
So this dark screen is the files that we just downloaded a minute ago.

21
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.270
And this light screen is the WordPress theme folder that we've been working on for several lessons now.

22
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.380
So here's what I want you to do in your theme folder.

23
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.780
Jump in to our header file and right below the opening body tag.

24
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.130
Let's delete this H1 element and then go ahead and paste in your clipboard, OK?

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.530
And if we save this and refresh our WordPress site.

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.280
Here's the new header content now, it's not styled yet, and that's because we haven't moved over any

27
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.540
access code yet.

28
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.030
Don't worry, we'll do that in just a minute or two.

29
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
But next, let's move over the footer from the HTML page.

30
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.330
Right.

31
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.650
So on this page, if we scroll down to the very bottom, we see this footer section that we are probably

32
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.340
going to want on every page of the website.

33
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.120
So back in the recently downloaded indexed HTML file, if we go ahead and scroll down to the very bottom

34
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.480
of it.

35
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.950
Right above the closing body tag and the script tag, we see a footer element, so why don't we place

36
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.940
our cursor at the end of the foot or element and then scroll up a bit?

37
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.050
OK, and here we see the opening tag for the footer, so let's just hold down the shift key on our keyboard

38
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.390
and click at the very beginning of the footer element.

39
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.120
Then copy this into our clipboard and then we want to paste it into our theme folders, footrot file.

40
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.990
So back in our WordPress theme folder, jump in to your footrot file and we want to leave these lines

41
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.680
intact.

42
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.680
But let's go ahead and delete this dummy paragraph and then just go ahead and paste in your clipboard.

43
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.610
And if we save that and refresh the WordPress site, now we've got the footer in place.

44
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.830
However, we still don't have any sort of styling or design or CSS.

45
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.370
So let's just take the success from this page and add it to our theme.

46
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.460
So in that same folder where we just borrowed code from the indexed HTML file, what I want you to do

47
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.960
is move these four folders into your WordPress theme folder.

48
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.300
So the four folders that I want you to move over are called Build Success Images and SIRC.

49
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.840
So we want to move those four folders into our theme folder.

50
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.000
And if you're wondering how to find your theme folder, well, if you're using the local app to work

51
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.100
with WordPress locally, you can just.

52
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.370
Right.

53
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.530
Click on the site and choose reveal revealing finder or show an explorer.

54
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.180
So that should open up your local sites folder.

55
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.730
Then you just click into the selected folder for the particular site you're working on going to app

56
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.150
public WP content.

57
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.080
Hopefully this is a bit familiar.

58
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.730
Then you just go into the themes folder.

59
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.850
Our theme is named Fictional University Theme.

60
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.510
So now this is the location where I just want you to move over these four folders from the file we downloaded

61
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.710
earlier in the video.

62
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.500
So just move over those four folders.

63
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.950
I'm just going to drag them into my WordPress theme folder here.

64
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.810
And now let's just go tell our theme to actually use some of these new files.

65
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.120
So do this with me in our theme folder.

66
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.690
Jump into our functions, file within our function called university files.

67
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.700
Here we're loading a style sheet.

68
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.470
We can leave this first argument in place, but let's hollow out the second argument.

69
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.350
So I'm just going to remove this git style sheet you are.

70
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:54.870
I call because I no longer just want to load style DOCSIS now, while we do need the style that CSC

71
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.820
file, if I jump into it just for these comments up here to give WordPress a bit of information about

72
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.200
our theme, we don't have to include all of our success in this file.

73
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.950
So I'm actually going to remove this body color green test code inside of style DOCSIS but leave this

74
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.940
comment in place.

75
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.740
WordPress will know where to find this.

76
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.190
But back in functions, let's just load a text file from the build folder.

77
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.870
Right, to pull in some of the existing CSS that will create this design.

78
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.080
So do this with me for this second argument here.

79
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.980
Let's say get the same file.

80
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.210
You are parentheses to call that, give it a string of text and then slash look inside the build folder

81
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.050
slash and then the filename is style.

82
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.110
Dasch Index dot CSC.

83
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.570
Let's load one other CSS file.

84
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.130
So I want you to just duplicate or copy and paste this entire line of code here.

85
00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:02.220
And on the second copy, let's change the nickname of the file to maybe university extra styles and

86
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.550
then just change the file name we're looking for to look inside the build folder for index success.

87
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.340
OK, let's go ahead and give that a save.

88
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.300
And then if we refresh on the front end of our website, we see the hint of a design shining through.

89
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.640
OK, now looking at this page, I see all sorts of things we need to fix.

90
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.190
So let's just start working through it bit by bit.

91
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.940
So you'll notice down here in the footer underneath this Connect with US column, back in the HTML template

92
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.810
for this page, there's supposed to be social network icons there.

93
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.030
And when I created this page, I used an icon package named Font.

94
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.660
Awesome.

95
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.540
So we just need to make sure that we load the font awesome icon pack in our WordPress theme.

96
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.760
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

97
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:58.800
So if we open the indexed HTML file that we downloaded earlier in this lesson and we scroll up to the

98
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.850
very top of it, you'll notice that in the head section on this line I'm loading the font awesome icon

99
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.540
library.

100
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.890
Now, your first instinct might be to copy and paste this line into the header file and WordPress,

101
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.710
but that's not the ideal way of doing things.

102
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.760
Let me show you why.

103
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.200
So back in our WordPress theme folder, if we jump into P up at the top, here's our head section.

104
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.070
And remember that instead of load.

105
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.770
Voting access files directly here, we added this WP head function so that WordPress can be in control

106
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.190
of loading different files and assets.

107
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:44.010
So if we want to load another CSFs file that loads up the font awesome icon pack, we actually want

108
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.230
to jump in to our theme's functions file.

109
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.450
We're already loading to access files here.

110
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.140
So let's just duplicate this WP on Q style line once again.

111
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.800
For me, it's already in my clipboard, so I'll just duplicate or paste that line in once again.

112
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.140
And let's just change this first argument.

113
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.620
The nickname of the file to be Font Dasch.

114
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.430
Awesome.

115
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.600
And then the second argument is just where we point towards the file.

116
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.780
So the file location, instead of calling the file uteri, let's delete that and just have the second

117
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.260
argument.

118
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.690
Be a string of text because instead of loading a file locally, we just want to provide a web address

119
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.140
or you aurel to a file.

120
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:33.720
Now if we jump back into our indexed HTML template file, you can see here that I was loading font awesome

121
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.010
from an external U.

122
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:39.510
RL, so let's just copy and paste part of this URL into WordPress.

123
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.950
So do this with me.

124
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.910
Place your cursor in between this colon and the first forward slash and then I want you to select all

125
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:53.280
the way to the end of the file name so it ends in dot success.

126
00:08:53.910 --> 00:09:00.690
So with that selected let's copy it into our clipboard and then back in our WordPress functions file.

127
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.470
Just paste that in between the quotes for this second argument.

128
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.390
Cool.

129
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.140
So now if we save and refresh.

130
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.420
Those icons are in place now.

131
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:20.170
Let's move on to the next fix, so the next thing that I notice is that the text on this page is using

132
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.500
a generic font, but the text on the HTML template is using a custom font.

133
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.670
And if we look at this indexed HTML file in our text editor right above the font awesome line, you

134
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.770
can see on this line, I'm loading custom fonts from Google.

135
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:45.820
So if we want to move this over into WordPress, let's just jump back into our theme's functions file.

136
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:51.660
We want to load another external CSS file, so just duplicate this most recent line that we just wrote.

137
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.230
So I'll just duplicate that line.

138
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.170
Let's change the nickname from font.

139
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.530
Awesome.

140
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:03.310
On this duplicate copy to instead B, how about and I'm just making this name up custom Google fonts.

141
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.150
OK, then let's hollow out the quotes for the second value.

142
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.600
We just need an external web address to load the file from.

143
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.220
So back in the template file that we're borrowing from, here's that Google fonts.

144
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.190
You would just begin by selecting the two slashes.

145
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.480
And then just select until the end of that value, it should end in seven hundred, I just copy that

146
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.650
back in our WordPress file, just paste that into these quotes and if we save that and then refresh

147
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.660
and it's a subtle change, but you can see that we are now using custom fonts.

148
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.580
Next, let's focus on the actual content of the homepage.

149
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.270
Right.

150
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.880
So instead of this generic listing that loops through our blog posts, instead of that, why don't we

151
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:56.390
work on importing this custom welcome area and two column layout and slideshow?

152
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:04.640
So to do that, let's jump back in to our indexed HTML template and you can scroll up to the very top

153
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.240
and then you'll notice that we've already imported this header element.

154
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.300
So scroll down a bit until you get to the end of the header element and then let's place our cursor

155
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.060
right before this page banner element, OK?

156
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.870
And then let's scroll down all the way to the bottom right before the footer element begins.

157
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.500
So we don't want to include this.

158
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.280
We've already copied and pasted that.

159
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.470
So just hold down shift and click right here at the end of this div.

160
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.500
So let's just copy that to our clipboard and then let's jump over to our WordPress theme folder.

161
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.470
And the file that controls the homepage is Index Dot P.

162
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:49.000
Now, in this file, we still want to begin by including the header template and we still want to end

163
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.620
by including the footer template, but we want to get rid of everything in between.

164
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:59.580
So let's delete this test placeholder loop code that we wrote earlier, OK?

165
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.290
And now we want to paste in the HTML from our clipboard, but you'll notice that we are currently in

166
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.430
mode.

167
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.390
So on this line, let's just drop out of AP and then right before get footer we can enter back into

168
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.170
P.

169
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.530
So that means right here we are in HTML so we can just go ahead and paste in a clipboard.

170
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.660
Let's save that and refresh the WordPress site.

171
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:32.320
Looks good, we just have two quick problems to solve, the first issue is that we are missing the images

172
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.650
or photographs that should be displayed here and then down here as well.

173
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:42.120
And the second problem is that this slideshow section isn't behaving like a slideshow.

174
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.410
OK, so let's fix both of those things.

175
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.400
But let's begin with the missing photos.

176
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.500
We just need to update our HTML to look for the images in the right folder.

177
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.250
So back in our text editor in our theme folder, jump in to index.

178
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:05.230
And up towards the very top of the file, you'll see a div with a class of page, banner, BGI image,

179
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.880
and it's using an inline style that's trying to pull in a background image.

180
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.630
And this code tells the Web browser to look within the current folder for a sub folder named Images

181
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.240
and look inside it for a JPEG named Library Hero.

182
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.310
So the reason our photo isn't loading is because if we go up to our address bar, we don't have an image

183
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.140
folder in the root of our domain or the root of our project directory.

184
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:37.900
Instead, we do have a WordPress folder named WP Dash Content, and then within that folder we have

185
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.070
a theme's folder.

186
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:46.840
And then the name of our specific theme is fictional university theme, and that is where the images

187
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.740
folder lives.

188
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.180
So then we could look within their for library hero dot jpeg.

189
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.680
OK, cool.

190
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.980
So this path works, but look how long this is.

191
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.180
You probably don't want to have to type this out every time you want to load an image.

192
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.830
So let's go back and jump back into a text editor and I'll show you a trick.

193
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.350
So go ahead and select this current path.

194
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.180
So from images to JPEG, copy that into your clipboard.

195
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.860
And then go ahead and delete it.

196
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:22.600
So now we just have empty parentheses and what we're going to do is drop into P because WordPress has

197
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.240
a function here that can help us.

198
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:34.510
So within the tags, let's echo out the results of a WordPress function named Gett, underscore, theme,

199
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.650
underscore, file, underscore uteri.

200
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.940
And it's a function.

201
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.620
So open up parentheses and it only takes a single argument.

202
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.600
So quotes.

203
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:49.840
So now just out of forward slash and then paste in your clipboard and that's all we need to do.

204
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.360
This WordPress function will generate the path to our theme folder all on its own.

205
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.870
Cool.

206
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.510
So let's save this and refresh and we're in business.

207
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.120
Now let's just do the same thing for the three images down here at the bottom of the page.

208
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:11.980
So back in index, if you scroll down to the very bottom, we see images, bread, images, apples and

209
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.060
images, Busse.

210
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.640
So go ahead and pause the lesson and adjust these three image paths the same way that we just adjusted

211
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.780
the image up at the top.

212
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.850
The only problem now is that this section isn't cycling through the three slides.

213
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.490
It's just showing all three slides stacked on top of each other.

214
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.910
All we need to do to fix that is load a JavaScript file that handles the slideshow behavior.

215
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:41.530
So back in our text editor, jump in to our theme's functions file and loading a JavaScript file is

216
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.900
just like loading a CSC file.

217
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:50.770
So right above this line, let's add a new line and let's call a function named WP on cue.

218
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:57.730
And then instead of style its script within the parentheses, the first argument is our chance to name

219
00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:58.330
the file.

220
00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.670
The name doesn't really matter.

221
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.440
Let's just call it main university JavaScript.

222
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.330
The second argument is where we point towards the file that we want to load to point towards the JavaScript

223
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.680
file.

224
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:17.530
Let's use a function named Get the same file you are and it's a function.

225
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:24.400
So parentheses quotes for a string of text and then just slash look inside the build folder and the

226
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.880
file name is Index Dot JS.

227
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:33.640
Now loading a JavaScript file requires a few more arguments than when we load a case file.

228
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.280
So after the quote and then this parentheses, let's include a comma so we can add another argument.

229
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.390
And WordPress wants to know if this script depends on any other scripts.

230
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:43.650
Right?

231
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.430
Does it have any dependencies?

232
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:52.870
So after the Commonwealth's outerspace, let's have an array so array parentheses and we only have one

233
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.650
dependency.

234
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.160
So just string a text J query.

235
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.880
Now, later in the course I will provide query free alternative code.

236
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.210
So in that case you wouldn't need to include query here.

237
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.700
But in a lot of our original JavaScript example problems we will use query.

238
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.620
So that's why I'm including it here.

239
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:18.610
If and when you're not using J query, your value here could simply be null if your JavaScript doesn't

240
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.770
depend on any other JavaScript.

241
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.890
But for now, I'm just going to leave this in place.

242
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.960
Let's have a comma.

243
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.990
Another argument.

244
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.540
This is the version number for your script.

245
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.850
I'll just give it a value of one point zero.

246
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:36.880
And then the final argument is basically WordPress asking us, do you want to load this file right before

247
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.120
the closing body tag, yes or no?

248
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.650
So we say yes or true.

249
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.570
And that way it loads at the bottom of the page instead of up in the head section, which is much better

250
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.950
for overall performance.

251
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.500
So if we save this and refresh now, we have a typical slideshow behavior.

252
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.520
Perfect.

253
00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.980
That's going to bring this lesson to a close.

254
00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.240
In our next lesson, we'll start working on an interior page template.

255
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.400
Let's keep it rolling and I will see you then.
