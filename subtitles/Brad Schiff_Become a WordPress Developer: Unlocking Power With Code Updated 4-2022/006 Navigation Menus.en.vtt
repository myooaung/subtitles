00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.530
Hello, everyone, in this lesson, we will learn how to set up dynamic navigation menus that you can

2
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.060
control from within the WordPress admin.

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.670
Let's dive right into it and let me show you what I'm referring to.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.980
So as of this moment, if I want to make changes to this navigation menu up here in the header, I would

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.540
need to jump into my text editor and hop into the header file and just a little bit below the opening

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.370
body tag.

7
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.010
Here we see a nav element and within that we have an unordered list with a list item for each link.

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.410
Now, every project is different.

9
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.150
On some projects.

10
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.910
You will want to control your navigation directly through the HTML in a template like this.

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.940
But in other projects you'll want to be able to control the navigation menu from within the WordPress

12
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.290
admin screens.

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.040
My general rule of thumb is that if I'm building a custom one off website for a particular client,

14
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.750
I prefer to keep the navigation links right here in the HTML code.

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.690
However, if you're building a more generic theme that you want to submit to the WordPress free theme

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.540
repository so thousands of people can use it, or if you want to build a premium theme that people buy

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.400
from you, in that case, you want your theme to be as flexible as possible.

18
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.130
And in that case, it's basically mandatory that you make your navigation menus controllable from the

19
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.330
WordPress admin.

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.300
Now, ultimately, in this course, at the end of the day, I'm going to control my navigation menus

21
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.090
directly with HTML just like this.

22
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.140
But knowing how to set up dynamic WordPress menus is an essential skill that I want to be sure you master.

23
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.550
So right now, let's get started over in your Web browser.

24
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.570
If you jump into the WordPress admin screen, you know that with most themes.

25
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.330
If you hover over this appearance item in the menu, within this pop out menu that appears, there's

26
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.700
almost always an option named menus.

27
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.900
However, at this moment, we don't see one.

28
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.870
And that's because in our current theme that we're building, we haven't registered any menu locations.

29
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.860
So in order to add a menu location to our theme, let's jump into our text editor and in our theme folder,

30
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.520
Open Up the Functions File.

31
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.340
If we look down towards the bottom of this file, you'll remember that we've already created a function

32
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.860
named University Features.

33
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.300
And on this line, we've told WordPress to call or run that function during the after setup, theme,

34
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.360
event or hook.

35
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.070
Now, when you want to add new menu locations to a theme, this is the event or hook that you want to

36
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.900
hook onto.

37
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.530
So cool.

38
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.070
We've already got a function tacked on to that.

39
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.930
So within our university, features function either right above or below this add theme support line.

40
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:06.770
Let's just add a new line and we're going to call a WordPress function named Register Now menu within

41
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.550
the parentheses.

42
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.500
We need to give it to arguments.

43
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.300
The first argument is just a name that we get to make up for this particular menu location.

44
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.310
Let's begin with the menu up in the site's header.

45
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.520
Let's call it header menu location.

46
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.280
So this name doesn't matter.

47
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.460
I just made it up.

48
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.540
It could be anything.

49
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.230
OK, and then a comma, because we want to give it a second argument.

50
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.310
And this is our chance to list a human friendly name header space, menu, space, location.

51
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.380
This is the text that will actually show up in the WordPress admin screen.

52
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.070
Cool.

53
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.480
Let's save this file.

54
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.080
And if we jump back into the WordPress admin screen and refresh now, when we hover over the appearance

55
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.010
item in the sidebar, we do indeed see a menu option.

56
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.920
We have not created any menus yet.

57
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.360
So nothing shows up here.

58
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.500
But down here we can create our first menu.

59
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.340
Now, the name here doesn't exactly matter, but just so we're on the same page, why don't we name

60
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.180
it my main header menu?

61
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.570
And then in terms of what links we actually want in the menu, let's pretend that we only want about

62
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.700
US and privacy policy.

63
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.920
So to get rid of another link, you can just click on this arrow and choose remove.

64
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.000
So I will remove everything except about US and privacy policy.

65
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.740
You can also just drag and drop.

66
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.930
So if I wanted about us to be first, OK, and then let me delete all of these other links.

67
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.030
OK, so now I just have the two pages that I want about some privacy policy, let's click create menu,

68
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.550
OK, now that we've created it, here's the important part.

69
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.270
Down towards the bottom, we see menu settings.

70
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.190
It's just personal preference.

71
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.940
But I definitely do not want to automatically add new pages.

72
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.340
So I will leave this unchecked and then for this second option of display location.

73
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.250
Well, at the moment our theme only has one location and this is definitely the one we're interested

74
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.400
in.

75
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.060
So let's check that box and then click Save Menu once again.

76
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:22.510
And now all we need to do is jump back into our header file and replace this hardcoded unordered list

77
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.190
element so you can either delete it outright or just comment it out temporarily.

78
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.630
It's totally up to you.

79
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.920
In my case, I'm going to end up using static HTML like this.

80
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.590
So I'm just going to comment this out.

81
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.320
And now let me show you how to output a dynamic menu into your template instead.

82
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:53.590
So where that unordered list was just drop into P and call a WordPress function named WP, underscore

83
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.950
nav underscore menu.

84
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.090
OK, now we need to tell this function which menu location this spot in the template should represent.

85
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.760
Right.

86
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.840
So back in our functions file, remember the code name that we chose for the menu location that we registered

87
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:18.940
is header menu location with the capital M and L, so you can either memorize that name or just copy

88
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.510
and paste it to your clipboard, OK.

89
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.320
And then back in header P, we need to give this function that name.

90
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.610
Now this function doesn't take simple argument, so we can't just begin typing here.

91
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.570
Instead, this function demands that we pass it an array of arguments.

92
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.330
Remember we worked with associative arrays just a couple of lessons ago.

93
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.850
So within the parentheses, let's say, array, and then open up its own pair of parentheses in between

94
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.080
those.

95
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.000
Why don't we drop down to a new line, stay organized.

96
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:57.700
And just like before when we would say cat equals meow or dog equals bark, this time around the parameter

97
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:05.230
name is theme location and then we want it to equal so equal greater than symbol.

98
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.210
And then this is where you paste in that name we made up for that menu location.

99
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.260
So now we've created this hollowed out skeleton area in our header template that corresponds with the

100
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.910
header menu location that we registered in our functions file.

101
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.660
Cool.

102
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:28.840
So if we save header P and refresh the front end of our website, we see the navigation menu that we

103
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.630
created in the admin and forevermore.

104
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.070
If we make any updates or changes to that menu.

105
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:41.260
So if I drag and drop privacy policy to be the first link and then click save menu as soon as we refresh

106
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.870
the front end, notice the order switched.

107
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.540
Cool.

108
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.590
Now, if you didn't 100 percent follow everything I just did, that's OK, because practice makes perfect

109
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.460
and now we are going to do the same thing for this menu in the footer as well as this menu.

110
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:05.170
Let's begin by jumping back into our functions file and in order to save ourselves a bit of typing,

111
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.810
we can just copy and paste this line.

112
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.620
Right, because we want to register another menu location.

113
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:18.820
So copy this line and then right below it pasted in and now we can just swap in new arguments.

114
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:27.040
So the variable name for this menu location, this area, why don't we call this footer location one

115
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.250
and we can call this one footer location, too.

116
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.740
So we get to make up whatever name we want.

117
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.150
Let's call it footer, location one.

118
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:43.180
And then for the human readable name, let's say whatever location one.

119
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.880
And then let's just paste that line again.

120
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.340
So on this line pasted in.

121
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:59.680
Change this to another location, too, and change the human readable name to fit our location, too,

122
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.760
and if I save this file and refresh my WordPress admin screen.

123
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.660
You can see that now whenever I'm working with a menu down here under display location, we now have

124
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.470
three options header foot or one and foot or two.

125
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.470
Now, before we go ahead and create a couple new test menus for these locations, why don't we first

126
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:31.500
jump in to the footer file in our theme folder and let's hollow out those hard coded unordered list

127
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.180
elements.

128
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.290
So for this first one, we could just delete this unordered list.

129
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.820
You're free to do that.

130
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:45.660
But in my case, I'm just going to comment it out instead temporarily to show you how this works.

131
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:51.270
But at the end of the day, for this particular project, I want to stick with the hardcoded menus.

132
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.790
But back to the task at hand, whether you delete this unordered list or just comment it out temporarily

133
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:04.260
in its place, you want to drop into HP and you could just copy and paste the code that we wrote in

134
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.180
headers a few minutes ago, but it's almost just as fast to type it out again.

135
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:16.590
So the function name is WP Naved Menu and then we pass an array of arguments.

136
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:26.960
Parameter is theme location, and we set that to equal the variable name that we are interested in.

137
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.590
So in this case, it would be footer location one.

138
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.480
So let's copy that.

139
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:42.070
Quotes paste in the value cool, so we've haul it out the first footer location, and now we can just

140
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.320
copy and paste this for the second footer.

141
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.590
So copy this block of code we just wrote.

142
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.000
And if you scroll down just a little bit, you'll see the next column.

143
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.300
Right.

144
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.460
Here's the other unordered list in the footer.

145
00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:01.900
So you can either delete that or comment it out totally up to you, but in its place you can just paste

146
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.890
in your clipboard.

147
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:09.430
And for the theme location, let's change this from footer one to footer to cool.

148
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:15.190
Now, if we save this file and jump back into our admin dashboard, why don't we go ahead and create

149
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:20.080
a couple more test menus and assign them to the footer one in two locations.

150
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.800
So I will click create new menu.

151
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.930
Let's call this one my magical menu and the name doesn't matter.

152
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.570
And here's what I can choose from.

153
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.830
Maybe I just want to add a link to sample, page and cookie policy.

154
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.000
Right.

155
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.940
This is really random.

156
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.950
It's just for educational purposes.

157
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.260
And the important part, display location.

158
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.760
Let's imagine I want to assign this new menu to the footer location one.

159
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.650
So click save menu.

160
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.880
And why don't we create another third menu for the second Furter location.

161
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.680
So create new menu.

162
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.130
Let's call this one super amazing menu.

163
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:06.610
And maybe this one will just have a link to the about us page and maybe I'll create a custom link here

164
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.730
to Google dot com with link text of Google ad to menu the important part display location.

165
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.050
Let's assign this to footer location to and click save.

166
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.440
And now if we refresh the front end of our website, cool.

167
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.310
We see those custom dynamic WordPress menus that we just created.

168
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:34.480
And if I scroll back up to the header and use one of these header links, you'll notice that once I'm

169
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.880
on the privacy policy page, that link lights up as yellow or as active.

170
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:47.200
And if I go to the about US page, then it stays lit up and that's a nice benefit of using WordPress

171
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.370
dynamic menus.

172
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.180
If I right.

173
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:55.240
Click on this current about US link and choose inspect, you can see that the list item element for

174
00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:02.080
that link has a special class of current menu item and then you can target this class name with your

175
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.580
success to make the link a different color.

176
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:10.270
I've already done that for us because remember I wrote the success for this layout, but that's just

177
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:16.630
something that I want you to be aware of in general when working with WordPress websites for this specific

178
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.250
website and this project.

179
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.270
I actually don't want to use dynamic navigation menus.

180
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.220
I prefer to keep control of the menus in my template files.

181
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.970
It's just personal preference.

182
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:34.030
But now at this point that I've shown you how to use dynamic navigation menus, I don't feel like I've

183
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.290
done you a disservice.

184
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.360
You can always use this lesson as a reference to implement them on any WordPress website.

185
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.500
You can replay this lesson and review the code as many times as you need to.

186
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:51.990
But at this point, I'm actually going to remove the dynamic menus from my theme files and uncommented

187
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.230
back out these unordered list hardcoded links.

188
00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:01.060
Now, again, this is totally just personal preference, but I do want you to be able to do things either

189
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.420
way.

190
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.580
So we've seen the dynamic WordPress menu way, but for now I'm going to kiss it goodbye.

191
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.130
So right now I'm in heterodoxy.

192
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:16.510
B, I'm just going to delete this and then uncommented take out my original unordered list and then

193
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.730
I'll do the same thing in my footer file.

194
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:25.150
Delete that, delete the comment and the closing comment down here.

195
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.230
Do the same thing for footer one, delete this HP.

196
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:39.480
The opening comment and the closing comment and just for good measure, back in my functions file,

197
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.410
I can delete these three register nav menu lines.

198
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.270
Cool.

199
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:53.320
So now if I save that and if I try to refresh the menu screen in my admin, you'll notice I see a message.

200
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:58.090
Your theme does not support navigation menus or widgets, which makes sense.

201
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.060
I just deleted all of the applicable code.

202
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.190
So up in the address bar, you can just go back to the root of WP admin to take you to the main admin

203
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.410
screen and we're back to where we started.

204
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:15.070
So now if I go to the front end of my website and refresh this about us page, we've got our old navigation

205
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.400
back.

206
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.770
But you'll notice that even though I'm on the About US page, this doesn't light up yellow to show that

207
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.170
it's the current page wrong.

208
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.160
So you might be wondering how to have that.

209
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.650
Nice.

210
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.260
This is the page you're on feature when using your own menu html.

211
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.560
Well let me show you how we can do that.
