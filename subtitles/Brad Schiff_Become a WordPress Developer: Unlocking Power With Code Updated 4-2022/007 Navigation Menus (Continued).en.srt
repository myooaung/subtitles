00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,360
So you might be wondering how to have that nice.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,930
This is the page you're on feature when using your own menu HTML.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,260
Well, let me show you how we can do that.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,790
So in the text editor in Header P, here's our navigation menu and here's the link for about us.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,020
So all we need to do is use the power of PHP and if statements and only add a special class to this

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,690
element if certain conditions are met.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,940
So let's do this in between the eye and the greater than symbol.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:43,320
Let's drop in to P and let's say if parentheses curly brackets and actually if we're going to write

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,200
this if statement all on a single line instead of breaking down the new lines, we actually don't want

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,340
the curly brackets.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,750
Now we will fill out the condition that lives in the parentheses in just a moment.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,990
But if it's true, what do we want to do?

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,840
Well, we want to echo out a little bit of HTML, so single quote, single quote.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,050
And within the quotes we want to echo out class equals double quotes.

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,640
And the class that we want to add is current menu item because that corresponds with the special classes

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,340
and counts that I've already written for us.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,140
So that will make the element light up as yellow to indicate it's the current page.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,700
So now all we need to do is fill out the condition within these parentheses.

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,920
So check this out.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,520
There is a function in WordPress named is Underscore Page and then you can give it an argument of the

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,350
slug for the page that you're looking for if you can't remember what a slug is or refresh your memory.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,630
So, for example, on the about US page, notice how the Eurail ends in about us.

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,040
So that means about Dasch.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,220
US is the slug for this page.

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,060
So in our code is page about us.

26
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,380
And this function that I've got highlighted right now will return.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,150
True, if that's the page you're on, otherwise it returns false.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,120
So then we will only echo out this class if it makes sense to write.

29
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,120
So let's save this and refresh.

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,540
Perfect.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,600
Now, the only other thing we need to account for is if you go to a child page of about us.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,860
So on our history, ideally we would still want the about us link in the header to light up, even though

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,840
we're not on that page directly.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,110
We're on one of its children pages.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,790
So here's what we can do in the code to make that happen within the parentheses for our if statement

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,550
for the condition right after this first condition here in between the two parentheses, we can say

37
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,000
or and then list another condition.

38
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,900
So let's say or if the current page has a parent of about us.

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:01,740
So to check for that, we can say or WP get post parent ID and it's a function, so give it its own

40
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,030
set of parentheses.

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,120
And within those parentheses we need to tell this function which page we are trying to find the parent

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,220
ID of.

43
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,090
So we just want to tell it to make that look up for whatever page the user is currently visiting.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,950
So we could say get the I'd call that function, but in order to save ourselves some sanity, instead

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,920
we can just say zero and WordPress will understand the zero to mean look up the current page.

46
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,040
OK, so this code that I'm highlighting right now will return an idea of the parent page.

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,250
And then let's say if that returns an idea that matches the idea of the about US page.

48
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,670
Well, if that evaluates to true, then we want to echo out the special class.

49
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,490
So here we just need to type in the numerical ID for the about US page.

50
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,330
So to find that out, you can jump into your admin because your number might be different than mine.

51
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,710
In fact, I can almost guarantee that it will be so if I click on the About US page on my computer,

52
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,220
it has an ID of sixteen, but yours might be something different.

53
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,820
So now back in our code we can just type in sixteen.

54
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,560
Cool.

55
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,470
So altogether what our if statement is saying is if the current page is the about US page or if the

56
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,550
current page is parent page is the about us page then echo out this special class.

57
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,550
So let's save this and refresh the front end of our website.

58
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,210
Cool, so I'm on a child page of about us, but it's still knows to stay lit up up in the navigation

59
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,930
menu and that's going to bring this lesson to a close.

60
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:45,130
At this point, you now have a basic understanding of using one of two setups, dynamic WordPress menus

61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,500
or your own custom menus.

62
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,970
It's totally up to you.

63
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,370
But I encourage you to follow along with me because I think it's nice to know how to have fine grained

64
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,510
control like this.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,570
Now, in our next lesson, we're going to switch gears and begin building out the blog section of our

66
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,160
website.

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,050
Should be a lot of fun.

68
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,490
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
