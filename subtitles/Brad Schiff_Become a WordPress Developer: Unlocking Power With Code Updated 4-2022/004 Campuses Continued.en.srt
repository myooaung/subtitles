1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,610
In this lesson, we will continue to work on our campus post time.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:08,570
OK.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,160
Up in the header, let me click on the campus's archive link.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,660
And in our previous lesson, we created this interactive Google map where visitors can zoom around and

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,560
scroll around.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,900
And we pinned on the map locations for each of our campus posts.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,920
Remember, this is the post that has a title of downtown West.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,780
And this is the post that has the title of downtown East now in its current state.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,450
This map isn't very useful for visitors because if you click on a pin, nothing happens.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,680
So our goal in this lesson is to set things up so that if a visitor clicks on one of the pins, it pops

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,850
up a little bit of info with the name of the campus, maybe the address.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,580
And if you click on the title of the campus, it will take you to the permalink detailed screen for

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,280
just that one individual campus post.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,210
OK.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,680
So if we want to customize this screen, we need to jump over to our text editor.

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,330
So over in our theme folder, let's jump in to archive campus.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,430
Here's the while loop that outputs this H.T. email once for each post.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,840
So remember that our JavaScript code is looking at these data attributes of data latitude and data longitude.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,560
And the JavaScript is also going to look inside the div for any content that we want to use for a pop

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,890
up.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,490
Right.

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,570
So check this out in between the opening div tag in the closing days of tag.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,210
So right here, if we say hello.

25
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,120
One, two, three.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,040
As a test.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,670
Now, when I click on one of the pind locations, we see.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,170
Hello, one, two, three.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,720
So instead of hello.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,560
One, two, three.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,920
Why don't we output maybe the title of the post.

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,990
And then also the street address.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,430
So let's delete.

34
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,750
Hello, one, two, three.

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,490
And maybe create a heading level three headline for the title of the post.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,400
And within the H three tags.

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,580
Let's drop in to BHP and just call the title.

38
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,170
And just to stay organized, we could drop down to a new line right before the beginning H3 tag and

39
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,720
then right after the H3 tag, we could also dropdown.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,980
OK.

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,040
So now underneath the heading level three, we can output the street address for the campus.

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,600
So to do that, let's go back into BHP and let's echo out a property that lives within our map location

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,290
variable.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:32,810
Right.

45
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,780
This variable gets all of the information associated with the pin, the location on the map.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
From this custom field.

47
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,790
So down here, let's echo out map location, that variable.

48
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,450
But let's look inside it.

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,990
So square brackets to look inside the array.

50
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,010
And just like we did up here for latitude and longitude.

51
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,990
Now we can do the same thing with a dress to get the street address.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,110
Let's go ahead and save this and refresh.

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,920
The front end.

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,100
So now if I click on downtown west right here.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,820
Cool.

57
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,760
Perfect.

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,730
So now let's just take things one step further and set it up so that you can click on the title to go

59
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,650
to that individual detail screen.

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,960
So here's our heading level three.

61
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,760
Let's just wrap the text in an A tag to create a link.

62
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,020
And on the opening one, a draft equals.

63
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,030
And then we just want the permalink.

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,980
So go into BHB, the permalink.

65
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,330
Click on downtown West and the titles got an underlined indicate that it's a link.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,410
Let's go ahead and click it.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,220
Cool.

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,360
And we're on the permalink.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,150
The only issue is that this template is designed for blog posts and not campuses.

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,780
So in order to create a unique, detailed view for campuses, let's just create a new template file.

71
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,530
So in our theme folder, let's create a brand new file.

72
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:09,070
And we need to name this new file, single dash campus dot p HP.

73
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,760
And in order to save a ton of typing, why don't we use the single dash program file as our guide or

74
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,850
starting place?

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,480
So I'm going to go into single program and just copy the entire thing into my clipboard and then back

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
in the new single campus.

77
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,240
Let's paste that in.

78
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,880
And then let's scroll up to the top and just start customizing this for a campus.

79
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,360
So for example, the first thing that I want to change is this breadcrumb or meta info box.

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,440
So instead of all programs, it should probably say all campuses.

81
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,970
So here's that text.

82
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,350
Let's change that to all campuses.

83
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,570
And let's also change the H graph for that link.

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,930
So get post type archive link for campus instead of program.

85
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,800
So now if we click this, it takes us back to the campuses archive.

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,510
Cool.

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,610
Let's go back to downtown West.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,250
Why don't we customize this area a bit?

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,830
So first, why don't we pull in a map with Just Dippin for this one campus location?

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,620
So back in our text editor right underneath this div with a class of generic content and where we're

91
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,810
outputting the WordPress, the content function right below this div.

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,560
Let's add a new line and instead of typing everything out again, we can just go back into archive campus

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,050
and we can just copy and paste this code.

94
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,880
So let's begin from the beginning of this div with the class of HCF map.

95
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,770
So let's begin selecting there.

96
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,410
And then let's just select all the way down.

97
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, actually, before we copy and paste this, I see a mistake.

98
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,850
We can fix.

99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,470
So on this campus archive screen, we don't need to echo out any pagination links.

100
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,480
So let's actually delete that.

101
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,650
And then these two P P tags can sit on the same line.

102
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,590
OK.

103
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,390
Much better.

104
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,000
So now we can get back to copying and pasting.

105
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,830
So let's copy from the beginning of this div down to this closing div right after the ending BHP tags.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,850
Let's copy that into our clipboard.

107
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,910
And then back in single campus right underneath the main the content div.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,380
Let's just paste it in.

109
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,800
Except this time we don't need any of this while loop code because we're already on the single permalink

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,510
for just the one campus.

111
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,830
So let's just delete this opening block of BHP and then we can also delete this closing while loop curly

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,310
bracket.

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,650
Perfect.

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,750
Give that save refreshed individual downtown west screen.

115
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,070
Woops.

116
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,780
Looks like we're out in the middle of the ocean.

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,790
I think I know what's causing this problem.

118
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,550
So when we just deleted that opening while loop code, I also accidentally deleted the code where we

119
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,580
created the variable named map location.

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,170
So let's do this.

121
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,190
We could add a new line in between these two lines or even just right up here.

122
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:09,120
It doesn't matter where we do this, but let's drop into P HP and let's just create a variable named

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
map location.

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:11,730
Right.

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,290
So all of this code will work.

126
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:22,590
And let's set it to equal get field and the field name that we're looking for is map underscore location.

127
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,830
OK.

128
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,520
So with that variable back in place, let's save this and we should no longer be in the middle of an

129
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,940
ocean.

130
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,420
Cool.

131
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,900
So now that we're on the individual screen for just one post or campus, if someone clicks on the pin,

132
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,180
it makes sense to show this information.

133
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,910
But we no longer want this to be a link, right.

134
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,180
Because it would just be linking to the page that someone is already on.

135
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,890
So let's just go ahead and remove the A tag that's wrapping that text.

136
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,770
Perfect.

137
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,080
Now, I can no longer click on the title.

138
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,100
It's not a link.

139
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,660
OK.

140
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:04,010
Now, before we bring this lesson to a close, I also think it would be neat if on this template for

141
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:11,600
each individual campus, if we had a section right about here that said programs available at this campus.

142
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,780
Now, in order to create a relationship between a program and a campus, we're going to need to create

143
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,550
a new custom field.

144
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,190
So right now, let's jump into the admen.

145
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,510
And down at the bottom of the sidebar, let's click on Custom Fields.

146
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,520
Let's create a new group.

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,670
So add new let's name this new group related campus.

148
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,660
Or you could put.

149
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,570
Yes, in parentheses, right.

150
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,530
Singular or plural is up to you.

151
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,600
Let's go ahead and add a field.

152
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,970
Let's name the field related campuses.

153
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,650
But for the actual variable name or short name for the field, let's get rid of those parentheses.

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,240
So just related campus.

155
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,480
So it's easier to remember and type can than here's the important part for field type instead of text.

156
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,020
Let's set it to relationship.

157
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,760
After that, let's set this filter by post type two.

158
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,090
Only use campus under filters.

159
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to uncheck everything except the search box.

160
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's scroll down to the location box.

161
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,100
So show this field group.

162
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,160
Only if post type is equal to.

163
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,700
And let's set this to program.

164
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,210
OK.

165
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,000
Now let's scroll back up to the top and published this new field group.

166
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,790
And let's go test it out and take it for a spin.

167
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:42,770
So let's go into programs and let's say that the math program is available at the downtown west campus.

168
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,150
So if we scroll down, we see that new custom field related campuses.

169
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,580
Let's click on downtown West.

170
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,480
Cool.

171
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,520
Let's go ahead and update or save this.

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,020
And now let's just go back to our downtown west single view.

173
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,510
Front end campuses click on to downtown west.

174
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,900
And now let's just right the BHP code to output a headline here that says programs available at this

175
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,590
campus.

176
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,240
And then we can write a custom query to pull in any applicable programs.

177
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,660
So let's jump back into the text editor.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,090
Here's that map code that we modified just a moment ago.

179
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,570
Now, because we created this single campus file by duplicating single program, you'll notice that

180
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:34,050
right below this map code, we have a few extra custom queries left over from the program template.

181
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,810
So we've got this related professor's query.

182
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,310
And then below that, we've got code that checks to see if it's empty or not.

183
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,390
And then it outputs an H2 accordingly.

184
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,310
So what we can do now is just modify this.

185
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,260
Instead of looking for related professors, we can look for related programs.

186
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:52,860
Right.

187
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,600
And that will save us a lot of typing.

188
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,880
So let's change the variable name to related programs.

189
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,650
Let's modify this query.

190
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,950
So posts per page looks good post type.

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,170
Let's change this to program instead of professor.

192
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,590
Order by an order.

193
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:10,880
Look.

194
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,430
Okay.

195
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,580
We do, however, need to modify this meta query.

196
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,990
So for the key instead of related programs, let's change this to related campus.

197
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,010
Cool.

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
So altogether we're creating this new query.

199
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,880
We're saying give us any program posts where the related campus contains the I.D. of the current campus

200
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,600
that we're viewing.

201
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,050
OK.

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,640
So we've got our custom query.

203
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,290
Now, let's just use it in this code, that output stuff onto the page.

204
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,720
Remember that we renamed our query variable from related professors to related programs.

205
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,060
So let's update that here.

206
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,390
Then let's also update it here and here as well.

207
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,510
They did programs and related programs.

208
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,170
OK.

209
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,560
Let's first adjust this heading level two that we're echoing out.

210
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,860
Only if there are indeed related programs to show.

211
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,400
So originally this would say math or English.

212
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,580
And then professors in this case, we just want to say programs available at this campus.

213
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,410
So we can just delete everything inside the H2.

214
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,580
So now we've just got one string of H.T., AML.

215
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,850
And then inside the H.

216
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,350
Two programs available at this campus.

217
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,160
OK.

218
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,680
And then within this while loop, we don't want to output a professor card for each item.

219
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,220
Right.

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,630
Instead of that, let's just output a plain text link to a program.

221
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,980
So let's delete this class on Ally.

222
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,100
Let's just have a regular ally.

223
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,750
And then also the element.

224
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,520
It doesn't need a class either.

225
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,980
We don't need to output an image.

226
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,500
So we can delete this image element entirely.

227
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,450
And then we don't need a Spann element.

228
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,470
We can delete that.

229
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,770
And we don't need the closing span tag.

230
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,620
Move this up on to the same line.

231
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,900
So basically, we just have a list item with a link in it with the title that points to the permalink.

232
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,710
And then before we save this, let's change the UL class.

233
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:11,370
Right.

234
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,410
All of these list items will live within.

235
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:21,200
Instead of professor cards, let's just change this to mean dash list and link Dasch list.

236
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,330
That will give us appropriate CSF styling.

237
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:24,860
OK.

238
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,400
Let's go ahead and save that.

239
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,370
And now if we scroll down underneath the map, we see programs available at this campus, math.

240
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,010
And if we click on it, perfect, it takes us to that screen.

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Now, we do want to make sure that that relationship flows in both directions.

242
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,830
So maybe at the bottom of a program page, we should have a section down here that says this program

243
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,230
is available at these campuses.

244
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,830
Right.

245
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:59,100
So to set that up, the template file that controls this screen is single dash program.

246
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,430
So in our text editor, let's jump into a single program and let's scroll down to the very bottom.

247
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,610
And at the end of this, while loop code, while we are still in P HP, we can just write a little bit

248
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,780
more of P HP.

249
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,200
So first things first.

250
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,130
We do not need to write any new custom queries because remember, the custom field that creates the

251
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,400
relationship lives on the program post.

252
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,230
So we don't need a custom query.

253
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,080
We can just look at the value of that custom field that's associated with the current post.

254
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:37,900
So why don't we begin by creating a variable and name it related campuses?

255
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,880
And let's set it to equal get field.

256
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:49,530
Remember, we named it related underscore campus singular semicolon at the end here.

257
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,170
Now, before we actually try to do anything with this variable, I do want to point out that right above

258
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,060
this line we should call.

259
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,460
BP reset post data, right, because that will give us a clean slate.

260
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,710
Otherwise, when we try to get a field with this name, WordPress might think that we're talking about

261
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,880
whatever posts we just loop through in this custom query code up here.

262
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,990
OK, so reset post data gives us a clean slate.

263
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,430
So now we've got this variable with an array of related campuses.

264
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,620
Now let's just set up an if statement to only output a headline onto the page.

265
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,450
If this is not empty.

266
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:28,990
Right.

267
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,060
Only if there are campuses to work with.

268
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:42,790
So we can say if parentheses curly brackets for the condition, let's say only if related campuses exists.

269
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,840
That's all we need to say.

270
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,260
This will evaluate to true as long as it's not empty.

271
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,800
OK.

272
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,980
Now within the curly brackets, let's say we want to echo out a heading level to.

273
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,130
Semicolon at the end.

274
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:06,290
Let's make it say blank is available at these campuses.

275
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,210
Except we don't want it to say blank.

276
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,660
We want it to say math or English or biology.

277
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,320
So let's delete the word blank and then add another single quote to close out this string of text of

278
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,580
the opening age two.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
And then we can add a single quote to begin text again right here.

280
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,530
But then in between that, we can use a period to concatenate on or add on and we can just call get

281
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,630
the title.

282
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,620
Then we can add another period to concatenate on the rest of the text.

283
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:42,440
Let's be sure to add a space, though, before the word is so that the text doesn't run together.

284
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,790
OK, let's save that.

285
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,800
So so far that's going to give us.

286
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,100
Math is available at these campuses.

287
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,400
Why don't we adjust the CSF styling so that this headline looks like these headlines that we've already

288
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,270
established.

289
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,420
So let's just give our H to a class of headline and headline.

290
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,800
Dash.

291
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,480
Dash.

292
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,610
Medium.

293
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,500
OK.

294
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,370
And then right underneath this line, after we output the headline, let's just output one link for

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,630
each campus that lives in this array of related campuses.

296
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,580
So to do that, you can say for each parentheses, curly brackets inside the for each parentheses,

297
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,700
let's use our related campus's array.

298
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,660
And say for each item in this array, let's say as.

299
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,250
And then we can make up a temporary variable name which is called campus.

300
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,940
And now we can use this variable name in the body of this for each loop to get the title and permalink

301
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,450
for each item that lives in this array of related campuses.

302
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,730
Now we could echo out a string of H t Amelle and Mass with the concatenation in the periods.

303
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,280
But I feel like that gets messy pretty quickly.

304
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,100
So instead, why don't we drop out of BHP and then drop right back into BHP.

305
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,580
But in between there we can write good old HDMI oil.

306
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,030
So let's just create a list item and a link.

307
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,570
And inside the link, let's output the title for each item.

308
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:16,910
So BHP Atco get the title and what post do we want to get the title for?

309
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,010
Well, within those parentheses we can just pass in the campus variable.

310
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,770
So the current item in our array of campuses.

311
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,840
Then let's do the same thing for the permalink.

312
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:36,680
So drop in BHP and go out, get the permalink and in parentheses campus.

313
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,930
Now from an h t AML perspective, since we are creating list items, we want them to live within a U,

314
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,780
l or unordered list.

315
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,520
So right before the four each.

316
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,800
Why don't we just go out.

317
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,830
You l.

318
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,800
So my colon.

319
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,290
Let's give it a class of men list linked list for CSF reasons.

320
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,450
Then right after the for each loop we can just echo out a closing you l tag.

321
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,570
Let's give that a save and test it out.

322
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,910
Math is available at these campuses.

323
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,270
Cool.

324
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,190
Before I click on this to test it out.

325
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,890
Why don't we add a horizontal rule right here to create some much needed vertical spacing here.

326
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,960
So right before this heading level two, why don't we just echo out a horizontal rule and let's give

327
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,650
it a class of section break?

328
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,030
That looks a lot better.

329
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,650
And we can now test out our link.

330
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,320
So it takes us back to downtown west and that's gonna bring this lesson to a close.

331
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,200
Our next lesson should only be five minutes or less.

332
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,110
And we will finish up our campuses post type.

333
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,510
And then right after that, we can jump into the new topic of live search results.

334
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,250
Powered by JavaScript.

335
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's keep things rolling.

336
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,000
And I will see you in the next lesson.
