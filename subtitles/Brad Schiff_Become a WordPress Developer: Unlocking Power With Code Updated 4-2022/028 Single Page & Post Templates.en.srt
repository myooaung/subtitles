00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,910
In this lesson, we're going to work on building the remaining templates for our block theme.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,960
Let's jump into the action and let's start by just navigating through the website and we'll build whichever

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,320
template would be needed to actually visit that URL.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,760
So for example, from the homepage, we have this from our blogs area.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,680
And if you clicked on one of the links to a blog post, well, this URL would be powered by the single

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,250
template.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,210
So with a traditional theme that singled out PHP in our case with the block theme, it would be in our

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,610
theme folder, in the templates folder, the file named single lot HTML.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,210
So in other words, in single that HTML currently we just have the hard coded, you know, paragraph

11
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,780
block.

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,870
But remember we used the full site editor to add the post title and the post content.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,180
It's okay if you don't remember us doing that.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,010
That was many, many lessons ago.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,670
So to refresh your memory, if we go to the full site editor, appearance editor and we don't want to

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,420
edit the index or the homepage template, we want the single template so you can use this menu and then

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,920
click browse all templates.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,260
Or what I have been doing throughout the chapter is I use the top left WordPress logo, click templates.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,410
Either way, we just want to edit single post.

20
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,510
Cool.

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,850
So there is post title post content.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,400
So that's what's giving us this dynamic content.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,590
That's great.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,210
If you wanted to build a theme where you use these WordPress default blocks, you know, to display

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,580
basic things like the title and the content, and you don't need to do anything custom and you don't

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,780
need to be in control of the wrapping HTML around it, then that's fine.

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,510
This approach will work wonderfully for you, but if you need to write your own custom queries on the

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:00,870
page, or if you need to be in control of the HTML or just really anything that the core default blocks

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,160
can't handle, well then the question becomes, what are you supposed to do?

30
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,770
Well, I'm well aware that my own personal philosophy or my own personal approach is definitely not

31
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,970
the, quote, standard way of doing things in a block theme.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,100
This that we have right here, this would be the, quote, standard way of doing things.

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,160
But there's really not a whole lot to explain here, right?

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,010
It's just clicking and dragging and inserting default blocks and arranging them in a way that you like.

35
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,980
You don't need a video lesson walking you through that, but to set up your own custom solution, well,

36
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,330
let me show you what I would do.

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,880
So let's just delete everything that we have so far.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,700
So we just want a completely blank template and let's begin by having the overall header.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,460
BLOCK So what kind of block do we want to add?

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,720
First, you can just type slash and then I want the fictional university header.

41
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,620
Cool.

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,210
We know that at the bottom we want a fictional university footer.

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,290
So if I search for footer?

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:58,530
Yep.

45
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,390
Fictional university footer.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,440
Cool.

47
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,560
Now, in between the header and the footer, what do we want?

48
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,730
Well, off camera, I just switched to the finished product theme, and this is what an individual blogpost

49
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,990
screen should look like.

50
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,160
So yes, it has the global header and the global footer, but then right below the header, we want

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,930
sort of just this basic formatting.

52
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,500
So this is how the blog post title should appear.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,410
And then we have this sort of breadcrumb navigation area and then we have the actual, you know, content

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,790
for the blog post itself.

55
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,000
Now it's just my opinion, but I don't want this to be set up in a way that the end user, you know,

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,700
can rearrange things like, I wouldn't want the end user to be able to move the breadcrumb navigation

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,980
to sit below the blog content.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,960
Or I wouldn't want the user to be able to drag and drop the content to live above the blog title.

59
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,260
In other words, I don't really believe there's any value in the user customizing something like the

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,910
interior blog post view, but that is 100% my own personal view.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,310
So from here you really have two options.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,120
If you did indeed want this area to be customizable for the end user and you wanted them to be able

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,840
to drag and drop and change the options for different pieces of content, you could use the default

64
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,290
WordPress core blocks, or you could use all of the concepts that we've learned in this chapter to build

65
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,720
your own custom blocks and just add different attributes and options to let the user choose.

66
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,720
For example, you know, does the user want the title to be a certain font size?

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,880
And then remember how we had the small, medium, large, or if you wanted them to be able to choose

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,190
the color for the breadcrumb navigation, right?

69
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,970
We had our blue orange and dark orange, so on and so forth.

70
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,830
So you could apply those same principles if you wanted to to allow customization here.

71
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,590
But personally, I'm not going to go that route.

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,950
I don't really think there's anything here, a value worth customizing.

73
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,750
So let me show you what I'm going to do.

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,650
We've already added our header and footer placeholder blocks, so really in between those two, we just

75
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,530
want sort of the static template, right, that's going to output all of this other basic content.

76
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,040
So I'm just going to create a placeholder block and we can call it, you know, instead of header or

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,760
footer placeholder, maybe single post placeholder.

78
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,430
So do this with me in our functions dot AP file down at the bottom.

79
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,480
We don't need a G block, we don't need any advanced, you know, client side interactions or HTML.

80
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,710
If you scroll up a little bit for me, it's around line 200.

81
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,850
We have placeholder blocks, so just duplicate one of those lines.

82
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,000
We just want to set up a new placeholder block and the name for it would be maybe how about just single?

83
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,000
Or just to be clear, I'll call it single post.

84
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:54,930
Cool.

85
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's give that a save.

86
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,880
And now we just need to go into the our blocks folder, create a brand new file and name it single post

87
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,710
dot Jess To save a bunch of typing, just go into your header, not just file.

88
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,710
Copy that into your clipboard, paste it into a single post.

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,320
Let's change the name here instead of header.

90
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,360
It would be single post.

91
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:24,990
Change the title to maybe just fictional university single post and then change the placeholder content

92
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,370
that you'll actually see.

93
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,070
To maybe be single post placeholder.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,960
Let's give that a save.

95
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,170
And now we just need the render callback with the matching name.

96
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,770
So in the our blocks folder new file all name it single post-op AP.

97
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,220
Now in this file, we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

98
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,160
We've already written the AP for this custom content, right?

99
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:56,440
We wrote the logic in the code, the HTML, the PHP for this breadcrumb navigation.

100
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:03,310
And along the way, if you added any other queries for related content or whatever sort of custom advanced

101
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,740
features you've built into this template, well, you can just include that in this file now.

102
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,040
So let's just go borrow that code from the original theme that we built earlier in the course.

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,940
So if I switch to this window of VS code, this is our traditional theme.

104
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:26,890
I would just jump in to single that up and we definitely do not need this header code, but I would

105
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,990
just start copying from the wild loop.

106
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:37,060
So from the wild down to and then down at the very bottom, this closing tag and the closing curly bracket,

107
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,590
we do not need the footer.

108
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,830
So just sort of the middle content on the page, I would just copy that into my clipboard back in our

109
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,210
new empty single post op.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,330
Just paste that in, give it a save and let's go use it and test it out.

111
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:58,240
So in this screen where we're editing the single post, you can save what you have so far with the header

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,740
and footer placeholders and then we need to refresh so the new block type will appear.

113
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,700
And then right about here I would just want to insert I start to type single post.

114
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,030
Yep.

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,810
Fictional university, single post.

116
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,770
Perfect.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,220
So we can save that.

118
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
Now, if we go to our front end, this is a URL for an individual single blog post.

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,910
I refresh.

120
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,960
Woops.

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,840
Looks like we've got a really obvious error at the very top of this file that we pasted into obviously

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
at the top or in PHP.

123
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,130
So have an opening question mark.

124
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,110
P tag just like this.

125
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,110
Give that a save.

126
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,560
Try one more time to refresh.

127
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,490
Perfect.

128
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,130
So this is the approach I like to take when there's custom content that doesn't really need to have

129
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,000
any interaction or doesn't need to have any user customizations.

130
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,100
Now, you might be wondering, well, what's the point of even having this as a block theme then?

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,110
And my answer to that would be because now the user can add whether they want a slide show or the events

132
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,430
and blogs, right?

133
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,420
So we have this template for all single blog posts.

134
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,060
And what if right before the footer, what if the end user decides, hey, you know, I think it would

135
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,790
be nice if the upcoming events and blogs block was right here or I think it would be nice if we had

136
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,560
a slideshow before the footer.

137
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,600
So the point is, even if this specific content isn't editable or customizable, the page as a whole

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,500
still is.

139
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,540
And through the power of composition and choosing whichever blocks you want, the possibilities are

140
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,710
still infinite at this point.

141
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,060
Let's get back to the actual task at hand or the goal for this lesson.

142
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:43,690
So in verse code, in our block theme, in our templates folder, let's go back in to single that HTML.

143
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,960
So remember, we want this to now have the code that represents this, right?

144
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,530
These placeholder blocks instead of just a paragraph.

145
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,310
So to find the code that WordPress has generated from this full slide editor, I just like to go look

146
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,190
in the database.

147
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:07,360
So assuming that you've saved a recent change to this template, it will be the most recent post in

148
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,260
your post table.

149
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,000
So you know the drill by now.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,270
I just found that post template in my database and there you have it.

151
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,710
It's nothing but our block theme and then header single post and footer.

152
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:24,250
So I would just copy that back in our text editor, just paste it in and that is all we need for this

153
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,150
single template.

154
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,950
The end user is still free to add in anything they want in between the blocks.

155
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,510
So if they want a slideshow, if they want events and blogs, so on and so forth.

156
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,480
Also, if they do make changes, they can always revert back to this as a starting place.

157
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,300
Let's change gears and now let's set up similar behavior for an individual page.

158
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,380
So, for example, if I try to visit my About US page.

159
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,560
Well, because we don't have a page template yet.

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,630
It's just using the index template.

161
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,030
But you could imagine that this URL should use an individual page template.

162
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,830
So let's go create that right now.

163
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:12,730
So in our templates folder, just create a new file and name it page dot HTML within this new empty

164
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,220
file.

165
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,290
You can just copy and paste and move over the contents from single that HTML.

166
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,410
So just duplicate paste those over.

167
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,830
And really we would just need to use a different block here in the middle.

168
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,100
So instead of single post, let's go create a new block type and we can call it something like single

169
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,470
page or just page.

170
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,080
So in functions dot p, I would just use a new instance of placeholder block.

171
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,300
So new place holder block semicolon quote value is let's just call it page.

172
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,890
Give that a save.

173
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,720
And then in the our blocks folder, just create a new file.

174
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,200
Name it.

175
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:01,720
Page dot JS to save a bunch of typing, just jump into single post dot js, copy everything in there,

176
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,840
paste it back into pages, change the block type name here to maybe just page.

177
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,820
Let's change the title to fictional university page.

178
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,060
And then change this placeholder line at the end here to be just single page placeholder so we can give

179
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,750
that a save.

180
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,240
And then finally, we just need to create a new file in our blocks and name it page TCP IP.

181
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,370
Now, in this file, we do not need to reinvent the wheel.

182
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,600
Let's just go borrow a bit of code from our original fictional university theme.

183
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,840
So let me switch back to that folder and I would just open up page TCP IP.

184
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,900
Now we do not need the header, right?

185
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,420
We already have a block specifically for the header.

186
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,300
So I would just start selecting from this while.

187
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,750
And then down at the bottom we do not need the footer.

188
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,420
So I would just select until this closing curly bracket here.

189
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,430
So copy that.

190
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,630
Back in this empty page up.

191
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,410
Copy paste in your clipboard.

192
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,060
Up at the very top.

193
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,050
Be sure to add the opening IP tag like this.

194
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,100
Cool.

195
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,580
So we can save this file and then we just need to jump into page or html and just change the block type

196
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,520
that we're using here.

197
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,320
So instead of single post, this would be page.

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,120
Let's give that a save.

199
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,640
And now if we refresh on the about us URL, perfect.

200
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,050
And we can click these links to view the children pages of the about us page.

201
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,040
Excellent.

202
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,740
At this point, let's change gears and let's actually go back to our blog or actually to illustrate

203
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,760
the point I'm trying to make.

204
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,420
If I try to visit the blog up in the navigation, well, that index template for that doesn't make sense.

205
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:57,180
So let's set things up so that our home page is powered by a template called front page dot HTML, but

206
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,860
then our blog listing.

207
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,410
So that should just sort of be the fallback index template that can actually be indexed on each HTML,

208
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,190
right?

209
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,180
And this URL would then show you the ten most recent blog posts.

210
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,570
If that doesn't make perfect sense, that's okay, but let's walk through it.

211
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:20,700
So first of all, in our block theme, in our templates folder, let's just duplicate index that HTML

212
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,580
and name the new copy front page.

213
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,520
So I would just jump into index, select everything in this file, copy it, create a brand new file

214
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,370
in the templates folder and name it front dash page dot HTML.

215
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,110
In this file, just paste in your clipboard, give it a save and then back in index dot html.

216
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,140
Well, we can delete everything in that file and to save a bit of typing, just go borrow these three

217
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,200
blocks from page or single that html.

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,960
So I would just copy those paste that into indexed on each html only we'd want to do something different

219
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,300
here in the middle in between the header and footer.

220
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:00,750
Right.

221
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,700
We'd want the blog listing.

222
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,740
So let's actually just change this block type name right now, even though we haven't created the new

223
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,100
block type right now, we're already in this file, so we might as well change it.

224
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,330
Let's name it.

225
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,930
Blog index.

226
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,450
Just one word.

227
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,070
Just like this blog index.

228
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,950
So we can save that jump into functions.

229
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,630
Dot B Just create a new placeholder block with a name of blog index semicolon.

230
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,350
Save that.

231
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,550
Then in the our blocks folder, create a new file, name it blog index dot Jess.

232
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,810
To save typing, you could just jump into a simple file like footer dot J.S. Just copy all of that content,

233
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,150
paste it into blog index.

234
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,840
Just change the block type name here to blog index.

235
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,030
Change the title to maybe fictional university blog index.

236
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,460
Change the placeholder, maybe just blog index placeholder.

237
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,660
We can give that a save.

238
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,450
Create another new file in our blocks and name it.

239
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,110
Blog Index Dot AP.

240
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,490
This is the file where we do not need to reinvent the wheel.

241
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
So back in our original theme that we built together, I would just jump into index dot AP.

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,560
We do not need the header, but I do want this page banner.

243
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,920
So I would just start selecting from page banner.

244
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,870
All the way down at the bottom until this closing day.

245
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,900
So we do not need the footer, just the closing div like this.

246
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,480
I would select that into my clipboard back in our empty new AP file.

247
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,510
Just paste it in at the very top.

248
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,220
Make sure you add an opening IP tag.

249
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
Let's give that a save.

250
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,880
And now if you refresh this blog listing URL, woops, it's still our homepage template.

251
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,870
I believe this is because WordPress stored a customized version of our template in the database instead

252
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,520
of actually using those newest files, you know, they actually live on the hard drive.

253
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,190
So I would just go into the full site editor and click on the templates area.

254
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,020
Might need to refresh this and yep, you can see for index the blue dot.

255
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,430
So just restore that click on these three dots, click clear customizations.

256
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,460
So it will actually use our text file.

257
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,230
So now if we refresh the blog URL, perfect.

258
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,160
But if we click back to our homepage, cool, that uses the front page template to refresh your memory

259
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,900
on how I set up my blog listing page to be different from my homepage URL.

260
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,210
Well, remember back in WordPress?

261
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
Under settings.

262
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,990
If you click into reading instead of this default option of your home page displays related posts.

263
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,830
I just clicked this a static page and then I created two pages, one called home and one called blog.

264
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,350
And those pages can be completely empty.

265
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,830
They really just need to exist for a sluggish URL perspective.

266
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,730
But essentially now WordPress will use the index template for your blogs and front page template for

267
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,570
your home page.

268
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,410
Cool.

269
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,330
That's going to bring this lesson to a close.

270
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,500
In our next video, we're going to create a few more page templates together.

271
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,230
Now, don't worry, I'm not going to bore you and make you walk through creating every single page template

272
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,380
with me, because as you can see, it's getting a bit repetitive.

273
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,900
But I do want to walk through the process with you at least another three or four times just to show

274
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,760
you how I would handle certain post type archive screens, so on and so forth.

275
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,900
Let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
