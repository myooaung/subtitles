00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.480
Now.

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.730
Again, if you asked 100 different programmers to set up a solution for this, you'd probably get 100

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.470
different answers of how to do it.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.330
But let me show you what I would do.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.640
So we need to tackle the solution, both from an admin editor, client JavaScript angle and from the

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.830
PHP render callback angle.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.640
However, regardless of which problem we solve first, I don't know of a way from client side JavaScript

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
in the admin editor to access the theme folder you are.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.670
So for example, in the admin screen, if you start to edit your index template in this JavaScript environment,

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm not sure of an easy, elegant way to have WordPress give us the currently installed an active theme.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.500
You are right.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.640
So this is what I'm going to do in our functions.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.230
Dot AP file.

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.050
Down at the bottom when we're creating our new instance of x block for slide.

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.420
Well let's just give it a third argument.

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.850
So comma, square brackets.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.540
And remember we set this up so that you give it a happy array of data and then it will be made available

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.920
from JavaScript.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.110
So let's make up a property name.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's call it quotes.

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.100
I'll make up a name maybe of.

22
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.450
How about.

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.850
Theme image path.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.380
So after the quote arrow symbol and then it would just be get theme file.

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.140
You are try parentheses to call that give it a string, a text, just slash.

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.610
Images slash.

27
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.620
Let's give that a save.

28
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.490
But the idea now is that in our client side JavaScript for the editor screen, we can access this value

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.090
and WordPress is giving us the HTTP.

30
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.500
You are ie towards our theme folder and then the slash images folder.

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.670
So this will work with any configuration of WordPress.

32
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.890
It doesn't matter if WordPress is installed at the root of the domain.

33
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.230
It doesn't matter if someone has changed the name of the WP content folder, so on and so forth.

34
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.720
Now before we directly go use this little bit of data, let's acknowledge that really all we need to

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.230
do now is add on to the end of this.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.640
So after the slash right, right about here, this would be, you know, bus, dot jpeg or apples dot

37
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.800
jpeg or bread dot jpeg.

38
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.200
So what I would do is back in our index dot HTML template, let's go find the slide instances.

39
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.530
So the first slide for me is around line number 24.

40
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.970
Here's what I would do.

41
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.740
So this first slide, this is what I want to be, the bus dot jpeg, right?

42
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.340
I'm just going to completely get rid of the image ID and definitely get rid of the image URL properties.

43
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.820
So now it's just an empty pair of curly brackets and let's make up an attribute name.

44
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.790
So we could call it anything, but let's call it maybe theme image, colon.

45
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.250
Give it a string of text for the value and just say bus dot, jpeg.

46
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.270
Right?

47
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.130
Because all we need to do to finish the path is just we're already in this images folder, so just use

48
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.700
this file.

49
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.940
Let's do the same thing for the other three as well.

50
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.510
So about on line number 38, this would be the apples dot jpeg.

51
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.340
So on this slide tag, just get rid of the image ID and the image URL.

52
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.450
In the curly brackets, it would just be quotes, theme, image, colon, quotes, apples, dot jpeg.

53
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.850
And then finally, let's do the same thing for this slide.

54
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.950
So get rid of the image, id get rid of the image URL in the empty object it would be quotes theme image

55
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.720
colon quotes.

56
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.840
Value is bread jpeg.

57
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.800
Cool.

58
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.120
Let's give that a save.

59
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.510
And now all we need to do is edit the client.

60
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.680
Add Main Gutenberg block JavaScript to combine the theme images folder with that little file name value

61
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.550
we just set up.

62
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.330
So I think this will come full circle right now if you just jump into our blocks folder and opened up

63
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.350
slide dot James with me up at the very top of this file, let's set up a new attribute.

64
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.130
So in the attributes object, let's add a brand new attribute.

65
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.260
We could name it anything, but we've already chosen a name back in our template, right?

66
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
We made up a name of theme image.

67
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.520
So let's use that here.

68
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.990
Theme, image, colon, curly brackets.

69
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.380
Be sure to add that line with a comma in the curly brackets.

70
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.390
We just need to say type string.

71
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.440
Cool.

72
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.800
Now let's just write a little bit of code so that on the first render or the first initial page load,

73
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.670
we check to see if this value is empty or not, if it exists, if it's not empty, right?

74
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.610
If you've passed in a value from your template file, then we can actually use it and then we can set

75
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.970
things up so that when the user actually uploads their own custom image, then we can just delete or

76
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.710
empty or hollow out this value.

77
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.390
Let me show you what I have in mind.

78
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.560
So in the edit component, we're already using use effect.

79
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.080
Let's set up another user effect because this one's watching for changes to image ID.

80
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.210
I want a new use effect that's only going to run on the first initial page load.

81
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.950
So just right above that use effect, we can just set up another use effect.

82
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.090
You give it to values for the B value, just give it an empty array.

83
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.290
Meaning we're not watching for any value in particular for changes.

84
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.160
This means only run this function on the initial load.

85
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.040
So then instead of the a placeholder, we'd give it a function.

86
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.510
In this function I would just write an if statement.

87
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:58.200
So if parentheses curly brackets, the condition would be props not attributes dot theme image.

88
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.820
So if that evaluates to true if it's not empty, then let's just set the image URL to sort of combine

89
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.560
the values in a way that makes sense.

90
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.920
So we'd say props, not set attributes.

91
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.570
You give that an object we would want to set image URL colon to now B and we would construct our own

92
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.020
string.

93
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.490
So let's use back text.

94
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.520
And now we'd essentially just combine the value that we set up in functions dot API's.

95
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.370
Remember a few moments ago we set this up.

96
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:37.590
So this is going to be the path that points towards our theme slash images slash so we can access that

97
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.310
by just saying slide dot, theme, image path.

98
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.670
So back in our JavaScript, in the back sticks, it would be dollar sign, curly brackets, and then

99
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.730
we'd say Slide 14, image path and then still in the back ticks.

100
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.500
But you could just set up a new expression.

101
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.330
So dollar sign, curly brackets, we're just sort of squishing two dynamic values together into one

102
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.350
overall string.

103
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.260
But then this would just be props dot attributes, dot theme image.

104
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.150
So all together this will be the theme images folder and then bus dot jpeg or Apple's dot jpeg.

105
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.980
Cool.

106
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.300
Now, before we save this file, let's address what should happen once the user actually does.

107
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.850
Or I should say if they actually upload and replace that with their own custom uploaded image.

108
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.030
So to take care of that in the original use effect that we already set up in a previous lesson, we're

109
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.070
watching for changes to image ID.

110
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.020
So if that changes, that means the user uploaded their own file and we are already setting, you know,

111
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.130
props, dot set attributes and setting the image URL.

112
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.900
So in this object I would just empty out theme image, right?

113
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.280
In other words, once the user uploads their own image, we no longer want to pay attention to or acknowledge

114
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.520
this hardcoded, you know, theme image, bread, dot jpeg.

115
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.000
So what I would do in this props dot said attributes maybe right before image URL we can just say also

116
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
change theme image colon to just be an empty string of text comma.

117
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.680
Let's give this a save and test it out.

118
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.160
So back in the full site editor screen.

119
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.390
I'll refresh the page.

120
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.650
Oops.

121
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.990
I just remembered we need to have our NPM run start task up and running in the command line.

122
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.830
Cool.

123
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.330
So with that, running with refresh.

124
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.920
If we scroll down to the slideshow, perfect.

125
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.610
There are the three images that we actually want.

126
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.460
So they're working.

127
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.890
Now if the user tries to customize that.

128
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.360
So if I click on this first one.

129
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.470
In the right hand side bar click choose image.

130
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.950
If I choose this building, click select cool that works.

131
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:55.060
And if I click Save and now refresh just to prove that it's saving into the database and still actually

132
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.180
being used instead of the hard coded, you know, busty jpeg.

133
00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.290
Cool it is.

134
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.460
So now we just need to adjust our render callback function a tiny bit so that the actual public output

135
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.780
also works, right?

136
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:14.260
Because at the moment, if we refresh the actual front end of our Web site, well, yes, we do indeed

137
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.790
see that image I just uploaded.

138
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.600
However, what about when someone first enables this theme?

139
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.550
So let me explain what I mean.

140
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.650
If the user reverts back to the initial template that the theme ships with.

141
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.970
So let me do that really quick.

142
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:35.920
If I go into templates, might have to refresh, but on index just revert or clear any user customizations.

143
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:36.670
Okay.

144
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.750
So we refresh notice that first slide on the actual render callback, it's using the fallback image

145
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.910
instead of bus dot jpeg.

146
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:55.180
So to fix this, all we need to do is in the our blocks folder, jump in to slide, dot up and up at

147
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.170
the very top in this copy block let's just write one more if statement.

148
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:05.620
So if parentheses curly brackets for the condition, I would just say if dollar sign attributes, square

149
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.630
brackets look for theme image.

150
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:15.700
So if that exists, if it's not empty, then let's just set image URL to actually use that hardcoded

151
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.000
value, you know, of Apple's dot jpeg or bus that jpeg.

152
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.540
Otherwise, if that's not true, this just will be ignored completely.

153
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.610
So in this if statement for the curly brackets, I would just say dollar sign attributes look in the

154
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:37.510
array for image URL set that to equal and then just get the file you are I semicolon give that a value

155
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:44.050
of quotes slash, images slash and then after the quotes I would concatenate on.

156
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:50.110
So a period dollar sign attributes look inside the array for theme image.

157
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.970
Let's give that a save.

158
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.280
And now with our theme using its total default values that shipped from the, you know, the actual

159
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.660
text file on the hard drive.

160
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:06.280
If we refresh perfect it knows to use that bus dot jpeg value and that's true for all three slides,

161
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.750
but the moment a user actually customizes that so we can go back into index and if I change the bread

162
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.810
slide to instead be this cat click save, we can go check the PHP version.

163
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.520
Go to the third slide.

164
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.140
Perfect.

165
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.570
So big picture, what does this mean?

166
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.030
It means that our indexed on each html template file is good to go.

167
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.160
You could ship out this theme.

168
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.830
You could distribute this theme and this code will make sense for any WordPress installation.

169
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.420
So when the user first installs in enables your theme, it will work and makes sense.

170
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.760
But it's also a great home base that they can always revert back to that's going to bring this lesson

171
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.450
to a close.

172
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:55.990
And even though that was a lot of work just for the one homepage template, trust me, all of the other

173
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:02.620
templates, you know, for individual blog post, individual page archives, so on and so forth, those

174
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.490
don't require any sort of custom accommodations like we set up in this video.

175
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.310
So those are all going to go very quickly.

176
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.130
I think we can finish them in just a video or two.

177
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.720
In other words, we're very close to finishing this new block theme together.

178
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.160
Let's keep our momentum rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
