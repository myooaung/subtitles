00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.110
Hello, everyone, in this lesson, we will make a few quick miscellaneous edits and improvements to

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.740
our theme.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.920
This lesson probably won't feel super educational as it's more of just a follow along and do this in

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.840
that type of thing.

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.370
Without further ado, let's get started.

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.970
So the first thing that I want to do is make sure that our website is responsive, or in other words,

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.370
that it's optimized for devices of all sizes.

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.360
So, for example, if someone viewed this website on a smartphone, what would it look like?

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.220
Well, check this out.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.340
If you're using Google Chrome as your Web browser, and I recommend that you do as Chrome has some of

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.500
the best developer tools in the world.

12
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.850
But if you're using Chrome, you can right click anywhere on the page and choose, inspect and then

13
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.730
from this developer Tools Pop-Up Window, I want you to click on this second icon that we see towards

14
00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.690
the top left.

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.160
It's two rectangles.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.510
It looks like maybe a smartphone and a tablet.

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.150
Go ahead and click on that.

18
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.590
And now back in your main Web browser window, Chrome lets you simulate different mobile devices so

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.010
we can use this menu up here and we can choose between the Galaxy Nexus iPhone, iPad.

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.370
So I'm using the iPhone six.

21
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.040
And obviously this is not what we want our website to look like on a smartphone, because what we're

22
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.340
seeing is a layout designed for a large desktop monitor and then it's just zoomed and scaled out to

23
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.800
fit on a tiny screen.

24
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.380
So in order to actually read any of this text on a smartphone, you would have to pinch, zoom in and

25
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.150
then awkwardly scroll around and then maybe pinch zoom back out.

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.960
It's super awkward, right?

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.830
So instead of the iPhone adapting to our website and zooming it out in order to fit, we want the opposite.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.450
We want our website to adapt to the size of the device.

29
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.370
So in order to do that, jump into your text editor and in your theme folder, open up header HP now

30
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.580
up towards the very top within this head section, right above this PWP headline.

31
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.850
Let's create a new line and type this in with me.

32
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:25.030
Let's add a new meta tag and we'll give it an attribute of name and set that equal viewport.

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.180
And then after the quotes, let's add another attribute named content and set that to equal width equals

34
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.550
device width.

35
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.610
So that will tell Web browsers and devices to just be true to themselves and use their own native device

36
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.080
size or device width.

37
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.990
And then within this same set of quotes, let's add a comma and say initial scale equals one.

38
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.790
Cool.

39
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.090
So if I save this and refresh my iPhone simulation.

40
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:08.170
Much better so now the layout has collapsed to a single column view, the iPhone is using its natural

41
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.600
size and the content of the website has kind of squished down to fit and up in the header.

42
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.370
Instead of seeing all the navigation links, we can click on this menu icon to toggle the mobile menu.

43
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.030
Cool.

44
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.220
Now, I do want to point out that this meta tag that we added is not magical, meaning this line on

45
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.940
its own will not make a website responsive.

46
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.900
You need to write your CSR code and your CSFs layout to be responsive.

47
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.930
And then this meta tag is sort of the cherry on top that tells devices to use their native size.

48
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.170
Now, if you're curious about writing responsive, mobile friendly access, I've already created two

49
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.140
entire other courses dedicated to that topic.

50
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.590
In this course, we want to stay focused on and WordPress and we don't want to get derailed with 10

51
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.140
or 20 hours of CSFs code.

52
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.740
So long story short, if you're ever working with WordPress and you know for a fact that you have responsive

53
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.110
access, but the website still isn't acting responsibly, you're probably just missing this meta tag

54
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.250
in your head section.

55
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.120
OK, now let's change gears and move on to the next topic up online.

56
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:25.150
Number two, we have this opening HTML tag and we want to be sure to tell Web browsers what language

57
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.400
our website is using.

58
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.820
Now, when I say language, I don't mean HTML or JavaScript.

59
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.060
I mean human languages like English or Spanish or French or you get the idea.

60
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.770
Now, WordPress has a function we can use here that will dynamically look at the language of your site

61
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.480
and the language setting that you chose and WordPress and output the appropriate tag here.

62
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.890
So place your cursor in between the L and the greater than symbol.

63
00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:01.030
And then what we're going to do is drop into P and call a WordPress function named Language Act tributes.

64
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.720
Now, if I save this and refresh the page, obviously we don't see any visual difference.

65
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:16.120
But if we inspect the page, you can see that on the opening HTML tag here, WordPress added a langur

66
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.200
language attribute and gave it a value of English U.S. cool.

67
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.060
And if you chose a different language in your WordPress settings, the appropriate language tag would

68
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.010
be displayed here.

69
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.630
So that way search engines like Google and visitors of your website know what language they can expect.

70
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.440
Let's move on to the next tip.

71
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.060
So back in our code in heterodoxy HP within the head section, let's add another meta tag.

72
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.600
So right above the meta tag that we just added a moment ago.

73
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.670
Let's add a new line and create another meta tag and let's give it an attribute of care set short for

74
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.550
character set.

75
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.350
And let's set that to equal an empty pair of quotes.

76
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:02.680
And then within those quotes, we want to drop in HP so we can use a WordPress function now before we

77
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.850
type out the function name.

78
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.540
Just a little bit of context here.

79
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.120
This is how you tell the Web browser what type of characters or letters and numbers you're going to

80
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.560
be using on the page.

81
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.120
Right.

82
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.390
And this might be different depending on the language of your website.

83
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.620
So WordPress will dynamically look at your language settings and a few other options and output the

84
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.900
appropriate value here.

85
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.920
So we want to call a WordPress function named blog info.

86
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.160
And then within the parentheses, we will give it an argument of care set short for character set.

87
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.500
So if I save that and refresh my page.

88
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.850
In my developer tools, I can look at the source code for the page, and if I dig into the head element,

89
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.790
WordPress is now generating this meta tag with a character set of UTF eight, which makes sense since

90
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.640
my Web site is in English and I live in North America.

91
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.480
Cool.

92
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.020
Let's move on to the final tip in this lesson.

93
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.360
So back in our text editor in heterodoxy, I want you to find the opening body tag.

94
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.830
And in between the letter Y and the greater than symbol, let's add a space and drop in to peak.

95
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.700
And what we're going to do is call a WordPress function named Body Underscore Class.

96
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.830
Now, this is probably one of my favorite WordPress functions because check this out.

97
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:31.810
If I save this and refresh the page, we can see that on the opening body tag, WordPress added a class

98
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.660
attribute and gave it all sorts of values.

99
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.960
And these change depending on which page or screen a user is visiting.

100
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.620
So we see home because I'm on the homepage.

101
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.250
We see logged in because I'm currently signed in.

102
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:52.780
But if I go to a different page, if I go to the about US page and if I inspect or view the source again,

103
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.640
now check out the body tag.

104
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.590
It has totally different classes.

105
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.170
Page template default, page ID, 16 page parent.

106
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.750
Cool.

107
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:09.400
And if I go to one of the children pages like our history and check out the inspector tool, now we

108
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.440
see page ID, twenty two page child parent page ID 16.

109
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.830
So what this does is it gives you all sorts of neat information about the current screen, your viewing,

110
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:27.040
and then you can use these class names in your success if you want to style a particular page in a different

111
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.390
way, or you can even use these classes in your JavaScript.

112
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.270
Now, that's going to bring this quick miscellaneous lesson to a close.

113
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.610
Before we jump into the next lesson, I do want to show you how to exit out of this mobile responsive

114
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:46.390
mode so you can just click to inspect again and then you can just click this same icon a second time

115
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.340
to exit out of that mode.

116
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.940
Cool.

117
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.400
So now we're back in regular desktop mode.

118
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.210
Looking ahead to our next lesson, we will learn how to create dynamic WordPress powered navigation

119
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.630
menus, and you'll be able to edit and maintain them from the WordPress admin appearance menu screen

120
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:11.260
so you can set one menu location up here in the header, a second one for this footer column and a third

121
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.640
one for this footer column.

122
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.680
You'll learn how to create as many different menus and menu locations as you need.

123
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.140
Should be a lot of fun.

124
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.190
Let's keep it rolling and I'll see you then.
