00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.530
Hello, everyone, this is going to be a very quick listen.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.970
We're just going to make a few tiny edits related to the blog section.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.330
Let's dive right in.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.600
So I'm on the homepage of our Web site.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.560
And in our previous lesson, we wrote Code to pull in dynamic content here, the two most recent posts.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.450
But we forgot to update this button that reads view all blog posts.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.270
When someone clicks on this link or button, it should take them to the slash blog page.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.780
But at the moment, if I click that link, it just takes me to the top of the page because it's HSF

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090
value is just a placeholder hash tag.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.140
So let's fix this link right now in the text editor.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:49.120
Let's jump in to front page dot BHP and let's scroll down until we see that blog area.

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.580
So here's the piece we wrote in our previous lesson.

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.670
So just right below that, here is that button or link that reads view all blog posts.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.260
So let's just adjust the address, delete the placeholder hash tag and instead drop to P and then echo

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
out the results of a function named site U.

16
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.850
RL.

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.590
Now, without any arguments, this function will return an absolute Eurail to the root of our domain.

18
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.250
But if we include an argument, we can say slash blog and the function will just append that to the

19
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.250
end of the root of our domain so we can save that and then refresh.

20
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.970
And now when I click on this button, perfect.

21
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.500
Takes us to the blog page.

22
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.140
Now let's change gears.

23
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.690
The only other edit I want to make in this lesson has to do with the blog link up in our header navigation.

24
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.320
Right.

25
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.170
Because if I go back to the home page and then if I try to click on that blog link, it doesn't work.

26
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.710
So to fix that, let's jump into our text editor and open up our header file.

27
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.510
So here I see a NAV element that is the header navigation.

28
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.300
And here's the list item in Link for blog.

29
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.850
So let's just update the atrip value.

30
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.910
Instead of a hardcoded hash tag, you could just copy and paste what we wrote just a moment ago, but

31
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.370
it's almost just as quick to type it out.

32
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.880
So echo out the results of Site You URL.

33
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.580
And we don't just want the root of our domain, we want to add on blog.

34
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.230
Cool.

35
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.050
So if I save that refresh now, I can use that link up in the header to visit the blog section.

36
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.160
However, our work is not complete yet because remember, we want our header navigation to show you

37
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.020
which page you are currently on.

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.820
Right.

39
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.420
If I click on about us, noticed that it stays lit up as a subtle yellow colour to indicate that that's

40
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.160
where you are.

41
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.480
So we would want the same thing to happen with the blog link once you click on blog.

42
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.720
That link should stay lit up as yellow as long as you're reviewing the generic blog listing or an individual

43
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.270
blog post or an author archive or category archive.

44
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.260
So back in our text editor, remember to make that happen for the About US link.

45
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.280
We just wrote an if statement to say that if the page you're currently on is about us or if the current

46
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.510
page has a parent of about us, then echo out a little bit of HTML that assigns this class and that

47
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.070
will make the link turn yellow.

48
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.570
So we just want to do something similar for this blog list item.

49
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.790
So within this opening line tag, after the I and before the greater than Simbel, let's drop in to

50
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.280
P and let's say only F and then what is our condition going to be?

51
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.180
Well, there's lots of different ways we could do this.

52
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.610
We could say if is home and that will evaluate to true when you are on the generic blog listing homepage

53
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.420
screen, however, that function will return false if you're on an individual blog post or a category

54
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.470
archive screen is home just by itself will not do the trick we could try is single and that will evaluate

55
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.790
to true on individual post screens or we could try is archive for the author and category archive screens.

56
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.860
Now you could use all of those different functions, but let me show you a neat way of covering all

57
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.830
of our bases with just one condition check.

58
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:36.600
Let's say if I get post type, it's a function, so give it its own parentheses if that equals post.

59
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.500
So out of the box, WordPress comes with posts and pages.

60
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.330
Now, a page is really just a post that has a post type that equals page and a traditional blog post

61
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.880
obviously has a post type of post.

62
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.880
Later on in the course, we will learn how to create our own custom post types for things like events

63
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640
and programs and professors and campuses.

64
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.350
But for now, this will do the trick, because as long as the current URL and default query has to do

65
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.450
with post type of post, well, that obviously means it's related to our blog.

66
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.110
OK, so if this is true right after these parentheses, if that condition is true, we just want to

67
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:27.410
echo out a bit of HTML, so single quotes and then let's say class equals and then double quotes.

68
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.750
And I don't expect you to memorize the class name, but we can see it up here.

69
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.150
So this will apply the success that makes the link yellow.

70
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.220
So its current menu item.

71
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.530
Current menu item.

72
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.470
OK, and if I save that, let's test it out.

73
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.170
Cool.

74
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.110
So it's a subtle yellow, but you can see it lights up while I'm on an individual post screen and I

75
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.970
can go to an author archive or category archive and it stays lit up or it can even go to the main blog

76
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.900
home page here.

77
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.710
And that's actually going to bring this lesson to a close.

78
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.210
In our very next lesson.

79
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.010
We're going to be changing gears.

80
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.280
We're going to be diving into custom post types.

81
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.360
So that way we're not limited to only posts and pages.

82
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.140
We can create custom post types named events and programs and professors and campuses.

83
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.940
And this is where things will really start to pick up and feel powerful and like we're moving beyond

84
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.720
the basics.

85
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.460
Should be a ton of fun.

86
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.040
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
