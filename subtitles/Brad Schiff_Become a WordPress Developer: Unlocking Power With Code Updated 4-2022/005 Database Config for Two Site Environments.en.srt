00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,320
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:11,900
In this lesson, we will learn how to deploy our WordPress files from a repository up onto a Web host.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,490
In our previous lesson, we learned how to move a database.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,670
Now, in this lesson, we are focusing on files.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,190
However, before we actually move any files to our Web host, I first want to cover a topic that is

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:33,050
related to both files and the database, and that is that when you are manually moving a WordPress website,

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,470
you need to account for the fact that the database that lives on your local dev environment and the

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:46,070
database that lives on your Web host require different login credentials in order for WordPress to be

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,450
able to access them.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,700
Let me explain what I mean by that.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,450
I think the best way to understand the issue that I'm trying to describe is to open up the config file

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,130
for our local dev environment, WordPress.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,600
So right now, let me show you where you can find that file within the local by flywheel app.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,150
You can right.

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,780
Click on your project, choose, reveal and Finder, dig into your project, dig into app and then dig

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,800
into public.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,770
And then within this folder that contains WP content, WP admin and WP includes, there is a file named

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,940
WP Dash Config Dot.

19
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,970
So right now, let's go ahead and view this file in our text editor within this file.

20
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,480
If you scroll down to about line number 23, there are four values that I want us to focus on.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,910
They are Debe name, DB User DB Password and DB host.

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:56,150
Now these values of local root, root and localhost, these work for our local dev environment and they

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,050
allow WordPress to successfully connect to our local database.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,100
But the database that lives on our Web hosting account, it requires completely different values.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,310
Now at first you might think, big deal, who cares?

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,620
Why don't we just update these values to whatever our Web host database requires?

27
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,250
Well, it's not that simple because if we make any change to these values whatsoever, so if I change

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,550
the database name to just something random and save that, well, now, as soon as I visit my local

29
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:33,600
dev environment website and refresh, it's completely broken, right?

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,310
Because now it cannot establish a connection to its database.

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,380
Let me put that value back really quick.

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,840
OK, so the question becomes, how can we set up this config file to please both our local dev environment

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,010
and our Web hosting environment?

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,240
Well, there are probably a hundred different ways to do that.

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,290
But let me show you my favorite way.

36
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,970
So right above this comment that says the name of the database for WordPress, right above that line,

37
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,150
let's create an if statement.

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:13,070
So if parentheses curly brackets and actually right after the closing curly bracket, let's say else.

39
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,380
OK, and then for our condition, check within these parentheses, let's say, if so, in terms of that

40
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,640
condition, in order to save a bit of typing, why don't we just jump in to our functions file in our

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,630
theme folder?

42
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,590
Because we've already written that if statement wants.

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:41,120
So, for example, if you jump into functions, B, this is in our theme folder and if you scroll down

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,230
and find our function named university files, you can see we've already written that exact if statement.

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:57,290
So I would just select from the beginning of this story start and then select until just the one closing

46
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,280
parentheses.

47
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,540
So don't grab both of them, just grab one and then copy that into your clipboard back in our WP config

48
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,650
file right here.

49
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,910
We can just paste that in.

50
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,880
OK, so if that's true, then in this if block we would just want to cut and paste these four values

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
to make this a bit cleaner.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,780
Why don't we actually get rid of these comments?

53
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,110
So I'm going to get rid of the comment right above the DB name, get rid of the comment above user as

54
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,890
well as databased password and MySQL hostname.

55
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,640
So I'm just going to cut or move these four defined lines into the block.

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,290
OK, let's go ahead and save this and test it out.

57
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,470
So on the front end of my local copy of the website, if I refresh, everything still works perfectly

58
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,870
and to make sure that our logic is actually running, you could just change this address a bit so that

59
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,610
it doesn't evaluate to true.

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,760
So if I add it on a few extra L's at the end of local and save now when I reload.

61
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,980
We see an error message, right?

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,490
We cannot establish a connection to the database.

63
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,540
Cool.

64
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,100
So let's put that back to just dot local.

65
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,340
OK, and now let's take these four defined lines, these values.

66
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,720
Let's copy these and just create a duplicate copy in the else block.

67
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,680
So now we just need to modify these values or find the correct values that would work with our Web hosting

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,220
account.

69
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,890
Now, it's important to point out that every Web hosting company is slightly different.

70
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,560
So you might need to look for your hosting companies frequently asked questions, page, or see if they

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,890
have any documentation on setting up a database or even get in touch with customer support.

72
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,870
But the point that I'm trying to drive home is that I can't guarantee what values you should use here

73
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,430
because every host different.

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,810
However, let me walk you through what I would do with this particular Web host.

75
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,080
So when I log into my Web post, I'm just looking for the database section or the MySQL section.

76
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,570
And because your Web host isn't going to look like mine, it's not so much about looking at where on

77
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,650
the screen I'm clicking.

78
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,130
It's more about the actions I'm performing.

79
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,840
So right now I'm just navigating to the database section because I'm trying to find the database name.

80
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,450
Right, the name of the database that we created on our Web host in the previous lesson.

81
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,720
So here it is.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,890
I'm just going to copy and paste this into my text editor on your Web host.

83
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,900
It might be a randomly generated name or it might be some sort of name that you chose to enter.

84
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,820
But either way, we're just looking for the DB name, the database name, and then back in our text

85
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,320
editor within the else block for DB name.

86
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,030
Let's change this from quote, local to quote and then just paste in your clipboard.

87
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,660
OK, next is the database user.

88
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,210
So back inside ground, you can click on this user's link or user's tab here, down at the very bottom,

89
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,980
we should have an existing user.

90
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,950
So, again, this is a randomly generated username.

91
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,350
You can just copy that into your clipboard.

92
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,710
Back in our text editor instead of root for the DB user, just paste that in the quotes.

93
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,340
Next up is the password for this user.

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,490
Now back in site ground on this user row here in the far right corner, you see these three dots and

95
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,310
if you click on them, you can then click change password.

96
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,530
Unfortunately, there's no way for us to view the current password.

97
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,250
So our best bet is just to change the password to something that we know.

98
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,860
So let's click change password.

99
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,250
So just go ahead and type something in that's eight or more characters or you can click the generate

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,670
button.

101
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,300
OK, then click confirm and then back in our text editor, whatever you just chose for the password

102
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,630
that goes on this line.

103
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,460
So here's the super secure password I chose.

104
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,730
Please don't hack me 20 20.

105
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,570
OK, and before we move on to the fourth and final value here, I do want to show you something back

106
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,330
in the site, ground control panel.

107
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,800
So down here under Manege users, this is the user name and we just set a password.

108
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:12,490
But we also want to be sure to give this user access to the new database that we created in the previous

109
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,960
lesson.

110
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,970
You need to make sure that your database user has access to the desired database itself.

111
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,750
So to do that towards the right hand corner, we can click on this icon here and you can see we're just

112
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,840
adding a database for our user.

113
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,530
So by default, it selects the one database that I have and I'm just going to give this user all privileges.

114
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,000
So click confirm.

115
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:46,750
Cool, so now this database user actually has permission and access to the desired database at this

116
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:46,970
point.

117
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,160
Let's jump back into our text editor and work on this fourth and final value.

118
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,780
We could likely leave this as localhost and it would work.

119
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:03,830
However, I did notice that site ground by default sets this to so quotes one two seven zero zero one.

120
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:11,140
Now, I am aware that localhost essentially equals one two seven 0.01, but who knows, maybe Cytron

121
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,610
has a reason that that's what they set it to by default.

122
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,060
Now, when I say that every Web host is different, that's especially true when it comes to DB host

123
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,720
values.

124
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,870
A lot of companies do use localhost here, but I know in the past when I used Dream host, they would

125
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,950
give you a MySQL subdomain that you would use here.

126
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,030
So if you think you have the DB name, user and password, correct, but it's still not working for

127
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:39,910
you, you might need to contact customer support or look through the web hosting wiki and discover what

128
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,760
you should use for your DB host value here.

129
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,790
OK, let's go ahead and save this file.

130
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,910
And now our database set up is complete.

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,740
This code is able to successfully connect to our local database as well as our live database.

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,350
Now that's going to bring this part of the lesson to a close.

133
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,520
In the next part, we will get to the moment we've all been waiting for.

134
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,900
We will implement deployment's that automatically happen every time you update your GitHub or BitBucket

135
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,830
repository.

136
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,810
It's a super luxurious workflow that makes future updates to your code, files a piece of cake.

137
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,580
Let's keep things rolling and I will see you then.
