00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.620
In this lesson, we will learn how to use custom image sizes on the front end of our Web site.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.640
So, for example, in our previous lesson, we added custom image sizes for portrait and landscape.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.320
Right.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.210
So WordPress will automatically generate all of these different sized images, different copies of the

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.260
same photo.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.610
And now we just want to learn how to use the different sizes on the front end.

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.150
So as an example, on a professor detail screen like this, we would want to pull in an image that is

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.070
taller than it is wide.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.570
So if we jump into our text editor and open up functions dot p HP, you'll remember in our previous

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.550
lesson that we created two new image sizes and we gave them nicknames of Professor Landscape and Professor

12
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.150
Portrait.

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.960
So if we want to use one of these sizes on the professor detail screen here, let's jump into the template

14
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.720
file that controls this screen, which is single Professor Dot BHP.

15
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.110
And if we scroll down a bit here, we see the code that is responsible for outputting the featured image

16
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.020
or the post thumbnail.

17
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.850
And all we need to do is go inside the parentheses for this function and for the argument.

18
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.600
We just type out the nickname of one of our image sizes.

19
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.040
So, for example, let's say Professor Portrait.

20
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.930
Go ahead and save that.

21
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.650
Cool.

22
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.730
And that's all it takes.

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.670
So now we can see we are using the portrait image here.

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.330
And then if we go back to the biology program page.

25
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.690
Remember, this screen is still using the really large high resolution copy of the image.

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.190
Right.

27
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.770
If I right.

28
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.110
Click and choose open image in New Tab.

29
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.210
You can see that this image is almost 5000 pixels wide.

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.900
So instead we want to pull in the image that uses our professor landscape image size here.

31
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.010
So the template file that controls this screen is single dash program dot BHP.

32
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.870
Let's scroll down a bit.

33
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.930
Here's the related professors custom query right below that.

34
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.140
Here's the while loop that controls the HDMI like it's generated for each professor.

35
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.320
Here we can see the function, the post thumbnail.

36
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.250
You are well, and let's just go inside the parentheses for that function and give it an argument of

37
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.960
our image size nickname.

38
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.570
So, Professor Landscape, let's go ahead and save that.

39
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.050
Cool, and if we test it out by right clicking and choose open image and new tab, we can see that image

40
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.390
is a reasonable four hundred pixels wide.

41
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.470
Cool.

42
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.190
OK.

43
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.040
Now, at this point, let's change gears a bit and talk about how our images are being cropped.

44
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.520
So, for example, if I click on to the miaows a lot detail screen, obviously this image was cropped

45
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.820
in order to create this portrait aspect ratio.

46
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.620
Now, by default, WordPress will crop towards the very center of the image.

47
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.770
Now, for this particular photo that worked, OK, but what if we had another photo where the subject

48
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.300
was off to the side?

49
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.700
So the question is, how can we have more control over how the images are getting cropped?

50
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.380
Well, let me show you something.

51
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.510
Back in our text editor, let's jump in two functions, dot p HP.

52
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.110
And you'll remember that when we created these new image sizes, we said cropping is set to true.

53
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.250
Now, a value of true will just cropped the image towards the center.

54
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.030
But if you want more control, you could provide an array.

55
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.280
And for the first value you could either say left, right or center.

56
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.550
And for the second value, we can say either top center or bottom right.

57
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.220
So the horizontal and vertical corner that you want to crop towards.

58
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.040
However, personally, I never use this feature because images are not all the same.

59
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.370
Right.

60
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.000
There's not a one size fits all cropping strategy for images.

61
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.340
So let's set that back to true.

62
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.540
And I'll show you what I do on Web sites where center based cropping is not what I want.

63
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.230
Right.

64
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.100
So what do I do when I need to crop each image differently?

65
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.970
Well, luckily, there's a perfect plug in for this situation.

66
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.790
So in the admen dashboard, lets hover over plug ins in the sidebar and click add new.

67
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.720
And let's use this search field to search for manual image crop.

68
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.980
And then the author's name is t o m a s z.

69
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.780
You do need to include the author's name in your search here in order to have this show up towards the

70
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.160
beginning of the results.

71
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.970
Now, yes, I will admit that this plugin has not been updated for five years, but as of June 2020,

72
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.070
in the latest version of WordPress, it still works perfectly for all of my projects.

73
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.440
So it's absolutely what I still recommend.

74
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.730
But you're free to look for other plugins after this lesson if you'd like to.

75
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.810
Anyways, let's go ahead and click install now and then.

76
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.100
Let's click activate.

77
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.500
OK.

78
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.440
And now let's give ourselves a goal.

79
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.220
Let's imagine that I want to crop this cat image differently.

80
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:29.100
So in the word press, admen, let's go into professors and let's edit the Dr. Miaows a lot post and

81
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.290
now over in the featured image area.

82
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.510
If we click on the featured image.

83
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.720
Well, now, right here, we see this new option of crop image.

84
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.260
So let's click on that.

85
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.820
And the first thing I want to draw your attention to are these different tabs up here.

86
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.050
So we see thumbnail professor landscape and professor portrait.

87
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.810
So I don't need to customize the thumbnail size.

88
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.630
But let's go ahead and click on Professor Landscape.

89
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.890
And now, if I try to resize this crop area, what's nice is it's automatically constrained to the aspect

90
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.920
ratio that we defined in our functions file.

91
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.430
So for the landscape, maybe I really want to zoom in tight on the cat's face like this, maybe a little

92
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.630
bit more exaggerated.

93
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.490
I'm happy with that.

94
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.050
So then if you scroll down a little bit, there's a crop it.

95
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.520
Button.

96
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.230
Let's click that.

97
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.720
Cool.

98
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.730
And now if I go back to the front end of my Web site and refresh this screen where we are pulling in

99
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.520
the professor landscape photo, woops.

100
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.940
Now, at first you'll see that the image did not change.

101
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.180
So this is not the new cropped version that we just created.

102
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.930
This has nothing to do with WordPress or the plugin we're using.

103
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.550
And it has everything to do with our Web browsers caching behavior.

104
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.960
Essentially, the new JPEG file that WordPress and the plugin created, it's using the exact same file

105
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.450
name as the previous version of the image.

106
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.770
So when you perform a normal refresh, you will not see the new image here.

107
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.060
However, if you perform a hard or full refresh, you will see it.

108
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.210
So to do that, you can just hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the browsers reload

109
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.630
button.

110
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.120
Cool.

111
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.880
Notice now we do see the new cropped version.

112
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.900
And if we go to the detail screen that uses a portrait version, if we want to customize this crop back

113
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.970
in the admen, we can just scroll back up and click on the Professor Portrait Tab.

114
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.610
And now we are constrained to that aspect ratio.

115
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.980
So maybe I want to zoom in really tight on the cat's face like this.

116
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.270
Let's scroll down a little bit.

117
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.500
Click crop it.

118
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.010
And then if I jump back to the front end and refresh this screen initially, we will not see the new

119
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.570
image because our browser has already downloaded the old version with the same file name.

120
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.010
So, again, just performing hard or full refresh, hold down the shift key and reload.

121
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.890
And there is the new cropped version.

122
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.230
In the real world, this caching issue is not usually a problem because you're usually going to crop

123
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.600
the images when you first create the post.

124
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.000
That combined with the fact that most visitors will not have already viewed your professors.

125
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.560
And you can see how this is not going to be an issue on our live production Web site.

126
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:24.250
Now, not every Web site will need fine grained control over cropping like that, but I think this plugin

127
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:29.290
is a life saver if you want to have art direction over your different sizes of images.

128
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:35.350
Now, that's going to bring our focus on featured images to a close, but we are not done yet.

129
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:42.220
When it comes to learning how to manage uploaded images in our next lesson, we will finally learn how

130
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.160
to make this top banner area dynamic.

131
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.750
So in addition to replacing this annoying.

132
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.450
Don't forget to replace me later.

133
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:55.360
Text that I'm sure you've been staring at for this entire course in addition to making that dynamic.

134
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:02.710
We will also learn how to set things up so that each post and each page can upload its own unique background

135
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.730
image here.

136
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.360
Right.

137
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:10.150
Instead of this default fallback beach or ocean photo, learning how to set this up should be a lot

138
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.630
of fun.

139
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.130
Let's keep things rolling.

140
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.950
And I will see you in the next lesson.
