00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,530
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:11,060
In this lesson, we're going to actually finalize our first block themed template file that users can

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,260
revert back to.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,830
So we already learned about that concept earlier in the chapter.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,560
Only now it's actually using the desired blocks that we built ourselves.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,880
Let me explain.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,520
So currently this is what our homepage looks like.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,770
We've successfully added the header, the banner block, the events and blogs, block slideshow, and

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,550
then the footer.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,490
So this exact combination and layout of blocks, this is spelled out in the database.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,270
Let's just go find that and then actually use it in our text editor copy of the file so that the user

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,220
can always revert back to this.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:56,120
So just to be clear, if you look in your theme folder and go into the templates folder and dig into

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,850
indexed HTML, currently all we had hardcoded in this is just a paragraph and heading as an example.

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,630
So the idea is we want to have the Gutenberg comments right that look just like this, only they're

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,160
using our block types.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,030
We want this type of code that spells out this exact combination of our blocks.

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,000
So remember, there are two ways to find that.

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,760
So let me show you in your admin interface under appearance if you click into editor.

20
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,930
One way to find that code is from this editor screen in the top right, you see the three dots and this

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,670
needs to be in the full site editing, not the blog post or page editing screen, but you can click

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,550
those three dots and choose export.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,470
So that'll download a zip file.

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,520
You can look in the contents of that zip file for the template files.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,080
You can totally do that.

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,050
But I like to just go look in the database oftentimes.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,640
So, for example, here's the database for my local WordPress website.

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,370
If you dig in to the post table, click Select Data.

29
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,260
Just go to the very last page.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,120
I scroll down to the very bottom.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Well, this is assuming that you haven't created any pages or posts since you last saved a change to

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,590
this template.

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,430
But if you go into the very last item and look under post content.

34
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,750
There you have it.

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,080
So it starts with our header block and then our banner block.

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,530
Perfect.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,960
If you scroll down to the bottom, there's our footer block.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,290
So I would just click into this field and just control or command a select everything in there, copy

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,660
it into your clipboard and then back in this index dot HTML template file.

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,430
Just empty it out and paste in your clipboard.

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,520
Let's give that a save.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
And now I want to show you why this is so useful.

43
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,670
Now, don't worry.

44
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,950
We're going to make a few improvements to this to make it a bit more robust or resilient to different

45
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,230
WordPress installation configurations.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,020
But for now, let's see why this file is useful.

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,220
Just a quick reminder.

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,030
So now if the user of the website makes a change, let's say they change this headline to just be something

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,380
that doesn't even make sense.

50
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,120
And they click Save.

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,660
And imagine they accidentally deleted, you know, the header placeholder and maybe they accidentally

52
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,980
deleted the slideshow.

53
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,070
And they saved that as well.

54
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,940
Cool.

55
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,040
So they've totally changed their website.

56
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,800
Now, I imagine they want it to revert back to the original default version that the theme provides.

57
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,860
Well, that's the whole point of that text file that we just created.

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,910
So the user would just go into this templates menu here.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,810
Oftentimes you will need to manually refresh this page.

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,890
But the idea is for index, you'll see a blue dot and that means that there are user customizations.

61
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,960
So the user could just click these three dots here and click clear customizations.

62
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:55,070
And as soon as they do that, that's going to revert things back to this hard drive copy version of

63
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,270
the file, the template.

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,220
So now if we go back to the front end and refresh, everything is perfectly restored.

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,410
Right.

66
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,490
This is back to normal.

67
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,550
We've got the header.

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,110
We've got the slideshow.

69
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,040
Perfect.

70
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,340
At this point, I want to talk about something that may seem like a tiny detail, but it's fairly important

71
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,820
to me.

72
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,080
Let me explain.

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,250
So I want you to dig into our file that we just created, indexed on each HTML.

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,040
And I want you to scroll down and find the slide show area.

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,980
So for me, it's around line number 23.

76
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:31,160
Here's the first slide and I want you to pay attention to the image URL value.

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,010
In other words, off camera.

78
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,160
In the previous video, I actually uploaded the images for the slide show, you know, the apples,

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,570
the bread and the bus.

80
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,690
However, let's think about this for a moment.

81
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,220
We want this default version of the theme that we ship out to our users.

82
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,260
We want it to make sense right away.

83
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,860
And when someone has their own installation of WordPress, they're not going to have a media uploaded

84
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,100
file for the bus and the apples in the bread.

85
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,100
Right.

86
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,690
That user is going to have their own totally unique media library.

87
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,760
They're not going to have the same images that we've uploaded, so this file reference wouldn't exist

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,240
for them.

89
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,330
So we need to set things up in some sort of robust, resilient way where we can somehow point towards

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,710
our theme folder.

91
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,550
Right.

92
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,640
So if we're distributing our fictional block theme folder.

93
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,230
Yes.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,300
Inside that folder, we will indeed be shipping this images folder.

95
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,770
And that has the real copies of bread, apples and bus that we want to point towards.

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,580
Right.

97
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,260
So that way, anyone who uses our theme would actually have the JPEGs in question.

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:47,810
Now, if you wanted this to work for maybe 70 to 80 to 90% of your potential users, but not 100% of

99
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,400
them, you could take the easy route and just hard code this.

100
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,800
So for example, you could get rid of the HTTP and just begin with, you know, slash for the root of

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,050
the domain WP content and then change this to be, you know, the themes folder.

102
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,740
And then I won't spell it out but your theme name and you know images bust dot jpeg you could do that

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:17,090
and that would work for most but not all users because not everyone is going to install WordPress at

104
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,410
the root of their domain.

105
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:24,320
And some users might, you know, change the name of the WP content folder, so on and so forth.

106
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,490
So how would we set this up in a flexible, resilient way?

107
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,120
Well, there's probably a hundred different ways you could set this up.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,280
But let me show you what I have in mind.

109
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,460
And actually, first, just to make sure that the issue at hand is crystal clear, we can actually scroll

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,770
up to the very, very top of this file.

111
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,910
And before we worry about the slideshow, let's first worry about the banner block.

112
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,600
So around line number three on this opening banner block tag, I would just completely remove image

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,250
ID and especially image URL from this template file all together.

114
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,330
So I would just delete both of those attributes or values.

115
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,930
You don't even need these empty curly brackets then.

116
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,460
So the opening tag would just look like this.

117
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,550
We can save that and test it out in just a minute, but we're able to do that because we already built

118
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,860
the banner block in such a way that it knows what to use as a fallback, right.

119
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,980
A default placeholder value for the image.

120
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,740
Remember we told it to use the library hero image as a fallback.

121
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,900
So if we go to the homepage and refresh.

122
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,550
Right.

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,000
Perfect.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,620
It knows to use that as the fallback image that works for us in this banner block, because this fallback

125
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,050
image can sort of be the singular fallback.

126
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,320
But when it comes to our slideshow, we want to ship our theme in a way where this is already spelled

127
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
out for the user, right?

128
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,640
Where there's these three slides that start out with these text values and these images.

129
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,570
So we can't just provide sort of a singular default fallback image for a slide in general.

130
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,410
We need to actually provide specific instances, you know, of bread, dot jpeg and bus dot jpeg and

131
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,790
apples dot jpeg.

132
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,880
Now again, if you asked 100 different program.

133
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,640
To set up a solution for this, you'd probably get 100 different answers of how to do it.

134
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,490
But let me show you what I would do.
