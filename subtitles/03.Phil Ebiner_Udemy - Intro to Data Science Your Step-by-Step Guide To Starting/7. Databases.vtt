00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.100
It all go back to intro to data science and today's step is about databases.

2
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.640
So why are databases important.

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:22.990
Well let's have a look at our data science process as we discussed five steps and the step that is the

4
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.200
largest apart from present your findings that surprised that at the end.

5
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.450
Apart from that the largest step is prepare the data.

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.840
This one we here and that is that step involves getting data from somewhere and then dealing with it.

7
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.190
And so this is where databases come in.

8
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:51.490
The reason why we're including databases as a step in your getting started into the Science Guy is because

9
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.710
whilst we have statistics and some of his position he created two data sets databases will expands your

10
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.000
reach and allow you to get access to more data.

11
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.080
You can do data size without data.

12
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.030
And that's why databases are important.

13
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.160
So that's on one hand.

14
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.020
They allow you to access more data.

15
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.920
So when you're sourcing a data when you're talking to clients or to internal departments you know how

16
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.200
to deal with those databases and therefore you can get to that data but also databases are important

17
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.280
because they will allow you to perform your lyrics in a more structured manner or you'll be able to

18
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.060
put your data that you have rather than just keeping in Excel spreadsheets or in Says view files all

19
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.480
the time.

20
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.830
You'll actually be able to upload it to a database especially if you have a lot of data that is very

21
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.490
useful.

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.640
You upload it to a database you structure your own table structure your own schemas and you set everything

23
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.790
up so that everything is prepared for analysis and everything is very well organized and that and it's

24
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.470
also repeatable it's also orderable there's a trace of everything.

25
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.480
And that is the more professional approach to designs.

26
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.520
So in the end it's always good to know more and more and more about any of the topics and designs and

27
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600
move time.

28
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.720
If you study database or you encounter databases with time you will get better and better and better

29
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.270
than with them.

30
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.490
But at the same time even just to get started it's a good idea to understand even a little bit about

31
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.340
databases how they work and how to may be extracted.

32
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.220
That would be the first step how to extract data from that database.

33
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.900
All right and now let's quickly have a look at what kind of databases are popular these days.

34
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.620
So we're going to zoom our way here to D-B Highfill angels dot com a very popular Web site.

35
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.190
Well popular because I've used a lot of that today.

36
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.430
I think a lot of people use that as well in terms of ranking database management system.

37
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.210
So DBMSs stands for database management system.

38
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.790
If you look here you'll see that the reason why it's impossible to know everything.

39
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.620
Look at how many different database management systems exist that are just listed on this website.

40
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.530
There's like over 300 different systems.

41
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.740
Yeah.

42
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.370
And they're all rags here so the ones that we care about are usually the top four or five maybe you

43
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.760
know like depending on on how far you want to go and what what you're working with.

44
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.320
But the top four have are and have been for a very long time.

45
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.760
Oracle by Escurial Microsoft Asgill server and postgresql.

46
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.380
The interesting thing about them is that they're very similar.

47
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.150
All of them are very similar.

48
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.860
They all are a scale type databases.

49
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.280
Oracle's probably been around for the longest it's been since Aransas 1970s or something like that.

50
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.820
And that's why it's so high up because it's entrenched in a lot of companies a lot of large corporates

51
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.040
don't want to change.

52
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.300
And saying oracles are a good software.

53
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.880
I haven't used that personally but must be good software.

54
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.640
So many companies use it but it's been around for so long that's why it's up top there.

55
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.720
At the same time I've predominantly used Microsoft as you also are.

56
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.390
I've also worked with my secure all that's mostly for my own web sites I've studied postgresql and worked

57
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.570
it a little bit but it's also very useful and powerful as you all type of database.

58
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.370
So what I can say from my work of my asshole as Yasser and PASIAS skills they're all very similar.

59
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.440
They are nuances to them.

60
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.200
But if you know how to work with one you can very easily and quickly pick up hard to work either one

61
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.030
Mogo to be a bit different.

62
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.510
It's a no as well type of database.

63
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.290
It's used for a different type of storage so this is where we getting to something a bit different.

64
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.110
Then there's other tools as well like hive you know SAP HANA what else.

65
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.240
Some big data tools here at least in pollos will spark spark Escurial Greenplum.

66
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.660
That's big data tool and stuff like you do Hadoop was enabled Greenplum works at Purdue and things like

67
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.840
that.

68
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.990
So there's lots of different types you can get into.

69
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.830
But the starting point is one of these you know like postgresql Yul's free of free software a lot of

70
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.110
startups used postgresql.

71
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.300
So you know that's that's one way to go about things.

72
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.990
On the other hand Microsoft as you also are is very popular and has a large community of users that

73
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.060
can help you out.

74
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.110
Kind of like Tablo has a large community in space exhiliration.

75
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.030
Yeah those are the real tools.

76
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.030
And I'm just going to go back to the presentation quickly to recap on this.

77
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.520
So let's go past this recap.

78
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.270
Start by learning one of their skill database systems DBMS's.

79
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.210
Just pick one whichever you like.

80
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.380
I would you know if you if you don't always have that big audio of the postgresql or Microsoft's scale

81
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.540
server I personally prefer Microsoft skills are but problem is it doesn't really work on a Mac it's

82
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.910
hard to make it work there.

83
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.530
Yeah.

84
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.550
So as always you start with that.

85
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.330
That's good enough.

86
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.760
Don't jump into things like big data right away and more advanced things.

87
00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.290
Then there are unstructured data you know like things like Mongo D.B and other databases that can help

88
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.720
work with unstructured data and then we've got big data that's like that's the person you go through

89
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:45.010
but for now for this getting started into their signs even a basic understanding of how Asgill databases

90
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:51.550
work and what they're all about and maybe some basics of scripting languages that will really help you

91
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.930
get started as one of the first things that I learned when I was getting started at the word and really

92
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.200
really helped me as well.

93
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.500
Don't overdo it just as statistics are discussed there.

94
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.200
Basic simple start will be sufficient.

95
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.810
That is the skill.

96
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.570
Databases Okay.

97
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.630
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial.

98
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.000
I look for Unix then.

99
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.730
Until then enjoy the Edisons.
