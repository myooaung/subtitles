00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,890
Hello and welcome to this new section.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,280
Now introducing you to the cloud.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,290
The cloud is the solution.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,020
If you don't want to buy or have a powerful computer to execute and train your machinery models indeed

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,740
you can now get access to some powerful what we call virtual machines all around the world and you can

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,410
use them privately for your own private machining projects or a project to run your models.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:37,760
So that's an incredible tool to be aware of and that's why in the U.S. I'm going to introduce you to

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,450
the best cloud platforms that exist today on the Internet.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,290
And of course at the end I'll tell you which one is my recommendation.

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,390
Which one is my favorite and besides on this favorite unrecommended platform.

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,930
I'll show you how to get started and I'll give you a nice PBF report and nice guide which will guide

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,250
you through the process of setting up an account on this platform.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,020
All right so I'm going to introduce now to several platforms.

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,850
The order will not matter yet.

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,840
I'll just give you the list of the best platforms and in the end or in the next tutorial I'll give you

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,370
the best recommendation.

17
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,320
All right so let's start with the first one we're going to start with the most classic one and the most

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,150
popular one which is a AWOS Amazon Web Services.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,010
This one right here.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,120
First link Amazon Web services cloud computing services.

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:37,280
Let's click on this and here here you are on the page from which you can get access to that virtual

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,690
machines inside Amazon's and we call them actually the easy two instances which most of them are Linux

23
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,780
virtual machines.

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,590
So what exactly does this mean.

25
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,130
This means that you will be connected from your place to some powerful virtual machines far from you.

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,750
They can mean one state of the United States or in some other states.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,740
So they will be probably be far from you.

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,520
But it's as if you had this computer in front of you and you can use it to use on machine learning.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
So that's pretty amazing.

30
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,600
And Amazon Web services content is one of the best virtual machines.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,990
So here you can scroll down to see all the products they offer.

32
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,060
I told you about Amazon easy to which are the virtual servers in the cloud.

33
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,650
So that's the main and most widely used product of Amazon related to machine learning.

34
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,130
So we can already click on this Amazon too and there you go.

35
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,300
You can already get started here.

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,240
They have an amazing guide and they even offer you a free trial.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,520
Now you can try amazon too for free and the guide is amazing they show you step by step so that you

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,140
can really follow the process.

39
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,890
All right.

40
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,550
So that's the first one.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,020
And now the second one the second one I want to show you.

42
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,270
And again that's not in any order of preference.

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:01,560
The second one is the Google Cloud platform so we can just type Google Cloud and here we go.

44
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,960
That's this link here.

45
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,620
After get this thing here Google Cloud Platform Google Cloud computing hosting services.

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,460
All right so.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,500
Yes.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,650
Cookies OK.

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,920
Build what's next better software faster you can imagine that.

50
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,750
Google also has an amazing platform with some great virtual machines as well.

51
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,010
And if you're interested in checking out in more details we want to go to product and here you go.

52
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,110
You have all the products and services and among them you have the virtual machines on Google's infrastructure.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,520
So if we click on this here is where you can connect to a virtual machine in the Google Cloud platform

54
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,400
to build and train your machinery models.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,580
All right so that's another great one but that's not all.

56
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,120
We have another two.

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,890
The next one is Microsoft.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,030
As you were then you can just type cloud.

59
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,920
There you go.

60
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,700
Microsoft as you cloud this link again that's just an ad for Microsoft.

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,250
As for cloud computing platform and services definitely this one.

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,170
Here we go.

63
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,480
That's the third cloud platform.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,130
I highly recommend to check out.

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,170
No worries again I'll give you my best recommendation.

66
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:19,190
So your vision your cloud and as you can see Zaur has more than 100 services with great end to end tools

67
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,440
to make you successful.

68
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,220
OK.

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,360
They're hybrid intelligent trusted.

70
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,500
Definitely Microsoft is a great brand and you can feel safe using their cloud platform.

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
All right.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,070
And again if you're interested in checking out more details you just need to go to product here and

73
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,800
there you go.

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,090
You can find the virtual machines virtual machines provision Windows and Linux virtual machines in seconds.

75
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,000
You'll see that most of the virtual machines are offered on club platforms are either Linux or Windows

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,120
virtual machines but I can already give you my recommendation that it's better to use Linux virtual

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,940
machines in general when you do machine learning de-briefing or artificial intelligence Linux is more

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,410
recommended than Windows and even I'd say that Linux is the best operating to do some machine learning

79
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,910
or artificial intelligence.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,800
So at least whether you choose Amazon Google Cloud or Microsoft is all cloud.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,730
I recommend the Linux virtual machine instead of the windows virtual machines.

82
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,850
But there you go that's where you can connect to virtual machines on the Microsoft Zaur cloud platform.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,060
And here again you can start free.

84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,420
You have a nice guide that explains you well the process of setting up a virtual machine and use it.

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,260
Right.

86
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,720
So that's another great one and the next one the next one is of course you have heard of it.

87
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:46,430
This amazing brand and cloud the IBM cloud of course let's not forget about IBM you know what's on you

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,320
know what they do in terms of artificial intelligence.

89
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,820
That's pretty amazing.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,720
And they also have their great cloud platform.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,550
That's the first thing of course this is not just any cloud.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,970
This is the IBM cloud.

93
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,900
There we go.

94
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,970
This is one of the best clouds for sure.

95
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm not telling you yet which one is my favorite but this one is also really really good.

96
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,660
I'm not saying that I used all the cloud for a long time.

97
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,730
You know I didn't develop some machinery.

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,650
Applications for big projects on all of these clouds.

99
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,160
I just want to be honest on that.

100
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,910
The reason why I'm recommending you this is first of all I did a lot of research I experimented and

101
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,300
mostly I asked around you know I have a lot of people in my network who are data scientist and artificial

102
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,360
intelligence engineers or machinery scientists and they use a lot the clouds and ask them which one

103
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,990
is your favorite.

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,820
Which one do you use the most.

105
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,490
And that's how I could get a good idea on which are the best you know and also it's important to know

106
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,040
is that not everybody has the same favorite cloud platform so it's good that I introduce you to the

107
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,560
best so that you can see which one you feel best and also which one would fit the best to your project.

108
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,320
The way you work do you constraints and your goals.

109
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,420
No that depends.

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,740
But anyway the IBM cloud platform is another great one.

111
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,870
And again if you want to check it out in more detail you just into click products here and by scrolling

112
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,900
down you should find the cloud virtual servers.

113
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,840
There we go.

114
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,680
These are the ones you can just click on them and then not only have a great explanation on what's virtual

115
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,340
servers are but mostly you can sign up to do some great and powerful machine learning on their platform.

116
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,030
All right.

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,830
So another one among the best and now a final one which you might not have heard already but this is

118
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,370
also a great one that I must introduce you to.

119
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,870
And that's paper space paper space.

120
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,720
Another amazing cloud platform.

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
It is a great one.

122
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,500
You will see by the Web site that it's an innovative cloud you know built for the future powering next

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,220
generation applications from VFX to machine learning.

124
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,900
Here we go.

125
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,670
So if you want to do some powerful machine learning that requires some great computer resources you

126
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,130
can also consider paper space.

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,560
That's a great one.

128
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,600
So you can see again here we go.

129
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,970
Effortless infrastructure for machine learning and data science.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,770
This is really a great one actually if you want to start because it's one of the simplest to start.

131
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,840
And you know you can easily run your python modules or Jupiter notebooks on this cloud.

132
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,870
So it's to be highly considered.

133
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,290
All right.

134
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,400
And so if you're interested in checking it out.

135
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,810
Well again you need to go to product.

136
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,830
You know it's always the same you have to go to products and solutions to products and then you need

137
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,540
to go to core because that's where the servers are.

138
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,570
Then you can not only request a demo you can also get the guy which is a great guide and which will

139
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,530
definitely help you in the process of setting up paper space very easily and we can see that really

140
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,530
it's a recent Web site quite innovative quite user friendly as well.

141
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
Know right now it makes me want to try it again.

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,990
So there you go.

143
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,690
That's my last recommendation.

144
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,300
These four plow platforms are really amazing.

145
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,960
And now in the next toile I'll give you my favorite.

146
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,620
I'll show you again the way to connect to a virtual machine and mostly explain why to me this is the

147
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,490
best.

148
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,620
All right so check out all of them if you want.

149
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,870
And next to toile Let's find out.

150
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,980
My final recommendation.
