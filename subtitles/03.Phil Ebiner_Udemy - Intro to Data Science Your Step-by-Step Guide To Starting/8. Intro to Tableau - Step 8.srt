00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,780
Come back to the into is hands course and today is going to be a bit of an advance tutorial because

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,160
we're going to work with a different type of variable.

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,580
We want to work with one of these variables.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,740
So so far we've been working with dimensions and dimensions are actually categorical variables.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:32,110
These are type of variables are a yes no variables or they say a day of the week the you know the type

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,720
of education a person has the marital status like.

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,170
So it's basically words or categories you know day of week can be considered a category these old categories

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,080
months.

9
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,010
These are all different types of care.

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,540
So what category does a person fall into.

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:56,890
Whereas here we've got numerical variables which are different in the sense that you cannot consider

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,720
them categorical.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,440
There's a continuous numerical summary of a continuous numerical variables.

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,890
So for instance you've got H.

15
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,250
Right so a person you cannot just categorize MHG because they could be like three and a half years.

16
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:21,430
Or it could be 3.1 2 years old or a thing or three is probably a 30 and a half or 29 years and two months

17
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,370
in one day and things like that so it's not easy to bucket people among these.

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,000
And so let's see what happens if we give it a go.

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,290
Right.

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,400
So if we duplicate the sheet we take like age then we're going to be working.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,100
So we can just rename this.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,160
So we take age for instance and try to do the same thing you know first of all doesn't replace and even

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,530
if we try this something else comes up write something completely different and we can probably build

24
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,270
some interesting charts around this but we can apply the same exact approach right.

25
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:00,860
We cannot just say you know like just replace edge there simply because it's not a categorical variable.

26
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:07,050
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a categorical variable out of it through bins.

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,490
We're going to create like we're going to been age into groups.

28
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,900
And so you'll see how we do that.

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,920
Or if you just right click and you clearly click Create and you play create bins and then you say don't

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,860
worry about anything else we're going to go into detail you just say size of being five or so years.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,960
The bins are going to be five years each.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,790
Been there and now you can see a categorical variable here age being.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,720
And so by the way before we do this I want to show you that if you take your age bean and you put it

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:49,830
into columns and then you put number of records in two rows you'll see distribution you'll see how people

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,830
are distributed across that those across those bills.

36
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,660
And this is what I mean by bin's instead of having to if I go back to age of set of having If I just

37
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,990
take age like this into calls right can't really do much with it because even if I take a number of

38
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:15,540
records now you can't really do much here because it's just doing by the here it's building them up

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,140
because it's sure you've got now category's right you've got 15 years so that's 15 to 20 20 to 25 or

40
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:31,740
25 to 30 to 35 and so on and so each bin is represented by the lowest age in 35 to 40 45 40 45 and so

41
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,000
on and this shows you how many people are in each one and so you can presume control and copy it into

42
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,450
color it looks even nicer or you can add that to a label.

43
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,790
You know that puts a label on top looks really nice right.

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,640
You can create a really nice chair like this.

45
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,850
So you now know how you people distribute it or as we know you could add a great Tibo calculation and

46
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,200
you could do a percent of total.

47
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:03,180
So you know how many people fall into which group so 22 percent of your customers are between 30 and

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,040
35 as you can see by the way.

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,970
That's one of the powerful things about tabel.

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,600
How quickly did we create that because all Zeshan very quickly.

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
But that's not the goal here.

52
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,530
Right.

53
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,420
So our goal is analytics we tried to we can create distillations that's another thing we can be doing

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,750
in.

55
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,830
But for now we've set ourselves a challenge to explore age right.

56
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:35,370
And so now we have just been very confused into the outcome and bam all of a sudden you see how this

57
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,790
you know the whole thing works out with age which people are more likely to take up the offer which

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,900
as always remember the statistical significance thing you know this is not really this is not really

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,970
as well.

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,930
None of these are really significant.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,850
But here at the bottom you can see that kind of like something interesting happening.

62
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,130
Right.

63
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:03,530
So you can see that the Middle Ages you know between 35 and 50.

64
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,860
They are low or maybe 35 to 60 even though they have quite a low percentage of subscription.

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,110
But the younger people between 20 and 30 they have like a higher percentage rate.

66
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,520
So that's that's something interesting to observe.

67
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,990
Again these are data looks like statistically significant species one of two or three variables but

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,740
that could be something going on here like it's not to say that it definitely isn't.

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,070
They might be but we just cannot.

70
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,530
We don't have enough evidence to say that it is.

71
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,690
But already you can pull some information on from here I guess.

72
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,450
So yeah.

73
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,940
So that's kind of like one of the drawbacks of this visual method that unless it's statistically significant

74
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,620
you can really say much and that's where a machine learning comes to the rescue.

75
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,950
What I wanted to say Alice here is that you can also practice one have these bins if you like for other

76
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,150
variables for instance pede days could work.

77
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,330
Previous could work and you can find descriptions of it here but we're not going to delve into that

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,650
further.

79
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,480
We're going to stop here so you can continue exploring but I think this this illustrates the power of

80
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,000
visualization for data mining for driving insights.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,370
There are other ways you can apply viz. you can apply those elections to create beautiful charts and

82
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:36,560
beautiful graphs and so on them and present things in a very coherent manner.

83
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,510
And that's also very important in design.

84
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:45,450
But here at least we explored this first component I think it's very powerful.

85
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,630
Like it's not only just about creating charts and graphs but it's also about the data mining aspect

86
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,430
and it shows you that you do have a lot of power in your hands already.

87
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,730
Even not knowing complex that this takes mathematics that this Dickel learning machine learning or even

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,040
if all were all those things you really have quite a lot of power in your hands with simple tools like

89
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,810
tabel.

90
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,830
And on that note I hope you enjoy today's Statoil and I look forward to seeing them.

91
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,730
Until then enjoy Dennison's.
