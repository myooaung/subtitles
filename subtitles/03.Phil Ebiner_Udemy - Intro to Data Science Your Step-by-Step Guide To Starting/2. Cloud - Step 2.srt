00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:12,790
Hello welcome to my ultimate recommendation on which is to me the best platform you can use to build

2
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,930
and run and train your own miles.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,200
So if it's going to be Amazon Web Services is it going to be Google Cloud platform.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,990
Is it going to be Microsoft Azur cloud platform or is it going to be IBM cloud or eventually is it going

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,820
to be paper space.

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,670
So here we go.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,820
My final recommendation is Amazon Web Services.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,580
There we go.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,340
So some of you might not be surprised because indeed this is the most popular one the most used one.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,770
And that's not only because it's Amazon that's also because they have great advantages which I'm going

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,650
to explain and highlight in the next tutorial but first before we do this I just would like to remind

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,790
you where and how you can set up a virtual machine on a W-S.

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,800
I remind that I rather recommend the Linux virtual machine than a Windows virtual machine.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,320
You just need to go here to product and then Amazon to Amazon.

15
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,400
Easy to is exactly the virtual server on which you can be connected to a powerful computer far from

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,550
you.

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,950
But it's as if you had it in front of you because you can basically get into it and train your models

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,820
inside.

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,570
All right.

20
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,430
So it's very simple to get started with Amazon.

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,370
Easy to.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,800
You can actually click this thing here get started with Amazon easy to but before this I like to highlight

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,470
the fact that in order to be connected to a server you need to have an Amazon easy to account.

24
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,800
And of course ultimately when you use it permanently it will be a paid account.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,540
And I'll talk about the prices soon but the good news is that you can actually try amazon easy 2 for

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,390
free.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:03,750
It's AWOS free tire that includes 750 hours of Linux and Windows instances each month for one year.

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,630
So you see you can really experiment and see if you like it but when you start you can either click

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,280
this link.

30
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:17,880
If you don't have any account on Amazon to make sure you get one free AWOS account first and then you

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,390
can click this link get started with Amazon easy too and you will see they have an amazing guide that

32
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,440
walk you through step by step through the process of connecting to a virtual server or a virtual machine.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,500
So here I already have an account.

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,450
There we go.

35
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,740
I think that's the one.

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,410
All right.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,070
So here we are on AWOS.

38
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,900
The first thing you need to understand is that in order to connect to a virtual server or a virtual

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,290
machine which has got an Amazon easy to instance you need to create an instance first and that's why

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,490
here you have this option launch instance so you can just click it and you will have many virtual machines

41
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,820
you can select and you see that for each of them it is specified if it is free.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,460
So you're eligible.

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,660
And that's the one you must choose if you're still in the experimenting phase retire legible.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,210
So that's an example of one.

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,440
But no worries if you see many of them you might be wondering right now which one I should choose.

46
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,630
Well no worries because the quick start guide which is actually right here getting started guide will

47
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,140
explain step by step which one you must choose to start.

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,190
So they will tell you exactly the one.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,260
And then inside this one they will guide you step by step and you can see actually the steps here.

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,770
Step one launch an instance step to connect your instance which is exactly what I was talking about

51
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,830
you know connecting to a virtual machine virtual server and then step three you need to clean up your

52
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,750
instance and then you have some next steps.

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,980
But let me show you here the main steps the steps on how to get started with Amazon easy to Linux instances.

54
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,040
Perfect.

55
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,160
So here you have an overview of how all this works.

56
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,160
You have the prerequisite of course which is just setting up with Amazon easy to remember.

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,360
On one of the prettiest pages you know right after I clicked Amazon is to.

58
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,780
Well we had two links.

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,450
First getting started and second get to retire in order to set up with Amazon easy.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,510
Well that's just a prerequisite.

61
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,680
Make sure you set up with Amazon.

62
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,670
Easy to write and then you have the different steps.

63
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,440
Step one is to launch an instance and here's you can see it is explained in great details on how you

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,620
should do it for us.

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,830
Open the Amazon easy to con..

66
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,790
Then from the console dashboard you will see launch instance that's exactly what we did before.

67
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,940
Remember this launch instance but near.

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,310
That's what you must do.

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,630
And then you need to choose an Amazon machine image.

70
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,460
Am I.

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,620
So I'll show you this.

72
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,920
If we click on launch instance here.

73
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,550
Well these are Amazon machine images and they tell you as I said the one you must click to get started

74
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,090
with.

75
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,240
Which is this one's the HD m edition of the Amazon.

76
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,200
Am I.

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,880
And indeed it is marked as Freet eligible.

78
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,040
So let's do this AGM this one.

79
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,270
So that's the first one.

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,790
HVM and it is indeed Freespire eligible.

81
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,080
So we click on select.

82
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,580
I guess that's what they say.

83
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,830
And then on this next page choose an instance type you need to select the T-2 that micro type.

84
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,040
So let's do this.

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,190
You see I'm just following step by step what they explain and really won't encounter any issue.

86
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,600
Everything is well-made on AWOS.

87
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,730
That's one of the reasons why it is my highest recommendation.

88
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,090
There is no issue.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,350
It's very easy.

90
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,460
And so there we go here that's what ask to select T-2 that micro free are eligible.

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,510
That's the reason.

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:48,110
So make sure it's like this but I think it's selected by default and then they ask to click review and

93
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,890
lunch.

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,290
If I'm not mistaken Yes that's right.

95
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,150
Step up step five.

96
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,640
Review and lunch.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,530
So let's do this review and lunch.

98
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:57,950
All right.

99
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,330
So we are connected to the right instance tied to that micro we're using one virtual C.P. use with one

100
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,580
gigabyte of memory.

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Nor is the virtual machines you'll use for your machine or will be much more powerful but here that

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
of course because it is the free are eligible.

103
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,820
Am I to get started.

104
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,830
All right.

105
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,530
So then you need to click on lunch.

106
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,040
Let's check that.

107
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,680
It's the next step.

108
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes indeed.

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,770
And they give us more details on the review instance launch page that hit this page here review instance

110
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,440
launch.

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:39,500
Well what we need to do is under security groups security groups here the wizard created and selected

112
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:46,010
a security group for us we can use the security group or alternatively we can select the security group

113
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,510
which we created when getting up using the following steps.

114
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,230
The steps are here but we're going to use this selected security group here that will do it.

115
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,790
No need to get in too much advanced details now and then we just need to click on launch right here

116
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:10,020
on this review instance launch page let's do this launch and now we have this window opening.

117
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,700
And again they tell us in great detail what we have to do.

118
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,270
No room for any issue.

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,030
We just need to choose or create a keep there.

120
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,850
So you will get your key pair of public key and private key when setting up your insitu instance.

121
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,440
Make sure you keep that somewhere.

122
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,850
And here it will automatically select your key pair and then you can just click launch instances and

123
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,660
there we go.

124
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:40,190
We are connecting to our instances are instances are now launching and then you can just follow the

125
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:46,490
next steps and then we can move on to step to connect to your instance.

126
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,860
All right so I just wanted to guide you a little bit do a little bit with you the steps on how to connect

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,800
to an instance then you just need to follow the next steps.

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,130
And remember as a bonus of course I'll give you a nice and well made practical PDAF handbook on how

129
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,530
to connect your instance and get familiar with it.

130
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,990
All right.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,640
And now we're going to move onto the next toile where I'll explain the main reasons and the main benefits

132
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,180
that make this Amazon Web services cloud platform the first choice.

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,970
I'll explain that in great detail in the next tutorial.

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,720
And until then and data science on the cloud.
