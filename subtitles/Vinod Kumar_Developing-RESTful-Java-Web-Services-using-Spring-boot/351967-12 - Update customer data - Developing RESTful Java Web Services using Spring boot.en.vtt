00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
as part of the crowd operations.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.080
Let's also provide update to our rest.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.700
Controller.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.150
Let's goto our controller here.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:17.130
I'm gonna add a function here that returns response entity off customer as a off stage

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.920
customer.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.330
Now,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.380
as convention,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.070
we have to receive the ivy off the customer for whom we want to make changes on the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.340
customer data.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.750
It's them.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.400
It is possible that I may be different than the customers.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.870
I d.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.710
We have to discard the customers,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.200
I d and then use this for optation.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.490
So the first thing I will be doing here is testimony.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.490
Door said I'd be off i d.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.950
And then I'll say your reporter save customer.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.480
And if everything is okay,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.610
we just want toe written this one.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.670
What if something goes wrong?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.720
There'll be an exception,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.220
and that exception will be written as state a score 500 with a custom error message from

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.880
Springboard.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.240
Now,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.790
as far as the mapping is concerned,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480
we have to say here after it put mapping,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.830
we also have to say that this comes from a part variable this come from the request body.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.210
So we say here at the ridge path variable,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.950
whose name is gonna be idee and this is gonna be from Request Body.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.610
And since we said that it's supposed to come from part variable,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.100
we also have to say you're slash curly bracket.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.150
I d like this.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.260
So when you're making a request,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.600
you should say slash ap slash customers slash some i d.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.860
And that idea will be map to tow this.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.900
Plus the Baylor will be converted into a customer object and will be received over here.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.950
We're using the same function for save but distant.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.960
There is an I D.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.150
So because of which is going to do an update if possible.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.970
And if there is any other,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.960
this will be reporting status code 500 now.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.250
First,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.110
let's go and get one of the customer.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.720
Let's get the customer whose data is safe.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.650
45.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.740
This is the data on.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.700
Let's copy this on.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.690
Then make a put request.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.330
Let's go to the body.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.440
You're wrong.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.750
And then I choose Jason and business.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.980
Now,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.860
even if you give some different idea here,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.660
it doesn't matter because this is an idea that would be considered for update.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.160
Of course,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.380
the rest of the later will be there Let's change this from the phone number ending with

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.380
7588 toe 0000 Some changes.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.650
Let's go and make the email to be example dot com.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.550
But it's also make this as that's a Dallas on Texas.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.160
So now I can click on the send,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.810
so see that the data has been updated,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.650
its going chicken or where the response and you can see that the response came back after

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.790
it has been updated.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.300
So let's go also two very fine in the BB.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.790
Let's look for 45 then say Iran,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.750
and you'll see that the phone number and with 0000 city has been changed.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.360
State has been changed.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.290
The email is now activated.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.360
Example dot coms,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.670
everything has been updated.
