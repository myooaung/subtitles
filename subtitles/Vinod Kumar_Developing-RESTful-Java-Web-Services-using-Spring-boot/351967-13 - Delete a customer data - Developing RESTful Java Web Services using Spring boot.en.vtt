00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's do delete operation first,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.100
you can see that I have the customer whose ideas?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.770
45.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.070
So I click the run button.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.250
I see the data.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.930
Let's go back at a new function year,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.650
which is supposed to return their deleted customer data.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.750
Ansel's a response entity off customer type.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.850
It's called it as delete customer.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.010
We want to take the I d from the part really well.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.280
So I can actually copy this part and then based over here And then,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.870
of course,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.750
we have toe,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.180
sir,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.150
For this customer,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.910
if the customer is not form,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.210
we may want toe respond with 404 So let's do that.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.290
We had done that earlier here,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.690
so we can say that we want to get this customer so in a copy and paste the same thing.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.870
So we got the customer.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.950
But what if there isn't enter so the customer doesn't exist?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.050
So I put the try catch blocks under threat play catch Andi based or here.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.720
So if there is an exception,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.220
I'm gonna say you're that there is a for not for so I cannot delete this because the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.780
customer doesn't exist,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.740
so I can see that customer the nexus.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.150
But if the customer exists,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.950
I want to delete that first by doing a report dot did it?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.540
And then I supply either lead by idea or dilator entity.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.740
It's such like and say,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.860
See one and then I'll say your return response entity don't okay and then supply.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.680
See one Because see,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.130
one happens to be the data that we deleted.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880
So as far as the mapping is concerned,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.070
it is like put mapping.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.900
But there is no request body,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.680
but we just started,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.950
say,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.810
after it village mapping and then with a slash idea,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.090
because we have to say whose record we want to do it.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.470
So that's another save.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.890
This spring Boot is restarting the application.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.510
Let's go back to the browser,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.460
Andi.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.600
Check once again.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.750
So I'm gonna say Select.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.940
Start from customers where Ideas 45.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.860
So we get the later let's go back to a postman.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.110
Now make the delete request.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.570
This time on Believed Request doesn't care about the body.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.640
There's no need off body,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.780
so I can remove that.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.780
So there's a deal.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.070
It 777 70 p a customer's 45.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.830
So I click on send of course it's gonna delete on.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.440
I would get the data back,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.520
but if I tried to send it again,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.240
you can see it's gonna be a four,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.730
not four,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.130
because there's no data.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.510
So I click on Send.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.170
Ah,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.790
now I see it is for not for because this record is not there in the database anymore.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.260
It's very find it by going to the database and click on the run button here and you see

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.160
that no rose phone for I D 45.
