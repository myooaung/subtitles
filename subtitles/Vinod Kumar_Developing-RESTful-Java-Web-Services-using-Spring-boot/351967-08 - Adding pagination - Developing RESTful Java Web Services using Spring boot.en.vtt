00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
now that we have a list off 1000 customers,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.980
quite often,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.590
we don't want all the customers in the database,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.650
because what if I have a 1,000,000 records off test Imus Now?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.470
You don't want to send all 1,000,000 records at one sharp,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.080
but human,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.650
1% a chunk off there.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.680
For example,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.110
when a search anything in Google,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.170
Google may give you probably 20 or 50 reports at the first pitch.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.770
And then,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.210
if you want,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.550
you can go to the next page and so on and so forth somewhere I should be able to say that.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.700
Hey,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.070
give me the page number one something like this by typing question Mark underscore.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.390
Page equals to one.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.620
So this way I should get only the first page record where the first,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.410
which may consist off 10 reports,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.170
are 20 records,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200
something that we can assume as default.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.850
So to do that,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.270
I can go back over here toe clips and then change our customer repository.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.820
Instead of extending credit repository,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.680
we can extend a subtype of card,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.230
repository,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.670
card,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.730
paging and starting repository,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.460
So let's go out that year.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.440
Beijing and starting repository save this.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.370
I have all the functions But in addition,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.820
we also have a couple of extra features.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.650
So if you go back over here on the refresh here,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.220
I still see my 1000 records.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.800
Of course,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.280
now I have a day off processing this page.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.980
Number one.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.990
Now the underscore page is a convention that you say that the page number is one.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.560
Similarly,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.420
if you want to say the size of the pages 20 for example,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.940
you may say 1% underscore.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.550
Limit equals to 20.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.190
So these are not any keywords.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.070
It's your choice.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.600
If you want to change this from Underscore page,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.760
toe paid size and be yell,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.530
etcetera.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.880
It's totally up to you.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
I'm going to stick with underscore Page underscored Limit for two parameters.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.560
Now,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.110
if I don't mention anyone off them,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.770
it should be assumed.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.440
For example,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810
if I don't mention any perimeters at all,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.070
it should be assumed that I'm looking for page number one.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.340
So to do this,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.510
let's go back to our core in our rest Controller,

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.930
we're going to see here something like this.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.230
So we're gonna add a couple of variables that they individual beige and then as a into your

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.200
size,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.020
if page numb and paid says have been supplied.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.850
I can supply those two information over here.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.630
Now,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.740
if you look at the find all parameters,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.060
there is a sword object,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.380
I reckon,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.880
supply.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.040
There is an terrible ideas I can supply.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.460
And there is also Page Herbal I can supply.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.610
So Page Herbal is an interface that has a couple of options.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.850
So let's see how we can clear that.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.840
So I'm going to see your payable B equals two,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.890
which means information about the page ability such as page number and paid size,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.210
is gonna come from page request.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.980
Don't off.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.850
I can supply the page numb and obss ites.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.080
So I'm gonna say your page number.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.800
And then there's a big states on this page.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.080
Herbal needs to be imported from spring framework.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.450
So let's do that.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.950
And then I can say find all off key.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.200
So we do have now a page herbal option.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.690
But only one problem is that we did not tell spring where to look for values for this page

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.580
name and paid size.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.750
Now,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.610
if you remember,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.160
we used our we start off using underscore page on underscore Limit.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.640
So to do that,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.950
we may have to say here something like I put it Request para meter on the perimeter Name

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.150
happens to be underscore Page and then I can say if it is not supplied,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.770
default value is one.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.670
And that's what actually we have to say for patient.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.020
And then similarly,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.830
I can give here also an option saying that it is supposed to be underscore limit and the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.700
default value happens to be 10.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.500
So in Calif,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.920
you don't supply the limit will assume that it's gonna be default now,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.360
once month thing here Is that for us,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.550
the page number one means that we want to start from the record number one.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.330
But the page request trips.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.310
The dice page number do so because the index of the page start from zero.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.250
So we may want to specify here that page nom minus one because we want to say when you want

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.140
page number one,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.640
we want to say you're zero.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.080
So as soon as we done with this,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.940
let's save it.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.610
Let's go back here and not specify any additional parameters and then refresh.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.030
I should see a smaller chunk here now,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.270
and you can see that it start from page number one.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.280
So hands I d number one to the last one,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.140
which would be the I.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.020
D Number 10 but we also get a lot of additional information.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.260
But I'm only interested in the area of detente safe.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.990
That is the case you might have to say.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.470
Here,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.590
Find out,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.440
Dart,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.990
get content.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.620
And that gives me a list off customers only.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.220
So when I go back here now,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.990
when I refresh there,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.340
you can see that we get a plain and simple a day off data from 1 to 10.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.790
If you want the second page,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.660
you can always a question more underscored page number equals two,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.900
and you can see we get it from 11 to 20 and so on and so forth.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.150
So if I said page number 33 we got 321 onwards up to 330.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.860
That's how we're getting the results.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.350
Of course,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.670
we can also check their head.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.260
Poor page.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.670
I want 20 reports,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.830
not 10.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.690
So I can say 1% underscore.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.330
Limit equals to 20 or 25.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.290
Whatever that you feel right now,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.550
you can see I got 20 records starting from 641
