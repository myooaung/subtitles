00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
another beer ableto get multiple records are a single record.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.850
Let's see how we can do adding in your card.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.320
So do that.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
Let's go Dollar application customer restaurant Roller.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.890
Let's add a new function here for Blake response in today Off caution mark on a new

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.430
customer we received a customer object and then as a report out,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.610
save testimony.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.970
No,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.550
this actually acts the data that is coming from the perimeter into the database

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.630
automatically because an assumption here is the customer ideas now and that customer object

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.800
will be inserted into the database.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.440
The newly generated I d will be automatically set to this customer And then I can simply

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.250
say here,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:04.140
But I've done the response entity Don't okay with the customer object like this.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.550
And we have to argue at the rate forced mapping to say that any request for slash ap slash

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.050
customers with the http method called post should be handled by this particular function.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.940
Now the question is,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.780
how can spring give me a customer object woken as a user supplied the customer object.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.270
Now,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.300
if you come toe postman and choose a post my per for slash ap slash customers,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.560
you can see that there is an option here called Body and this is going on.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.130
Request Body or Taylor on You can supply a form data with name value pairs.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.290
Similarly,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.050
www for mural in Portage.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.760
Then there is a wrong,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.390
and then you can choose the type off text to be Jason or XML or plain text.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.900
So we are sending the actual customer later in Jason Format.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.700
But that's a request body,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.360
so we have to 10 spring that hate their data coming from the request body should be

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.750
converted into a customer objective possible,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.010
and then that customer object is now taken on added to the database To do so.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.340
All I have to do is tow right at the rate requests.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.840
Body Onda.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.070
Now spring knows we're to look for a customer details when a poster questions may.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.850
Now let's give it a try by going back over here,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.110
we're sending a post request toe local news Double seven double seven slash CBs slash

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.490
customers and that's what.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.950
Actually this is map to toe a B a customer's post mapping,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.030
but we have to send the body.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.260
I'm gonna send a body here that contains name off the customer.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.350
Let's at my name.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.550
That's a female.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.230
We don't have to be.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.430
No,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.050
not cool.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.920
That's a phone number.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:17.150
Gender City Bangle in Attica on a country is India.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.030
Now I'll have to do is to send this.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.070
Not that I'm not sending idee,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.230
but the response should be the same details with the newly generated I D.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.760
So let's click on the send button and see everything is okay.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.100
And as you can see that I.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.270
D.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.180
1001 has been gendered it.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.150
And that response is 200.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.250
All I have to do waas toe read the data from the request body and saving to the reader base

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.650
and then send the same customer back.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.340
So if I go back to the browser where my database I have access to here,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.550
so let's go connect,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.550
and then I can even check Select star from customers with Ivy close to 1001.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.030
Click the run button.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.460
I should see the same data that I have sent from Postman.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.570
It has been added successfully as well
