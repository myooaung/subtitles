00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.930
Now that we got the data,

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.230
let's use an RGB Amos called hits two deliveries so you can go toe heads to rid of its dot

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.530
com and then look for its download options.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.430
The car in question is wondered for that one double lane,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.680
which somehow seem to have some issues.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.450
So let's not download this one.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.030
But let's go toe all downloads and then you can see it is the last to stable version

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.100
happens to be wonder for the 1 97 Now,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.830
if you're on Windows,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.730
you can download the Windows installer with simply installs a folder on your computer.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.790
Ultimately,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630
you can download platform independent sit file,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.890
which I have already downloaded and unzipped in my home directory.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.350
So if you happen to see here under my home directory,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.870
I have a folder here called H two and the H toe has a BIN directory hits to dash wondered

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.130
for 0.1 $97 jar.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:08.160
They got a such file that you can use in mac or leaners yourself hit student bad for

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.250
windows Now on windows.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.870
You can simply double click this file,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.350
and you should see that the server will be started as well as a client application will

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.160
open in a browser on Mac or leaners.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
You can just copy the part off the fight by going toe services,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.750
copy pot and then open it.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.390
Don't you know?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.970
And then based this press enter,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.750
you can see that the Sarwar started on on the menu bar.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.280
You consider the Nikon on Windows,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.450
you will see the similar icon on a notification area at the bottom.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.850
Right.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.760
The browser that came up is basically a client application that allows us to connect to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.870
this particular server.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.890
In case if you happen to close this,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.270
you can always get this back from this icon,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.720
then click on its to console.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.690
Now,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.330
if you're running this for the first time,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.270
you may see something called Generate Age toe embedded and the options would be a little

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.280
bit different over here.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.080
So make sure that your selected generate cage to Sarah.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.360
Here you can give some custom name and click on the save button on this name will appear in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.780
the job.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.040
Done.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.940
The driver plus happens to be our door heads.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.850
Tudor Trevor.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.120
No change over there.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.230
The GBC Orel has the server and climb protocol the central location and then you have a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.300
name off the levy,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.170
which is called test by default.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.940
I can change this to a new DB car.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.670
Spring boat that's training.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930
And then click the best connection to see if everything is OK.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.940
You may notice that the user name s a and password.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.950
A blank password is default.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.720
If you want,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.800
you can change that and then click the connect button on.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.370
Then you will be taken into the database.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.340
Now,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.200
here you can type in command such as create older drop,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.750
select etcetera.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.060
But since we already have got the data in an Eskil file,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.280
we have to take the command around,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.600
stripped from in single courts gave the part to the particular file.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.250
In my case,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.590
I don't know did that and kept in my workspace directory.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.850
So I'll goto the workspace location and this is a file.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.540
Once again,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.110
I will copy the part off the fight,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.040
then come back over here.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.500
Fish,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.550
that course complete.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.000
If I click on the run button here now it's gonna execute that man.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.920
And if there is no problem,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.950
it will give you some kind of update count,

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.870
you can click the clear button and then look at the customer's.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.770
Here I have all the fields Clicking on the customers will bring me a select start from

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.530
customers.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.940
Trick the run button,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.960
and I should be able to see all the customers that I have added through marco dot com.
