WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
The first thing that we will do is tow with it.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.290
Start Springboro your weapons which takes us toe spring initialize er application.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.150
Here we can configure our project such as Do we want to use Maimon Project or a cradle

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.750
project?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.200
I would like to use May when Posit you can court spring Good using job Ocotlan are groovy.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.740
I would choose Java in the spring ball.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.910
Washington salvages stood out one about seven and you can give here your project Details

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.430
such as?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.470
What is the group?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.910
Buy the artifact Charity.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.670
Let me give it us court,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.450
are we not?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.790
And spring boat Devil.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.870
There are a few options that you can explore such as What is the description?

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.850
Was the package name going to be?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.790
Is it a job project or a war?

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.720
Most of the time,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.830
we would be using springboard for creating micro services or where baby s.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.120
So it's gonna be tested.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.950
Jar find standard on project the Washington jama.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.290
I would leave it to the people,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.710
which is eight at this time.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.680
And then you can add some dependence is by either typing here if you know what you're

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.370
looking for,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.180
such as Web security JP actuator,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.130
Deftones etcetera.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.140
As indicated over here are you can click on the list here and chose some off there for this

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.750
project.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.220
I will only add one single dependency on as and when we need,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.790
we will are more so I'm just like,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.170
well,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.450
and select the spring Web starter at this to our list.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.640
Now we condone look,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.680
the entire zip file consisting off the main one project all I can explore individual fights

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.350
and choose whatever that I want.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350
So I choose to go with this.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.760
Explored the project option that will show me the Ponder XML and any other related files.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.810
I simply have to click the copy button that copies the content off Ponder XML to our

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.980
Clipper and then Al Gore a kids.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.380
I have only opened eclipse in a brand new workspace.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.320
As you can see,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.700
there is nothing over here.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.550
I will simply create a new May 1 project Check on this check mark that says Create a simple

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.150
project.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.650
Next,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.060
I need a group idea Escort.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.800
Are we not artifact Early as spring boat?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.550
That's General.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.550
I leave the washing as 001 snap shirt and packaging US job Click finish To come out of this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:43.570
Here is the project that God created which doesn't have anything except a bomb dot xml I

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.740
opened upon the wreck salmon Replace that with the wonderfully copied from spring

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.420
initialize er as soon as the same,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.900
it eclipse will start downloading all the jars from the dependency list.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
This may take a while in case if you're doing this for the first time.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.940
In my case,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.260
it has already done because I have worked on this kind of examples earlier.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.850
So all the maven dependencies have come to my project right now.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.450
But you may see that there are a couple of errors over here that says Maimon configuration

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.580
problem number one.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.750
It is unknown so we can ignore this.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.560
The 2nd 1 says Project configuration is not up to date with Ponder XML and select May 1

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.940
update project from the project Context Mental are used Quick fix All we have to do is tow

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.950
kicked the project,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.500
go to May 1 a big project and said OK,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.480
and there's they're gone.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.970
Let's close this.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.830
Create a new gel a class that actor,

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.480
that starting point for our application So I'm gonna right click on this SRC main job New

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.250
to us.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.840
I'll get the package as quarter,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.350
you know,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.590
on the name off the class happens to be application.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.440
You can give any name you want.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.250
I just wanted to give application.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.800
The application is simply going to have one main function.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:27.140
And I'm gonna say your spring application Doctor on and then I supply the application Dark

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.960
class itself.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.160
One last thing I have to do is tow Say that this is a springboard project by adding an

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.590
impatient at the rate spring boot application.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.390
Save this.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.350
And now I can run the court when it on this program,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.360
spring will run an internal down catch server on blood support.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.840
Eijiro,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.350
eijiro.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.060
In my case,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.670
however,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.850
8080 has been used by Jenkins.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.930
As you can see you,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.310
it has been used by Jenkins.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.630
So I have two options.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.500
Either stop Jenkins at Agia Eijiro.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.730
And although this spring application to run on 800 all I can ask spring to use a different

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.400
port number.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.220
This can be done by adding a properties file to our resources section.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.740
So I'm gonna are here file by going toe.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:27.910
New other gender flight Let's name this as application start properties.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.590
Now these properties can be configured either using application that properties are

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.250
application,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.400
or why am L or application or family fire for this demo?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.950
I will stick with application dot properties,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.100
and all I have to do is to say,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.390
Sir,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.190
we're not fourth equals Toe A pulled off my choice.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.650
Let's give us 7777 I saved this close this application that properties right click on this

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.040
file,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.100
but on that's Joe application at center.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.900
They do that on the pencil.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.450
You can see that it comes up with lots off locks that includes logs from dumb.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:19.350
Get saying that Tom get started at Port number 777 Started application in 5.903 seconds,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.100
and as you can see that the application is still running,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.320
it is not quit.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.710
It's not dominated.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.150
I can forcefully terminate them over here.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.630
But if I want,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:37.510
I can go to a brother and access this local host Holland 7777 and then press enter and we

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.490
get some white label error.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.170
But of course this is an output coming from our project that it hurts,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.460
um,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.550
greeting message over here instead of this era page.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:55.570
So let's go back to our core and ready function your core public string Say hello,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.680
which returns a hello world message.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:09.200
But if I want this particular function toe respond toe this brother request we have to add

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040
to annotations here number one We have to say that this the rest full controller by typing

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.060
a marriage arrest controller And then we have toe other mapping to this particular function

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.060
,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:30.440
saying that whenever the user makes a get request for local 777 we want to actually

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.090
restaurant from here so that can be done by typing at marriage Gift mapping.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.860
Save this.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.890
No,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:44.020
not that the previously done program has to be stopped if I want to run this again.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.250
So I have stopped it.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.060
Right?

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.790
Click on this program run as Gela application.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:55.550
A similar output comes just like the previous one.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:03.460
And now I can come back to the browser and refreshed the same and we should see here.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:03.810
Hello.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.050
World message came up.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.550
Now if I want to change the message,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.230
I can change this.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.090
But then again.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.040
I have to click the stop button and then run the program again.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.260
Now,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.950
since we want to develop Web services quickly,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:24.490
this can be a herd of So what we can do now is I can stop this for a minute and then other

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.340
dependency from spring initialize er or as deaf tools.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.150
So all I have to do is tow at the dentals as dependencies,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.520
get the new Bondevik salmon,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.110
and then replace the current ponder XML with the new content.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:52.300
Save it and you will see that Eclipse is downloading the new abortion on its updated.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.080
Now,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:03.990
I can actually run this project once and then change the content whenever I want.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.650
And every time there is something changed and the file has been saved,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.850
the fight gets combine on automatically.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.220
Dentals will reload this once again.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.190
For example,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.390
instead of follower,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.080
I can say hello,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.250
string boot savage and you can see that there is a reloading off the server.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.070
I go back to the browser,

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.350
refresh this once again and you'll see that it is hollow string boat again.
