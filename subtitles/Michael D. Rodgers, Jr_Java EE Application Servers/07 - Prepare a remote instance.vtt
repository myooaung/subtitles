00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] We just set up a cluster of Payara Servers

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.090
but there are a few issues in setting up a cluster

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.030
across two or more physical machines.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.000
In this video we'll be using the SSH capabilities built in

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.040
to Payara which is problematic for Windows users.

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.080
However, Payara also has a different communication facility

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.090
for Windows machines using DCOM.

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.000
We will only be focusing on SSH for this in the next video.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.010
If you're interested in using DCOM,

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.070
please use the link found here.

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.030
For Mac users we want to have Homebrew installed.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.000
Brew's a package manager that makes it easier

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.010
in going foward with our install, Vagrant.

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.030
Please run the following commands,

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.000
brew cask install

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.070
virtualbox.

17
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.050
Then type, brew cask

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.020
install vagrant.

19
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.020
And finally, type, brew cask

20
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.070
install vagrant-manager.

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.080
Vagrant is, as their website points out,

22
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.070
a tool for building and managing virtual machine

23
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.020
environments in a single workflow.

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.080
Now, we'll be using Vagrant in this setup

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.040
to run a VirtualBox VM of Linux

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.050
for one of our Payara cluster instances to run on.

27
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.000
With Vagrant installed from the terminal

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.070
type, vagrant init

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.040
generic/oracle7, hit Enter.

30
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.070
There are many different VMs we could use like

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.020
Red Hat, CentOS, Ubuntu, or even Windows.

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.070
If you look at the directory you ran,

33
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.010
the vagrant init command you'll see a Vagrant file.

34
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.030
There can only be one Vagrant file in a directory,

35
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.030
and this is where the VM will live.

36
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.090
Next, we'll type, vagrant up,

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.040
and hit Enter.

38
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.090
This may take a few minutes as the VM instance

39
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.030
is pulled down and started.

40
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.090
At this point, we're going to type,

41
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.030
command, space, and in the spotlight search

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.080
we'll type virtualBox, and hit Enter.

43
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.090
As you can see, our Oracle7 instance is running.

44
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.080
What we'll do, is we'll click Show,

45
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
and these annoying messages, if you click,

46
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.070
Do not show this message again, and click Capture.

47
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.010
If you need to remove your mouse

48
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.080
from the VirtualBox instance hit the left command key

49
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
and that will free your mouse.

50
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.050
The login is, vagrant, and the password is, vagrant.

51
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.030
From here, we're going to validate

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.040
that we have a stabile internet connection,

53
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.090
and we're connected.

54
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.020
Sending a ping to 8.8.8 ensures

55
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.090
that we can communicate with the world.

56
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.070
By the way 8.8.8.8 is Google's main DNS address,

57
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.050
so it's a good test.

58
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.070
From here, hit your command key to re-free your mouse.

59
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.040
Click back on your VirtualBox Manager, go to Settings,

60
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.050
then Network, and we're going to change the network setting

61
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.010
to Bridged Adapter.

62
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.040
And the name of the adapter is Ethernet 1.

63
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.080
Click Advanced, Allow All, and then OK.

64
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.060
What the bridged adapter does

65
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.070
is make the IP address similar

66
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.070
to the IP address that's running on the local box.

67
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.040
We may need to restart the Oracle7 VirtualBox instance.

68
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.000
As we can see, it's resetting the adapter.

69
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.070
If we type, Ifcongfig,

70
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.060
the IP address is 10.35.3.112.

71
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.080
Let's validate this and see if it's

72
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.080
in the same range as our host machine.

73
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.050
Take your mouse off, switch to your terminal window,

74
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.040
and at this point you may see an error message on the box.

75
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.090
Just ignore the error message for now.

76
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.010
Type, ifconfig, hit Enter, we'll scroll up,

77
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.070
and we can validate that our IP address

78
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.000
of our local host is 10.35.3.15, we'll copy that.

79
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.090
Go back to our VirtualBox Linux instance, type, ping,

80
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.090
paste in 10.35.3.15

81
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.040
and hit Enter.

82
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.000
This validates that we can ping our local IP address

83
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.020
which is important in order

84
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.080
for the Payara instance to communicate.

85
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.040
Next, let's validate that we can SSH into this terminal.

86
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.050
Bring up our terminal window again.

87
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.010
We'll type, ssh

88
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.010
vagrant@10.35

89
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.030
.3.112, hit Enter.

90
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.050
Say Yes, it asks for the password, vagrant,

91
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.090
hit Enter.

92
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.090
We're now SSH'd into our local Linux instance.

93
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.070
At this point we have a few more things we have to do

94
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.040
to prepare the remote Payara Server.

95
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.080
First, we'll type,

96
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.020
sudo yum update.

97
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.010
Yum is a package manager similar to Brew.

98
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:04.020
For each confirmation, please click Y, and hit Enter.

99
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.060
With it completed, let's type, java -version, hit Enter.

100
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.050
This tells us that Java's not installed.

101
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.000
Remember, that our Payara instance can only use Java 1.8,

102
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.050
so we're going to type,

103
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.030
sudo yum install

104
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.080
java-1.8.0

105
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.030
- openjdk,

106
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:40.010
and hit Enter, say Yes.

107
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.060
Our final step is to also install the JDK develop.

108
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.080
We'll type, sudo yum install

109
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.060
java-1.8.0

110
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.030
- openjdk

111
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.010
- devel,

112
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.070
hit Enter, click Yes, and we're complete.

113
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.040
Now, if we type, java -version,

114
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.020
we see our Java version.

115
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.040
If we type, javac -version, we see our compiler.

116
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.010
Last few things we have to do to prepare our Linux instance

117
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.010
to work with Payara is to adjust the firewall.

118
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.090
Now, your Linux admin can help adjust the ports needed

119
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.000
by Payara, and I recommend them doing this.

120
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
For us, all we're going to be doing

121
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is turn off the firewall,

122
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.090
which you don't want to do in production,

123
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.020
but if we don't configure the firewalls, or turn it off,

124
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.040
this will lead to more problems as we move foward.

125
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.000
The command to do this is,

126
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.020
sudo systemctl

127
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.020
stop firewalld,

128
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.060
hit Enter, sudo systemctl

129
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.050
disable firewalld, hit Enter.

130
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.040
Okay, we've done quite a bit to set up our Linux instance.

131
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.080
For the next part, which is configuring Payara,

132
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.070
but we have one more detail that we are going to need

133
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.050
and that is a Payara directory.

134
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.090
So we'll type, mkdir

135
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.000
payara5, hit Enter.
