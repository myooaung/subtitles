00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] IT Managers at H Plus Org want

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.060
to make the application more dynamic

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.050
and so we've been requested

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.030
to prepare our Tomcat installation to connect

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030
with a MySQL database.

6
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.080
In order to access the different database systems

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.040
with web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat,

8
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.000
you first must add them to the Apache Tomcat lib directory.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.050
So, let's first go download the correct driver.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.090
If you navigate in your browsers

11
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.000
to dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/,

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.060
scroll down to the connector 8.0.15,

13
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.060
select the Platform Independent,

14
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.080
go to the zip download, and click download.

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.020
If you have not created an Oracle account yet,

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.030
you must do this and log in, in order to download the file.

17
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.030
Next, let's just open this file up.

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.080
We'll use the automatic unzip capabilities here of our Mac.

19
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.010
Go to our terminal window, we're going to copy

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.040
from the downloads folder the MySQL driver,

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.070
to the lib directory.

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.010
Forgive me, I made a mistake.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:26.050
We need to copy not cd from the downloads MySQL directory

24
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.040
to our lib directory.

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.020
Do an ls on the lib,

26
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.010
see that it's there.

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.090
There is a MySQL connector.

28
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.080
Next, with the jar copied, we need to modify our context.xml

29
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.040
to use this connection.

30
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.000
So, we'll type

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.040
vi

32
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.010
conf

33
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.030
context.xml.

34
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.080
And I want to quickly turn your attention

35
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.000
to the Tomcat website.

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They have a great example here for MySQL,

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.070
and it's this information here.

38
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
What we're going to do is just copy this resource name,

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.060
going to come over to our context again,

40
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.060
bring our cursor down to about there, hit enter,

41
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
and paste this information in.

42
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.000
We'll change the resource name.

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.080
This will be our jndi name for our H Plus database.

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.010
We'll change the java user, if you remember this is

45
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
from our very first video where we set up the database,

46
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.000
this will be our H Plus user.

47
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.070
Our password,

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:56.020
enter here, bring this over one more time.

49
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.060
Going to add a validation query.

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.020
This query is ran when the Tomcat server starts up.

51
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.030
It validates the database is connected.

52
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.040
And we're going to change the database name here.

53
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.010
Those changes done, we'll hit escape colon write

54
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.040
enter colon q to close it.

55
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.080
Then next, we need to stop

56
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.020
and start our Tomcat instance.

57
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.050
Now, once you've restarted,

58
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.050
you would typically deploy your app

59
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.080
with the appropriate db connection details

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.040
that rely on your jndi settings

61
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.010
made in the resource tag of your context.xml,

62
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.050
which we've just done.

63
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.020
And you would reference these in your web.xml.

64
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.090
Now, we do this by opening in our project,

65
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.010
I've already opened this for us,

66
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.040
this is in our chapter one 01_05_begin folder,

67
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.050
and I've already made the changes

68
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.080
for you inside the web.xml.

69
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.090
I have a description tag.

70
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.000
I have a resource ref tag, and inside that we have our name,

71
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.080
which references what we just changed in our context.xml

72
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.000
for the jndi connection.
