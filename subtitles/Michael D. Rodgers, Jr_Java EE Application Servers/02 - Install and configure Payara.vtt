00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Instructor] H+ Sport has been pushing the envelope

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.010
in setting up and trying these various

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.010
Java application servers.

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.070
The excitement around Payara

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.080
and its long history in GlassFish

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080
only add to the interest of installing

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.090
and configuring Payara for H+ Sport

8
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.070
during its flagship web application.

9
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's get started and download Payara

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.060
from https://www.payara.fish/

11
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.080
software/downloads/all-downloads.

12
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.000
This page displays multiple versions available.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.040
You'll find here the micro editions

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.030
which are designed for use in microservices.

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.080
You'll find the embedded versions

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.020
and the multi-lingual versions.

17
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.000
The multi-lingual, the embedded,

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.080
and the regular Payara server come in two varieties

19
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.030
and you can see that here, the full and the web profile.

20
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090
We've covered what these two types are,

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.070
the web and the full profile in previous videos

22
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.060
with WebLogic and WildFly.

23
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.080
And Payara is no different.

24
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.080
For our purposes,

25
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.010
we'll be downloading the full server version at the top.

26
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
Another interesting feature concerning Payara and GlassFish

27
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.000
is that it currently only works on JDK 8.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.090
Yup, you guessed it.

29
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.030
If you don't have JDK 8 installed,

30
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.060
you'll need to do this now before we can continue.

31
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.090
Hopefully, this will be remedied in the near future.

32
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.000
With JDK 8 installed, let's switch to our home directory

33
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.020
and we're going to copy the download

34
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.070
to our home directory.

35
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.000
Make sure you type that dot there and hit Enter.

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.040
Next, we're going to unzip

37
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.040
and this will create a Payara5 directory.

38
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.070
CD in to that directory.

39
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.010
And we're going to type bin/asadmin start-domain

40
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.070
and hit Enter.

41
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.020
Asadmin is the primary CLI methodology

42
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.050
for making changes to Payara or GlassFish

43
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.000
so we should see a few logging statements here.

44
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.080
As we're waiting for it to start,

45
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.060
let's copy this line here

46
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.090
server log

47
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.000
and we're going to open a new window

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.060
and tail this log.

49
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.000
This way we can see what is happening in the logs

50
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.050
as we move forward.

51
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.090
Next, we're going to go to our browser again,

52
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.080
open a new tab,

53
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:57.040
we'll type HTTP://localhost:4848

54
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.070
and hit Enter.

55
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.010
This will open the default administrative console.

56
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.060
You'll notice this page says

57
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.000
status the admin console is loading please wait.

58
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
After it finishes, it takes us to the console

59
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.080
and note that no username and password was requested.

60
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.050
This is because the default credentials

61
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.000
have not been changed yet.

62
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.040
We'll get to that in the next section.

63
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.090
The last couple things I want to show you

64
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.020
are back on the terminal window.

65
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.090
You'll notice that when we typed bin/asadmin start-domain,

66
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.030
the next line says waiting for domain1 to start.

67
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.010
Domain1 is the default domain that is started

68
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.060
using the asadmin start-domain.

69
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.080
If we wanted a different domain to start,

70
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.070
we would have to specify that here

71
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.030
with asadmin start-domain domain2

72
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.070
or whatever the domain is called.

73
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.060
We'll create a different domain later on

74
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.070
and demonstrate this.

75
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.040
Let's go ahead and stop the domain

76
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.060
and then we'll start it again

77
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.020
with the bin/asadmin start-domain domain1 to demonstrate.

78
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:15.080
To stop Payara, we'll type bin/asadmin stop-domain

79
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.020
and I'm going to go ahead and add our default domain here

80
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.090
and that will kill the process running in the background

81
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.090
for the domain.

82
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.090
If we look at our logs,

83
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.020
it'll show us that we have basically stopped this domain.

84
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.000
So let's start it back up again.

85
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We'll type this time

86
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.020
bin/asadmin start-domain

87
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.030
and specify our default domain.

88
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.010
And as we can see,

89
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.000
it's starting back up just like we expected.
