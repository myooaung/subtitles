00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] In order to get started with the deployment,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.050
ensure that you have Oracle's JDK installed

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.060
and not the OpenJDK.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.000
This is due to licensing reasons.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.030
To get the latest copy of WebLogic,

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.030
you'll need to navigate to the oracle.com Downloads page.

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.080
However, you'll first need an Oracle account.

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.090
No worries here.

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.080
You can register for free by creating an account.

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.050
Basically navigate to the oracle.com site,

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.040
locate the Account icon in the top right corner.

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.070
As you hover over it, it'll give you

13
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.080
the option to create an account.

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.060
Or if you already have an account,

15
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.080
click the Sign In button.

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
Once logged in, go back to the Downloads page,

17
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.050
scroll down to the middle of the page

18
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.030
where it says Middleware, click on the link.

19
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.070
Luckily, these are alphabetically sorted.

20
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.060
Scroll down to the WebLogic 12c Server.

21
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.070
We want to accept the license.

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.050
Going to change the dropdown here to the Generic Installer,

23
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.080
and then we're going to click Download File.

24
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.070
Once the download is complete,

25
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.010
we're going to navigate to our terminal.

26
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.080
Going to copy from the downloads folder

27
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.010
the fm 12.2, and we're going to place this

28
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.040
in our current directory.

29
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.030
From there, we'll run unzip.

30
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090
We'll unzip the directory.

31
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.080
Clear the screen.

32
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.090
And then we're going to run the command java-jar

33
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.020
fmw_12.2, wls.jar.

34
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.050
This will kick off a launcher, a GUI,

35
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.080
and we'll walk through the steps from there.

36
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.080
Once the installation of an inventory page comes up,

37
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.060
we're going to basically follow the defaults, click OK.

38
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.000
And then we'll click Next.

39
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We'll skip the auto updates.

40
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.050
We'll leave the Oracle home as is.

41
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.020
We'll leave it as WebLogic Server, click Next.

42
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.040
And we'll click Install.

43
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.010
This process can take up to 10 minutes

44
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.040
depending upon your system.

45
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.090
We'll click Next.

46
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.090
We'll make sure this, Automatically Launch

47
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.070
Configuration Wizard, is checked, and click Finish.

48
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.050
At this point, the Configuration Wizard will kick off.

49
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.070
We're going to change the base domain name,

50
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.090
and we're going to call this our hplus domain.

51
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.000
We'll click Next.

52
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.090
And here, we're going to skip and go to Next.

53
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.050
At this point, we have the name of our server,

54
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.080
we have a password and a confirmation.

55
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.000
I'm going to use my tried and true password,

56
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.050
the capital MY$3CRET, my secret.

57
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.010
Capital MY$3CRET.

58
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.090
We'll click Next.

59
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.090
You have two choices here.

60
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.030
You can leave it in development mode,

61
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.080
or you could use a production mode.

62
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.060
We're going to go ahead and select Production mode

63
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.090
for our purposes and click Next.

64
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.010
For this screen, we'll leave it in its default.

65
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.020
And we'll click Create.

66
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.080
Click Next.

67
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.050
And Finish.

68
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.000
So now, we're going to open up our terminal window.

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.050
We'll clear the screen here.

70
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.020
And we are going to go

71
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.020
into the Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home.

72
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.040
We will go to the user_projects/domains/hplus_domain/

73
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000
and then to our bin directory

74
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.040
and type startWebLogic.

75
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.010
This is going to prompt us for our username and password.

76
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.080
We'll type WebLogic and our password.

77
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.050
As you can see, our server

78
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.020
is in a starting state of running.

79
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.030
Go to our browser.

80
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.020
Type http://localhost7001,

81
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.040
hit Enter and add console, there we go.

82
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.030
Here's our WebLogic Server.

83
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.090
And enter the username WebLogic

84
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.000
and the password, MY$ECRET, and log in.
