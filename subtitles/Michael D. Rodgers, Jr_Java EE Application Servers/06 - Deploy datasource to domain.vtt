00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] Starting WildFly in domain mode

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.030
we'll type bin domain SH and hit enter.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.050
The logs will show a server one and a server two.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.010
And everything is started, 79 of 81 services.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.050
In our browser, going to a new incognito window,

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.080
we'll type HTTP 127 zero zero one 99 90.

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.070
We'll hit enter.

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.020
From there we're going to navigate to the deployment

9
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.070
section and this should look different

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.090
from the standalone mode.

11
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.070
We have this nice little picture diagram

12
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.090
that indicates we will deploy to a server group

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.020
instead of an individual server.

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.050
So on the left we're going to click on the groups link.

15
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.030
You'll notice that currently there are two

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.040
different server groups created by default in domain mode.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040
For our purposes, we'll go ahead and use

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.080
the main server group.

19
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.040
Clicking on this, we see it has no deployments currently.

20
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.070
So let's deploy a DB driver.

21
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.040
Click on the plus symbol, upload new deployment, click here.

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.090
Again, we're going to go to our downloads,

23
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.030
select the my SQL driver, click okay,

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.060
and then next, and finish.

25
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.090
Then we'll click close.

26
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.020
We didn't enable the driver yet, so click enable

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.000
and it should give you a success message.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.040
So next we need to create a data source.

29
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.040
Going to click on the configurations tab

30
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.010
and then click on profiles, and then click full

31
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.040
because the server group that we had

32
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.090
was in full mode, then the data sources

33
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.060
and drivers, and then drivers.

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.030
And you will notice that our my SQL database

35
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.040
driver is listed.

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.010
Okay, so now we need to click on the data source

37
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.090
and then click on the plus icon, add data source.

38
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.030
We'll select my SQL, next, change the name

39
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.060
to H plus DS for data source.

40
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.010
We'll add in J boss data sources and we'll change

41
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.000
the name of the data source specifically

42
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.080
to H plus underscore DS.

43
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.000
We'll click next.

44
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We'll select our driver.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Click next.

46
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.080
Change the database name.

47
00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.010
We'll change the user name.

48
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.070
And we'll change the password.

49
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.090
And we'll click next.

50
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.080
At this point if you've done everything correctly

51
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.020
we'll click test connection and we should get

52
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.090
a success message.

53
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.040
And then finish.

54
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.050
You can click view on the data source if you want.

55
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.070
To validate our data sources shared to a cluster

56
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.020
of servers, let's click on the runtime.

57
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.080
So we're going to click on server groups,

58
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.010
main group, and server one.

59
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.090
And we can see that server one needs to be reloaded.

60
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.090
We can do that by clicking the dropdown and reload.

61
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.080
Click yes.

62
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.020
Same thing for server two, reload and yes.

63
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.020
If we click on server one and drill down

64
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.020
to data sources, we see our data source as well

65
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.060
and a way to test it.

66
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.090
Click on server two, data sources, data source.

67
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.030
We can test our data source as well.

68
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.000
So we have successfully deployed a data source to a cluster.
