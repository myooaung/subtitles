00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] HPlus Sport Drink IT Manager

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.030
has directed that we go forward with installing

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.060
the latest Java EE version of the web application.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.090
We know there might be some issues here

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.000
because Tomcat does not readily support Java EE APIs.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.080
When it comes to addressing missing JEE functionality

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.040
and capabilities in Tomcat,

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.090
there are varied ways to remediate this.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.070
Sometimes this includes copying

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.030
the missing API jar to the lib directory,

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.040
like we did previously with missing MySQL driver.

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.090
Sometimes it means doing something a little different,

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.040
like including the missing dependencies

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.050
within the build file.

15
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.030
For this video,

16
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.040
we've provided a simple CDI application,

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.050
a Contexts, Dependencies and Injection web app,

18
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.080
which is designed to cause

19
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.070
a standard Tomcat installation to fail.

20
00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.060
Let's compile our project in practice_files, 01_06

21
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.000
_begin.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.030
We'll type the command gradle clean build.

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.070
Assuming you don't have any errors,

24
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.050
let's move on with deploying.

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.000
We'll come back to our Tomcat terminal here.

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.050
I'm going to cd back one directory.

27
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.030
Actually, I'm going to cd into the webapps directory.

28
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.040
Clear the screen.

29
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040
Here we go.

30
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.040
And we're going to copy

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.090
from our practice_files

32
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090
Chapter_01

33
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.080
01_06

34
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.030
_begin,

35
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.070
the build/libs,

36
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.050
there it is.

37
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.050
We'll copy this,

38
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.030
and there you go.

39
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.010
If we watch this,

40
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.010
we'll actually see it deploy fairly quickly.

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.040
And there's our hplus-simple

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.030
directory that deployed.

43
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.060
Now, Tomcat is obviously already running in this scenario.

44
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.040
So we've deployed the application

45
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.040
that has built-in CDI functionality

46
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.020
and we're going to demonstrate

47
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.020
that the app will fail in Tomcat,

48
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.000
so what we're going to do is we're going to go to our browser.

49
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.040
We have the application running as it is right now,

50
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.030
and we're going to change the path up here

51
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.090
to message, which is a URL-designed

52
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.000
to access the CDI functionality within this app.

53
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.090
We'll hit Enter and we get what I expected,

54
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030
a NullPointerException.

55
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.030
Now, the NullPointerException tells us

56
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.030
it occurred at line 22 within MyServlet.

57
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.030
So, let's dig into this application real quick

58
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.020
and see what's going on.

59
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.010
We can open up IntelliJ

60
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.080
and we're going to go to the MyServlet class in line 22.

61
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.040
And line 22 is telling us that basically this object

62
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.030
is null,

63
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.020
and we know it's null because, well,

64
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.090
it has an Inject on it,

65
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.040
and this tells us that Tomcat is not doing its work

66
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.000
'cause it doesn't support CDI.

67
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.070
So how do we address this issue?

68
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.040
Well, we have to do couple of things first.

69
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.030
Because Tomcat doesn't have the necessary dependencies,

70
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.020
we need to make sure that in our build.gradle script

71
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.050
that they're available.

72
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.090
Now, I've already commented out the dependencies here for us

73
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.040
to make this quicker.

74
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.000
So we have a javax.servlet that was commented out

75
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.080
and the weld.servlet,

76
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.010
and weld.servlet is the actual implementation that we need,

77
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.070
which Tomcat doesn't have.

78
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.000
The other thing that we need to do is in our web.xml.

79
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.060
The application would not work in Tomcat

80
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.020
in a normal scenario because the listener is not available,

81
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.060
so we have to apply a listener within our web.xml here.

82
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.000
So we're going to uncommment the listener again, choosing weld.

83
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.070
And the last thing we need to do is go to our context.xml

84
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.000
and make sure that the BeanManager is set up.

85
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.030
Again, the BeanManager is using our weld library.

86
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.020
With all of these things done,

87
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.000
we're going to go back to the Terminal, to the command line,

88
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.020
we'll come back to our practice_files,

89
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.010
we'll type in gradle clean build.

90
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.070
And I need to say these dependencies

91
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.090
will most likely present issues later on

92
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.050
when we deploy this application

93
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.080
to WebLogic, Jboss, and GlassFish,

94
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.030
because those app servers

95
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.050
already have the missing API dependencies.

96
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.060
And because they have the dependencies within them,

97
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.070
there'll be conflicts

98
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.010
between which library needs to be used.

99
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.070
We'll address that later.

100
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.020
So our project should be recompiled and let's redeploy.

101
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.090
We'll come back over here.

102
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.010
And I think I have the command still on,

103
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.030
there it is.

104
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.080
We'll hit Enter again.

105
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.050
If we do an ls -la,

106
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.060
we'll see that the application is here.

107
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.060
It copied it over.

108
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.030
And let's switch back to our browser.

109
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.010
We have the error that's there from last time,

110
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.030
so let's refresh

111
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.000
and now it's gone.

112
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.040
Now, to demonstrate this is the message

113
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.070
that's been populated,

114
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.060
so we're going to take this out, hit Enter, come back,

115
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.020
type message that accesses the CDI,

116
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.090
and then there's our message, it's populated.

117
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.080
As you move forward

118
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.070
with your app development and deployment,

119
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.080
pay close attention to what is happening

120
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.060
in the catalina.logs and the localhost logs

121
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.030
regarding how Tomcat is Java EE compliant.

122
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.090
It's a process of learning to read the logs

123
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.020
and then search for an answer via the documentation,

124
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.050
and sometimes you could find the answer

125
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.030
by basically Googling it or going to Stack Overflow.

126
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.080
These sites will basically point out

127
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.040
the missing library or API that Tomcat does not have

128
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.000
and that you need to add to your dependencies.
