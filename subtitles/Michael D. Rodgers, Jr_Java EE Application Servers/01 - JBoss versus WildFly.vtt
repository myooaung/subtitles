00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] H+Sport Drink's IT manager

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.070
has been ecstatic so far about the success of using WebLogic

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.020
but has had some concerns with the pricing

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.020
and wants to investigate using JBoss EAP

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.040
or WildFly and their available features.

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.000
Red Hat has two application server platforms for use:

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.070
JBoss and WildFly.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.010
JBoss EAP, or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform,

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.070
is Red Hat's commercial-license application server.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.060
It's fully tested and production ready.

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.050
Currently, it's at version 7.1.

12
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.070
WildFly, which was renamed

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
from JBoss AS, or JBoss Application Server,

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.000
on the other hand, is Red Hat's free community edition

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.090
Java enterprise application server.

16
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.070
WildFly is currently at version 15.

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.060
As of version 14, however, WildFly was certified

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.000
as a Java EE 8 full-platform compatible implementation

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.070
as well as a Java EE 8

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.030
web-profile compatible implementation.

21
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.010
With version 15 as December 2018,

22
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
Red Hat aims to contribute to the rollout of Java EE 8,

23
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.070
support and polish its support for JDK 11,

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
which means in theory it contains Java EE 8

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.010
application server functionality

26
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.000
but is not fully tested or certified as of yet.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.040
JBoss EAP, on the other hand, is downstream

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.020
of all the new development whizzbang features of WildFly

29
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.050
and, as such, is always slightly behind

30
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.060
those latest improvements.

31
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.030
This also mans that Java EE certifications will differ.

32
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.050
Currently, JBoss EAP is certified at Java EE 7

33
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.060
full-platform compatible implementation

34
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.060
and a Java EE 7 web-profile compatible implementation.

35
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
JBoss EAP supports JDK 1.8,

36
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.030
including these six alternative JDKs.

37
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.080
The licensing agreement of JBoss EAP

38
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.030
actually prohibits downloading trial versions

39
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.060
to make training videos

40
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.080
and can only be used for development purposes.

41
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.090
We will be focusing on WildFly,

42
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.070
and because WildFly version 15

43
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.090
is also fully JEE 8 certified,

44
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030
we'll be using it.

45
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000
Even without that justification,

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.070
the reason for choosing WildFly

47
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.070
is because it is free, open source,

48
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.050
innovative, current, fast, and lightweight.

49
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.080
I want to caution you.

50
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.010
If you use WildFly production,

51
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.030
and this really goes for any application server,

52
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.060
like Tomcat, TomEE, GlassFish, or WebLogic,

53
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.090
it is always a good idea to implement

54
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.060
a complete monitoring and alerting infrastructure

55
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.080
against the application environment

56
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050
so you can analyze and troubleshoot

57
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.000
any issue that may arise.
