00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] H Plus sport drink has mandated

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.030
that the flagship website be migrated to a Java EE platform.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.090
At present, you're evaluating

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.020
Apache Tomcat and Apache TomEE.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.020
It's important to understand the differences

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.020
between Apache Tomcat and Apache TomEE.

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.050
Simply stated, Apache Tomcat addresses

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.040
the missing Java enterprise edition functionality

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.050
in Apache Tomcat, making it fully compliant.

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.050
Some organizations do not have flexibility of using TomEE.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
So for this chapter, we'll be focusing on Apache Tomcat.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.050
The Apachetomcat.org site says that

13
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.000
Apache Tomcat is an open source implementation

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.050
of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages,

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.080
Java Expression Language, and Java WebSocket technologies.

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.050
It powers numerous large-scale,

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.020
mission-critical web applications

18
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.020
across a diverse range of industries and organizations.

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.040
Apache Tomcat is specifically designed to work with

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.030
Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages,

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.020
JSPs, Java Experession Language.

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080
And Apache Tomcat, as of version eight,

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.090
works with WebSocket technologies.

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.090
Okay, so what's the difference between the two?

25
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.040
Well, Apache TomEE, as its name suggests,

26
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.070
is a Java EE Web profile-certified stack.

27
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.090
So in Java five, in order to be certified,

28
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.070
you had to have implemented a full set Java EE APIs.

29
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.030
In Java six and above, you could define

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.050
a subset of the Java Enterprise edition as a profile,

31
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.030
which is what TomEE does.

32
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.070
TomEE provides several profile versions

33
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.020
that you can download.

34
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.040
It's built on Apache Tomcat core

35
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.000
and integrates additional Java EE related technologies

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.030
like CDI, EJB, JPA, and JSF, to name a few.

37
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.040
What's nice about TomEE is it includes

38
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.030
all of the goodies that Tomcat has,

39
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.030
Servlets, JSPS, JSTL, WebSockets, plus some more.

40
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
It also includes all the necessary Java EE APIs

41
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.010
that are listed here, which makes it a fully compliant

42
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.050
Java Enterprise edition application server.

43
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
TomEE is designed to make Tomcat Java EE compliant

44
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.050
and comes in four flavors, at the time of this recording.

45
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.060
As you can see from the right,

46
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.000
it delineates the versions available.

47
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030
So which one do we use?

48
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.000
This is really personal preference,

49
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.060
and what your organization is comfortable with.

50
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.020
For this chapter, however,

51
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.000
we'll focus on configuring Tomcat.
