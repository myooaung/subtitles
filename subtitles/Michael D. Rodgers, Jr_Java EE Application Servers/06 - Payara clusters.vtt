00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.050
- [Instructor] Following the direction

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.080
of our h plus IT Director,

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.020
we began investigating how to cluster some paired instances,

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.020
and found out that clustering is done a little different

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.070
than in glass fish.

6
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.080
This is because the cluster feature has been deprecated

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.010
in favor of creating a deployment group,

8
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.060
which can contain one or more server instances.

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.050
For this lesson we'll be using

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.080
from our practice files zero four underscore zero six begin.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.000
Please make sure that the source files are compiled

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.020
and ready to go before we continue.

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.080
To create a deployment group,

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.000
we'll simply click on the deployment groups

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.030
on the left navigation,

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.060
click New and type in the name of our group.

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.000
Here we'll type h plus group.

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.070
Click okay.

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.090
From there we have this table of deployment groups

20
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.030
with currently only one listing.

21
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.020
Click on the link, and then click on the Instances tab.

22
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.020
From here, we'll add our instances to the deployment group.

23
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.000
Click New, we'll type h plus server dash zero zero one,

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.030
leave the other fields in their default configuration.

25
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.020
Click okay.

26
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.080
Now we're going to do it again.

27
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.010
We're going to add a second instance

28
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.050
to our deployment group.

29
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:28.040
We'll call this one h plus dash server dash zero zero two.

30
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.000
And we'll click okay.

31
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.050
So now we have two instances

32
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.010
on our deployment group called h plus group,

33
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
and you'll notice that both instances are stopped.

34
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.050
To start these instances we'll click on both check boxes,

35
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.060
and then click start.

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.040
Click okay.

37
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.030
You may get this informational dialogue stating

38
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.020
that a long running process has been detected.

39
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050
This is normal and often occurs

40
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.040
when any process might take too long.

41
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.030
And of course this is informational.

42
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.000
And is happening here because we started two instances.

43
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We'll let this continue and finish.

44
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.010
With both processes complete,

45
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.010
we can now see that each instance are started and running.

46
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.060
If we click on server instance one,

47
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.040
we see that it's running on http ports of 24848 28080

48
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.000
and 28181.

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.040
Clicking on instance two,

50
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.000
we see this one's running on 49 81 and 82

51
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.050
of those respective ports.

52
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.040
If we go over to the terminal window,

53
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.090
and type ps dash ef pipe, grep Java,

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.080
this will demonstrate

55
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.080
that we have three separate Java processes running now

56
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.060
for each instance.

57
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.020
At the bottom of the page we have our instance name,

58
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.030
h plus server zero two, and that the type is an instance.

59
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.080
If we scroll up to the next Java process,

60
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.020
we see that the instance name

61
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.020
is h plus server zero zero one,

62
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.000
and that it's type is instance.

63
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.080
And if we scroll to the next Java process,

64
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.040
we see that the type here is a DAS

65
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.060
and that the instance name is server.

66
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.080
Going back to the web console,

67
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.090
we can see that clicking on applications

68
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.000
our h plus simple application is currently deployed.

69
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.060
And if we click on it, we see that it resides on the DAS

70
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.060
on the server.

71
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.080
Since we've created the deployment group,

72
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.070
we want to make a distinction now between the DAS,

73
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.080
the Domain Administration Server and the instances,

74
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080
of h plus server zero zero one

75
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.070
and h plus servers zero zero two, that are also live.

76
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.000
If we click on one of the instances,

77
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.050
h plus servers, zero one and click on applications,

78
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.030
we see that no application is deployed.

79
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.020
Likewise for h plus zero zero two,

80
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.040
no application is deployed.

81
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.060
This is an important thing to remember.

82
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.030
Because an application deployed

83
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.060
to the DAS cannot necessarily be considered highly available

84
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.050
or load balanced.

85
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.040
The application must be clustered.

86
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.000
In our case deploy to a deployment group.

87
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Let's go back to our applications,

88
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.050
and we're going to deploy again.

89
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.040
This time choosing our file, from four zero six begin,

90
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.050
in the build directory libs our war file, click okay,

91
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.070
we're going to scroll down to the bottom.

92
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.050
We're going to select our h plus group.

93
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.020
Click add and click okay.

94
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.030
Now an error has occurred.

95
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.080
The reason is because the application h plus simple

96
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.080
is already deployed to other targets.

97
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.060
We're required to remove it if we want to deploy it

98
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.020
to the deployment group.

99
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.030
So let's do that.

100
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.020
Click on applications, click check, undeploy, click okay.

101
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.070
Now Click on applications again. We can see it's empty.

102
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.000
So now let's deploy to our deployment group.

103
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.090
Click deploy, choose the file,

104
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.070
again make sure you're using zero four zero six begin.

105
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.010
Go to the build, Libs directory, select the war, click open.

106
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.080
We'll scroll to the bottom,

107
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.080
this time elect our h plus group, click add and click okay.

108
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.050
And the application was deployed to our deployment group.

109
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.070
If we click on the launch,

110
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.080
we can see now that the application lives

111
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.030
on two separate instances and runs on the unsecured port

112
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.050
and the secure port.

113
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.080
If we validate and click

114
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.000
on one of these, we can see that it was deployed.
