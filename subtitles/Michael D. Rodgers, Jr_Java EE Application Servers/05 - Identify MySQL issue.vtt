00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] Next we're going to install

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.090
a MySQL database driver and walk you through the process

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.000
of configuring and setting it up.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.010
The first thing we need to do,

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.020
just like installing any WER file,

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.090
is clicking the lock and edit button.

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.010
Then we'll scroll down underneath services to data source

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.010
and click on new, select generic data source.

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.070
In the name we'll type H plus DB.

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.040
And for the JNDI name it'll be

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.010
JDBC/ H plus DB.

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.060
We'll change the type to MySQL, click next.

13
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.090
We'll change the database driver to calm MySQL JDBC driver,

14
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.030
click next, we'll keep these options selected as they are.

15
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.050
For the database name, we'll type again H plus DB.

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.000
The host is local host.

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Database username, H plus user,

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.030
and our password is my secret,

19
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.070
capital M-Y-$-3-C-R-E-T.

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
We'll click next,

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.050
and before we click test configuration,

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.090
I want to let you know that these changes will fail

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.020
because the version eight of MySQL database

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.040
that we have is incompatible with the highest version

25
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.020
of the database driver that WebLogic has by default.

26
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.040
The reason I'm demonstrating this,

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.070
is so you won't be shocked and you'll know what to expect

28
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.020
when a driver doesn't work.

29
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.080
Click test configuration,

30
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.010
and the error we get is Java class cast exception.

31
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.020
Java math big integer cannot be cast to a long.

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.040
This error message, after digging into it

33
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.050
for quite some time, basically means that

34
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.030
the driver version of the MySQL driver we have

35
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.070
is incompatible with the version of the database.

36
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.030
I also want to show you something else.

37
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.040
If you get a different error here,

38
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.070
which is very common, pull up my terminal,

39
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.060
and in the practice files for

40
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.060
02_05_MySQLscript,

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.070
if you look at this config samples .txt,

42
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.080
it's very possible that you'll get an error that says

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.070
caching sha2 password.

44
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.040
To address the error, follow the directions

45
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.030
in this configuration samples.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.000
Basically once you log in as MySQL root,

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.030
you'll enter the password, at the MySQL prompt,

48
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.090
you'll copy this command here: alter user H plus user,

49
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.070
so forth, with the password.

50
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.080
You're going to paste that in at the MySQL prompt

51
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
and hit enter.

52
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Let's go back to the exception here.

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.080
Now there's two ways to fix this

54
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.000
and we'll get into that in a moment.
