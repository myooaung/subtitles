00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] Because it's a bit different

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.020
on every application server, let's walk through how

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.070
to deploy a WAR file in WildFly.

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.080
Let's go ahead and ensure

5
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.000
our practice files are open in IntelliJ.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.040
We'll be using practice file

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.070
zero three underscore zero four begin.

8
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.060
Here I've already done this.

9
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.050
And from the terminal window below, the command line window,

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.010
we're going to type gradle clean build and hit enter.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.080
It shouldn't take very long at this point to build.

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.020
Let's switch back to our WildFly instance,

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
we'll go to start on deploy, click on the plus symbol,

14
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.030
upload a deployment, choose the file,

15
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.020
and we're going to navigate to our practice files,

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.060
chapter three, zero three four begin,

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.010
go to the build, and libs, and there's our WAR file,

18
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.050
click open, and click next.

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.060
We're going to leave the filled enabled off for right now.

20
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.020
Click finish.

21
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.080
It shows that deployment was successful.

22
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.010
We'll click on view deployment, and then click enable.

23
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.060
As you can see here, we got a error message.

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.080
And specifically, this error message is

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.050
is that the Java lang runtime exception,

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.080
the sun faces config configuration, it failed.

27
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050
Let's go back to our project files

28
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.010
and let me show you why this happened.

29
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.060
And keep in mind, that just like web logic,

30
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.030
there are already Java EE libraries included in WildFly

31
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050
to handle the Java EE required servlet library,

32
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.020
because WildFly is fully compliant Java EE app server.

33
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.060
So adding a weld servlet here will cause it to fail,

34
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.010
it'll cause an error.

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.020
Since we still have the project opened in IntelliJ,

36
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.020
we're going to just comment out this line,

37
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.080
save it, and rebuild the project.

38
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.020
We're going to go back to our deployments window again,

39
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.000
we're going to remove the deployment, click yes,

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.090
we're going to add the deployment again,

41
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.070
navigate to the same location, click open,

42
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.070
next, and finish, view deployment.

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.080
Everything is successful, click enable,

44
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.060
and now the WAR file was successfully deployed.

45
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.090
We click on the deployment link.

46
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.040
It should open up our H plus sport application.

47
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.020
Let's go back again.

48
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.010
Now we're going to remove it,

49
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.030
and install the application through the command line.

50
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.080
Going back to the terminal window,

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.000
going to make sure that we're in the correct directory,

52
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.030
and from the command line here what we're going to do

53
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.080
is copy our file from our practice files location,

54
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:15.090
chapter three zero three zero four begin build libs.

55
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.030
And we're going to copy this to our WildFly instance

56
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.000
standalone deployments folder, hit enter.

57
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.080
If we run an LS dash LA

58
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.000
on the standalone deployments,

59
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.050
we'll see that the WAR files deployed.

60
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.090
Now we can see this by it adds

61
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.000
an extra identifier on the application.
