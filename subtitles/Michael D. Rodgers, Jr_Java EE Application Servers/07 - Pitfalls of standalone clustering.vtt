00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Narrator] Clustering in Stand Alone mode

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.040
can at times present some challenges,

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.070
especially if you're attempting

4
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.020
to cluster on the same machine.

5
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.090
To demonstrate from the command line,

6
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.000
looking at our Stand Alone installation directory.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.080
We're going to copy,

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.000
the WildFly instance,

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.020
and call it wildfly dash b.

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.000
Now, if we do an ls we can see both instances.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.020
The issue with starting both of these instances

12
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.010
simultaneously is that port conflicts will occur.

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
So, JBoss has designed a way for us to handle

14
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.020
this by passing a property at the command line.

15
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.080
Or, we could edit the configuration standalone-ha xml,

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.090
or the standalone.xml, if you just wanted

17
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.060
to run two distinct JBoss instances.

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.090
"ha" by the way, stands for high availability.

19
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.050
So, let's focus on the first.

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.020
We're going to go into our WildFly instance.

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.090
Bin, standalone,

22
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
server-config

23
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.070
equals

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.020
standalone-ha xml,

25
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.040
and hit enter.

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.010
Open up a new tab.

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.060
Going to go into our second WildFly instance.

28
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.030
We'll type, let's clear this out so we can see more,

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.040
type bin, standalone,

30
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.000
server, config, equals,

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040
standalone, ha.xml,

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.030
and then we're going to pass a,

33
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.070
property to allow us to start

34
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.060
this server with a port offset.

35
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.050
And, we're going to set the port offset here to 100.

36
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.050
We hit enter.

37
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.080
This'll take a moment to start.

38
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
And, there we go.

39
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.090
Our port offset is by 100 and you can see here

40
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.030
that the WildFly instance is started at 10,090.

41
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.060
The other server, had started,

42
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.000
in 9,990.

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.010
The other information I want you to capture here

44
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.000
is that it's recognizing that this is in a cluster.

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.020
The other thing that we could do

46
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.040
to change the port offset, is by actually going

47
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.070
into the wildfly final b,

48
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.040
and we'll edit inside the standalone configuration,

49
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040
and we'll pull up the

50
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.060
standalone.ha.xml,

51
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
we'll do a search,

52
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.090
for port offset,

53
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.080
and here we can see that the port offset is set to 0.

54
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.020
Now, we could change this right now,

55
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.040
and change this to 100,

56
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090
but because the JBoss WildFly instance is running,

57
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.020
it would get overridden.

58
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.010
So, we're going to exit out of this.

59
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.080
Let's deploy an application to the standalone cluster.

60
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.060
In our practice file 03_07_begin,

61
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.030
going to use vi, and open up the web.xml,

62
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.070
go to insert mode,

63
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.050
going to type in the tag, distributable,

64
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.000
make sure I spelled that correctly.

65
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.010
This will allow the application to work

66
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.040
in a cluster and share session information.

67
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.050
And, that's really all you have to do

68
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.030
for a web app, by the way.

69
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.090
You may remember using this tag

70
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.090
back when we worked with Tomcat.

71
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.020
Let's save this, and exit vi,

72
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.040
going to do a gradle clean build,

73
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
going to open up two Chrome tabs and I'm in incognito mode,

74
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.000
we'll type http 90 90,

75
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and we're going to start a deployment,

76
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.080
and apparently we already have one.

77
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.040
Let's disable this.

78
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.050
Remove it, so we can start fresh.

79
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:28.000
Click upload, going to go to our zero three seven begin,

80
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.040
build, libs, click okay,

81
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.000
next, and finish.

82
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.020
Close, we'll enable the deployment.

83
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.030
Now, we're going to come over to the other window,

84
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.060
and remember this starts at 10,090,

85
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.030
so we're going to copy that, come over here,

86
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.030
10,090, hit enter, it's going to prompt us for our,

87
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.070
password, start,

88
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.060
we already have a deployment active,

89
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.050
and this is because it's actually

90
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.060
distributed the application.

91
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.060
So, we're going to go ahead and disable this one,

92
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.080
and remove it.

93
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.000
See, what's happening in the logs right now between the two.

94
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.070
You can see that the cluster

95
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.080
seems to be talking to each other.

96
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
The data that it's passing back and forth.

97
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.060
Let's come back into our instance, we'll refresh.

98
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.070
Go to the other one, refresh.

99
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.030
Going to deploy, upload,

100
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.010
choose the same .war, next, and finish,

101
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.060
close, we'll enable it.

102
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.030
Now, look over here in the logs,

103
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.090
and we can see that, says it's deployed the .war,

104
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.000
and there is communication that's occurring on this side.

105
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This is clustering with standalone instances.
