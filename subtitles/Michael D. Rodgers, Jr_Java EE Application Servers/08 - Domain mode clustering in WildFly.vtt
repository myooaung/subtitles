00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Teacher] We've looked at a stand alone cluster,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.070
but now let's consider a domain high availability cluster.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.030
From the terminal window, let's go into

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:17.020
our WildFly directory and type domain.sh and hit enter.

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.020
We're going to switch over to our incognito Chrome window.

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.030
Enter our credentials.

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.060
Running a WildFly cluster is an important step

8
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.030
to maintaining and running the applications

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.010
in a production environment.

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.020
A high availability clusters means

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.000
we have fell over when a server becomes unstable

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.080
and it also means we can handle higher loads of users

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.040
by sharing that load across to more WildFly servers.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.010
Now navigating to the runtime tab,

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
we'll go ahead and create and configure

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.090
a server group to run in full HA.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.050
Which means it uses the full Java

18
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.030
enterprise edition in high availability mode.

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.030
Clicking on the topology link

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
and in the left navigation bar

21
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.040
we can see the default topology has a main server group

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
which is running and the other server group which is not.

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.030
These are controlled by a master.

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.070
Clicking on these, we can reload, restart,

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.030
suspend, stop, destroy, and kill.

26
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.030
The other one we can only start, destroy, and kill.

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.070
Clicking on the main server group

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.060
we can see below in the details

29
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.040
that this group was created with a full profile

30
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.070
and what we need is a full HA,

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.030
meaning a full profile in high availability mode.

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.040
Clicking on the other server group

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.050
we see it has a full HA profile.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.090
We could use this one but I want to walk you

35
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.090
through the process of creating a full HA

36
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.000
and then deploying a distributable WAR file

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.010
to a cluster and to see the benefits

38
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.050
of using this domain load in full HA cluster.

39
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.090
So we'll go ahead and stop the

40
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.050
server group by clicking the link,

41
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.020
and then you'll see that the two servers

42
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.080
are processing this request followed by a success

43
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
that the main server group has been stopped.

44
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.010
Next, click on the server groups

45
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.040
in the left navigation panel,

46
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.040
and then click the plus button to add a new server group.

47
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.090
We'll call this server group our

48
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.070
hplus-sport-sg for server group.

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.090
In the profile we'll give it a full HA

50
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.060
and use a full HA socket, and click add.

51
00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.080
Next with the h sport-sg selected in the server column,

52
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.060
click the plus icon to add a new server.

53
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.030
We'll call this our hplus-server-001,

54
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.060
and we'll leave the other fields blank and click add.

55
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.030
We'll do this again, type hplus-server-002,

56
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.050
leave the fields blank and click add.

57
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.010
Click on the server one and in the dropdown click start

58
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.060
and this will take a couple of seconds

59
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.050
but should work right away.

60
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.000
Next, click hplus-server two and click start.

61
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.030
Hmm, it fails.

62
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.050
If we click on view we can see the attributes

63
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.020
and basically this server has failed to start

64
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.070
because the port offset is still set to zero.

65
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.010
Let's edit this and change the port offset

66
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.050
to one and then click save.

67
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:16.030
Now let's click back and click restart.

68
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.070
So we created hplus-sport-sg and two servers.

69
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.020
Let's go ahead and deploy our hplus app

70
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.060
to the server group and see what happens.

71
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.000
Clicking on the deployments tab at the top,

72
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.090
then on the server groups in the left navigation,

73
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.020
and then clicking on the hplus-sport-sg.

74
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.070
From here click on the plus icon,

75
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.030
upload new deployment, choose file, drag it here.

76
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.050
For this video we're going to be

77
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.010
using practice file 03_08 begin.

78
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.060
I've already compiled mine, if you haven't please do so now.

79
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:06.000
Navigating to 03_08 begin, build, libs, hplus WAR,

80
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.010
click open, next, and finish.

81
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.070
From here click close, and now we will enable the WAR.

82
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.050
So click enable, go back to the runtime tab,

83
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.020
inside of our hplus-sport and clicking

84
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.030
on our individual servers we see at the bottom

85
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.070
under web, deployment, our hplus WAR.

86
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.010
If we click on 02, under web,

87
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.090
deployment, we also see our hplus WAR.

88
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.080
Clicking on this deployment link

89
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.030
in a new tab shows the application.

90
00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:04.090
If we click on server one, web, deployment, on a new tab,

91
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.070
it shows 80 80, and this one's 80 81.

92
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.060
So that's all at this point.

93
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.050
Just like our other application servers,

94
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.020
Tomcat, WebLogic, and Jboss WildFly,

95
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.050
they're all set up for load balancing

96
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.000
with NF5 or through Hapache HTTP server.
