00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] H Plus IT Director likes

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.050
the progress you've made so far and now desires

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.060
that we look at the clustering

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.090
ability available in WebLogic.

5
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.070
From the WebLogic console, click on the environment link

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.080
and then on servers,

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.060
and you should see a table of available servers.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.000
Next, we're going to click the lock and edit,

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.020
going to add new, we'll type in Hplus dash MS dash one.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.060
Because our server instances reside on the same machine,

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.010
we're going to leave the listener address empty.

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.030
Going to change the port to 8001,

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.040
because it does reside on the same address

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.060
and we can't have any conflicts.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.010
I'll click next and finish.

16
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040
I'm going to do this again.

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.000
Going to type Hplus dash MS dash two,

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.040
going to change this one to 9001,

19
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.070
click next, and finish,

20
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.070
and don't forget to click activate changes.

21
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.080
Right now the state says these are shut down,

22
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.080
their health is unreachable

23
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.040
and they're listening on these ports.

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.060
So let's go to our terminal window,

25
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.000
we're going to click new and then new again,

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.050
because we need to have two windows

27
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.040
for what we're about to do.

28
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.070
Let's make sure we're in the home directory, we are.

29
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.030
So we're going to type Oracle, Middleware, Oracle Home,

30
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.030
user projects, domains, hplus domain, bin,

31
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.030
then we're going to say start manage WebLogic server.

32
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.090
We'll type hplus ms one,

33
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.040
then we're going to use the t3 protocol.

34
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.080
Type localhost and then the port of the admin server.

35
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.060
We'll hit enter.

36
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.010
And you'll notice that this prompts us

37
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.080
for a username and password again.

38
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.000
And we'll address that in a moment

39
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.090
by going into the appropriate folder

40
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.010
and adding a boot dot properties file.

41
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.080
So this command and its parameters

42
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.070
tells the start manage node SA script

43
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.010
to start the hplus ms one node that we created.

44
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.080
And it tells it to connect it to

45
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.090
the administrative server running on port 7001.

46
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.050
The t3 protocol is a proprietary Oracle WebLogic protocol

47
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.060
used for connecting these servers.

48
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.050
It'll create a folder in the server's directory

49
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.040
containing the admin server called hplus ms one.

50
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.010
As you saw, we had to enter the username and password,

51
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.040
like we did earlier.

52
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.030
And we're going to create a boot properties

53
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.060
and to do that, I'm going to kill our instance

54
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.030
and we're going to navigate to

55
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.020
the Oracle, Middleware, Home,

56
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.050
user projects domains, hplus domain.

57
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.040
We're going to go to the servers our hplus ms one directory.

58
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.020
Hit enter and inside of here,

59
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.010
we're going to create a security directory.

60
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.040
And we'll go into the security directory,

61
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.030
we'll say vi boot properties.

62
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.090
Go to insert mode and we'll type username WebLogic,

63
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.080
password mysecret escape, right, quit.

64
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080
Now WebLogic will take that

65
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.020
and hash that properties file for us.

66
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.080
We're going to come all the way back out,

67
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.080
go to Oracle, Middleware, user projects,

68
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.050
domains, bin, start, manage WebLogic server,

69
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:04.050
hplus dash ms dash one, use our t3 protocol again,

70
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.060
local host, colon, 7001, hit enter.

71
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.000
We shouldn't be prompted for a password this time,

72
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.020
it should load right up.

73
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.050
We're going to do the same thing in the next window.

74
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.090
Type Oracle, Middleware, Home, User projects,

75
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.070
domains, hplus domain, bin, start,

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.010
manage WebLogic, this time it's hplus ms dash two,

77
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.090
use our t3 protocol, local host colon 7001, hit enter.

78
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.090
Again this is going to prompt us for our user name

79
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.030
and password so we're going to kill it right there.

80
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.040
And we're going to cd into the Oracle, Middleware,

81
00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.050
Oracle Home, user projects, domains, servers,

82
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.000
and we should see our hplus two.

83
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.020
Going to make a security directory like we did before.

84
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:26.030
Vi to our boot dot properties, username WebLogic,

85
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:34.080
password my secret right that, exit.

86
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.060
Go back out through our home directory

87
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:47.000
and we'll start this managed note again.

88
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.040
Hplus dash ms dash two, our t3 protocol,

89
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.050
local host 7001, hit enter.

90
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.060
Okay so both of these servers are started up,

91
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.050
the credentials are added, and they're both running,

92
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.030
so let's go back to our browser,

93
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.030
we'll click the refresh icon,

94
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.020
and we should get some good information here in a moment.

95
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.030
Now all these are running,

96
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.030
so our next step is to add these to a cluster.

97
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:28.080
To create a cluster, we're going to click lock and edit,

98
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.080
click Clusters, click new, cluster,

99
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.040
and we're going to call this a hplus cluster.

100
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.050
Keep it as unicast,

101
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.040
we'll select that the port is still 7001,

102
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.060
click okay, going to click into this again

103
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060
and look around a little bit.

104
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.070
You'll notice that the load algorithm is round robin,

105
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.060
you can change this if you wanted to

106
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.070
and of course we can always click on the more info

107
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.000
for other options.

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.010
Activate the changes.

109
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.090
So on the configuration tab, we're going go to the servers,

110
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:22.040
and click lock and edit,

111
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.020
come down here and click add,

112
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.090
going to select existing server, click next.

113
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.030
As you can see from the message here

114
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.040
we have to stop the server before we can continue.

115
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.080
So we're going to go back to our servers,

116
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:48.000
go to the control, and force a shutdown now.

117
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.090
Yes, now we're going to go back to our clusters,

118
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.050
click on our cluster, go to servers,

119
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.020
scroll to the bottom, and to add the ms one,

120
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:06.040
click next, add the second one,

121
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.040
going to activate our changes, come back to our servers,

122
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.080
we'll go to our control.

123
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.090
The servers are shut down so we're going to need

124
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.040
to start these up.

125
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.090
We'll go to the command line.

126
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.030
We'll type Oracle, Middleware, Oracle Home,

127
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:31.070
user projects, domains, bin, start, manage server.

128
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:41.010
We'll again specify our ms one, use our t3 protocol,

129
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.070
hit enter, do the same thing over here.

130
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.090
Luckily we can just hit our up arrow

131
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.080
and do that over again.

132
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.030
Come back to our browser, click on this refresh,

133
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.080
and now they're running.

134
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.090
The last thing we have to do here on this page

135
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.030
is deploy our application to the cluster.

136
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:13.070
So, for deployments you're going to click lock and edit,

137
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.090
minimize this, go to deployments,

138
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:30.040
we're going to stop the current deployment that's here,

139
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.010
'cause this will conflict with our new deployment

140
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.050
to the cluster.

141
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.070
Going to activate the changes and lock and edit again.

142
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.090
Click install, this time we're going to go to

143
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:50.070
Chapter two zero eight, if you have not compiled this

144
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.030
please compile it at this time.

145
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.050
Going to click next, click next again,

146
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.000
and now we have a cluster available.

147
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.060
We need to select the hplus cluster, click next,

148
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:14.030
and next, and finish.

149
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.080
Going to activate our changes.

150
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.040
Click on the control,

151
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.020
come down here and we will start servicing all requests.

152
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.020
Click yes, now the application is started,

153
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:34.000
go to monitoring, I'm sorry, go to testing,

154
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.030
and we can see that our application

155
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.000
is now deployed on both servers in the cluster.
