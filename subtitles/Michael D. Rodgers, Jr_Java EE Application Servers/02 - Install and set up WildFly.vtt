00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Narrator] Let's download and install

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.030
the latest release of WildFLy.

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.050
On this page I'm going to scroll down to version 15.0.1 final.

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.040
Click on the zip.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040
You may see a newer version depending

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.060
on when you watch this course.

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.020
After downloading, let's open the terminal window.

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.020
From the terminal, we'll type cd tilde downloads, hit enter.

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.080
Next, we'll list and sort the

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070
directory to see what we have.

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.060
From here we see we have our WidlFly zip.

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.020
So we're going to copy our WildFly zip

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.040
to our home directory.

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.050
By using the tilde at the end.

15
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.000
That will navigate back to our home directory.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.080
See the WildFly?

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.080
We're going to unzip WildFly.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.090
And once it's done unzipping the file.

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.070
We're going to cd into WildFLy final.

20
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's clear this out.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.060
List our directories.

22
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.020
And JBoss and WildFLy come with several profiles

23
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.050
that you can start the application server with.

24
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.090
These web profiles are used at startup

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.000
to control what Java EE modules are made available

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.020
to the system.

27
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.060
In general, these profiles are controlled

28
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.050
by x amount configuration.

29
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.020
Files in two broad categories.

30
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.000
A standalone and a domain.

31
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Standalone means what its name suggests.

32
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.010
When you start JBoss or WildFly using the bin,

33
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.020
standalone, dot, sh.

34
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.060
Or dot BAT file.

35
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.040
It will start the application server with a simple

36
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.030
Jave EE web profile.

37
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.080
That stands independent of any application servers.

38
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
Looking at the WildFly admin guide, it tells us that

39
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.020
it's not necessary to use a manage domain.

40
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.050
And for these we can just use the standalone mode.

41
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.010
Let's go back to the terminal window, here.

42
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.000
And hit enter.

43
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.010
In this command, let's see what happens in standalone mode.

44
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030
Now the logs demonstrate what Java EE modules

45
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090
are loaded into the server memory and made available

46
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.000
to the application that you might deploy.

47
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.010
If we scroll up, we'll see that the EJB3 modules are loaded.

48
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.080
To better demonstrate these differences,

49
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
let's go back again.

50
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.010
Kill the process.

51
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.070
We'll type bin, standalone.

52
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.070
And this time we'll run the server in full standalone mode.

53
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.050
We'll do that by typing dash, dash, server config,

54
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.080
equals standalone, dash,

55
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.010
full, dot XML.

56
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.070
And hit enter.

57
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.040
Again, several modules are loaded.

58
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.040
But in particular, as we scroll up,

59
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.050
you'll now notice that the ActiveMQ modules

60
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.050
are loaded into the standalone mode.

61
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.020
Now let's a look and find where these modules

62
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.070
are located at.

63
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.040
If we open a new terminal window.

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.040
And go into our WildFly directory again.

65
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.010
We can do an ls, dash, la.

66
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.090
On our standalone configuration.

67
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.080
And see that there are several XML files

68
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.060
that are made available.

69
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.000
These XML files tell what profile

70
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.030
should be loaded into standalone mode.

71
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.020
Additionally, you may have the need to create

72
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.090
your own web profile.

73
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030
And you can do this by copying

74
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.060
one of these standalone XML files.

75
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.040
By the way, we're running the command;

76
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
bin, slash, standalone, dot sh.

77
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.070
It implicitly runs the application

78
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.020
in the default standalone mode.

79
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.070
Which is what we have listed here.

80
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.090
You can also specify this of course.

81
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.030
If we go back to our other window.

82
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.010
Kill the process again.

83
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.000
Type bin, standalone, dash, dash, server.

84
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.090
Config equals standalone dot XML.

85
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.070
Hit enter.

86
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.000
Domain mode is one of the primary

87
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
new features of WildFly.

88
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.080
And has the ability to manage multiple WildFly instances

89
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.000
from a single control point.

90
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.050
A collection of such servers is referred to as a

91
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.040
member of the domain.

92
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.050
With a single domain controller.

93
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.030
Process, acting as a central management control point.

94
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.090
Let's kill the current process.

95
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.050
And kick-off the server in domain mode.

96
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.080
We'll do this by typing bin, domain, dot sh.

97
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.090
And hit enter.

98
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.010
In the logs, we'll see a line saying starting server-one.

99
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.090
And starting server-two.

100
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.080
Here's our server-one.

101
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.030
And registering our server two-process.

102
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.000
Starting server-two.

103
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And registering server-two.

104
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.070
In our other terminal window.

105
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.040
If we type, let's clear this out.

106
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.000
Ps dash ef, pipe, grep, Java.

107
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.060
This will show up all of the processes kicked-off

108
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.000
by this domain, dot sh.

109
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.060
If we scroll up.

110
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.040
We'll see that the process controller was started.

111
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.040
We see a host controller was started.

112
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.000
We also see that the server-one was started.

113
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.080
And that a server-two was started.

114
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.040
For a total of four processes.

115
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.050
We'll cover more of configuring domain mode later on

116
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.000
in this chapter.
