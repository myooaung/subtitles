00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.060
- [Michael] Do you use Java Enterprise Edition functionality

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.000
and need help deciding which Java application server best

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.060
fits your needs or of your organization?

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.040
Then join me in this course

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
as I explore the top four Java application servers

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Apache Tomcat, Oracle Weblogic,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.090
JBoss Wildfly, and GlassFish or Payara.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.090
In looking at these four application servers I'll walk you

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.080
through installing and configuring each.

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll also troubleshoot issues

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.080
in migrating a simple Java EE application across each

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.030
of these four serve platforms.

13
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
Then demonstrate in a very simplified manner,

14
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.060
adjusting the applications codebase

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.020
to work work on a work on a supported

16
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.080
or certified Java EE container.

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
I'll also consider the various ways to deploy applications.

18
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.060
In this course I use

19
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.050
an example company called Hplus Sport Beverage.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.060
I'll walk you through how to upgrade

21
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.000
and modify a sample web application,

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.090
across various Java web application server containers.

23
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.080
My name is Michael Rodgers, join me as I explore

24
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010
and demonstrate how to install, configure, deploy,

25
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.060
and handle the various Java application servers

26
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.000
using Tomcat, Weblogic, Wildfly, and Payara.
