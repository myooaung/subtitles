00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] The Hplus IT directors asked

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080
if we have configured the Payara server database resources.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.010
And so, we're off to our next task.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.070
Again, with the Payara Glassfish server started,

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.050
we're going to add our MySQL database driver

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.030
to the Payara instance using the CLI.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:29.040
By typing bin/asadmin add-library,

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.020
and then we're going to go to our downloads,

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.090
select the database driver,

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020
and hit enter.

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.050
This will prompt us for a username, we'll type admin,

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.050
and a password.

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.090
If everything was successful,

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.040
we should see a command that says

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.030
add-library executed successfully.

16
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.000
Alright, so now let's open back up our browser,

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.070
then go to the resources,

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.050
and select JDBC,

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.050
and then JDBC Connection Pools.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.000
You'll notice that on this page,

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.020
there are a couple of different connection pools already.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.080
Keep in mind, these are here for examples,

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.010
and not meant for production.

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.020
We'll click on the New buttton,

25
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.090
and in the Pool Name, I'm going to put HplusPool.

26
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.010
In the Resource Type, I'll select javax.sql.DataSource.

27
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
For Database Driver, there are many listed here.

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.040
Scroll down till you get to MySql,

29
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.020
and then click next.

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.050
For this next window that opens,

31
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.090
in it, it has several input properties to fill out.

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.050
We need to replace the Datasource Classname dropdown.

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.090
So in the available field here,

34
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.040
we will modify this to use

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:16.090
com.mysql.cj.jdbc.MysqlDataSource.

36
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.050
We have to use this instead,

37
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.050
otherwise the connection will fail.

38
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.040
Next, we're going to enable the ping

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.090
so that when we're done with this pool,

40
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.060
it will automatically let us know

41
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
if it's succeeded in connecting with the database.

42
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090
We'll leave the rest of these properties as they are,

43
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.020
and skip down to the table at the very bottom.

44
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.000
In this table,

45
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.080
we'll have to ignore some properties

46
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.010
and add other properties in there stead.

47
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.090
This is because the MySQL database and driver we are using.

48
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.020
For password, enter My$3cret.

49
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.060
For databaseName, enter hplus_db.

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.090
Ignore the roleName property,

51
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.090
and the serverName, enter 127.0.0.1.

52
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.010
Ignore the datasourceName.

53
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.050
For the user, enter hplus_user.

54
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.030
We'll ignore the networkProtocol.

55
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.060
For portNumber, enter 3306.

56
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.070
Before we click finish,

57
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.000
we're going to change the networkProtocol,

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.090
and replace it with useSSL.

59
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.040
We'll set the value to false.

60
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.060
So again, we're ignoring the roleName,

61
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.030
and the datasourceName,

62
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.070
and we'll click finish.

63
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.000
Awesome, it worked!
