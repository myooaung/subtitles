00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] In order to install and set up Tomcat,

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.080
you first have to consider a few prerequisites.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.090
For Tomcat 9, which we'll be using,

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.080
you must have Java 8 or later installed.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.020
You might other constraints to consider as well,

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.030
like what version of Java your organization supports

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.070
at present or particular API specs.

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.010
This table here gives a good amount of detail to consider.

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.030
Now, for this demo, we'll not be installing Tomcat

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.050
in a typical production scenario where you might have

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.040
a Windows service or Linux service set up.

12
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.000
We will simply copy the core files over and get it running.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.080
With that in mind, you can go here to Tomcat 9.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.050
Click on it, then scroll down

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.080
to version 9.0.16, to Core, then to zip.

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.030
Click and download.

17
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.060
And again remember, you will need to have

18
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.020
at least Java 8 installed and it's a good idea

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.060
to have that complete before you go any further.

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.040
Now, once the latest version of Tomcat is fully downloaded,

21
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.010
on a Mac or Windows, open up a command prompt,

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.020
and we're going to copy

23
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.020
the version of Tomcat to our home directory.

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
And then from there we're going to unzip it.

25
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.050
Both machines typically decompress these file formats,

26
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.030
leaving you a directory entitled apache-tomcat

27
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.040
with the version number.

28
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.090
We'll go ahead and cd into the directory.

29
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.030
Inside the Tomcat directory, we need to do a few things.

30
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.050
So let's go ahead and navigate into the bin directory.

31
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.090
On a Mac we need to pay attention to the startup.sh,

32
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.000
the shutdown.sh, and the catalina.sh.

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.080
So what we're going to do,

34
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080
we'll need to make these executable.

35
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.010
We'll type chmod +x startup.sh,

36
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.000
chmod +x catalina.sh,

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.060
chmod +x shutdown.sh.

38
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.090
This will allow us to start up Tomcat

39
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.080
using the command ./startup.sh.

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.040
So we'll do that now, ./startup.sh.

41
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.020
And this will spit out a few log statements

42
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.070
saying that CATALINA_BASE and some other things

43
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.000
followed that Tomcat started.

44
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.070
Now we're going to open up a browser window.

45
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.040
Type in localhost:8080 and hit Enter.

46
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.050
You should see a green banner

47
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.070
for Apache Tomcat server that says

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.020
if you're seeing this,

49
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.060
you've successfully installed Tomcat.

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030
Congratulations!

51
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.020
Now, the next step is to stop the server

52
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.060
from the command line.

53
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.050
We'll go back to the terminal to type shutdown.

54
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.020
Again you should see some log statements

55
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.090
saying that CATALINA_BASE and other things.

56
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.000
It won't show a Tomcat stopped message,

57
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.070
but trust me, it is.

58
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.080
We can go back to the same browser window

59
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.090
and verify that it's stopped, which after refreshing,

60
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.050
you'll get a message saying it can't be reached.

61
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.000
This indicates that the shutdown script worked.
