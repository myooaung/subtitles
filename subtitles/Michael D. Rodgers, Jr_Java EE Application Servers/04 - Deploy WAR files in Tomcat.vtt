- [Instructor] Management at H+ Sport Beverage

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.000
has request that we go forward with deploying

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.030
of our application to the Apache Tomcat server.

4
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.040
We know this will be the first

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.020
in a series of deployments where we'll later add

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.060
to our app, Java EE, and database calls.

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.070
There are two ways you can deploy WAR files.

8
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.060
We're going to first consider how to use Tomcat manager app.

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.010
Now by default, Apache Tomcat comes pre-installed

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.040
with a manager application.

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.050
As you remember, the manager app dashboard console

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.010
shows you all the web applications deployed

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
and then below this, you have a section

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.000
with different text fields for deploying WAR files.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.040
We'll skip this one and go on down to a second one,

16
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.070
where it says WAR file to deploy.

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.080
Now before we can deploy our WAR file,

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
we need to make sure that our practice files,

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.080
under 01_04_begin are compiled.

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.090
Using a terminal window, we'll navigate to this location,

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:11.030
and we'll run the command gradle clean build.

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.020
Back in our browser, we're going to navigate to Choose File.

23
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:27.060
We'll select the practice file.

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030
And we'll deploy it.

25
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.020
Now on the screen, it should show a file

26
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050
like what you see here.

27
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.040
From there, you can lick on the path name,

28
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.000
and this will take you to the application.

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.010
Okay, so the second way of deploying an app

30
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.090
is navigating back to the web apps.

31
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.080
But before we do that, we're going to

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.010
stop this application and undeploy it,

33
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.030
going to navigate to our command line.

34
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.010
And since we're already in the directory

35
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.020
where we've built, we're going to copy from the build,

36
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.050
libs, hplus-0.0.10-SNAPSHOT.war.

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.020
And we're going to copy this to

38
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.010
our Apache Tomcat web apps folder.

39
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.070
This is the second way of deploying an application,

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.020
by copying it directly to the web apps folder.

41
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.010
Now if we go back again to our web console,

42
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.010
we click List Applications,

43
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.060
we'll notice that the hplus WAR app is now deployed again.

44
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000
And there you go.
