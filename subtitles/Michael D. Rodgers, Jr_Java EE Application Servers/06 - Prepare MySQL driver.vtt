00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.010
- [Instructor] WebLogic currently has a version 5 driver,

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.080
and we're using a MySQL version 8 driver.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.040
How do we solve this?

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.080
There's a couple ways we're going to do this,

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.020
and this would really work with any driver

6
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.020
that's not compatible with WebLogic.

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.090
The first thing we're going to do

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090
is going to switch back to our terminal,

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.080
I'm going to stop the WebLogic instance,

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.040
then we're going to CD to the Oracle Middleware,

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.070
Oracle Common, modules, driver.

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
And the modules common directory

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.000
contains all the various libraries and drivers

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.030
that are needed by WebLogic, including MySQL version 5.

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.010
We're going to do two things.

16
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.030
First, I've already downloaded and unzipped

17
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.050
the latest MySQL version 8 driver,

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.010
and we can see that the version 5 driver

19
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.010
is here in the modules directory by typing "grep MySQL".

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.060
What we're going to do is copy the latest version,

21
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.000
going to paste it here, we'll do a grep again,

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.020
now we can see both.

23
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.050
The second thing we're going to do

24
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.080
is rename the directory for the version 5 driver,

25
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.060
and the reason we have to do this

26
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.010
is because the driver name and the location

27
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.080
are listed in a meta INF file,

28
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.000
which WebLogic loads into the classpath at startup.

29
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.060
Now, according to WebLogic, if you are going to load

30
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090
an identical driver into the modules folder,

31
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.030
you must either remove it or rename it.

32
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090
What we're going to do here is we're going to rename

33
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.010
the version 5 driver, we'll do that

34
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.010
by typing move MySQL, and we'll call this bac,

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.040
and I'm just going to keep the same name.

36
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.070
Now if we do LS grep again, we can see

37
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.010
that the only two drivers we have are those.

38
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.030
The second thing we need to do is we need to change

39
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.040
the set domain and environment .sh script,

40
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.070
and this is where the drivers are loaded,

41
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.040
so I'm going to CD back to my home directory

42
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040
and I'm going to type VI, Oracle, Middleware,

43
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.050
Oracle Home, user projects, domains, H plus, bin,

44
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.070
and Set Domain Environment script.

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.010
We'll scroll down here to right below the comments,

46
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.000
hit I for insert mode, hit enter a couple times,

47
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.010
and enter a comment, and the comment

48
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.060
I'm going to make here is basically

49
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.070
that we are setting and modifying classpath

50
00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.040
to put MySQL driver on classpath.

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.000
We'll hit enter, and I have the name

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.090
of this file stored over here in our samples,

53
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.060
so I'm going to copy this to make it quicker for us.

54
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.060
Come in here, we'll type classpath equals,

55
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.040
paste that in, and then we're going to say

56
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:34.010
colon, dollar sign, curly brackets, classpath,

57
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.070
close curly bracket, close quote.

58
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.050
Now we hit the escape key, W, colon, Q to quit,

59
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.080
and this will ensure that the driver's on the classpath

60
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.020
when we restart the server.

61
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.090
So we've changed the name of the original driver folder

62
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.080
and our modules directory by prepending it with bac,

63
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.040
we've copied the latest MySQL driver

64
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.080
and we've changed the classpath

65
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
to include a reference to the driver.

66
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.030
So the next step is to restart the WebLogic server.

67
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:14.030
We'll do that by going into.

68
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.050
Once this is done, we're going to scroll up here

69
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:22.020
and locate the name of the WebLogic driver

70
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.000
that was loaded into the classpath.

71
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.060
Scroll up, there's a huge section here of drivers

72
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.090
and we can see it's located right there.

73
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.000
There is our MySQL connector driver.
