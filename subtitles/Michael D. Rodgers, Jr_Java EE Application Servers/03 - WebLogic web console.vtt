00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] If you have not started WebLogic,

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.070
we'll do so here by running the following command

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.070
from our home directory.

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.010
We'll type Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:20.020
domains/hplus_domain/bin/startWebLogic

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.080
and this will prompt us again

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.030
for our password and credentials.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.050
So with the application,

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.010
now we'll wait for that magic log message that says

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
server state changed to running.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.080
With this in mind, let's stop this server

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.030
and we're going to add credentials to a boot.properties file

13
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.050
so WebLogic will start automatically

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.050
without asking us for that information.

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.010
We're going to cd into the Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.030
user_projects/domains/hplus_domain/server/AdminServer

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.020
and we're going to make a directory called security.

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.040
Inside security,

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.020
we're going to create a boot.properties file.

20
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.070
In here, we will type username=weblogic

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.030
and password=My$3cret.

22
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.020
Save that, close it.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.060
I'm going to go back to the home directory.

24
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.060
We'll type Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/

25
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.060
user_projects/domains/hplus_domain/bin/startWebLogic

26
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.030
and what you'll notice now is that we're not prompted

27
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020
for the username and password

28
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.000
and now we see server state has changed to running.

29
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.010
With WebLogic started and running,

30
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.060
let's navigate back to our browser.

31
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.050
We'll refresh this,

32
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.070
type in our password.

33
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.000
By the way, the boot.properties only affects the startup,

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.080
not the login from the web console.

35
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.040
The WebLogic administrative console

36
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.090
allows you to do a number of things.

37
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.020
We're going to quickly walk through user account

38
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.000
and modification, deletion, and creation.

39
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We'll click on the Security Realms

40
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.060
and then click on My Realm on the table.

41
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.080
And once the page reloads, click on Users and Groups.

42
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.070
You should see a table that appears with a list of users.

43
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.000
We're going to click on WebLogic

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.070
and then on the password tab.

45
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.050
I'm not going to change the password here,

46
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.060
but this is where you would do it.

47
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.050
Okay, so we're going to go back to Users and Groups

48
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.020
and we're going to create a new user,

49
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.090
click on New,

50
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.080
and in the name we'll type hplus_user.

51
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.090
We'll identify this

52
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:28.040
as the Hplus Sport user for deploying war files.

53
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.070
And in the password I'm going to use our default My$3cret.

54
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.010
This goes without saying

55
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.060
that you don't want to do this in production.

56
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.080
And then we're going to click OK.

57
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.080
Now we're back on the Users and Groups screen

58
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.010
and if we click on the hplus_user again,

59
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.050
we can configure his permissions and rights.

60
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.020
We'll click on the Groups tab

61
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.010
and this will show us all of the available groups

62
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.040
in the system.

63
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.070
For our purposes, we'll make this person a deployer,

64
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.060
monitor,

65
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.010
operator,

66
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.000
and an app tester

67
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.080
and we'll click the arrow to bring those over,

68
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.020
then we'll click Save.

69
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.030
So let's test our user.

70
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.020
We'll click Logout.

71
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.040
Type hplus_user,

72
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.050
type our password.

73
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.050
We're going to navigate back to the Security Realms

74
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.050
and to My Realm and then the Users and Groups,

75
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.010
where we were before,

76
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.000
and you'll notice they don't have permissions

77
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.030
to change or add users

78
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.030
which is because we've only given them limited permissions.

79
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.000
They will however have rights to deploy applications.
