00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] With the payara server started

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.030
and the administrative console open,

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.070
at local host 4848,

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.020
you would have noticed that it does not prompt

5
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.050
for a password.

6
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.090
Before we address that,

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.090
let's look at some of the basic features,

8
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.000
offered here, in payara.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.030
Payara 5 administrative console,

10
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.090
has a long deheader,

11
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.040
a listing of the current user logged in,

12
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.070
the domain and the machine.

13
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.020
On the left hand side is the navigation menu.

14
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.020
The navigation menu bar lists common tasks,

15
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.060
at the top,

16
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.020
which by default is open quickly addressing things

17
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.070
like changing the administrative password,

18
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.080
monitoring data and logs,

19
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.070
creating new JDBC resources

20
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.010
and over here,

21
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.030
listing applications and deploying applications.

22
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.080
The common task section

23
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.040
groups together, common tasks

24
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.040
that you would most routinely access.

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.070
Without getting too bogged down in

26
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.010
going through each of the items on the left navigation,

27
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.060
let's focus on changing the password.

28
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.040
We can access this functionality

29
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.000
through the common task section

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.040
by clicking on administrative password.

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Or, we can come over here,

32
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.090
click on the domain link

33
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090
and click on administrative password.

34
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.000
From here, you would type in your password.

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.020
You might have guessed what I'm going to type here.

36
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.060
My secret,

37
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.050
that again,

38
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.070
is capital M Y $ 3 C R E T

39
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.070
and at this point we'll click save.

40
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.040
Okay, with that done,

41
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.010
let's click the home button at the top.

42
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.010
After that, it refreshes us and

43
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.050
we have a log out link.

44
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.030
Let's click that.

45
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.010
Confirm our logout.

46
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.020
So now, we see a login screen.

47
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.080
Our user is admin

48
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.000
and our password is M Y $ 3 C R E T.

49
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.020
Enter.

50
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.060
Let's stop the server and see what happens now.

51
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.020
We'll type bin.asadmin stop-domain domain1

52
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020
hit enter.

53
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.050
Notice that I put domain1 after stop-domain

54
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.010
this is really a good habit to get into

55
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.060
because domain1, as we'll get into later,

56
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.040
could be named differently.

57
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.030
So let's go ahead and start our domain back up.

58
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:37.020
We'll type bin/asadmin start-domain domain1

59
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.060
hit enter.

60
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm going to go back to our

61
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.060
browser here

62
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.060
and I'm going to close this incognito window.

63
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
And open a new incognito window.

64
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.070
Going to type in localhost:4848

65
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.040
hit enter.

66
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040
And notice that we're prompted for our username

67
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.050
and password again.

68
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.030
So we've entered our credentials.

69
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.020
We have changed them.

70
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.040
So how about we do this through the CLI.

71
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.010
To do this we're going to go back now and

72
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.090
blow away our installation and start over.

73
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.060
So let's close the browser window.

74
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
We're going to go back to our terminal.

75
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.030
We're going to stop the asadmin service.

76
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.090
Go ahead and close this window here.

77
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.090
(typing)

78
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.050
And we're going to remove payara.

79
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.040
See it's gone.

80
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.070
Now we're going to unzip payara again.

81
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.090
CD back into the server.

82
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.090
(typing)

83
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:09.040
Type bin/asadmin start-domain domain1.

84
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.090
Now we're going to use the CLI to change the password

85
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.040
but the domain has to be started first.

86
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.060
So next, from the command line

87
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.030
we're going to type

88
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:29.030
bin/asadmin change-admin-password

89
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.070
and hit enter.

90
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.060
This will give you

91
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.090
a default user admin,

92
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.000
so just hit enter.

93
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.070
Next it prompts you for an admin password.

94
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.030
But because we have just wiped out

95
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.000
the payara5 installation and started over,

96
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.050
leave this blank for now and hit enter.

97
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.030
From reviewing stack overflow and other blogs,

98
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.010
this seems to throw a lot of people off.

99
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.020
So, now it's going to ask for a new admin password.

100
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.040
I'm going to type my favorite password,

101
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.080
my secret, hit enter.

102
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.050
And confirm.

103
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.080
If you did everything correctly,

104
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.040
you should see a message,

105
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.020
command change-admin-password

106
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.060
executed successfully.

107
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Switching back to our browser,

108
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.000
put a new incognito window,

109
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.070
localhost:4848, hit enter.

110
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:29.090
And it prompts us for our administrative password again.

111
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.080
So, we've changed the password

112
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.000
through the domain administrative console

113
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.090
and we've also changed it through the

114
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.000
command line interface.
