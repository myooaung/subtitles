1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] We got our VM instance running

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.070
so now let's make the configuration changes needed

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.080
to connect our domain application server to it.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.020
In our browser we'll log into Payara

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.040
and in the left navigation bar

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.090
we're going to click on nodes.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to create a new node.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.060
Click new.

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
We'll enter something descriptive here.

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:36.060
Type vbox dash aura Linux.

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.090
We'll choose our type as SSH.

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.050
If you remembered before,

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.090
for Windows users you can use DCOM.

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.080
We're going to use SSH facilities.

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.040
In the host port we're going to enter the IP address

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.030
of our Linux instance.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000
Going to switch back to the terminal

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.020
which we're still SSHed into at this point

19
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.080
and type if config to retrieve our IP address.

20
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.000
This is 10.35.3.112.

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.060
Come back here we'll type 10 dot 35 dot 3 dot 112.

22
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
For the node directory, I'll type home, vagrant

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.010
'cause that is the user and we'll type Payara five

24
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.000
and in the installation directory,

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.060
copy this and paste the same information.

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.090
We're going to click install Payara server.

27
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.000
Force the node to be created.

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.080
We'll change the username to vagrant

29
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.070
and for the SSH authentication,

30
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.010
we'll choose password and the password again is vagrant.

31
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.090
And we'll go ahead and click okay.

32
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.000
Now we need to make sure we have all the details correct

33
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.010
and completed, otherwise we'll have to delete the node

34
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.020
and start over.

35
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.010
This may take a moment

36
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.080
depending on where your server is located.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.060
I've tried this on an AWS instance

38
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.020
but because of the upload speeds on my box,

39
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.020
the installation fails.

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.050
There's even a GitHub bug concerning

41
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.090
the zip directory structure being corrupted

42
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.050
because of this.

43
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.040
The recommendation is that the Linux server nodes

44
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.070
be relatively geographically close or have very

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.050
excellent bandwidth speeds between servers.

46
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070
Once we get past this and get a success message,

47
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.060
we should be able to ping the link.

48
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.070
Successfully made SSH connection to our vbox our Linux.

49
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.080
Let's go back to our terminal window now

50
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.020
and remember we're SSHed into our Linux instance.

51
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.080
If we do an LS dash LA now inside of this instance

52
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.010
we see our Payara five.

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.050
Let's CD into that.

54
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.040
We're going to LS dash LA here

55
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.030
and we see several directories created.

56
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.010
We have a bin, a glass fish, h2db, javadb,

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.060
meta INF, and an MQ.

58
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
Basically our Payara DAS server

59
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.060
has pushed and configured initial glass fish

60
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
installation structure.

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.010
Let's create our cluster configuration now.

62
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.090
Go back to your browser and in the configuration section

63
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.020
we'll click on new, and we'll type cluster config

64
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.080
and we'll base this off the default config and click okay.

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.090
As you can see here when we created the server instances

66
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.090
and you can go ahead and click on them as I just did

67
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.080
and we'll address how this happened in a moment.

68
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.030
Going back to the configurations,

69
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.050
the server configurations were created

70
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.030
when we created each of the individual instances.

71
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.040
Go back to the instances section

72
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.070
and I'll walk you through the recommended pattern

73
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.080
for adding a local and remote instance

74
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.030
to our deployment group.

75
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.020
Let's remove the previous.

76
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.030
We'll click stop on these first.

77
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.080
With the instances stopped,

78
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.090
we'll select those boxes and we'll click delete.

79
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.050
We'll add these back to work with

80
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.000
our new cluster configuration.

81
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.040
We'll click new, we'll enter our instance name

82
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.080
H plus dash server dash 001.

83
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.000
We'll select our deployment group, click add,

84
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.060
and then we'll select local host domain

85
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.040
and you can see now that the vbox

86
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.010
or our Linux instance exist.

87
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.040
We'll keep it on local host for now.

88
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.040
In our configuration, we'll choose cluster config

89
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.060
and it's important at this point that we select

90
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.080
reference the selected configuration

91
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.060
instead of make a copy.

92
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.040
We'll click okay.

93
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.060
We'll do this again.

94
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:31.060
H plus server 002, select our deployment group,

95
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.040
we'll keep local host the same, select cluster config,

96
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.010
click reference, click okay.

97
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.050
Before we add our Linux instance,

98
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.000
we have to resolve some weird vbox naming resolution issues.

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.030
Back in our terminal, mine is still connected via SSH.

100
00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:01.030
Type sudo VI etc host hit enter.

101
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.030
Right below the 127 hit I for insert

102
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.040
and we're going to type the IP address.

103
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.060
Type 10 dot 35 dot 3 dot 15

104
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.010
and we'll type in our host name of the machine.

105
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.050
We'll escape, right, and quit.

106
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.000
The reason we did this is because Payara sometimes

107
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.040
in connecting to a virtual box cannot resolve the name

108
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.080
and it creates some issues.

109
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.070
If the instance you have is configured by

110
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.010
your system admins, this should not be an issue for you

111
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.040
but this is a vbox instance.

112
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.040
You can alternatively skip this step

113
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.000
and watch it fail if you want

114
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.060
but you'll have to complete this to continue.

115
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.010
Now we'll add our remote Linux box instance to our cluster.

116
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.090
Go back to the browser, click new here.

117
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.030
We'll call this our H plus vbox dash 001.

118
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.040
We'll select our cluster, click add.

119
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.060
For our node this time we'll select

120
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.010
our vbox or Linux instance.

121
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.090
Our configuration will be cluster

122
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:21.050
and again, remember to select reference then click okay.

123
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.010
Remember how we turned the firewall off earlier

124
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.090
in our vbox Linux instance?

125
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.040
Well this is where it could come back to bite you

126
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.060
if you hadn't.

127
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.010
Please make sure your Linux admins help you with this

128
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.020
if you have not so let's start up our instances.

129
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.090
We'll first start with our Linux box.

130
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.040
Our Linux server instance is running.

131
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:52.060
Now we'll start the other two simultaneously.

132
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.080
Awesome.

133
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.030
Our last step is to deploy our H plus application

134
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.080
to our H plus server deployment group.

135
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:10.040
We'll go to applications, we'll undeploy it currently,

136
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:27.020
and we'll deploy again.

137
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.060
I'm going to select our H plus group,

138
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.020
click add and then okay and our application is deployed.

139
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.090
We'll click on the launch icon and as you can see

140
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.010
our instance exist on the virtual box instance

141
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.050
and on each of our two local instances.

142
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.050
To validate, we'll click on our virtual box instance

143
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.000
and the application's been deployed.
