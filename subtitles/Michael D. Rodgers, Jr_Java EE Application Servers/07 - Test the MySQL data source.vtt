00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Narrator] From our last video, we had entered

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.090
a classpath variable using a relative classpath.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.080
And according to web logic,

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.080
relative classpaths will cause problems.

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.030
And indeed they do.

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.000
So what I want to show you real quick,

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.080
is how to fix this and how I fixed it.

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.020
You go into vi,

9
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.000
Oracle, user_projects/domains,

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.070
go to the bin directory,

11
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
the setDomain.

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.010
Hit enter, go down to mysql.

13
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.030
And what I want to show you is,

14
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.000
is what I've already fixed for you.

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.040
You need to use a absolute classpath

16
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.050
instead of a relative classpath.

17
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.040
Previously this was a relative classpath,

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.060
and you would've seen that in terms of a tilde symbol.

19
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.090
If you haven't made that change,

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.010
please make that change now in your set domain.

21
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.090
We'll exit out of this, we'll come back up,

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.040
and we'll start up WebLogic, create our data source.

23
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.070
We'll log in,

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.080
go down to data sources, click lock and edit,

25
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.060
click new, generic data source,

26
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.010
type in the name,

27
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.020
leave it as Global.

28
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.080
(clicking)

29
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080
Change your database driver, click next, next,

30
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.010
enter the name of the database, the host name,

31
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.060
the user,

32
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
and the password.

33
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.080
My secret.

34
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.020
Capital M-y-$-3-c-r-e-t.

35
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.060
We'll click next, going to test the configuration,

36
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.000
and now we have a successful test.

37
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.050
If we go back to our terminal window,

38
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.030
you'll see that a statement is made here

39
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.000
that the loading class is deprecated.

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That the new driver class name is com.mysql.cj.jdbc.

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.010
We're going to copy that, come back over here,

42
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.040
change the driver class name, click test again.

43
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.010
Everything is valid.

44
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.080
And click next.

45
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.050
We'll select the AdminServer, and then finish.

46
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.000
Then we'll close it by activating the changes.
