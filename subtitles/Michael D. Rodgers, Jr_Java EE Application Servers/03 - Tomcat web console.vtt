00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- Now, let's start Tomcat again

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.050
and go to the browser URL

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.040
and try to access some of these pre-installed apps.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.000
When you click on the manager app,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.070
it prompts us with basic auth dialogue

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.070
asking for our credentials.

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.080
If we click cancel and go back,

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.020
we're presented with a 401 Unauthorized screen,

9
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.000
but notice what the message on the screen tells us as well.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.090
It tells us how to set the privileges to these resources

11
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.020
in the conf Tomcat users xml.

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.010
The screen alerts us that Tomcat 7 onward

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.050
that you have to have a manager gui,

14
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.090
a manager-script, manager-jmx, and manager-status

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.050
that access these different pieces of functionality.

16
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.070
And these have to exist on a user with these roles.

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.040
So, let's configure that.

18
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.080
We'll switch over to our terminal window

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.050
and we'll navigate to the conf directory

20
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.030
and inside the conf directory you should see

21
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.050
a Tomcat dash users xml.

22
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.090
I've been using vi that it follows

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.010
and if you haven't learned vi now, this is a good time.

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.000
Inside this directory, type vi

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
tomcat-users.xml

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.030
We're going to scroll to the bottom

27
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.090
hit i to insert, hit enter,

28
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.030
and we're going to type

29
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.060
role, rolename equals,

30
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.020
our first one is going to be the manager-gui.

31
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.060
Do it again.

32
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.010
Role, rolename equals,

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.060
the next one will be the manager-status.

34
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000
I'll type role,

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.020
rolename equals,

36
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.050
admin-gui,

37
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.050
and then we're going to define our user.

38
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.040
User, username equals,

39
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.020
and I'm going to provide my name,

40
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.070
Michael,

41
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.060
with a password

42
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060
of s3cret.

43
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.050
Hit enter,

44
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.060
and type roles equals

45
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.040
and I'm going to basically

46
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.070
say gui,

47
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.090
manager-status,

48
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.050
and admin-gui.

49
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.040
And we'll hit the escape key,

50
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040
colon w to write it,

51
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.010
colon q to quit from vi.

52
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.020
From here, we need to stop and start Tomcat again

53
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.070
so we'll back out one directory.

54
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.010
Type bin, shutdown,

55
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.020
and then we'll do bin, startup,

56
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.090
now we'll navigate back to our Chrome browser,

57
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.080
we'll click back, refresh this, click on manager app,

58
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.000
we'll enter the username Michael, and the password

59
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.070
s3cret,

60
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.020
and voila, here we go.

61
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.060
Now we have access to the manager app.

62
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.040
If we go back,

63
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.020
click on the host manager,

64
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.030
we have access to the host manager as well.

65
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.020
Going back to the host manager one more time

66
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.040
we can see from here that we have a set of links

67
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.000
across the top,

68
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.030
we're looking at installed help documents,

69
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.090
for server status,

70
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.030
list of virtual hosts, and so forth.

71
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.070
Sometimes these are helpful to understand the basic

72
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.000
server information and memory questions you might have.

73
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.080
One last thing I'd like to cover before we exit,

74
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.030
and this concerns the port address that Tomcat runs on.

75
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.040
By default, it runs on 8080,

76
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.080
but you might want to change that

77
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.050
due to differing IT security roles.

78
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.030
To do this, we go back to the command line again,

79
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.060
we'll type vi,

80
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.070
conf, server xml,

81
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.070
and hit enter.

82
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.030
I'm going to type / 8080 to do a search

83
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.090
and this will bring us down to the connector port here

84
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.050
that has our Tomcat instance listening.

85
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.000
We'll type i again to insert,

86
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.090
going to change that to 8090,

87
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.090
hit escape, w to write,

88
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.070
q to quit,

89
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.040
and then we're going to stop our Tomcat instance,

90
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.030
we'll start it back up again,

91
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.020
switch back to our browser,

92
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.020
and, if we refresh this,

93
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.000
we'll notice we can't access the site anymore.

94
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.060
However, let's change it now to 8090,

95
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.000
hit enter, now our Tomcat instance is running

96
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
on 8090.
