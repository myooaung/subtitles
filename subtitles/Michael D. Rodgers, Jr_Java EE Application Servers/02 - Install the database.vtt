00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Instructor] Later on in our lessons

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.090
for each of our four Java EE Application servers

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.090
we'll need to have a mySQL database

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.050
installed and configured.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.020
In an effort to simplify this,

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.070
I provide an instructions to the practice files

7
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.080
which attempts to lay out installation processes

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.060
for Windows or Mac users.

9
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.070
This directory lists five files.

10
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.080
Please begin with the start_here.

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.000
This file will help you decide which path

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to take based on whether you're using Windows or Mac.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.070
Because I'm using a Mac, we'll start

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.020
with the brew_notes.

15
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.010
Opening our brew_notes,

16
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.050
our first task

17
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.080
is to copy this line right here,

18
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:52.020
and paste it into our terminal window.

19
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.030
This may take a few minutes to complete.

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.080
While this is installing, let me tell you about

21
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.030
Brew and what it provides.

22
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.050
Brew is a package management system,

23
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080
similar to Yum for Linux.

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.020
We'll be using Brew to install our

25
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.030
mySQL database instance.

26
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.070
Once Brew is finished, the next task

27
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.090
is to run brew update.

28
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.060
After this completes, we'll run the command

29
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.060
brew info mysql,

30
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.030
and this command will tell us

31
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.010
the version of mySQL that's available on the Brew system.

32
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.060
There's 8.0.

33
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.000
With that we'll type brew install mysql, hit enter.

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.040
This may take a moment to complete

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
based on your broadband speed.

36
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.060
With the installation complete,

37
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.030
we will install the Homebrew services piece

38
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.060
which configures the system to start up

39
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.030
some software libraries when the computer powers up.

40
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.080
I'm going to copy this from our command over here,

41
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.050
brew tap homebrew/services, paste that.

42
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.000
We'll follow this command up

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.030
with brew services start mysql,

44
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.020
which will add mySQL to the startup scripts

45
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.070
and start mySQL.

46
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.090
Then we'll run brew services list

47
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.080
to validate that mySQL has started.

48
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.050
With mySQL installed, we need to set the password.

49
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.000
This will be done in step eight of our brew notes.

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.060
Step eight of our brew notes tells us

51
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.030
to proceed to the mysql_login_details file.

52
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.030
First command we'll run is mysql -V.

53
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.070
This tells us the version of mySQL that's running.

54
00:02:50.070 --> 00:03:01.000
Next we'll type mysqladmin -u root password

55
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.010
and then our password.

56
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.080
Hit enter.

57
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.060
The error that we see at this point,

58
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.050
access denied for root at localhost

59
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.090
using password no is normal.

60
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.070
Next we'll type mysql root -p, hit enter.

61
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.060
This will prompt us for the password

62
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.040
that we just created, my secret, hit enter.

63
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.040
Try that again.

64
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.030
Mysql -u root -p, hit enter.

65
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.070
There we go.

66
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.040
Next we need to open up the hplus_db.spl script.

67
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.080
We're going to copy the entire contents

68
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.070
of this script and paste it into our mySQL prompt.

69
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.030
As you can see, that went very quickly.

70
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.080
If we scroll up, we can see that

71
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.050
there's a table created,

72
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.070
several insert statements,

73
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.020
that a user was created

74
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.020
with different permissions granted,

75
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.070
that the database was created.

76
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.080
Next we'll type quit and we'll log in again

77
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.070
with the user that was just created.

78
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.040
This will prompt us for our password.

79
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.070
We'll show the databases available for this user.

80
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.050
We'll use the hplus_db,

81
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.030
and we'll finish this up by running a select statement

82
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.060
on the table created.

83
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.090
And that's it, we're now ready to configure

84
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.030
our application servers to use the new

85
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.000
mySQL database and use your credentials.
