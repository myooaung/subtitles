00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] Knowing that H Plus

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.030
sports drink is pushing forward with deploying

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.040
the Tomcat app to WebLogic,

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.000
we know that there are difficulties

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we'll be facing ahead.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.050
In preparation for this, we have a stripped-down version

7
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.030
of our H Plus Java EE web app

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.010
for validating which Java EE dependencies will have to go.

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.010
This app contains less features

10
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.070
than the one we used in our earlier video for Tomcat.

11
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.060
For this video, please have your practice

12
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.040
files available for 0204_begin.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.050
The practice files in this lesson

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
are a version of the ones used to run on Tomcat.

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.090
This lesson will focus on how to modify

16
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.010
a Tomcat web app to run on WebLogic

17
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.040
and how the deployment process in WebLogic 12C works.

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.060
Keep in mind, most production web applications

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.050
are much more complex than our practice files,

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.090
so when doing this in production,

21
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090
be prepared to have to modify much more

22
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.050
dependencies and other files.

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.070
Since our scenario is that H Plus sports drink

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.020
is wanting to migrate to WebLogic 12C

25
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.030
to take advantage of the whizzbang features,

26
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.010
it's helpful to know that the change you have to make

27
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.000
to the web app in order for it to be deployed.

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.080
So let's go ahead and compile our application.

29
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.020
And then we're going to switch to our browser,

30
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.090
go to the main screen of the WebLogic console,

31
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.060
and we're going to click on Deployments.

32
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.070
Now, in order to make changes here,

33
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.040
we first have to click the Lock and Edit button.

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.090
The Lock and Edit button is always here

35
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.070
in production mode, but not in develop mode.

36
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.070
WebLogic states that this is a safety feature

37
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.080
to ensure that no one else can makes changes

38
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.000
in a production system while you're making changes.

39
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.060
Now, go ahead and click on the Install button.

40
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.040
We're going to navigate to the 024 begin,

41
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
our build, libs, and the WAR file.

42
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.030
Click Next, click Next again, Next, and then Finish.

43
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.080
On the next page, we'll see a button

44
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.060
that says to activate our changes,

45
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.000
we'll click on that, and we have several tabs here.

46
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.030
We're going to kind of go through these quickly.

47
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.020
Keep in mind there is great documentation

48
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.010
available on each of these rows,

49
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.020
we have a Configuration tab, this is used

50
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.010
for fine-tuning the application,

51
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.040
for performance improvements and so forth.

52
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.070
We have a Security tab, where you can

53
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.040
actually apply different security features

54
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.080
to your application if it doesn't have any,

55
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.060
and then there's a Testing and Monitoring tab and so forth.

56
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.030
Now, at this point, what we want to do

57
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.080
is click on the Control,

58
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.000
we're going to click the checkbox

59
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.020
and then start servicing our request.

60
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.010
Keep in mind, this application will fail.

61
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.090
And look at that.

62
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.070
So we have this huge error message.

63
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070
Remember, we tried to deploy an app

64
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.030
with extra dependencies designed for Tomcat.

65
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.090
And, on WebLogic, this message is indicating

66
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.050
that it essentially does not know

67
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.010
which dependency to use, the ones included in the WAR file

68
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.070
or those included in WebLogic,

69
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.050
so now we need to remove them.

70
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.020
Let's switch back to IntelliJ,

71
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.060
and I've already set the files up that we need to look at.

72
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.010
We're first going to comment out in our build gradle.

73
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.070
We'll comment out the servlet here

74
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.040
and the weld servlet, we don't need those, click Save.

75
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.060
We'll go to our web XML, and we have

76
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.000
a listener here for weld, and we need to comment this out.

77
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.040
And we also have, in our context, we have a Bean Manager.

78
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.040
We don't need that.

79
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.020
We're going to comment this out.

80
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.000
Go back to our terminal,

81
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.070
we're going to run our Build command again,

82
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.070
navigate back to our WebLogic instance,

83
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.030
click on Deployments again,

84
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.050
come over here, click Lock and Edit.

85
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.070
While we're here, click the checkbox.

86
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.040
Delete, yes.

87
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.060
We're basically going to run through

88
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.000
the same process we did a moment ago.

89
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We'll activate our changes,

90
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.060
click on the deployments, Lock and Edit,

91
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.050
click Install, come to Build, libs, select the checkbox.

92
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.050
Again, remember, make sure you're doing 0204 begin,

93
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.070
click Next, Next, Next, and Finish.

94
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.010
Click activate our changes.

95
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.060
Go to the Control tab, we'll select the checkbox for app,

96
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.040
we'll start servicing all request, click Yes,

97
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.010
and we get a nice message that our app has been started.

98
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.020
Look, see, the state here is Active.

99
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.040
We'll go to our Testing tab, right-click

100
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
on the link here for our app,

101
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.000
we'll open it up, and our application is deployed.
