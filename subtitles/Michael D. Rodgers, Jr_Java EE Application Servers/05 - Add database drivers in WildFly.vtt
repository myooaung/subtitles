- [Instructor] Adding a MySQL data source

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.050
is not all that difficult in WildFly.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.070
First, we're going to go to the deployment section,

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.060
and click on the plus symbol.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.000
We'll upload our deployment,

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.080
going to choose the database driver from our downloads,

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.020
click OK, click next, we're going to enable it,

8
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.070
and finish, and close.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.010
Next, we're going to click on the configuration tab,

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.000
go to data sources,

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.050
and first we're going to click on ExampleDS.

12
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.060
As we can see here, this is an H2 data source.

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.050
This pattern, java colon jboss data source,

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.090
data source name is important.

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.090
Next, we'll click on data sources,

16
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.030
we'll add a data source, going to choose MySQL,

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.000
click next, going to change the name to our H plus database.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.030
We're going to call this H plus DS for data source,

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.060
put jboss in here, slash data sources,

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.030
and then we'll type H plus underscore DS.

21
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090
Next we're going to select the driver name,

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.040
and we have our driver listed here.

23
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.020
Click next.

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.030
I'll change the connection URL to include our database name,

25
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.050
I'll change the username,

26
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.050
and we'll click over here

27
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.080
so we can see the password as well.

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.050
I'll leave the security domain alone, and we'll click next.

29
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.000
Click test connection, and we have a good connection.

30
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Click next and finish.

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Click view data source.
