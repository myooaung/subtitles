00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.080
- [Instructor] H+Sport Drinks IT manager has asked you

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.010
to begin reviewing Oracle's WebLogic server container,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.070
and what would be necessary

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.000
to move the flagship application over

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.090
to a fully functional Java EE web application server.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.030
A few features concerning Oracle's WebLogic

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.060
is that it must be run on Oracle JDK and not

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.060
on the Open JDK due to licensing issues.

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.080
It's fully Java Enterprise Enterprise 7 compatible,

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.090
and Java SE certified which provides

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.040
some backwards compatibility.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
Keep in mind that JDK 9, or 10, or later will not work

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.010
with WebLogic 12c and WebLogic will let you know

14
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.090
as well during the installation.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.070
So let's look at the benefits.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.070
12c provides several monitoring tools and capabilities

17
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.090
for managing nodes and clusters.

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.080
WebLogic additionally supports a huge out of the box number

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.090
of XA and non-XA compliant database drivers.

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
You can as well deploy your own by copying

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.070
and deploying the libraries over.

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070
WebLogic allows you to create templates

23
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.040
of current 12c installations

24
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.090
for packaging and installation

25
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.000
into a .jar file for quicker setup

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.060
and installation on other machines.

27
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.000
And WebLogic 12 incorporates a huge number

28
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.020
of features which we won't be able

29
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.030
to cover fully in this chapter.

30
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.030
For the sake of time we will only

31
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.080
be covering core features needed by Devs

32
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.010
and System Admins for deploying and managing applications.

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.000
If you're interested in learning more

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
