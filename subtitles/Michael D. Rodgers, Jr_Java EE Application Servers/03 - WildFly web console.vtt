00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Narrator] Let's look at the web console

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.030
and how to change a password.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.020
From the terminal window, we'll start the application

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.050
in standalone mode.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.010
Then, standalone dot sh.

6
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.070
Hit Enter.

7
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
And as we can see from the terminal output tell us

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.060
that the admin console has started.

9
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.040
Http://127.0.0.1:9990.

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.090
We can see that it started 309 of 530 services,

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.010
and 321 services are lazy.

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.080
Let's click over to the browser.

13
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.080
We'll type in http, colon, 9990.

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.060
And you'll see we've got an error message.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.060
This basically tells us that there is no password setup

16
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.020
on the system.

17
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.000
And it also gives us a message of how to add a password.

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.050
We we're going to back to our terminal,

19
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.020
open up the new terminal window,

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.050
cd into the WildFly.

21
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.030
Bin directory and type add-user.

22
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.030
Hit Enter.

23
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.050
The first prompt tells us that we want

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.070
to add a Management User.

25
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.090
We'll select that.

26
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.020
Then we're going to enter a Username.

27
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.070
I'm going to say, "wildfly."

28
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.000
Hit Enter.

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.050
And then we're going to create a password.

30
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.030
I'm going to use a password we've used before,

31
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.020
so this is capital M, Y, dollar sign, three, C, R, E, T.

32
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.000
We'll type that again, capital M, Y, dollar sign, three,

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
C, R, E, T.

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.020
Hit Enter.

35
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.030
This will ask us what groups do you want to add

36
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.040
to this user.

37
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.030
So, we're going to leave this as none.

38
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.080
And this will ask us

39
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.050
if we want to add this to the ManagementRealm.

40
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.010
We're going to confirm yes.

41
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.020
And the final question asks if we want to have this user

42
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010
to be used for any application server process

43
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.010
for connecting to other servers.

44
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.010
So we're going to say no for now.

45
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.000
Go back to our browser.

46
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.090
We're going to click try again.

47
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.080
And now it prompts us.

48
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.020
So we'll enter wildfly, our password,

49
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.010
capital M, Y, dollar sign, three, C, R, E, T and sign in.

50
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.020
Now from here, you can see that the console allows us

51
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
to manage Deployments, Create Datasources,

52
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.050
take care of user access, and apply patches.

53
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.010
If we click on the Access Control link,

54
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
we'll see that currently the system is

55
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.060
currently configured to use simple access controls

56
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.050
which will not utilize changes made in the section.

57
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.090
In order to utilize RBAC settings, related settings,

58
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.080
you'll need to enable the Role Based Account Credentials.

59
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.060
The simple Access Control, means that the account

60
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.010
we just created does not have

61
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.010
any Role Based Account Credentials or RBAC.

62
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.010
The WildFly user account was set up

63
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.070
using the Management Realm, which is what we need

64
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.090
to log in, but if we want to create users

65
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.090
by roles and control what functionality they have access to,

66
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.060
then we need to enable RBAC.

67
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.010
Now according to the documentation, this simple

68
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.040
provider is the default and provides permission scheme

69
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.010
equivalent to JBoss AS 7, behavior where any authenticated

70
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.080
administrator has all permissions.

71
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.010
The RBAC provider gives finer-grain permission scheme

72
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.000
that is the focus of the section.

73
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We can see this if we switch back to our terminal,

74
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.090
and inside of here,

75
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.070
we're going to vi to standalone, configuration, standalone,

76
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.020
dot xml.

77
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.060
We're going to search for access control.

78
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.080
And you can see that the current access-control provider

79
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.020
is simple.

80
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.000
We could make these changes through the CLI

81
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.020
to make it RBAC, or we could do it through the browser.

82
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.090
Let's go ahead and do this through the browser.

83
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.080
Let's go back.

84
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.050
Going to enable RBAC.

85
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.020
We see a dialogue here that informs us that we're

86
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.050
currently using the simple provider.

87
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.010
And, that we're about to change it to RBAC.

88
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.040
If we do, we're going to have to edit the xml

89
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.020
if we want to go back.

90
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.030
So we're going to say yes.

91
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.080
You also see some dialogues here to reload.

92
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.040
We do not want to do that.

93
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.020
All right.

94
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.040
Click on users.

95
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.040
We'll click add.

96
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.020
We'll type in the name of our user, wildfly.

97
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.010
In the Realm, we're going to type ManagementRealm,

98
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.060
all one word.

99
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.090
And we're going to include SuperUser,

100
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.060
and then click Okay.

101
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060
All right.

102
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.080
So we've done this.

103
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.080
We've made the user SuperUser.

104
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.010
Now we need to go back to the terminal window

105
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.030
and we'll need to stop and restart the server.

106
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.050
Control + C, then bin, standalone, dot sh.

107
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.080
Hit Enter.

108
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.040
Now we're going to go back to Chrome,

109
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.070
but this time instead of using this pre-existing window,

110
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.050
there are cookies involved here in the browser history

111
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.060
and it'll create problems,

112
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.020
so what we're going to do is we're going to open

113
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.070
a new incognito window to demonstrate this.

114
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.020
We'll type http, colon, 127, zero, to zero, to one,

115
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
colon 9990.

116
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.080
Hit Enter.

117
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.080
Again it prompts us for our credentials.

118
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.010
Wildfly.

119
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.050
My secret.

120
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.020
Click Okay.

121
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.080
If we go back to the terminal window,

122
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.030
and exit here,

123
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.080
and then we're going to re-open it to refresh this,

124
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
go back down to access section,

125
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.000
and we'll see that the provider is now rbac.
