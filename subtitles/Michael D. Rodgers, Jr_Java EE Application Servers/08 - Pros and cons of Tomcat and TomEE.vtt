00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] H+ Sport drinks has asked you

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.070
to begin analyzing the advantages and disadvantages

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.060
of using Apache Tomcat.

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.070
Let's take a few moments

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.020
to consider what Tomcat has to offer,

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.070
and some concerns with using Tomcat, as well.

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.030
Tomcat is really easy to setup.

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.030
Whether setting it up in a production environment,

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.060
or running it on your desktop,

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.010
it takes only a few steps to start up an instance.

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.060
Tomcat, as well, has great support on multiple OSs.

12
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.050
So, if you wanted to write code on a Mac

13
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.040
and deploy on a Linux,

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.090
or have a group of developers writing

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.010
on different platforms,

16
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010
it really doesn't matter.

17
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.010
Upgrading Tomcat, as well,

18
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.020
is very easy.

19
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.040
Tomcat is lightweight.

20
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.050
If you don't need to add all of the Java EE components,

21
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.000
it makes a great fit.

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.060
And if you need to add some Java EE components,

23
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.080
it's not too difficult to add them, as well,

24
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.040
in your application.

25
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.030
Tomcat supports application clusters,

26
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.070
and has a great community support

27
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.060
and probably the greatest benefit

28
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.000
for small organizations,

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.060
is that it's free.

30
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.030
Now, with these advantages,

31
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.080
what are some of the disadvantages?

32
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.030
Tomcat clusters can be difficult to configure.

33
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.080
For example, the Farm Deployer capability,

34
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.030
which we didn't get into,

35
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
in Tomcat, the cluster configuration,

36
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.010
it's supposed to automatically deploy war files

37
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.030
across the cluster instances,

38
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.010
and this seems to been broken now,

39
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.080
for a number of years.

40
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.000
That said, anyone capable of writing shell scripts

41
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.040
could probably address the missing capability here.

42
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.020
Another issue,

43
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
although you can add the missing Java EE dependencies

44
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.080
to a war file,

45
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.040
this makes it more difficult

46
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.020
when you're attempting to deploy

47
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.040
to other applications like JBoss,

48
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.000
or WebLogic, or GlassFish

49
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.080
because the war would have to be changed, again.

50
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.050
This seems to go against the mantra

51
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.080
of write once,

52
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.000
and run anywhere.

53
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030
Especially, if you're going to run simultaneously

54
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.040
across different application containers.

55
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.000
Tomcat manager, the web console,

56
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.020
seems underdeveloped compared to other application servers

57
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.090
like JBoss, and WebLogic and GlassFish,

58
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.060
there isn't a lot of bells and whistles here.

59
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.020
There also seems to be some concerns

60
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.040
for Tomcat's default log rotation capabilities.

61
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.080
All in all, Tomcat is one of the most popular app servers

62
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.060
on the market,

63
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.050
and some even suggest 60% market share

64
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.010
of all Java app servers.

65
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.030
The reality is even with the missing Java EE functionality,

66
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.080
this can be adjudicated

67
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.000
through other third party dependencies within your app.
