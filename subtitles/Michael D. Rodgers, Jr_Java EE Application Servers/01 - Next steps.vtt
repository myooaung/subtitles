00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.030
- [Instructor] After looking at

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.030
all of these Java applications servers,

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
what other relevant information should we consider?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.060
Well, that is a good question.

5
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.020
There are some content areas we didn't fully explore

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.090
like CLI.

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.080
The Command Line Interface is available

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.050
in WebLogic, GlassFish, and Payara.

9
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.040
We only just begun considering how to use the CLI

10
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080
on the differing application servers,

11
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.070
or how to integrate them with other management tools

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040
like Chef or Puppet.

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.070
I want to encourage you to investigate, learn,

14
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.010
and practice using these.

15
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.070
Additionally, we did not consider the various JMS facilities

16
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.050
on WebLogic, WildFly, or Payara.

17
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.070
You could use third-party JMS servers like Apache MQ,

18
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.010
HornetQ, IBM Q, or a host of others.

19
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010
I also think however, that it would be

20
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.000
an excellent area of study in how to use

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.020
the facilities available in these Java application servers

22
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.090
to handle JMS messaging request,

23
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.030
especially if you're already paying for support in any

24
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.090
of the Java application servers

25
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.010
we've covered as a part of this course.

26
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.030
Lastly, we only briefly mentioned load balancing

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.090
in connection with our discussions

28
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.010
concerning server clustering and deployment groups.

29
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.020
Learning how to connect Apache Server through mod_jk

30
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.030
or Oracle's HTTP Server, or even learning how to use an F5

31
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.090
or BigIP appliance would be an excellent area

32
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.040
of further study.

33
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.030
I encourage you as well to explore

34
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.020
the LinkedIn Learning Library for more courses

35
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.010
like courses on configuring Apache Server.

36
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.050
Thank you so much for the time we spent learning together

37
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.030
in evaluating Tomcat, WebLogic, WildFly, and Payara.

38
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.000
I hope to see you again for future courses.
