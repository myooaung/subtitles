00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.020
- [Instructor] The H+ Sport IT Director understands

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.050
that the initial configuration is complete

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.060
and now would like to see the company web app

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.050
deployed and loaded on the Payara Server stack.

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.030
So, with the Payara application server started,

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:20.000
let's login and look at how to deploy an application.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.040
Deployments are one of the common tasks

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.050
presented by default on this first screen.

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
The other way we can navigate to the deployments option

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.020
is on the left navigation bar,

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.090
clicking on the applications link,

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
and then selecting the deploy button.

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.010
On this screen, we're going to deploy

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.080
from our practice files at 04_04_begin.

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
I've already compiled my class files.

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.000
If you have not done this you'll need to do this now.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.020
Click choose file,

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.010
navigate to your practice files,

19
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.070
and click open.

20
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.070
From here we have some basic options.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.000
And you'll notice that there is only one server listed.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090
Because this is the default server for this domain.

23
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.030
We'll get into clusters later on.

24
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.020
The enable option is set.

25
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.010
And we could uncheck this

26
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.010
if we did not want users to access

27
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.020
the application immediately.

28
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020
But we'll leave it set for now.

29
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.070
And basically, everything else we'll keep the same.

30
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.060
Click okay.

31
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.040
On the next screen, we're presented with a list

32
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.060
of applications deployed

33
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.060
and currently H+ Simple

34
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.050
is the only application available.

35
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.000
We could click the check box

36
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and be able to undeploy, enable, and disable

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.050
the current application.

38
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.080
Over on the right we have an action,

39
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.040
which if we click the call out button

40
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.030
will reload a new tab

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.090
and present two links,

42
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.000
one in an HTTP version

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.060
and one in an HTTPs version.

44
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.090
If your local DNS is not set up correctly

45
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090
this may not work,

46
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020
but we'll go ahead and click on it.

47
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.070
Okay, so we deployed the app through

48
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.070
the administrative console.

49
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.090
Next, let's deploy the app

50
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.070
through the auto-deploy directory.

51
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.000
First, I'm going to undeploy our current app.

52
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.010
Click the applications to verify it's gone.

53
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.090
Going to go back to our terminal window.

54
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.040
And we're going to switch directories to our

55
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.060
glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy/ directory.

56
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.020
This is the directory we could copy

57
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.070
our war files to and autodeploy them.

58
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.020
From here we're going to copy from our practice files,

59
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.030
Chapter_04/04_04_begin/

60
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.070
build/libs/hplus-simple.war.

61
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.040
And I'm going to put a dot at the end

62
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.000
to copy to the local directory we're in.

63
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.020
We'll validate this.

64
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.040
The war file's already deployed.

65
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.050
We can see this with the suffix .war_deployed.

66
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.040
We will navigate back to our Chrome instance,

67
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.010
click on the applications again.

68
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.050
We could see the application is deployed.

69
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.010
We'll click launch.

70
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.050
Click on the link

71
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.000
and everything is deployed.
