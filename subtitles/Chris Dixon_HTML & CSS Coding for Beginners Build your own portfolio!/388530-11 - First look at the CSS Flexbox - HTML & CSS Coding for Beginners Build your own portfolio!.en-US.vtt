00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
Both the CSS grid and the Flexbox,

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:10.260
are relatively new ways of laying out our content using CSS.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.185
In this video, we're going to be covering both techniques.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.620
Beginning now with the Flexbox,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.555
which is used to layout our content in one direction,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:24.865
either controlling it horizontally or vertically.

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:28.380
To get started with the CSS Flexbox,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.630
the first thing we need to do,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.025
is to create a wrapper for all of our content.

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:34.890
Over in the CSS,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.105
we then set this wrapper to have the display type of flex.

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:46.670
This will then allow us to set the flex direction for our content to be either row,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.790
which is across the page from left to right,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.450
or in a column which is from top to bottom.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.740
So our content is stacked vertically.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.300
This is great for responsive design and we can also set the reverse options too.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.930
We can set the row reverse,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.090
which we'll set our content from the right to the left and also column reverse,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700
which is going to be the opposite,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.010
so our content is bottom to top.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.170
We can use this combined with media queries to create

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.440
different layouts for different screen sizes and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.620
also the Flexbox has much more to offer and we'll

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.890
discover some of these flex properties throughout this course.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.460
Let's go over to our index.html page.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.330
In the content which we created in the last video,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.805
we created two sections with the class of recent work.

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:47.975
This is the wrapper div for each one of our projects and the wrapper for each row.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:51.935
When I want to use this recent word-class over in the CSS,

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:56.015
starting with the column layout for our small screen view.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:02:00.245
This means that each one of our projects will be stacked on top of each other,

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:03.560
stretching to be the width of the full mobile device.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.460
Let's go over to our style sheets and create our new section using the comments.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.880
This is the recent works section.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.670
Remember, we target a class with the dot and the name of recent work.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.520
To use the Flexbox,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.385
the first step is to set the display type to be equal to flex.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.130
Remember in the last video,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.530
we said that many elements can be categorized into inline and block level.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.940
Well, we can change the display type of an element using its display property.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.480
Here, we're changing the display type of our wrapper to make use of the Flexbox.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.825
This will allow us to make use of many more flex properties,

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:55.265
such as the flex direction.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.025
We're going to begin on

00:02:57.025 --> 00:03:01.850
the mobile size devices by setting the flex direction to be column.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.825
If we shrink this down,

00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:06.790
this means that the content will be stacked on top of each

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.080
other rather than the default row which is across the page.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.570
We also have the reverse options too,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.615
so we can set this to be column reverse,

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:19.110
save this and reload,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.850
and now the images will appear on top of

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.105
the text rather than how it was with just column,

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:28.130
where we have the text and then the images.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.575
We can also set the flex direction to be row.

00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:35.875
This will mean the content goes across the page, just like we see here.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.670
This means that the content will go horizontally across the page,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.100
leaving our text and the image alongside each other.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.950
Now though on these small screens,

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.780
we're going to leave this as column and then also set the font size.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.345
Don't forget the semicolon at the end.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:58.365
The font size is going to be equal to 1.3 rems and that's a margin

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:01.270
of one rem on the top and bottom to give us

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.440
some spacing and we don't need any spacing on the left and right.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.350
Let's reload this and if we now scroll down to between our two projects,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.480
we now see our margin in-between and also the font size taking effect.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.045
Next, I'm going to add some more general sizing and spacing to our section,

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:24.970
so we have the class for each title,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.920
which is recent work title.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.605
We can set the font size to be a little larger and want to use 1.6 rems.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:41.485
Next up, we can get to work on our text for our project.

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:46.810
This text, is all surrounded in a div with the class of recent work info.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.045
Let's go ahead and target is now.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:53.015
For the wrapper all I'm going to do,

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:56.340
is to add some spacing on the inside of the elements of

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.960
one rem and then we're going to move on to the Level 4 heading.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.750
If we go over to the markup in the HTML file,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.105
and we'll go to the recent work info,

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:12.230
we're now going to get to work on the Level 4 heading which is the project title.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.420
We do have a couple of different ways in which we can approach this.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.495
We could directly target the Level 4 heading.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:23.230
We could add a class to this heading and then grab the element this

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.895
way or we can be more specific like we looked at earlier in our CSS,

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:32.450
where we can select the recent work info, then h4.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.520
So let's do this. We can target

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.600
the recent work info and then any Level 4 heading which is nested in this section.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.270
All we need to do here, is to set the font size to be

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.005
1.4 rems or any font size which you prefer.

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.315
Next up, we have our features which we can see here

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:57.995
and we're going to add some space in between each one of these.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:01.595
We also have a symbol here which we need to remove.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:06.195
Let's go down. Also remove this.

00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:11.824
Now so we can be more specific with just targeting these list items in this section,

00:06:11.824 --> 00:06:14.675
rather than affecting any of our navigation links,

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:17.965
we can add a new class over in the index.

00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:19.875
For our unordered list,

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:26.555
we can add the class of features and we'll do the same for our first project too.

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:29.240
So inside the unordered list,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.960
the class of features,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.775
and then we can be more specific inside of our style sheets by targeting the features,

00:06:37.775 --> 00:06:39.980
the greater than symbol,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.685
and then our list items.

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:47.555
This works in a slightly different way to the way we've used this in the past.

00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:50.315
The way we select it just like this,

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:55.910
means that all Level 4 headings inside of this section will be affected.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.660
Doing it the second way with the greater than symbol,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.520
will mean that this will only affect

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.080
the list items which are a direct child of our features.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.480
This means that these list items need to be directly nested inside.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.220
We have our unordered list and these are on

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.820
the next level in so these will all be affected.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.335
If we have a second level of nesting inside here,

00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:24.005
let's say a second unordered list,

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:26.085
and then a list item,

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:29.115
this one will not be affected.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:33.365
Let's leave this in and see this in action by setting

00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:37.550
the margin to create some space in between our list items.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:44.940
One rem on the top and bottom and then zero on the left and right. We know the browser.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.505
We have our spacing just here and also off those projects.

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:52.710
Let's set the color of the links.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:59.315
Reload and now we can see that the test element which we added in,

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:02.975
because this is not a direct child of our features,

00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:06.175
this is not affected by our CSS.

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:09.250
Let just remove this test,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.165
save this, and reload.

00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:20.150
We can also remove the color and things are now looking a bit better with our spacing.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.700
The next thing we need to take care of,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.480
is the images which are too big for the device.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.670
Once again, over in our style sheets,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.794
we can target the elements by its name, which is IMG.

00:08:32.794 --> 00:08:37.925
Since this is also a general style which you want to apply to all of the projects,

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:42.140
I'm going to add this at the top of the style sheets in the global styles.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.350
This is just a personal preference and this can go anywhere in the style sheets.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.760
All we're going to do, is to set the maximum width to be 100 percent.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.235
This means that the image will always be a maximum of 100 percent of the container.

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:02.530
Let's reload and see this in action.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.360
Again, also in this general style section,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.110
I'm going to add a little style in for our horizontal rule.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.159
Let's add the hr elements.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:17.850
The width to be 100 percent so it spans the full width of the content.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.625
I'm also going to set the capacity to be 0.5,

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.685
which is 50 percent transparent.

00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:32.340
The color can also be light gray and let's see how this looks.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.805
Leaving us now with a lighter line between our content.

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:41.540
This is our first look at using the CSS Flexbox

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.790
and although we've only used it so far to create a mobile first column layout,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.115
as we progress through the rest of the course,

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:54.420
we will discover a lot more of what the CSS Flexbox has to offer.
