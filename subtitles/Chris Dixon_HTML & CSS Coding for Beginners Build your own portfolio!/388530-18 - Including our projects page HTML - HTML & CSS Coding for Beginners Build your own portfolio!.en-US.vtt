00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.410
Inside of the images folder in our project,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.870
we have all of these images which we're now going to use in our projects.html.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.440
We also covered over the basic structure and the header in

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.535
the last video along with the animation script down at the bottom.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:23.565
I'm going to now get started with our project section by creating a new section rapper,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:29.919
which is also going to have a level thee heading with the text of the recent projects.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.930
This is also going to receive various classes as we

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.380
go and we'll make use of these in the CSS very soon.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.105
The level three heading is going to have the class of projects title.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:44.755
Then after this, I'm going to add a div,

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:47.845
which is going to be a rapper for all of our projects,

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.290
so we'll add a class of projects to this.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.100
Then each individual div inside here is going to be for one single project.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.520
Each one of these projects is going to have a ID.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.010
I'm going to call the first one, work one,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.075
and this ID is going to be used later on in the CSS.

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:12.780
Each one of these is also going to have a consistent class name of grid-item.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.975
Then nested inside if we take a look at the final version,

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:20.455
we're going to have a image and also the project title,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:25.330
which is going to display later on when we hover over each image.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.315
We need to add these two elements in starting with our image.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.330
All of our images in this images folder.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.295
The first one I'm going to use,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.815
is going to be the music player,

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:40.930
also the old text.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.910
Then after this, we can add a link with

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.440
the a elements and this is going to be the text for our projects.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.240
This is the music player.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.740
It can add a link to a separate page to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.430
provide more details about this individual project, if you would like.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.585
I'm going to leave mine empty since we'll not be covering this during this course,

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:07.715
but feel free to do this as a challenge.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:10.760
A class name of hidden-text.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.980
Since the text is going to be initially hidden until the user hovers over,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.040
so we can go ahead and type out each one of these individually if you would like.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.170
But since I've got quite a lot to get through,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.550
I'm going to copy and paste this and then change over the details.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.760
Remember, you also don't need to include as many projects as me,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.615
and you can also add more if you prefer to.

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:39.145
Work two, the same class, the image location,

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:42.440
this time is going to be for react trello,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.135
the old text two,

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.040
and also the title.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.290
The third one we're going to paste in.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.255
Again, making sure this is inside of the project rapper,

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:02.795
paste this in, find the ID.

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:05.510
The image for my third one is going to be for

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.850
the photo editor and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.400
also the linked text two.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.020
The fourth one is going to be for

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.370
the productivity app

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.580
and also the old text two.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.075
This is how our projects are going to be structured.

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:41.590
I have nine in total,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.530
so I'm going to skip ahead and add these in now.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.420
Pause the video and come back once you have finished adding all of your projects.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.465
All of my nine projects are now in place,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.845
and hopefully, you have yours finished two.

00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:59.740
Now, let's go over to the browser and check this out in the projects.html.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.340
Just below the header, we have our recent projects title.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.470
Then for each one of our projects we have our image and also the title alongside.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.020
Our content is now in place for our portfolio page.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.850
Next, we're going to apply some CSS styling.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.570
To begin, we're going to be starting with

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.395
the mobile first approach and taking advantage of the CSS Flexbox.

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:28.610
Then later on in the course,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.700
we'll apply a media query when we have more screen space available.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.210
Then we can take advantage of the CSS grid to layout our content in two directions.
