00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
We're now going to create our project page,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.510
which will be a showcase for our previous work.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.110
This will also give us a chance to learn a new CSS technique which is called the grid.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
Unlike the flexbox which controls our layouts in one direction,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.310
the CSS grid will allow us to control

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.259
our content in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.345
Over to the final version,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:29.220
I'm moving on from our homepage.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.205
If you click on the nav link for the projects,

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:36.375
this includes the same header section which we've used for the homepage,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:42.015
and then we can scroll down and the recent projects will animate in as you scroll down.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:44.810
We can also hover over each one of these,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.840
and the title will display for each project.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.405
You can see on this full desktop view now we use the CSS grid layout.

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:56.629
We will learn all about this in the upcoming videos,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.195
and this is also fully responsive too.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:03.865
If we shrink the browser down we'll see various layout changes

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:09.905
such as the tablet size device which will then switch our projects to be two columns.

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:15.485
If we shrink this down even further this then becomes the full width of the browser.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:19.010
To begin with this we're going to go to over our project and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.760
create a new file in our portfolio directory.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.480
Create a new file, and this is going to be called the Projects.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.355
Again this is going to have the HTML extension.

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.650
Makes sure that this is in the root of the portfolio

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.590
alongside the index and the stylesheets.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.370
I'm going to make use of the same header section so we can

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.230
make our lives easier by going over to the index.html,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.430
and we can copy over all of the content and then Modify this.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.540
This already has the link to our

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.865
projects.HTML which we added early on when creating the header section.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.195
Let's Command or Control A to select all,

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:01.690
Copy the content over,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.100
and then Paste this in the projects.HTML.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.525
Starting from the bottom we also need to keep the animate on scroll library,

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:16.090
but we're going to remove all of the rest of the content up to the header section.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.750
This includes our recent work section, the parallax section.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.855
Let's remove this leaving us just with the header section,

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.955
and then our script at the bottom.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:33.929
This also has our same link to the stylesheet that we created,

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.030
meaning our styles will also still apply.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.790
The next thing we need to do is to change the title.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.140
This is going to be Chris Dixon's projects,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.980
and this now gives us a good starting point which still includes the same header

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.230
and all the links we need to our own CSS along with the animation library.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.720
Let's Save this file and the checklist is working okay in our projects,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.770
let's Reload the browser from the homepage,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.945
we can click on the Projects,

00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:06.900
and it's now links to our projects.HTML,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.240
and we can see the header section is in place.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.895
For this page I'll now set up.

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:17.200
Next we're going to add our projects using a mobile first approach.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.655
Remember from earlier on in the course you will also need to download some images,

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:27.700
or take some real images from some previous projects which you created.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.530
If you don't have any that's completely fine you can use

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.365
any placeholder image which you would like,

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:37.500
but make sure these are ready to use in the next video.
