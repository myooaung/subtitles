00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.170
CSS is always evolving along with adding some new features.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.645
These new features are often great and we may want to use them as soon as possible.

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:13.810
However, we do need to be careful because it often takes time for

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.810
these features to be fully supported in all browsers,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.290
and even when browsers support does catch up and the new browser version is released,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.145
we still need to be aware that not

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:29.135
everybody will be using the latest version immediately.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:35.055
The help amongst others that is a really useful site as caniuse.com,

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:40.000
this will allow us to check a CSS feature and also see how widely

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.455
supported it is across the major browsers including any previous versions too.

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:49.849
For example, if you wanted to use the Flexbox in our projects,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:57.300
we could type this in and then what we want is the Flexbox module, which we can see here.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450
Across the top we have a list of all of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.630
the major browsers and also the support for each one of the versions.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.880
For example, Chrome version 80 is green and we can see by the pop-up that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.490
this is fully supported and we can also see the global usage for this browser.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.510
For example, this current [inaudible] is 10 percent at the moment and this is really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.675
important to determine what browser support you want to provide for your project.

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:28.870
If we take a look at the different shades,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.720
Internet Explorer version 11 only has

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.340
partial support but currently this has only got about one percent global use,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.995
so we will need to decide if this will be a problem for your audience.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.840
Generally, something with all these green sections like this is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.145
pretty safe to use in a project since it is widely supported.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:53.740
Let's take a look at something else such as the opacity which we've recently used

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.070
in our projects and the opacity rule which you see here is pretty much fully green,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.510
so this is safe to use in all browsers.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120
Animations are also well-supported too.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.355
[inaudible] something in it to be careful of.

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:13.415
Let's type in the animations and see what comes up.

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:15.800
If we type in the animation,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.625
we see something called the AnimationAPI,

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.980
and see that this feature is experimental.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.230
This is because this is not exactly the animation which we used in our project.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.940
The reason for this is because animation is a CSS shorthand for multiple things.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.070
If we go over to our project and take a look at

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.675
the animation which we used earlier on in our fade-in,

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:45.620
the animation property is a shorthand for things such as the animation name,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.955
which we have here, and also the animation-timing-function.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:52.595
We could add these in separately.

00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:58.265
So we could add the animation name and set the speed fade-in,

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:01.465
and then the animation timing function,

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:05.520
and then we could set this to be ease-in just like we've used above,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.690
and then remove all shorthand.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.825
This would have exactly the same effect but this is just a way

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:16.375
of grouping together various related properties into one line.

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:21.620
In fact, our animation is also a shorthand for the animation duration too,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.710
so we can even remove this,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.770
we can remove this line of code,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.250
and then we can place this inside of our shorthand and this will work exactly the same.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.430
Let's just take this by going over to the project and into the header section,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.740
reload and everything still works as expected.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.560
This is something to bear in mind when searching for CSS properties,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.010
that sometimes a property may be a shorthand for multiple CSS rules.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.620
If you want to know if something is a shorthand or not,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.245
you can head over to the Mozilla website

00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:00.275
and then do a search for that particular property.

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:03.870
For example, let's search for the border.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.570
We can go into the CSS section and we

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.465
see straight away that the border is a shorthand property which sets the border width,

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:18.160
the border style, and also the color in one line.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.965
Generally, when dealing with newer CSS properties,

00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:24.740
it is a matter of balancing more features you want,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.210
the RTA project, along with catering for your target users.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.050
There are also tools which can help with browser support too,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.910
and this is using vendor prefixes and polyfills.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.480
We won't be covering these during this course but do feel free to look

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.530
into these subjects more deeply if you are interested in learning more.
