00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
That's in a parallax style effect to our web page can really make it standout.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:10.140
You may have seen this effect when scrolling on web pages or applications.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.885
It basically involves the background,

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:15.900
which in our case is an image scrolling at

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.610
a different rate to the rest of the content which sits on top of it.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.250
There are many options out there to achieve

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.300
a similar effect and many making use of JavaScript.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.760
But for this project I'm going to be creating a simple CSS only version.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.074
To understand the Parallax effect in more detail,

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:39.354
let's take a look at a quick example.

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:44.090
On the left here we have a typical web page layout with a header.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.305
We have some images and also some content which may go off the bottom of the screen.

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:56.180
If this happens, the user will need to scroll up for all the content come into view.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.625
Generally all of the content scrolls up at the same rate.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:04.175
However, those who apply a parallax effect,

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:07.250
the whole idea is the background image will

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.890
scroll at a slower rate than the rest of the contents or not at all.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.500
To achieve this with CSS,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
if we take a look at the image on the right-hand side,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.500
we're going to be setting a full background image to cover the whole size of the browser.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.790
This image is also going to be in a fixed position so we

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.220
won't move as the rest of the content scrolls up into view.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.070
We can also leave some gaps in our content.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.290
For example, if we remove the two images,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.500
this will leave a space to reveal the background image.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.720
As we scroll up with all of the content.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.880
Let's take a preview of the finished version to see how

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.390
this effect will look.If we scroll down,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.240
you can see that the background image is in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.540
a fixed position and it doesn't actually move.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.040
The rest of the content will scroll up and down over the background image.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.950
It's this section we're now going to create,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.445
provided with this course is the same background image

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:14.030
which I have used or you can use your own if you prefer.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.510
I have mine saved here on the desktop.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.995
I'm going to add this into our portfolio.

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:22.460
I'm going to store this inside of a images folder.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.625
Let's create a new folder.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.450
This is also going to store the portfolio images,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.760
which we'll add in later.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.190
Drag over the background image.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.715
Now if we open up the sidebar,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:41.525
we'll now see the images folder and the background image.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.150
We're going to begin by creating a section wrapper,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.425
which is going to be for all of the links which you see here.

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:49.910
Back over to our index page,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.020
we can create this now.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.340
Just below the header section,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.710
but still within the main body,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.610
we're going to create a new section.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.000
This is going to have the class of parallax.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.590
This will allow us to target this section in the CSS.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.480
Just as we did with the header,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.205
we're going to create an unordered list for each one of our list items.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:24.030
The first one is going to be for freelance web development.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.850
As ever, you can create any links which will suit your portfolio.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.300
The next one I'm going to add as premium training courses.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:45.879
The third one is going to be for free training courses, YouTube videos.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.820
Then finally the last one,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.130
as they bear film will say drink coffee.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.650
Save this, and over to the browser.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.770
Scroll down below our header and we see our list items down at the bottom.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.770
This is only html content we need.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.755
Most of the work for this section is over in our style sheets.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:14.445
Let's create a new comment.

00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:17.760
This is going to be for the parallax section.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.355
Taken advantage of the parallax class which we added in before.

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:27.350
Inside here we can set our background image,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.580
we'll do this in CSS with the background image property.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.750
Then inside here we have the option to set the url.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.435
The url is the file path to our image.

00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:41.615
Inside of the quotations,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:47.500
we have an images folder and then forward slash the background dot JPEG.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.895
We also want this to be the full height.

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:55.715
Let's set the height to be 100 percent of the viewport height.

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:58.250
Save this and over to the browser.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.575
The background has now appeared.

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:04.310
But we want to position this exactly where we want it to be.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.110
Let's start by centering the background image with the property of background position.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.750
We're going to add this into the center.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.640
We also have other options too,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.385
such as the left, top and bottom.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.640
Let's reload and see what effect this has.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.230
Now we see the image has been centered in the browser.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:34.650
The next thing we're going to do is to set the background size to a value of cover.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.730
For this property we have multiple options such as we can

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.060
set the size of the image to be 50 percent,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.910
three REMs, 100 pixels or any value which we like.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.040
Here though we're going to set the value to be covered,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.200
which will scale the image as large as possible without stretching the image.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.755
Now if we save this and reload the browser,

00:05:57.755 --> 00:06:00.530
we see that the image also moves with the rest of

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.835
the content and we don't currently have a parallax style effect.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:06.410
To get the desired effect,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.145
the key part is to set the background image to be fixed.

00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:18.555
We do this with the property called background attachment and the value of the fixed.

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:22.280
Over to the browser scroll up and down and we see that

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.720
the background image stays in

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.045
the same position and the rest of the content moves over the top.

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:33.440
This now works because the background image is fixed in place to the browser

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.635
or to the viewport and the rest of the content is free to scroll as normal.

00:06:38.635 --> 00:06:41.630
To finish things off, we also need to make the list

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.580
items a little bit larger and also add some space in.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.905
Let's begin by targeting the parallax section and the nested, unordered list.

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:58.645
The font size is going to be 1.8 rems,

00:06:58.645 --> 00:07:05.340
which will be the equivalent of 18 pixels and part in, of one rem.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.960
Save this. Good, our text is now a little

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.450
larger and we also need to add some space in between each one of our list items.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.430
We can do this by adding some margin to the top and bottom only.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.030
Let's target the parallax list item.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.140
The margin property.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.080
Again, we're going to use the shorthand so we can add 2 rems onto the top and bottom,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.870
and then a zero on the left and right.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.230
Since these list items are already censored,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.335
reload and our spacing has now been applied.

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:51.230
This is how we can add a simple parallax effect to our project using only CSS.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.260
As you can see, it can really make a big difference and

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.180
make a section of our website really stand out.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.850
Far in this course, we've also used both margin and

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.530
padding to apply space in it to our elements.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.830
If you are still not a 100 percent sure what each one of these does,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.940
we're going to take a closer look at each of these in the next video.
