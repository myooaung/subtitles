00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.805
Let's now take this knowledge and we can apply it to our portfolio project.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.980
To begin with a web project,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
all we need to do is to create a regular folder which is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.330
going to store all of the files and folders which we'll need.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.935
I'm going to add my project to the desktop or it can go anywhere which you prefer.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:28.690
I'm going to right-click and create a new folder which I'm going to call "portfolio."

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.215
This name is totally up to you and feel free to change this.

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.950
Next, we need a text editor to write our code.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.580
I will be using Visual Studio code for

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.590
this course which you can download from here if you need to.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.160
VS code is available to download for free on Mac,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.605
Windows and Linux, or you can use any other which you prefer such as Atom,

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:57.410
Brackets or Sublime Text.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.830
I already have Visual Studio code installed so I've got this open up on the desktop.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.750
To open up our project,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.280
you only to do is drag over

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.065
the project folder and then we need a new HTML file to begin working with.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:20.480
We can go to the new file in the options or use Command or Control N and this will

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.240
create a new file which I'm going to save as the index.html.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870
This will automatically save inside of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.134
our projects and all HTML files need to have this extension.

00:01:35.134 --> 00:01:38.990
This index file is generally the main file,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.750
all the entry point into our project often used as the homepage in a simple HTML site.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.200
Let's get to work by creating our initial HTML structure,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.545
starting at the top with the doctype.

00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:57.770
A doctype is the type of document we're

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.740
creating and this will tell the browser that this is an HTML file.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.950
Next, we need to surround all of our content in this page,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.780
in the HTML elements,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.615
and this has an opening and closing tag.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:16.070
We can also set the page's language as an attribute by

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.660
typing in "lang" and I'm going to set mine to be en for English.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.195
If you are using a different language,

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:26.210
you can quickly find a [inaudible] language codes by

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.290
searching for HTML language codes in your search engine.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.510
Inside of the HTML tags,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.955
this contains both the head and the body nested inside.

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:41.480
Let's start with the head section and this is going to contain

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.390
information about our site and also links to other files.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.095
None of the content we add in the head section is displayed in the browser.

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:55.895
I'm going to begin inside here by adding two meta tags.

00:02:55.895 --> 00:03:02.360
Meta tags are simply data about our site and not displayed in the browser.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.220
The first one, we're going to add

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.319
the character set attributes and set this to a value of "UTF-8."

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.830
This will set the characters which we are going to be using in our project.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.730
HTML5 standard is UTF-8 which covers almost all characters and symbols in the world.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.044
The second one, we're going to set the name to be equal to "viewport."

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:31.955
This is the viewport meta tag which is used to

00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:35.575
set the page up for different screen sizes.

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:41.360
We do this by setting the contents and so it's equal to the width,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.540
to be equal to the device width and this will set

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.480
our webpage to be the same as the device width

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.870
which has been viewed on with let's say mobile,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.260
a desktop, or a tablet.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.425
After this, add a comma,

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:03.070
and I'm going to set the initial scale to be equal to one.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.815
This is really important for responsive design.

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.590
This will set the initial zoom level,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.575
all our scale when the page is first loaded.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:17.500
This is really important so all site looks good on all screen sizes.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.175
If we don't add this,

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.125
a mobile device may try to take

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:25.925
our desktop size page and it simply zoom out to try to fit

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:27.500
all of the content onto

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.315
our small screen resulting in things such as our text looking really small.

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:37.720
We don't want to have any zooming or scaling since we want to

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.305
take care of the look and feel of our project using CSS.

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:44.910
A lot of this may look confusing to begin,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.545
but this is going to be something you will reuse on

00:04:47.545 --> 00:04:51.345
all projects so you will get lots of practice.

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:55.570
The final part is to add the page title and this

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.590
is the title of the page which will be displayed in the browser tab.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.015
I'm going to set this as Chris Dixon's Portfolio.

00:05:03.015 --> 00:05:06.475
We can change this to suit your project.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:09.565
Finally, you [inaudible] to the head section,

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:11.820
you can also add a body.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.485
This is the second element which is nested inside of our HTML.

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:20.840
This is how we set up a basic HTML structure.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.710
This body section contains all of the content which we want

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.055
to display in the browser such as any images,

00:05:28.055 --> 00:05:31.150
any links, and also any text.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.420
So you will spend most of the time for the rest of this project.
