00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
Before we go any further into this project,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.840
I want to share with you a quick tip which can really help you during

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.515
development and this is to use the developer tools,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.055
which are built into all of the major browsers.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.085
The Developer Tools, amongst other things,

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:23.069
can't allow us to inspect the HTML and the CSS of not only our own projects,

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.025
but any other website too.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.195
We can access the Developer Tools inside of the browser.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.950
Generally we'd right-click in or control-click and then go

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.470
to inspect or inspect element for some browsers.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.550
Inside here, we have lots of information about the Chrome websites.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.550
Want to expand this.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.405
We have the inspector,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.835
first of all, of the near top corner.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.765
If we click on this, we can then hover over parts of our websites.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.410
Just like which part we want to look at.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.570
Let's go far with level one title, click on this.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.285
We can see the HTML structure on the side you steer.

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:08.195
You may also see this information down on the bottom of the browser,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:13.405
but I'll just move mine to the right-hand side using the options here.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:17.410
Here we can see that the level one heading is highlighted.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.150
You can see exactly which possible HTML is controlling this section.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.265
Then on the right we have this styling.

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:30.840
We see that the header H1 has a font size of five rems.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.270
We can also click on here to remove the equal style in.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.865
We can play around things by adding new style into.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.540
Let's change the equaller.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.450
This instantly takes effect in the browser.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.270
Below, we also see some default style in which has been applied by the browser.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.590
We also see down at the bottom not some styles of also been

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.340
inherited from the body section which is the container,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.035
such as the font family and the text alignment.

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:03.920
There is many more advanced tabs which you can see at

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.675
the top but we won't be covering this during this class.

00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:13.670
The Developer Tools not only allow us to inspect the HTML and CSS of our own site,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.450
but also of other sites too.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.865
For example, if you go to the Mozilla website,

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.905
we can do the same here.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.795
Click on the inspector,

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.255
and then choose any elements.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:29.940
There is much more HTML as we can see here but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.515
this is surrounded in the p element for the text.

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:36.365
We can also see all of the styling which has been applied,

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.165
such as the font sizing,

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.260
which we can click on, a margin,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.670
the font family, any line height,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.155
and so much more.

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:48.155
None of these changes are applied permanently.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:53.990
All we need to do is refresh and everything is restored back to default.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.930
This is just a quick tip to show you about

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.885
the Developer Tools if you've not used them before.

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.280
They can be really useful during development.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.295
The developer tools do also have lots more advanced features.

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.435
But we won't be covering this during this class.

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:14.540
Next up we're going to get back to coding our portfolio

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.590
by adding a background image and also a parallax effect.
