00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.265
Currently,our CSS grid looks a little bit like this.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:07.060
We've created equal sized columns and rows,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.879
and this is designed to accept the same size pieces of contents.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.505
Although we sometimes have the need to create

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:20.445
different size areas to allow us to use different size pieces of content.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:24.360
For example, you may want a wider piece of content,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.535
span across two grid areas,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:31.335
or do the same vertically for a taller piece of content.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.620
Fortunately, we can do this with the CSS grid,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.900
using the grid areas and this is what we are going to take a look at using now.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.560
In our project start HTML,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.190
we gave each one of our projects a unique ID.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.785
This is work1, work2,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.970
and then increasing for each one of our items.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.220
This ID can be used in the CSS to place each

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.490
one of these sections into any part of our grid.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.855
At the moment our grid items are just naturally flowing across the page.

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:05.530
Then moving on to the next row.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.115
We can use these IDs now and then place them in different sections.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.355
We can also allow them to take a multiple sections,

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.805
and this is what we are going to be covering in this video.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.285
In this CSS file,

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:22.939
I'm going to now go back up to our project page section

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.095
where we added the comment. Let's scroll up.

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:29.525
This is the section here.

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:34.195
We add this anywhere, but I'm going to add this after the title,

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:41.545
and we can select our section by ID using the hash and the name of work1.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.035
This may look a little bit confusing at first,

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:49.085
but do bear with me as this will become more clear very soon.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.015
What we're going to do here is set the grid area,

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.530
then we're going to give this grid area a unique name.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.620
Let's go for work1.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.805
Now we have this section in our CSS assigned to a new grid area called work1.

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:08.720
Then we're going to repeat this for each one of our sections.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.575
work2, this can be any names which you choose,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.595
but I'm going to keep this simple and consistent.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:24.440
Number four, number five,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.835
and remember mine goes up to nine items.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:38.265
Six, seven, number eight,

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.080
and finally number nine.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.020
Now, we have assigned a grid area named to each one of our elements.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.250
We can lay them out in any way which we want.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.435
Let's go back down to our media query where we set up our grid earlier on,

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.275
down at the bottom of this file.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:04.450
We can then use the grid template areas property.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.770
I want to add this on its own line, so it's more clear.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.005
Inside here we're going to declare how we want our new grid to look.

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.930
Rather than certain things our weight,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.635
our grid template columns,

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.895
and rows which we looked at before,

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.570
where the content will flow more naturally,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.820
here we are declaring exactly which piece of content

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.540
we want to add into each one of our grid areas.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.045
We lay this out in a visual way between the quotations.

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:37.040
For example, if we wanted free columns,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.935
we could set the first place on the top left,

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:44.190
which is this one, to be the section called work1.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.935
Next up, I'm going to declare that work4 is going to be the second item on the first row,

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:54.585
then the third one is going to be the work7.

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:58.580
This is the items which you want to appear on the first row.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.145
On the next row between the quotations,

00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:03.550
we can then do exactly the same.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.210
I'm going to say it's work2 work5,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.805
and then also work7.

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:15.660
Notice here that this four are unique pieces.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.305
Then on the right-hand side we have two with the same name.

00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:22.685
This means that the work7 will take up two parts,

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:26.285
meaning that it will be a lot taller than the other items.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.910
For example, on our grid here,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.010
this will be one section just here,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.530
and work7 will take up both places.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.085
Down to our next row,

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.960
I'm going to set work3,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.130
work6, and then work8.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.300
Then for the following row,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.925
I'm going to add one section of work.

00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:55.990
This is going to span the full width of our grid taking up three parts on the same row.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.670
Since we have three sections declared,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.460
all we need to do is to add the same name of work9 into each one of our sections.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.200
Here without even seeing the grid in the browser,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.245
we get a visual representation of how our grid is going to be laid out.

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:17.855
We can see that all of these sections are individual,

00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:19.880
except this last section here,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.595
and also this vertical section in the top right.

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:26.155
Let's now save this.

00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:28.520
Reload the browser.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.305
In the top right we have this section which spans the two vertical columns.

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.980
We then have our individual pieces all surrounding,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.685
then at the bottom, the section taken up the full row,

00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:43.110
which is the work9.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.220
We can use this grid area technique to create some nice looking layouts and also

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.355
some more complex designs depending on the content which we have inside of our grid.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.145
In the next video, we're going to improve

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:03.930
our portfolio section by adding some nice CSS hover effects.
