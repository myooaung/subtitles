1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,270
In this section we're going to make our basketball la the app is pretty self-explanatory.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,290
Just try to score the ball.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:20,560
So open up X code create a new project a single application call the project a hoops press next and

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:29,830
create like always go to the main storyboard and to your initial view controller add an A or kid scene.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:41,140
If you expend the arcade scene kid view to the edges of your super view and pin it to the top leading

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:51,190
bottom and trailing space add a button in the middle of your etiquettes view and align it horizontally

7
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:00,830
and vertically add the two constraints and make a new image asset into your assets assets folder new

8
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,010
image set call the image set Plus

9
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,820
an inside of your resources folder there are assets of a plus button once you download them add them

10
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,180
to your assets folder.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,510
Re maximize my X code project and back to the storyboard take off this button text inside of your attributes

12
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,180
and Spector set the plus image as your image.

13
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,460
There you go.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,450
Now inside of your controller linked the arcade scene view with an ideal scene view

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:54,050
clothes the assistant editor and back to the View Controller import a kit in the next couple of steps

16
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,060
is something we've done many times before.

17
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:05,140
First it was to declare a constant configuration equal to a role tracking session configuration.

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,460
Run a scene view session with that configuration by writing self-deceit view session.

19
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:20,210
Run configuration debug options to your scene view by writing self-deceit view debug options equal to

20
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:27,560
an array type of debug options such that we want to show the world origin and we also want to show feature

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,870
points and other stuff.

22
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,370
We've done a million times before as go to your input output list and add the property privacy camera

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,110
uses description.

24
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,540
This simply displays an alert to the user prompting him to enable the camera.

25
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:52,880
A descriptive message to the alert saying you need the camera to display cool air.

26
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,280
Contact back to your controller.

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,950
One more thing I want to add is lighting.

28
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,600
So that itself does seem to view the auto enables default lighting is equal to true.

29
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,170
In fact it's always a good idea.

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,590
Tear it just makes everything look better in general.

31
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,870
So first order of business is we're going to build our basketball net so right click on your project

32
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,460
folder press 1 new file and scroll down until you find your scene Kitsune file press.

33
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,680
Next call you're seeing a scene file basketball or something related to the UP.

34
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,160
Create and expand this navigator and delete the scammer.

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,670
No we won't be needing it.

36
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:53,250
I don't know the tear seen it called the empty node basket into your scene.

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,060
INSPECTOR.

38
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,580
I'm just going to change this from a color of great color of white since that's easier to work with.

39
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,980
Your basket no.

40
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,170
First things first I just want to position it in the middle of the scene because it's easier to work

41
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,110
with that way.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,490
I don't know why this is so hard to click on.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,510
They should really fix that.

44
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,260
So it was 0

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,090
0 Anzur

46
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,970
Okay now to just go on the front prospective

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
click the play button twice and then double click on your basket.

48
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,750
There you go.

49
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,690
So to your basket node first we're going to add a floor.

50
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,560
So right.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,950
Floor and this floor to your seat of view.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,580
Or you know instead of just adding it to the scene view make it a direct child of our basket note and

53
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,280
make sure it's positioned exactly where the basket note is which it already is.

54
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,460
Zero 0 0 perfect alignment.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,060
OK.

56
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,600
This is our first time using a floor.

57
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:09,960
So in the attributes inspector give the floor a width of 0.5.

58
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,000
They should really make these easier to click on.

59
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,040
So 0.5 and a length of 1

60
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,700
I just drag it to one.

61
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,800
This is much easier.

62
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,280
There you go.

63
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,230
One.

64
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,080
OK.

65
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,370
And now give the floor a diffuse color of gray.

66
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,930
So magnesium I guess right here is our floor.

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
And now back to your attributes and Specter.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,830
It's not very clear the effect of this reflective property right now but you'll see what it does in

69
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,010
a minute.

70
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,340
So now in front of the floor we need to add our basket.

71
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:03,170
So start with the back board which will be a box add the box here scene view in the material inspector

72
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:12,060
give the box a color of lemon yellow and in the attributes inspector give it a width of 1.5 metre is

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,810
a height of 1 metres which is already there and a depth of 0.01 metres.

74
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,720
We want the board to be really thin 0.01.

75
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,280
There you go.

76
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,130
And let me just fix the front perspective.

77
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,010
OK.

78
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,300
So first off we want to make this buckboard a child of the basket.

79
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:45,440
And once you do that place it about two metres above the parent node and let's say negative three metres

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,990
behind it or 3.4 metres behind our Basken our floor.

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,970
If I just fix the perspective to be perspective instead of front

82
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,100
and this looks really good.

83
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,620
Notice the floor is a reflective property.

84
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:19,030
The higher this value the more the floor reflects 0.35 is a good value.

85
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,440
So I'm just going to keep it at that.

86
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,320
And finally we need to ring the hoop into which the user will shoot the ball.

87
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,740
The ring will be at Taurus cerate Taurus and we went over what a Taurus was in the introductory section

88
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,980
of the course.

89
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,130
So I had a Taurus and make it a child of the empty node basket as well.

90
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,780
And before proceeding let me just rename this from box to blackboard

91
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,800
and cat.

92
00:07:50,330 --> 00:08:00,310
And now this Taurus give it a ring radius of 0.4 meters and a pipe radius of about 0.01 metres.

93
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:08,730
We want to make it very thin like so now into the material inspector give the Taurus a diffused color

94
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,150
of red.

95
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,070
Now we want to position the running about 1.5 metres from the floor or from the basket node for that

96
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,970
matter.

97
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,100
And about three metres behind the floor so negative Threet

98
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,240
this is looking pretty good.

99
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,010
This really does look like a cool basketball court.

100
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,790
So now before we play this basketball court into our scene view we need to place this scene file into

101
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,760
an SDN assets folder.

102
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,860
So add a new file to your projects folder.

103
00:08:49,180 --> 00:09:00,950
Make sure the file is an asset catalog call the asset catalog basketball and create instead of this

104
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:10,140
being an X C assets make it a C and that's and for some reason all these crosses when I do that so let

105
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,770
me just reopen it.

106
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:18,400
The app is called a are Hoopes right here.

107
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
Everything is in good working order still.

108
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,040
Let me just drag this into my folder and we're good to go.

109
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,600
Now to just display this basketball court into our scene view.

110
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,030
So where we tap on a horizontal surface we want to display this basketball court.

111
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,730
We just did this two lectures ago and we've done it in many other lectures.

112
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,130
I want you to pause the video and use whatever resources you have to try this one alone.

113
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,000
So assuming that you've already tried it first off.

114
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,690
We need that configuration to detect horizontal surfaces.

115
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:07,700
So right self duct configuration that plane detection is equal to a dot horizontal.

116
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,960
Now we need an indicator to tell us when a plane was detected.

117
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:23,250
So inside of your story board add a label to the top of your view controller called the label plane

118
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,790
detected

119
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,230
align it horizontally to your controller.

120
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:39,750
That constraint and pin it about 40 feet from the top go to your attributes and Specter and where it's

121
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,660
us Funt.

122
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:51,210
I'm going to give it a font of your next by just going on custom and then family venir next and it's

123
00:10:51,210 --> 00:11:00,530
going to be a bold font with a size of about 22 and done so open up the assistant editor and link this

124
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:08,760
label to your view controller with an IBM plained detected close the assistant editor and make sure

125
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,570
that this label is hidden first.

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,290
We only want to unhide this label when a plane is detected.

127
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,070
So back to your view controller inherit from a.r.

128
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:30,820
I see and we delegate and call the delegate function did an anchor this delegate function gets called

129
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:37,210
whenever an anchor is added Whenever an anchor is detected only when it detects a plain anchor.

130
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:44,330
We want to unhide our label so Guard anchor is of type A plain anchor.

131
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,900
Else return.

132
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,430
So if a plain anchor was detected if a surface is detected then unhide the label.

133
00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:02,170
So self the plane detected is hidden is equal to false and hide it and now make sure you do this on

134
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,400
the main thread.

135
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,660
So right dispatch.

136
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:13,260
Q. Does it mean that a sink can put this block of code inside of the main thread.

137
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,160
OK.

138
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,630
Now three seconds later you want to hide the label again.

139
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,180
So right.

140
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,820
Dispatch.

141
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:33,490
Q. Does it mean that a sink after Darton now plus three so three seconds later we want to unhide the

142
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,520
label.

143
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:44,320
So right here just right self up plane detected is head and is equal to true now to activate this function

144
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,440
just re self seeing view.

145
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:54,790
DOD delegate is equal to self and run the app to make sure that there are no bugs.

146
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,370
And everything seems to work fine.

147
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,570
Now would just place the basketball court on the horizontal surface.

148
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,630
This is simply hit us thing.

149
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,930
We've done this a million times.

150
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,790
So entier if you controller make a tap gesture recognizer.

151
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:33,830
So right let top gesture recognizer is equal to UI tab gesture recognizer the target will be self and

152
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,970
the actual function that will be triggered is handled top.

153
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:48,110
So right phunk handle top with arguments sunder of type UI type gesture recognizer and make sure to

154
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,810
expose this function to Objective C before putting it into our selector.

155
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,930
Now right the selector handle type.

156
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,500
OK.

157
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:09,480
Now register this recognizer into your scene view by writing self scene view gesture recognizer UI or

158
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,770
just type just recognizer.

159
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,400
So whenever you tap the scene view this function will get triggered and now declare the scene viewed

160
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:25,320
that you tapped on by guard letting scene view is equal to sender view.

161
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,380
As you see in view else return

162
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:42,400
declare the location that you touched by writing touch location is equal to sender location inside of

163
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,330
the scene view.

164
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,130
Now check if the location that you touched matches the location of an existing plane by doing a hit

165
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,240
test.

166
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,750
So hit test result is equal to seen.

167
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:09,190
View the hit test first argument is the touch location and types dot existing plane using extent.

168
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,210
If the location you touched matches died of a horizontal plane your hate test results array will have

169
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,210
one element of results.

170
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,870
If the location you touch doesn't not start of a horizontal plane your head test array will be empty.

171
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:31,250
So if his test result is empty and make sure to add the exclamation mark to say if his test result is

172
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,200
not empty.

173
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,860
So if we touched a horizontal surface then we're going to add our basketball court right here else.

174
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,870
If the test result is empty do nothing.

175
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,240
Actually why not just remove this Alstad mean we don't even need it.

176
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:59,040
So if we do indeed touch a horizontal surface first we want to declare a function func basket with argument.

177
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,780
Hit test result of type A are.

178
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,440
Test result.

179
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,540
In past your hit test result into your function by writing self.

180
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:17,180
Add basket and I seem to have made an error instead of putting top gesture recognizer I put you on top

181
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,640
just a recognizer which makes zero sense.

182
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,570
So let me just fix that up.

183
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,480
And now to just pass our test result destroyed his test result.

184
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,920
First.

185
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,480
Remember there is only one element of results and it's the first element.

186
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,470
OK now an odd basket.

187
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:42,710
First let's load the basket seen by writing let basket's seen is equal to see and seen Nemed to access

188
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,520
your scene.

189
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:54,400
First go into its directory which is this one copy slash basketball scene.

190
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,960
Now that we loaded our scene we need the basket node.

191
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,310
The basket node is a child of the scene root node.

192
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,060
So just right left basket node is equal to basket.

193
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:19,720
The root node child node with name and the name of our node is simply basket's.

194
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:27,310
So make sure to copy this right here and set recursively as false since the basket node is an immediate

195
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,890
child of the scenes root node.

196
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,560
We need to place our basket node exactly where we top the horizontal surface.

197
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,870
We can get that position from the hit test results transform matrix as we discussed before the position

198
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,010
is in the transforms.

199
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,150
Third column.

200
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,930
So right let position of plane is equal to hit.

201
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,820
Test result that world transform doc columns 3.

202
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,620
Now try it.

203
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:09,830
X position is equal to position of plane x y position is equal to position of plane 1 and that position

204
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,810
is equal to position of plane.

205
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,810
And now just right Baskett node position is equal to as the end of vector 3

206
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,650
and just fill out your X Y and Z positions such that they match the exact position of the plane that

207
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,400
you detected.

208
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:46,340
Now you just have to add it to the scene view by writing self seen view seen root node dot child node

209
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,450
Baskett node

210
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
going to forcefully unwrap and then you're done.

211
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,680
Just run the up

212
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,510
wait for the world origin to load.

213
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:10,270
Once the world origin loads the touched a surface top surface and there is your basketball court.

214
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,910
This is really cool.

215
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,330
In the next video we're going to start shooting a basketball into our hoop.
