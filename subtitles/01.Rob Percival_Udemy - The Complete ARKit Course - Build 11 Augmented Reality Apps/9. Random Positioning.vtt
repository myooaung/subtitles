00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.760
And the last video we learn how to reset a few sessions that we can reposition notes based on a new

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.400
starting Warragul origin in this video we're going to further customize notes and position them in random

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.430
places.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.660
So first change the chamfer radius to about zero point zero three.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.470
So what this will do is it will cut off about three centimeters zero point zero three meters from the

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.870
edges of the box giving it a rounder edge.

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.240
Run the up.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.000
If you look at the box very closely.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.350
Notice that the edges are rounder if you want to make a sphere back to X code.

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.520
Make sure that all of these dimensions are the same and make the chamfer radius one half of all of these

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.500
dimensions.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.880
So right 0.1 divided by two.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
So the trick is if all of the dimensions of the same measurement and you divide that measurement by

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.920
two you will get a sphere run up.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400
Wait till the world origin loads.

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.530
Press add and it gives us a sphere.

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.350
This will be useful once you get to drawing in three dimensions.

18
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.760
For now though change this back to 0.03 and give the box a specular light by node does geometry.

19
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.100
First material does specular content's is equal to you like colored adult white.

20
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020
So first material is the appearance of a surface.

21
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.710
As I explained before in specular is light that's reflected off of a surface.

22
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.070
We're giving the light a color of white so a white light is going to reflect off of the surface of the

23
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.260
box.

24
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.130
Run the app to see how this works.

25
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.030
Wait till the world origin loads.

26
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.060
Press add and notice that nothing happens.

27
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.790
There is no white light reflecting.

28
00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.550
The reason is you need to give the scene view a source of light for the node to be able to reflect it.

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.580
So in view to load right when we are on our session we're going to add lighting by writing self does

30
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.080
view all enables default lighting is equal to true.

31
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.090
By doing this you're putting an omni directional light source in the scene view an omni directional

32
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.820
light source is simply light that spreads across the entire scene that we have light run the up again.

33
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.320
Wait till the world origin loads press.

34
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.550
And you get a reflection of white from the box

35
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.540
now have it reflect a color of orange by replacing the white speculate with an orange color.

36
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.390
Run the up press add and it reflects an orange color.

37
00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.070
Now instead of positioning the box in one place we're going to position it in many places.

38
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.370
This function is inside of your resources folder.

39
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.710
Make sure to copy it into your ex-cult project.

40
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.750
So this function takes a minimum flow value and a maximum flow value.

41
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.400
And it gives you a flow value in between.

42
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.860
This will be used to place the box in random directions instead of just one.

43
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.110
Now don't worry about this complicated return and you just know that it gives you a random value in

44
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.690
the range that you give it.

45
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.230
So back to your ad idea action.

46
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.950
Right.

47
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.930
X is equal to random numbers between negative 0.3 and 0.3.

48
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.630
So what this will do for us is that it will return a float value that's between 0.3 meters to the left

49
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.810
of the world origin and 0.3 meters to the right.

50
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.200
Do the same thing for the y value.

51
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.220
Why is equal to random numbers between negative 0.3 meters below the origin and 0.3 meters above the

52
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.400
world origin.

53
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.490
Do the same thing for those that value.

54
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.000
And this will give us a random flip value that's between negative 0.3 meters behind the world origin

55
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.830
and 0.3 meters in front of it.

56
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.120
And instead of having these Sadik values for the positioning just put X Y and Zed.

57
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.730
And so now we have a random horizontal vertical and depth for every single box that we had to test this

58
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.710
just run the up.

59
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.790
Let me just wait till the world origin loads

60
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.740
and as soon as it loads let me back away from it and start adding some boxes and notice all of these

61
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.550
boxes that are getting added in random positions every time.

62
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.250
This is pretty cool and how they're all reflecting an orange color of light and the next video we're

63
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.830
going to look at default and custom shapes.
