Hi there I'm Rayan.
1

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.980
And in this course you're going to build many apps using ARKit to start this course.
2

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.860
First you're going to display a very basic shapes into the phone's camera view and you'll finish this
3

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.980
section by making a very basic up in which you build a house from very basic shapes and display the
4

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.880
House and the phone's camera view.
5

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.530
And the next section you're going to draw in 3D by learning how and when to place nodes right in front
6

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.350
of the camera's position right after that you will learn how to rap different shapes with textures and
7

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.710
surfaces to make really cool designs like the planet Earth.
8

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.820
Then you'll make a really cool game by learning how to make 3-D models like the jellyfish you see right
9

10
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.630
now and how to apply basic animations to these models.
10

11
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.310
After that you will learn how to detect planes which are simply horizontal surfaces in the world around
11

12
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.240
you to master plane detection you will replace every horizontal plane with lava.
12

13
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.830
And once we've mastered plane detection you'll make your Ikea up where you will place household objects
13

14
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.200
on top of horizontal surfaces.
14

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.400
You'll also learn how to drive on top of these surfaces.
15

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.810
We're going to build our own vehicle give that vehicle vehicular physics learn how to steer the vehicle
16

17
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.070
based on the orientation of the phone.
17

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.060
You will learn to use the phone's accelerometer chip to detect your phone's orientation and therefore
18

19
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.900
steering your car accordingly.
19

20
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.400
Then you will make a distance measuring up which allows you to measure real life distances in the real
20

21
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.240
world.
21

22
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.650
Next you'll learn to make an and or a dimensional portal.
22

23
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.860
You will build the portal yourself.
23

24
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.870
Learn how to design your portal with different cube map images and you'll learn to mask the portal and
24

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.440
by doing so you'll give the user the illusion that he's going inside of a whole new world.
25

26
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.330
Next you'll learn how to launch projectiles by making a basketball up you'll build a basketball court
26

27
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.510
from scratch displayed in the scene.
27

28
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.010
View design your own basketball and launch your basketball based on how the phone is oriented as well
28

29
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.020
as the force that's being applied on the ball.
29

30
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.610
Finally you'll make a shooter up one in which the user shoots a bullet and tries to hit the targets
30

31
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.200
in front of them.
31

32
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.970
By making this up you will learn how to detect contact between two three dimensional objects.
32

33
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.960
By the end of this course you will have the confidence to build any A-R kit that you put your mind to.
