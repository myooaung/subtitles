1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,780
In this video we're going to rotate planets relative to the sun.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:12,960
So in X code we're going to have the sun rotate 360 degrees around that so do that by writing action

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,590
is equal to see an action rotate by with arguments x y set and duration.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,630
Now this is a view but remember that rotating around the X gives a vertical rotation around the Y gives

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,360
the horizontal rotation and around the said gives a clockwise or taken.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,790
We're not going to rotate the sun vertically so we've got a zero.

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,700
We're going to rotate it 360 degrees horizontally around the y axis or right here right 360 degrees

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,410
to radians and convert that to LCG float to avoid an air.

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,110
As for these value we are not going to erode the sun clockwise so eat that as Europe.

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,860
Now how fast the sun will rotate around that cell will be eight seconds.

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:06,320
Make sure this action lasts forever by writing forever is equal to see in action.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Got repeat forever.

13
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,500
And the action we're going to be forever is the rotation across the y axis.

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:20,630
Action now to activate the forever action right Sun Run action forever.

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,200
So the sun was just given this action such that it repeats forever.

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:26,870
All right.

17
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,830
Now before I run the out it's important to note that the sun is the parent node of both Earth and Venus.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,010
And if you remember from before and the Getting Started section in the lecture on rotation if I rotate

19
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:47,360
the parent node a certain angle around the y axis horizontally then the child node as it needs to preserve

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,980
its relative orientation to the parent node is also going to rotate horizontally around the parent node.

21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:03,020
So what we should observe is the sun rotating 360 degrees around itself and the planets rotating 360

22
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,750
degrees around the sun.

23
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,040
If you're confused as to why that is.

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,550
Make sure to revisit the rotation lecture in the Getting Started section for more info.

25
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,770
So run the app

26
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,770
and so the sun rotates 360 degrees around itself.

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,110
And Venus and Earth rotate 360 degrees around the sun although realistically it takes much longer for

28
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,450
the Earth to rotate around the sun than Venus.

29
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,390
And yet in this demonstration they're both rotating around the sun at the same rates.

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,900
So back to Mexico it takes eight seconds for the sun to rotate around itself.

31
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,660
And since Earth and Venus are children of the sun it will take them both 8 seconds to rotate around

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,200
the sun as well.

33
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:03,750
So the solution is to make Earth and Venus children of two different nodes so make two notes.

34
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,000
The first one.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,040
Let earth parent is equal you see and know.

36
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:18,560
And the second one let Venus parents is also equal to an C.A..

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,180
So we're not going to give these notes a geometry or anything.

38
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,170
We only need them so that we can give Earth and Venus different speeds of rotation and earth parent

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:29,800
to the scene.

40
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,300
View by just copying and pasting this line of code and instead of sun.

41
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,600
Just what you are there and do the same thing for Venus.

42
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:46,030
So just copy paste this and it is now in the scene view for Earth parent.

43
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,370
Make sure its position is exactly that of the sun so Earth parent position is equal to seeing that your

44
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,830
3 0 0 and negative 1.

45
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,750
So we're putting the earth parents exactly where the sun is which makes sense since we have to give

46
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,650
the illusion that Earth is positioned around the sun even though it's going to be positioned around

47
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,930
the Earth parent.

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,750
So do the same thing for the Venus parent.

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,030
So just copy this line of code instead of parent copying Venus.

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:29,280
So make Earth a child node of Earth parent instead by replacing the sun with Earth parents and do the

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,860
same thing for Venus make Venus a child of Venus.

52
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,280
So now earth is one point two meters to the right of the earth parents.

53
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,550
However earth parent is positioned exactly where the sun is so it will look like Earth is actually one

54
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,180
point two metres to the right of the sun and the same thing for Venus and Venus where it is also positioned

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,590
exactly where the sun is so it will look like Venus is actually 0.7 metres away from the sun.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,920
So run the app

57
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,620
and notice that Venus and Earth are not rotating around the sun any more and that's because they're

58
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,460
not children of the sun.

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,670
There are children of Earth parent and Venus parents earth parent and Venus parent are invisible nodes

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,280
since we gave them no geometry.

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,930
They are located exactly where the sun is basically inside the sun.

62
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:35,400
So if fire rotate or Haret and Venus parents around the y axis horizontally are children Venus and Earth

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,360
should rotate around their parents horizontally as well.

64
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,070
So back to X code.

65
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,500
Let earth parents.

66
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:52,030
A rotation is equal to see an action does rotate by an it's not going to rotate across the x axis.

67
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,840
It's going to rotate horizontally around the y axis 360 degrees.

68
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,970
It will not rotate clockwise and the duration of this rotation will be about 14 seconds.

69
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,420
So the Earth parent will take 14 seconds to rotate around itself.

70
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,310
Now as for the Venus rotation just copy and paste this.

71
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,800
Replace the name with Venus and instead of it taking 14 seconds to rotate around itself it will take

72
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,110
Venus 10 seconds.

73
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,210
So for both parents they will rotate 360 degrees around themselves.

74
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,610
However the Earth parent rotation is going to rotates slower than Venus or rotation.

75
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,020
It's going to be 4 seconds longer.

76
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,730
And since Earth and Venus are both rotating around their parents Venus or O.T. faster around its parent

77
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,290
than Earth.

78
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:50,610
Well and since both parents are positioned exactly where the sun is you can say that Venus will rotate

79
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,060
around the sun faster than Earth which is what we intended to do from the start.

80
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,270
So have both rotations last forever by writing love forever.

81
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,490
Earth is equal to LCN action.

82
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,890
Rotate repeat forever.

83
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,890
Earth's rotation

84
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,490
do the same thing for the Venus per rotation by copying and pasting this.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,860
Call that forever Venus and Venus and our wrote Richard no.

86
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,670
Make sure to run these rotations by writing or

87
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,950
a run action forever or SUNO the parent will rotate forever and the same thing for Venus right Venus

88
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,790
parents don't run auction or I heard Miss

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,410
OK.

90
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,110
Now run the

91
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,360
and notice how Venus is going around the sun faster than earth is all right now.

92
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,280
Here's a challenge.

93
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,620
Try giving one moon for the earth and one moon for Venus.

94
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,040
Make sure the moon surface is this texture and try to make it such that the moon rotates around each

95
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,790
planets paused the video and try to

96
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,510
download the moon texture.

97
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,980
Show it in Finder.

98
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:34,510
And in your assets folder add an image called Milman diffuse.

99
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:43,640
Minimize this and add the moon Yunji into your assets folder and back to your view controller source

100
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:51,170
file I'll make a new planet node so the moon isn't exactly a planet but we're going to use this function

101
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,910
just because it's convenient.

102
00:08:53,270 --> 00:09:02,180
So that Moon is equal to planets give it age country of a sphere with a radius of zero point zero five

103
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:10,440
meters so five centimeters he diffused would be the fuse that we just drive into are us older.

104
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,660
We don't have any specular images nor do we have emission or normal and give it a position of zero point

105
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:27,040
three meters away from the earth and do the same exact thing for the Venus Moon and this should be CNN.

106
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:34,970
Right now I see a doctor and a moon here just right in unison so this will be positioned relative to

107
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,410
the earth.

108
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,790
This will position relative to Venus so may each moon hate child of its respective planet by writing

109
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:56,340
Earth dot and child no moon and venus dot child node Venus mirror all right.

110
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,710
Now we need to go to each moon around its planet.

111
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,440
We've done this a million times because if you rotate the parents of certain angle horizontally the

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,020
child will rotate around the planet at the same angle.

113
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,620
So let earth rotation

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,050
is equal to SC and action.

115
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:27,860
Rotate byme rotate the earth is 0 around the X-axis 360 degrees horizontally around the y axis and we

116
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,400
are not going to rotate at all.

117
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,270
Why so 0 and give it any duration you want.

118
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,900
I am going to choose 8 seconds.

119
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,290
Do the same exact thing for Venus rotation.

120
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,700
It doesn't matter how fast any of them rotate.

121
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,380
So to make sure that the rotations last forever just right love forever.

122
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,970
Earth's rotation is equal to.

123
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,570
I see an action that repeats forever.

124
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:04,340
Earth's rotation do the same exact thing or the Venus rotation and just change this to forever.

125
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,420
Venus rotation

126
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,890
and replace Earth's rotation with this.

127
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:19,250
Now run these auctions by writing Earth run action forever.

128
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,070
Earth rotation

129
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,080
Venus don't run option forever.

130
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,100
Venus rotation.

131
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,250
So Earth will rotate around itself.

132
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,850
And since the Earth Moon is a child of earth the earth moon will rotate around the Earth itself.

133
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,940
The same thing will happen for Venus and its moon.

134
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,070
So you know what.

135
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,350
I'm not a big fan of the way things are at the moment.

136
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,940
We seem to be repeating these functions a lot.

137
00:11:49,060 --> 00:12:01,220
So to avoid this make a function called rotation that takes an a time interval and returns the action

138
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,850
for us instead of always having to write it over and over.

139
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,200
And so copy one CNI action and one forever action.

140
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,700
And instead of these custom names just call them the generic rotation and forever a rotation names change

141
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,130
this to rotation as well.

142
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:28,050
And Mixtura the duration is whatever time interval we give it and then return the forever option.

143
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,110
And so now instead of always having to rewrite all of this all you have to right now is for example.

144
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,660
This is the sun action.

145
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,380
So it just writes less sun.

146
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,450
Action is equal to rotation.

147
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:46,650
Aissa

148
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,610
since right here it says eight seconds.

149
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,670
So you can delete all of this.

150
00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:00,790
And wherever we were calling it which is right here just right son action we're going to do the same

151
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,050
thing for the earth parent rotation.

152
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,730
So this is 14 seconds.

153
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,040
Right.

154
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:13,770
Let earth parent rotation is equal to rotation of type 14 seconds.

155
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,030
Or place that do the same thing for Venus Venus parent rotation is equal to rotation.

156
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:34,910
Ten seconds and you can do all of this and there is a earth and forever earth rotation you can replace

157
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:41,940
that with the earth rotation is equal to rotation with time.

158
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,840
Eight seconds and do the same thing for the Venus rotation

159
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,390
is equal rotation eight seconds as well.

160
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,390
So you can delete all of this and right here.

161
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,100
Just put Earth rotation here put the Venus rotation

162
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:15,810
for Earth parent the earth parent rotation for Venus parent Venus parent rotation.

163
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,890
Notice how much cleaner this is.

164
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,150
Now we can run the

165
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,050
and notice the moon rotating around each planet since the planets are rotating around themselves.

166
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,520
Ok first off Venus doesn't actually have a moon.

167
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,480
This was just for a demonstration purposes.

168
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,280
So I'm just going to remove Venus's moon right here and where it says Venus thought childhood Venus

169
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,540
Moon and then want to remove that as well.

170
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,570
And now what if I want to rotate the moon around the earth at a different speed.

171
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,760
Right now it takes eight seconds for the Earth to rotate around itself.

172
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,130
So it will automatically take the moon eight seconds to rotate around the Earth since the Moon is a

173
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,530
child of the earth whatever the speed the earth rotates around itself.

174
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,470
The moon is going to rotate around the earth at the same speed.

175
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,660
Now remember from earlier when Earth and Venus were rotating around the sun we were able to give them

176
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,810
their own speeds of rotation by making them children of their respective parents.

177
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,070
Earth parent and Venus parent.

178
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,940
So do the same thing for the moon right.

179
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,120
Let moon parent

180
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,810
is equal to see a node.

181
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,590
I'm just going to declare that on top right here with the other parents.

182
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,910
So the moon parent is not going to have a geometry or anything.

183
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,880
Just like the other parents it will stay invisible.

184
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,610
It's only there to control the moon's rotation speed.

185
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,180
Now place the moon parent exactly where the earth is so right.

186
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,990
MOON parent

187
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,270
dot position is equal to see and vector 3.

188
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,460
And just copy the position that the earth has

189
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,050
and since the Earth is a child of the earth parent make the moon parent a child of the earth parent

190
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,800
as well.

191
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,160
Sarette earth parent Dogpatch child node neun parent.

192
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,620
Why did I just do this.

193
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,710
Now the moon parent is always going to be positioned exactly where the earth is.

194
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,990
How while both the moon parent and the earth are positioned relative to the earth parent and their starting

195
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,900
position relative to the earth parent is the exact same.

196
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,990
So wherever the earth is the moon parent is going to be at that exact same position.

197
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,380
And remember that the earth parent is just an invisible node.

198
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,670
We're only using it to control the moon's orientation around the Earth.

199
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:04,210
So give moon parent a rotation of 1 second by writing let Moon rotation is equal to rotation and the

200
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,790
time it's going to take to rotate around itself will be one second and make the moon a child of the

201
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:16,460
moon parent by writing moon parent child node moon.

202
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:24,130
Now just make sure to run this action by writing moon parent run action moon rotation.

203
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,350
In summary here is what's happening.

204
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:32,380
It takes the moon parent 1 second to rotate around itself which is really fast.

205
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,870
So it's going to take the moon one second to rotate around the moon parent and since the moon parent

206
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,410
is always exactly where the Earth is you can see that it's going to take the moon one second to rotate

207
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,910
around the Earth which is really fast.

208
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,350
Run the app to see if that's the case.

209
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:57,680
And look the moon rotates around the earth very quickly.

210
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,600
We were able to control the speed of the moon.

211
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,690
Now one second for the moon to rotate around the Earth is a bit too fast.

212
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,540
But X code.

213
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:17,970
Change it to about 5 seconds run the Afghan and there you go.

214
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,320
We were able to control the speed of how fast the moon rotates around the earth and that's it.

215
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:30,760
We learn how to wrap nodes with textures rotate nodes and control the speed of rotation.

216
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,890
This has a lot to learn and you've made it this far in the next section.

217
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,040
We're going to look at 3D models.
