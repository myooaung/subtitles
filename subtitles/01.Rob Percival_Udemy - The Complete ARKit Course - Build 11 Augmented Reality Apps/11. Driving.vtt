00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.180
In the last video we were able to steer the car in whichever direction the film was oriented.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.840
Now we're going to start driving the car.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.130
So the idea is that when I touch the screen of the phone the car should start driving.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.820
So override touch has begin

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.710
and override touch is ended.

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.160
Make a variable var touched of type.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:36.110
Bull is equal to false touches me again gets triggered whenever the user touches the screen of the phone.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.660
So if the user touches the screen of the phone set touch the true self not touched is equal to true

9
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:52.460
when the user releases the scene view when the user is not touching the screen a touch to false and

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.050
now inside of it simulate physics at time.

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.470
Let me just try and find it.

12
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.120
Right var engine for us of type float is equal to zero.

13
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.820
Now if Tut is equal to true let me just call this self-taught touched.

14
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.120
If self-edit touched is equal to true if the user is touching the scene view set the engine force equal

15
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.760
to 50 Newnes else.

16
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.430
If the user is not touching the screen set the engine for us to zero Newtons.

17
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.700
We want to apply this engine for us to our car before I do that.

18
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.800
Make sure this is a double equal sign to indicate a boolean check.

19
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:49.320
And now we want to apply this engine force to our car so a vehicle or self vehicle apply engine for

20
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.000
us.

21
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.070
The engine for us for applying is simply the engine for his variable and we want to apply this engine

22
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.590
force to the back wheels.

23
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.840
If I go to my wheels the right which is right here the back wheels are located in Indigo's zero in one

24
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.300
of the wheels right.

25
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.180
The one in the zero is the rear wheel and the one at inducts one is at the rear left wheel.

26
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.770
So back into here.

27
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.810
Make sure you apply engine force to wheel Zura the rear right wheel and apply it to wheel one to the

28
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.050
rear left wheel and it's telling me that I cannot convert a value of type float to expected argument

29
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.610
type CEG float.

30
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.980
So instead of making this a float value make it a C.G. float and it's as simple as that.

31
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.390
Run the UP WAIT TILL THE WORLD orange and loads as soon as the world orange and loads start detecting

32
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.250
some surfaces.

33
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.060
Once you've detected enough surfaces and your car

34
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.570
as soon as I touch the screen the car drives.

35
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.030
However the car drives towards me let me just try this again.

36
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.110
Which makes sense since as soon as I add the car the car faces me and since the car is moving forward

37
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.130
it makes sense that the car drives towards me.

38
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.850
We need it such that when the car is in front of us it's facing the other direction inside of your scene.

39
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.570
When the car is in front of us so go to the front perspective click the play button twice.

40
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.450
At the moment the car is facing me.

41
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.040
I don't want it such that when the car is in front of me it's facing the other direction.

42
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.810
So click on your chest Snoad resize the navigator and we want to rotate it 180 degrees horizontally

43
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.700
across the y axis such diets facing the other direction.

44
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:55.080
If you look at the car now when it's in front of us it's going to be facing the other direction run

45
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:04.800
the up as soon as the world origin loads start detecting some surfaces once you've detected enough surfaces

46
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.000
rotate your phone horizontally such that the car moves straight as soon as we touch the screen.

47
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.580
I need your car and if I touch the screen the car moves away from us which makes sense.

48
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.600
The car is facing the other direction and it's moving straight.

49
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.940
However now if I orient my phone to the left and I touch the screen the car moves to the right.

50
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.400
If I orient my phone to the right the car moves to the left.

51
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.980
That's because we reversed the car's orientation by rotating at 180 degrees across the y axis.

52
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.380
Therefore the steering angle required to move the car a certain direction was reversed as well.

53
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.990
So all we have to do to fix that is simply reverse the steering angle.

54
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.700
I want you to pause the video and give it a try.

55
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.910
To reverse the orientation what's the car is steering just make the orientation a negative and now everything

56
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.490
should be in sync.

57
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.940
Rerun the EP.

58
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:21.380
Wait till the world origin loads once your origin load started detecting some surfaces once you've detected

59
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.180
a large enough surface in your car to that surface.

60
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.600
Make sure your phone is horizontal so that your car moves straight first.

61
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.530
Now if I move my Filon to the left the car moves to the left.

62
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.390
Now let me add another car.

63
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.600
If I move my phone to the right the car is going to move to the right.

64
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.600
Now the car is a bit too fast.

65
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.450
There are two ways to control it speed.

66
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.950
One way is to simply change it smacks so right when we're declaring our physics body we're going to

67
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:09.250
give the physics body of our car a mass so right body mass is equal to 5 Newtons.

68
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.940
The mass of the car before was only one.

69
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.150
Since that is the default mass of any physics body.

70
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.500
Now the car is 5 Newtons.

71
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.440
It's much heavier and therefore will move slower.

72
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.770
Run the UP WAIT TILL THE WORLD origin loads

73
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.680
as soon as the world origin loads start detecting some surfaces.

74
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.410
Once you've detected a nice horizontal surface make sure that you orient your phone in the horizontal

75
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.630
so that when your car first starts your vertical acceleration is zero.

76
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.540
When your vertical acceleration is zero your steering angle is zero.

77
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.800
And when you're steering angle 0 your car's wheels will start off going straight.

78
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.440
And now as I move the car this seems to be a pretty good speed.

79
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.300
This is already looking pretty good.

80
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.980
Now there is another way to fix the speed of the car.

81
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.450
So put this back to one nutans which is what the mass was before.

82
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.410
We just never declared it since the default mass of the car weighs one news and lower the engine for

83
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.310
us to about 5 Newtons.

84
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.970
When we're touching the screen you can lower the engine for us to whatever you want until you find the

85
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.630
optimal engine for us that suits your up 5.

86
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.610
I found 5 Neumann's to be a fair speed so rerun the up.

87
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:36.930
Wait till the world origin load make sure you orient the phone horizontally so that when you first had

88
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.680
your car your car moves forward.

89
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.980
Since the wheels are not going to have a steering angle once you and your car start moving the car orienting

90
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.530
the phone how you want it and this is a pretty good speed.

91
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.250
It's not too slow and it's not too fast.

92
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.580
In the next video we're going to look at reversing the car and giving it breaks.
