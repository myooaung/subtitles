00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.340
In this video we're going to set every horizontal surface in the room to Lavo in your resources folder.

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.430
There is a picture of lava that you should add to your assets fold.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.400
This is just a screenshot of love you can use any image you want from Google Images as long as it's

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.290
a flat surface of law or you can use doing that I provided for you in the Resources folder.

5
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.020
So whatever your choice is just go to your assets folder and make an image set called love.

6
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.310
Drag your image into your assets folder into your view controller make a function call create lover

7
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.570
with a return value of a C.A.

8
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:59.710
right let lava is equal to C.A. with a geometry of an S and plane with width and height of 1 meters.

9
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:09.730
Let's actually change it to love a node and write love node geometry the first material thought diffuse.

10
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.440
Remember the fuse is the color texture spread across a surface and we're going to spread the surface

11
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.900
with your lover image from our assets folder.

12
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.580
Give the lava node a position of 1 metre behind that access by writing mother node position is equal

13
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:34.910
to a CN vector 3 x y is zero and position at 1 meter behind the Zad axis and return Diovan node

14
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.140
and in view to load right left love a node equal to the return value of create lover position the lava

15
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.750
node relative to the scene view by writing self does scene view.

16
00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.250
Thus seen da root node child node the lover node itself.

17
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.170
OK run the lover node shows up in front of us its position to one meter behind an axis of the world

18
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.000
origin.

19
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.620
But the problem is that we need the larva node to be horizontal not vertical.

20
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.900
So in your ex-coach project

21
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.740
remember this extension.

22
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.520
We've used it quite a bit and we're about to use it again to convert degrees to radians.

23
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.420
It's in your resources folder so make sure to copy it into every function.

24
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.990
Your challenge is to try and rotate this plane and make it horizontal.

25
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.920
Pause the video and give it a try.

26
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.540
Now that you've tried it out remember Euler angles were used them before in lecture 7 of the Getting

27
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
Started section to rotate the plane started horizontal.

28
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:10.180
We need to rotate it vertically across the X-axis 90 degrees so right a node the Euler angles is equal

29
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:20.070
to A C and vector 3 for the X field we're going to rotate it 90 degrees across the x axis.

30
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.860
We're not going to rotate it around the Y or the Zad Valley so leave those Zura up and run.

31
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.700
So the plane is invisible.

32
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.150
Well not really.

33
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.590
The problem is that only the bottom of the plane was covered with the lava texture whereas the top remains

34
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.000
colorless.

35
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.770
We need to make sure that both sides are covered with the lava texture.

36
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.190
So back to X code right love a node geometry.

37
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.040
The first material is double sided as equal to true.

38
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.210
This ensures that the lover image covers both sides of the surface.

39
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.890
Rerun the OP to make sure that everything works out and the texture shows up on both sides.

40
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.140
We're now down with the simple stuff.

41
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.610
Now we need a that every time the device detax a new horizontal surface we have to replace that surface

42
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.900
with love.

43
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.210
Indeed I'd remember that a plain anchor tells you the size of a horizontal surface that the device felt

44
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.020
we can use the airplane anchor size to make the lava plane the exact same size as the horizontal surface

45
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.900
an airplane anchor.

46
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.200
Also gives you the position of a detected surface.

47
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.880
We can also use the position to have the level plane such that its position exactly where the horizontal

48
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.190
surface was detected so that whenever any horizontal surface is detected make a love a node from the

49
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.140
return value of create love.

50
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.340
So remove these lines of code from our project.

51
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.100
Those are only for a demonstration purposes.

52
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:10.970
We need an argument plain anchor of type airplane anchor and right here just fill out the argument to

53
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.470
be that plane and crew that you guard lead it.

54
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.240
So we need to modify the size of the lava node according to the size of the plane and to do that further

55
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:32.350
what set it to play an anchor extent the extent represents the width and height of a detected horizontal

56
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.750
surface or plane for that matter to get the width just right done X asked for the height.

57
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.830
Note that we rotated the lava node such that it's horizontal so the height in this case is going to

58
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.560
represent how far the lava node extends horizontally.

59
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:58.300
So for the high rise plane Hincker extent does said the said value of this extent is simply how far

60
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.180
the horizontal surface extends and we seem to have an error and the error is that these need to be C.G.

61
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.280
flow value since those are the argument types.

62
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.110
So I'm going to do the same thing for the heights and we should be good to go for the sites.

63
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:21.280
Now we need the love node to have the same position that's encoded in the airplane and so align the

64
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.400
law of a node horizontally to the detected surface by centering it relative to the horizontal anchor

65
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:36.740
Dart Center a dot X or no plain anchor not anchor a line or a node vertically to the airplane anchor

66
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:47.200
by writing plain anchor dot center dot Y and do the same thing for those that value plain anchor data

67
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.740
center.

68
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.740
That's right.

69
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:58.240
One last thing to note is that every time a horizontal surface is detected a node is added to represent

70
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.720
the surface.

71
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.880
So make sure that the love node is positioned relative to this note by writing node that our child node

72
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.490
lava node.

73
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.880
So in summary here is what's going on.

74
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.950
Did I detect the horizontal surface and airplane Ankara's.

75
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.770
I did such that it encodes the size and position of that surface.

76
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.960
We're giving that size and position to the lover node and displaying it in the scene view by making

77
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.010
it a child of the horizontal surfaces node which kit made for us run the app.

78
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.610
I'm going to point my phone towards the bed until it recognizes it as a flat surface and it just did.

79
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.610
It created a love note.

80
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:48.770
So there is one plane anchor further but as I move my phone around the bed a Harkat determines that

81
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.930
the bed plate anchor is part of a larger real world surface.

82
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.650
So it's constantly updating the plane anchored to fit the size of the entire bed.

83
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.430
So the plane anchor size is constantly getting bigger.

84
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.100
But my love node is not.

85
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.370
So I need to update the lava according to how the plane increased size is being updated.

86
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:16.030
When the horizontal surface is an anchor is updated that update gets called ended our day.

87
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:21.870
We can access the same node that's representing the surface that was just updated.

88
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:31.330
And since the love node is a child of that node just right node that a Neumar child nodes with argument

89
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:41.920
child now would leave this one blank and now to update the lovers dimensions just right child node is

90
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.340
equal to create lava with your updated plan anchor.

91
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.620
But this doesn't work.

92
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.210
Child node is a constant.

93
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.320
So our only choice is to remove the current larva node.

94
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:04.960
So just read child node the remove from parent node and make a new lover note based on the updated anchored

95
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:16.190
by writing let love a node is equal to create lava with the updated plan anchor and make sure to display

96
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:22.720
it in the scene view position relative to the node that represents does surface.

97
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.710
OK.

98
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.990
Now rerun the app.

99
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.450
I'm going to point my film to that until it recognizes it as a horizontal surface.

100
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.020
Once you recognize that it is it makes a lava node and check it out.

101
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.760
If I keep going along the bed the lava node keeps getting bigger.

102
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.690
It's being updated along with the plant anchor.

103
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.810
This is really cool.

104
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.610
Now lastly there is one more thing we have to do.

105
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.540
So back into our ex-coach project did remove gets called whenever anchors get removed we only want to

106
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.180
deal with whenever plain anchors get removed.

107
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.390
So copy and paste this.

108
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.450
And if a plane anchor was removed we need to make sure that we remove the lava node associated with

109
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.250
this plant anchor.

110
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.030
So just copy and paste this line of code that we already have in that update that removes the child

111
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.460
node and we don't need the splint anchor so just leave it as blank.

112
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.210
Rerun the app to make sure that everything is working fine still.

113
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.750
I'm going to point my phone to the board until it detects it as a horizontal surface.

114
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.230
It does and everything works accordingly.

115
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.090
Now that we looked at horizontal plane surfaces we're going to start making our IATA.
