00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.030
In this video you're going to make planet earth with different textures and rotations.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.610
So making new EBSCO project by opening up X code Karaite a new project a single the application called

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.450
the project Planetes press next and creates.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.260
So like we've always done before the first thing to do is go to the main storyboard and add in a market

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.500
scene view to the View Controller such that we can blend three dimensional content into a camera view

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.090
of the real world.

7
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.360
Pin it to the edges of the super view.

8
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.360
The constraints by pinning to the bottom top leading and trailing space add the four constraints open

9
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.050
up the assistant editor and link the market scene get a view to the Wii controller with an idea.

10
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.240
Let's see you

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
import a r get close.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.070
The assistant editor.

13
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.370
And back to the Wii controller like we've always done before.

14
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.970
Declare a configuration constant equal to a world tracking session configuration memory that world tracking

15
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.330
is used to detect the device's orientation and position at all times.

16
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.150
This is important if you want to position nodes relative to the device and make sure the scene runs

17
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.390
a session with that configuration by writing self does scene view.

18
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.680
Does Sasson run configuration debug options by running self.

19
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.540
Does scene view debug options as equal to an array type of device options such that it shows the world

20
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.710
origin and shows the feature Kwan's.

21
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.100
Everytime we run the the last step is a step.

22
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.380
We've always done before and it's to go to the food up left and right the property privacy camera uses

23
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.500
description.

24
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.980
This displays an alert to user asking him permission to enable the camera.

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:08.510
Add a descriptive message that alerts saying you need the camera to display cool our contents so this

26
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.500
is nothing new.

27
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.200
We've done all of these before.

28
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.000
It's all boilerplate stuff.

29
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.590
If you were confused by any of these steps please make sure to revisit the first lecture in the Getting

30
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.030
Started section.

31
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.730
All right we're going to make planet Earth and message Tardio.

32
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.950
So in the Wii controller override you did appear and inside of it make in Melwood called Earth node

33
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.610
is equal to C.A. so we remember from before that a node is just a position in space with no shape dimension

34
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.290
or color.

35
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.450
And since planet Earth has a spherical shape give the node A geometry of a sphere as C and sphere with

36
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.520
a radius of zero point two meters 20 centimeters.

37
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.210
Now I said before that the fuse is the color of light spread across the entire surface of the known

38
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.560
material but it can also refer to the texture that spread across the node and Tarryall so right.

39
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.730
Earth geometry first material first material is the appearance of the surface dark diffuse diffuse is

40
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.360
the color texture spread across the surface.

41
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.710
The contents is equal to.

42
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.060
So we need to get a texture of planet earth such that it spreads across the surface of the sphere.

43
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.110
So I found a site which has cool textures called Solar System scope dot com slash textures.

44
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.000
The link is in your resources folder and for some reason the link doesn't work.

45
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.960
By the time you're watching this video I have attached all the images you need in the Resources folder.

46
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.470
So this is not texture is what we need to spread across our sphere.

47
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:55.330
So download the texture once a download show it in the Finder minimized the following drubbed school

48
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.600
project and as such.

49
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.910
Make a new image set called Earth Day

50
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.890
and drag the image to the Earth Day.

51
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.110
Ask that folder now back to the view controller set.

52
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.090
Did the fuse equal to the Earth Day toucher.

53
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.500
So what will happen is that this flat surface of the earth will wrap around the sphere and node such

54
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.690
that it covers the whole surface.

55
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.060
Now position the No.

56
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.850
1 meter away from the world origin behind these axes by running earth.

57
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.470
That position is equal to a three dimensional vector.

58
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.540
Leave the x and y as zero so horizontally and vertically centered to the origin and put a 1 meter away

59
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.690
behind these and X and the no to the seen you by running self doesn't view.

60
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.290
Does seem that route node got child node or then run the up.

61
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.850
So here is planet earth.

62
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:07.020
If you look around you'll notice that the map texture wrap it's up perfectly around the sphere and that

63
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.080
2 x code should add animations to the planet so that it rotates horizontally around the y axis.

64
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.420
So right left action is equal to C-n action.

65
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.810
Rotate by.

66
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.900
So it takes arguments x y ends as well as any duration.

67
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.380
You don't want to rotate it around the x axis.

68
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.480
Remember that rotating around the x axis gives any vertical rotation so leave that as zero where you

69
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.110
want to rotate it horizontally around the y axis 360 degrees.

70
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.160
But this argument takes in radians Sulak before.

71
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.460
Remember this extension.

72
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.900
We used that before to convert degrees to radians.

73
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.860
It's in your resources folder so make sure to copy and for the why of Alan you not.

74
00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:00.900
All you have to do is write 360 degrees to readings and convert it to ACG flow.

75
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.440
Since that is the argument type for this.

76
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.600
Leave these out as zeros since we don't want to rotate the earth clockwise.

77
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.480
If you're confused about rotations make sure to revisit the rotation lecture and the getting started

78
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.390
section.

79
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:23.150
And we're going to give an age of 8 seconds which refers to how fast the Earth will rotate 360 degrees

80
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.430
horizontally.

81
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.190
So in this case it will take 8 seconds to rotate fully around itself which I found to be a good default

82
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.040
duration.

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.580
Now this is your first time seeing as seeing options.

84
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.980
You've done Euler angles Euler angles were a way to specify how you wanted your note to be rotated.

85
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.650
This is basically the same thing as the options is simply an animation costs which is used to animate

86
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.790
the change in structure or display of a node.

87
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.580
In this case all it's doing is animating the nodes rotation across the y axis but the rotation principle

88
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.080
is the exact same as before except this time we have animation.

89
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:07.220
So lastly make sure you run the action by writing Earth run auction auction.

90
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:16.620
This applies the horizontal rotation to the earth run the and an enemy it's a rotation 360 degrees for

91
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.940
eight seconds.

92
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.720
It should stop soon.

93
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.810
And it stops now.

94
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.540
I want the rotation to last forever.

95
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:39.210
To do that right left forever is equal to CN option dot repeat for our and the auction we're going to

96
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.280
repeat forever is the fall.

97
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.830
So this line of code makes sure that this rotation animation never stops.

98
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:56.420
And instead of running the normal auction run the forever action run.

99
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.430
And if you keep this on for however long you want you should notice the planet never stops rotating.

100
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.190
Now I'm not going to run this up forever but you get the point.

101
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.460
All right.

102
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:16.870
Now for the specular texture go to the website and remember that specular is the color of light that's

103
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.940
reflected from the note this texture.

104
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:27.370
When wrapped around the sphere and would made sure that land doesn't reflect any light whereas any water

105
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:27.550
is.

106
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.110
Our oceans do reflect light.

107
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.120
So there are many types of textures.

108
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:40.750
The first one we used was made to use texture and it's made so that it can wrap around the entire surface

109
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.200
of a node with its contents.

110
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:51.490
So it spreads its contents across the entire node and covers a specular texture however is made specifically

111
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.110
such that it controls how light is reflected on a node.

112
00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:02.950
So download the texture show it in the Finder and we're going to drag this into our tax code project

113
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:09.700
by first making our image assets earth specular

114
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:20.580
minimize X code and drag this BNZ file right into your Earth specular ASJ.

115
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:31.060
Now you did appear earth geometry dust first material ta specular the contents is equal to earth.

116
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:39.940
Specular So the spectacular behavior of this node will act such that only water can reflect.

117
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.990
Let's remember from before that the only way for specular to work is that you need a light source.

118
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:55.020
So in vino low self that seems you got auto enables default lighting is the code.

119
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:02.530
True if you forgot this line of code illuminates it light in all directions of the scene you run the

120
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:10.950
app and notice the light doesn't reflect when it reaches land but only reflects when there is water.

121
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.670
This is very cool.

122
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.370
Back to the website there is another cool feature for us.

123
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:23.220
You can add clouds to the earth texture is an image and texture.

124
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.600
So as a review the first touch we used easy to use texture such that we want this texture to simply

125
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.500
wrap around the surface so that it can show and spread all of its contents.

126
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.530
The next one we used was a specular capture.

127
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.630
We had this texture wrap around the known such that it controls how light is reflected.

128
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.590
The result was that light only reflects if there is water.

129
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.490
And now this is an emission texture emission.

130
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.670
It simply adds color or content to a surface.

131
00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:01.410
We're going to add we're going to emit clouds to our surface so download the texture show it in the

132
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:08.630
Finder and we're going to make a new image assets into our ex-coach projects.

133
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:19.300
And the image set and call it Earth the mission go back to the finder and drag the clouds image into

134
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.240
our mission folder.

135
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.210
So back to the Wii controller.

136
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.640
Right.

137
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.480
Right.

138
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:34.470
Done geometry tough first material that you mention the contents is equal to earth.

139
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:43.270
The mission the mission defines the content emitted by each point of the surface.

140
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:49.430
So by wrapping the stuff through the earth know is going to emit clouds and each point of the surface

141
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.410
that has run out.

142
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.110
And this looks really nice.

143
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.840
We track the emission texture to our known and it emits clouds in every point of the texture that has

144
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.900
a cloud.

145
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.340
Now lastly we should look at the normal texture.

146
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:10.100
So back to the website the normal texture simply refers to the geometrical shape of each point in the

147
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.970
surface.

148
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.950
So in some parts of the world where there are mountains this texture makes sure that it has a specific

149
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:22.310
orientation and shape to that point in the map so that you can better observe the detail in the lens.

150
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:32.510
So download it show it in the Finder minimize the device and in your assets folder and the earth normal

151
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.580
image as

152
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:46.160
this project in and the normal map right into your assets folder and back to the Wii controller site

153
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.330
earth geometry.

154
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:57.280
The first material that normal dock contents is equal to Earth normal.

155
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:04.040
So this texture will wrap around the Earth node and adds three dimensional detail to our and know that

156
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.300
it can show mountains and other details in the map.

157
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:15.710
So we're on the and notice how in detail the physical features of the land are.

158
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:21.770
That's it for this video in the next one we're going to start adding the rest of the planet's.
