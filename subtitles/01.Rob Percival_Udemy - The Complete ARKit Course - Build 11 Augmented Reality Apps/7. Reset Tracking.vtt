00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.670
And you lost video you learn how to create a node.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.560
Give it a shape color and position relative to your starting position.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.650
The world origin in this video we're going to look at resetting a scene view session and next code change

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.110
this back to 0 0 and negative 0.3 run up.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.920
And you've seen this before.

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.060
It's aligned horizontally and vertically since you set the x and y fields as 0 but it's seven point

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.000
three meters away from these because the world origin behind it.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.700
You've probably noticed that if you keep pressing and over and over nothing happens well that makes

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.690
sense since you're always adding the box in the same position every time.

10
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
So you are indeed adding a box every time it just doesn't look like anything is happening since it's

11
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.760
always in the same position.

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.120
Now what if I wanted the box to be positioned somewhere else.

13
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.710
The box is positioned relative to the origin so that would mean that I would have to change the position

14
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.950
of the world origin.

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.430
But how do you change your starting position.

16
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.860
That's where you started it.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.860
Right.

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.490
While the answer is that you reset the scene view session such that it detects a new starting position.

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.550
So in your storyboard I had a button right button put it to the bottom right of your view controller

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.860
pinnate twenty pixels from the bottom space and 20 pixels from your trailing space.

21
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.850
Give it a what and height of 80 pixels.

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.980
Add the four constraints.

23
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.920
Go to your attributes and Specter and give the board a background color of orange or whatever color

24
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.200
you like it's up to you call this but unresearched

25
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.300
open up the assistant editor and link the reset button with an IAB action.

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.440
Here the controller called the IAB action reset connect and close the assistant editor back to your

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.490
Wii controller.

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.440
Every time we press reset first we have to pause the session saurus self the scene view that session

29
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530
that pause or you know what.

30
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.730
Instead of having this in the Reset IAB action we're going to make a separate function for it.

31
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.350
So right phunk restart session but no argument type and no return value.

32
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.160
And then just call a restart session and reset.

33
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.610
So now every time you press reset this function gets triggered.

34
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.050
And inside this function we're going to pause the scene view session.

35
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.230
So self does seem scene view that session.

36
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.300
Pause.

37
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.430
So when you pause the session it stops keeping track of your position or orientation.

38
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:57.410
Now remove the box from the scene view by writing self that scene view that scene dot root node dot

39
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.830
a numeric child nodes put the first argument as node and the second argument.

40
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.970
Just leave it blank.

41
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.120
We're not going to use it for now.

42
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.150
OK.

43
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.440
Now I explained before that node is a child of the root node.

44
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.350
You can even see it right here root root node child node node.

45
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.880
So we're enumerating through every single child node of the root node the box node being one of them.

46
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.640
And so the box node is what we're going to remove from the parent node.

47
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.220
So right node remove from parent node by removing the box from the root node or its parent node we're

48
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.860
removing it from the scene view.

49
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.100
Now that we've got rid of the box rerun the session such that it has the same configuration.

50
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.560
So self does scene view that session run configuration.

51
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.420
As for the options however we're going to have the scene such that it resets tracking so it would forget

52
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.120
about your old starting position and make a new one based on where you are at the moment.

53
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.050
And we're going to remove existing anchors.

54
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.530
And the reason this isn't working is because it should be inside of an ear right.

55
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.300
So autocomplete should work now to remove existing anchors which makes sense because this is a collection

56
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.720
of things an array is a collection type.

57
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.120
But anyway remove existing anchors and anchor is simply information of the position and orientation

58
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.760
of an object in the scene view.

59
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.000
We're removing all of that information as well and starting from scratch.

60
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:44.790
So run the app press add it gives you a box walk away from the origin reset give the device time to

61
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.130
reestablish its surroundings add a box again and it shows up in a new position.

62
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.730
Since our starting position changed so the box is positioning itself relative to a new starting origin

63
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.090
and the next video we're going to customize our box and place it in random locations instead of just

64
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.390
one.
