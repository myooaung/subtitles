1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
In the last video you were able to place a box onto a horizontal concrete floor.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
Now it's time to turn this box into an actual car.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,580
So right click on the vehicle folder.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,800
Click on new file.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,590
Scroll down till you find your Schene kit seen file press next and create your scene.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,860
OK so you'll notice that inside of the seen File we're given a camera or a node.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,670
We don't need this camera or a node so make sure to delete it.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,760
Now add a box to your scene view by a writing box.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,440
Drag it to your scene and to change the color of the scene.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,470
I'm not a big fan of the great color.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:45,030
Go to the scene inspector and put a background of white.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,920
Now that the scene is white it's a little hard to see our box.

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:56,510
So click on your box and give it a diffuse color of blue.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,520
Now I want to see how the box looks like from the front.

15
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,280
So click on the front perspective and the box just disappears.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Double click on the box and it still doesn't show up.

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,630
This is the next code bug.

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:16,610
The way I fixed it was simply click on the play button and then click on it again then double click

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,190
your node and your box shows up.

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,410
So if I go from perspective and back to front everything works fine.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,940
But note that the box is a little too big.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,410
It currently has a with height and length of 1 meter.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,370
That's about the size of a table.

24
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,370
So give it a width length and height of zero point two meters.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,640
And right under it we're going to place another box.

26
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:59,230
Go to the size inspector and give this box a width of 0.4 a height of 0.1 and the length of 0.4 as well.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:06,420
Give this box a background color or are a diffuse color of red.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,860
Now imagine that this is a truck.

29
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,770
This would be the frame of the truck and not the head.

30
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,240
So rename this blue box to head.

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:25,740
And this one to frame we want to position the head relative to our friend to do that make the had a

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,830
child of the frame by just dragging it right under our frame like so.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,220
So now the frame is the parent node of the head.

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,900
If you're a member from before the child node is always positioned relative to its parent node.

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:49,290
So go to the node Inspektor of our head and you can see that the head is positioned 0.7 to two metres

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
above our friend.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,850
So one thing I want to make sure is that the head is positioned almost right on top of the frame.

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:07,350
So about 0.1 8 metres above this is looking better and I want the head to be perfectly horizontally

39
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,200
aligned with the Phryne.

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,590
It already kind of is aligned with the frame since it's close to zero.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,220
But make sure it's perfectly aligned.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
There you go.

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,730
And as for the Zed value it refers to how far the head is from the frame center.

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,550
If I put this at 0

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,800
the head is positioned exactly at the frame center.

46
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:42,600
I want the had to be at the frame's edge so position is 0.1 metres from the frame center.

47
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,370
This is looking pretty good.

48
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,000
Now we need wheels for our truck.

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,840
The wheels are simply cylinders.

50
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:04,310
So I had a cylinder right cylinder and drag it to your scene give the cylinder a radius of zero point

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,810
zero four meters and a height of 0.1 meters.

52
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,770
The size looks a lot better to me.

53
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,100
Now we want to rotate the cylinder 90 degrees clockwise so that it looks like an actual wheel.

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:27,770
So in the no inspector in your Euler angles rotate the cylinder 90 degrees clockwise and that looks

55
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,920
a lot better to me.

56
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,570
Now give the cylinder a color of black since that is the standard color for a wheel.

57
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,820
So now we need to position our will relative to the frame.

58
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,020
So make do wheel a child of the frame as well.

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,910
OK.

60
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,340
Now position this wheel such that is 0.1 metres to the frame center.

61
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,060
So 0.1.

62
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,280
Let me just fix the perspective of this.

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,040
It's not very clear what's going on right now.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,270
So now the wheel is 0.1 metres to the right of the frame center.

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
Now I need the wheel to be 0.1 metres right under our frame.

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,600
So for the why field just put negative 0.1 it's a little hard to click on.

67
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,140
So just negative 0.1.

68
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:28,430
Now our wheel is almost right under our frame and the last thing I want to do is that I want this wheel

69
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,940
to be closer to the frame's edge.

70
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:41,480
So a negative zero point one two meters behind the frame center so further that field just right.

71
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:47,830
Negative 0.1 to fix the perspective back to its original one.

72
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,670
This is looking pretty good.

73
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,940
Copy and paste three more cylinders make them all.

74
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,380
Children of the frame OK.

75
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,960
So right now the rest of the wheels or the cylinders for that motor are positioned exactly where the

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,470
first one is.

77
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,770
So it looks like there is only one but they're all there.

78
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,660
We need to reposition the other wheels for the second wheel.

79
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,220
We need that wheel to be 0.1 metres to the left of the frame center.

80
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,220
Right now it's 0.1 metres to the right.

81
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:32,340
So just putting negative 0.1 to change the direction there is our second wheel position perfectly.

82
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:41,270
As for our third wheel the third cylinder we need that wheel to be zero point 1 2 meters in front of

83
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,540
the frame center away from it.

84
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,130
Right now with 0.1 0.22 meters behind the frame center to make it in front just remove this the negative

85
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,870
value.

86
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,070
And there is our third wheel.

87
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,750
And for the fourth cylinder we need that one to be 0.1 two meters in front of the frame center away

88
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,610
from it and 0.2 meters to the left of the Freema center.

89
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,670
So click on your fourth cylinder.

90
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,670
Change this to negative zero point once such that it's to the left and put it Zero Point 1 2 meters

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,890
in front of the frame center.

92
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,910
And there is our fourth wheel.

93
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,630
Now we have what looks like a car in the view controller.

94
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,520
Instead of adding a box on top of the concrete we're going to add our car.

95
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:47,490
So first rename this two car scene car dash seen as CN and so it doesn't fall in back into our Iby action.

96
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:58,090
Load the scene by writing a lot scene is equal to c and c and the scene is named just copy and paste

97
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,750
the following right into your screen name as a string.

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,160
And from the scene we have to get our car Noad this car note right here.

99
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,000
No the car is an immediate child of the scenes root note.

100
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:29,130
So back into your view controller just right leg car node is equal to seen a root node dot child node

101
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,810
with name the child nodes name itself is frame.

102
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:43,960
So copy and paste the right into your child node name know as we've always done before leave recursively

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,000
as false since the car is an immediate child of the scene the root node.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,370
So I'd just leave this as false parentheses to your car node and forcefully unwrap it since we know

105
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,560
that everything here is correct.

106
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:10,120
And make sure the body no references are cardno would not the box input car door physics body is equal

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,990
to body.

108
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,280
So we're applying physics to our carno not the box know it anymore.

109
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,070
And finally the car note to the scene view and make sure that the car node is positioned exactly where

110
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,830
the camera is not the box.

111
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,850
You know what let's just delete this box node entirely since we don't need it anymore.

112
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,130
So when the app

113
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,120
wait for the world origin to load start detecting some planes

114
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,390
once you detected a big enough surface.

115
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,110
Like I just did.

116
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,940
Now I had your car and there it is now.

117
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,880
I want to be able to see the wheels from the top.

118
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,130
To do that we have to make the top of the car transparent.

119
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:12,800
So back to your ex could project into your scene file go on to frame and into your node.

120
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:21,600
Scroll down till you find the passage city and change the opacity to about 0.75.

121
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,690
The smaller the opacity value the less opaque something is the more transparent.

122
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:35,130
So we made the frame more transparent and since the frame is the parent node of the head and the wheels

123
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,970
they become transparent as well.

124
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,410
So run the app.

125
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,600
It's important that you wait till the world origin loads.

126
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,890
Once it does start detecting some surfaces once you're done detecting surfaces on your car and this

127
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,050
looks pretty good.

128
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,890
In fact to code.

129
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,220
One more thing to note is that we're not actually loading the entire car.

130
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,700
We're loading the frame and it's true that by adding the frame to the scene view the whole car shows

131
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,490
up but that's not exactly the case.

132
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,180
All you're doing is adding the frame.

133
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,550
However if you go to your scene file the wheels and we had our children of the frame.

134
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:34,910
So by displaying the parent the children the wheels in the head are displayed as well.

135
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,790
It's kind of like Real-Life wherever the parent goes.

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,490
The children follow.

137
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:47,180
So just rename the frame for the sake of clarity instead of car Noad and change it accordingly.

138
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,320
Everywhere else here as well.

139
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,850
In the next video we're going to set up the accelerometer of the car.
