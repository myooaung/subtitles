1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,000
The last video we customized a box and placed it in random positions of the scene view and this video

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
we're going to look at more default and custom shapes.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,040
Aside from the box first we're going to start with the capsule.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:24,710
So a capsule and C-n capsule looks like a cylinder but it has two spherical ends we can modify the height

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,970
of the capsule as well as its radius its thickness.

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,240
So I can X code instead of declaring the box.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,430
Let me just comment.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,790
All of this so.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:44,990
And right node geometry is equal to a seat and capsule and the capsule's dimensions are going to be

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,190
the following.

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,800
First we're going to change the cap radius.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,620
Let me just fix the autocomplete.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,890
So as I said before the cap radius is simply how thick the capsule is.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:04,280
So I'm going to make it about 0.1 meters thick and its height will be about 0.3 meters.

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:13,480
So let me just keep the specular and diffuse colors and run the UP WAIT TILL THE WORLD origin loads

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,000
as soon as it detects the environment.

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:24,710
Once it does the capsule and you know what one thing I want to change before anything is place the capsule

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,590
right in front of me were done with this random positioning stuff.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,390
Align it horizontally and vertically in place at zero point three meters behind these axis and that

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,320
is easier to work with just rerun the and so if I just wait till the world origin loads once touched

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,670
all the surfaces there it is press add and there is our capsule right in front of us.

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,270
It looks pretty cool it looks like a basic cylinder with a rounded caps which is essentially what it

23
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,270
is.

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:54,530
OK.

25
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:03,870
Now on to our next default shape the next one is going to be the cone and as cone has a bottom radius

26
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,730
that we can modify a top radius as well as height.

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,120
So back into our ex-coach project instead of giving a geometry of a cop so let's give it a geometry

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,100
of a cone.

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,880
So no geometry is equal to c and cone.

30
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:30,090
And like I said before we can modify the top radius here the top radius is pointy because it has a value

31
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,280
of zero meters.

32
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,720
I am going to make my top pretty is a value of zero point 1 meters the bottom radius will be about 0.3

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,950
meters with a height of let's say 0.3 meters.

34
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,130
Run up to see what the cone looks like when it's in the scene.

35
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,230
View.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,830
So if I just wait till the world origin loads once the film attacks its environment and the cone and

37
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,260
there it is.

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,700
Notice how the top is not pointy since we give it a radius of 0.1 metres.

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,030
And the bottom radius is 0.3 metres much bigger than the top.

40
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,620
Now here's a challenge.

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Try and make the cone look like a cylinder paused the video and give it a try.

42
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,790
So to make the cone look like a cylinder All you have to do is make the top equal to the bottom.

43
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,490
So 0.3 for the top radius or you know what let's just make both of them 0.1 metres.

44
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:42,120
Does it really matter as long as these are the same run up.

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,280
Just wait till the world origin loads for the film to detect its environment.

46
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,160
Press.

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,140
And there is our cone or cylinder for that matter.

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,060
OK.

49
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,500
So the next shape we're going to look at is the cylinder itself.

50
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,460
Ironically we just made a cylinder out of a cone.

51
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,600
But this time we're going to mess around with the actual cylinder shape.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,780
And there is not much to a cylinder you can control its radius basically how thick it is as well as

53
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,650
its height.

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,950
So instead of declaring a cone declare a cylinder.

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,660
So right.

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:25,900
No geometry is equal to c and cylinder with a radius of a bow zero point two meters 20 centimeters and

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,890
a height of point 2 meters.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,590
And you probably already know what this is going to look like so let's just run the app as soon as my

59
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,810
world order loads.

60
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,620
I'm just going to do the cylinder mean back off a little bit.

61
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,110
There is our cylinder.

62
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,750
It has a radius of zero point two meters so a diameter of 40 centimeters which is why it's so wide.

63
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,200
Let me just get a better angle of it and it has a height of 20 centimeters as well.

64
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,020
OK.

65
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,260
Now the next shape we're going to look at.

66
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:09,480
Let me just go to the Apple documentation is an A C and sphere and a C and sphere is a pretty basic

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,900
shape.

68
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,850
You've probably seen that before.

69
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,380
All we can modify for the sphere is the radius itself.

70
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:28,570
So why don't you pause the video and try to make your own sphere node.

71
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,310
OK so here's how I would do it.

72
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:36,920
Node geometry is equal to c and sphere with a radius.

73
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,350
I'm going to give it a radius of 0.1 metres so a diameter of 20 centimeters run the app

74
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,550
is going to say to my world orange and loads so that the phone properly detects its environment.

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,020
Once it does press and there is our sphere there is not much to it.

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,040
It simply has a circular radius.

77
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,030
Now onto our next object.

78
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,310
And the reason that we're looking at all of these shapes is because in future apps we're actually going

79
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,190
to use all of these shapes to make 3-D models.

80
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,330
So the next shape we're going to look for now is we're s.c and tube.

81
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,000
That tube is almost the exact same thing as a cylinder.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,830
However a cylinder only has one radius where as the tube has two of them one to control the inner radius.

83
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:39,250
So how wide the hole is and one outer radius how thick the entire tube is in general back to X code.

84
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:47,470
Let me declare this a C and to know what geometry is equal to a C and tube and the inner radius how

85
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:56,970
wide the hole is is going to be zero point two meters make the outer radius about 0.3 metres.

86
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:04,090
So the tube is going to have a hole with a radius of 0.2 metres so the whole in general is going to

87
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,390
have a diameter of point four meters.

88
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,260
And from the center all the way to the edge of the tube we're going to have an outer radius of zero

89
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,700
point three meters the height will be about zero point five meters.

90
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,050
And let's run the app to see how this looks.

91
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,880
So if I just wait till my world origin loads and then press add let me just step away from this a little

92
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,250
bit.

93
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,630
And there is our tube.

94
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,960
The hole has a radius of 0.2 meters.

95
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,900
And the tube in general has an entire radius of 0.3.

96
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,630
So the tube has a diameter of 0.6 meters.

97
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,380
And the hole has the diameter of point four meters.

98
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,020
Now the next shape we're going to look at is a Taurus.

99
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,380
So back to our Apple documentation

100
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,560
the tourists kind of looks like a ring.

101
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:15,410
It has a ring radius which extends from the middle to the edge of the ring and a pipe radius which controls

102
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,030
the thickness of the ring.

103
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,720
We're going to use this Taurus shape in the future to make our basketball hoop.

104
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,400
So for now let's just declare a Taurus inside of our X called Project No.

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,570
Geometry is equal to c and Taurus.

106
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,430
And the ring ready.

107
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:41,430
So how wide the Taurus is from the center all the way to the edge is going to be about zero point three

108
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:49,740
meters and the pipe radius which controls the thickness of the ring is going to be about Dero point

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,030
two meters or you know what 0.1 metres your pipe radius should always be smaller than your ring radius

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,330
because your ring radius minus your pipe radius is basically how big the whole of your tourist.

111
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:10,320
So if you had a ring radius of let's say zero point two meters and a pipe radius of point three your

112
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,560
whole would be negative point 1 meters wide.

113
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,160
Which makes no sense you would kind of have an inverted hole of some sort.

114
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,130
Your Taurus would just look really weird whenever you're building a 3-D model that requires a Taurus.

115
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,690
Just make sure that your ring radius is always larger than your pipe radius and before running the app

116
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:36,780
let me just start placing the nodes about negative zero point seven meters behind the world origin.

117
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,380
Now let me just run it OK.

118
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,240
So I'm going to wait till the world origin loads and then press add.

119
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,850
So here is our Taurus.

120
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:55,130
It has a ring radius of point 3 which extends from the center all the way to the edge and a pipe radius.

121
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,230
So the thickness of the ring has a radius of 0.1 meters.

122
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,720
Now the next shape we're going to look at is a plane to find the plane in the Apple documentation just

123
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:14,830
right a C and plane and right here you'll see that the plane is simply a vertical surface with a width

124
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,820
and height and it has no extrusion depth whatsoever.

125
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,070
It's simply a flat surface with no depth.

126
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,630
So let's declare a plane and the plane is something we're going to use a lot in the course especially

127
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:35,020
for our vehicle up when we have to build a road so the width of the plane is going to be about point

128
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,600
two meters.

129
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,760
And do the same thing for the height run up.

130
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,860
Just wait till the world orange and loans and then my plane.

131
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,820
Here it is from here it looks like a box.

132
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,370
But if I go from the side you'll notice that the plane has no depth.

133
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,180
It's just a flat surface.

134
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,670
Well the width and height of zero point two meters.

135
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,660
OK.

136
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,470
Now onto our pyramid.

137
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,560
Find the pyramid.

138
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm just going to write a C and pyramid to find it in our apple documentation.

139
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,260
And the pyramid is exactly what you would expect it to be.

140
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,890
It has a length to control its depth a width and the height.

141
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,890
So let's declare a pyramid right into our project.

142
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,860
No geometry is equal to see a pyramid.

143
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,700
The pyramid is going to have a width of point 1 metres a height of point 1 metres and the length a depth

144
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,910
of point 1 metres.

145
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,650
Let's run up to see how this looks OK.

146
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,310
Now if I just press add here is our pyramid.

147
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,910
From here it looks like a triangle.

148
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,650
But this pyramid actually has a depth.

149
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,840
So if I just go from the side it has a depth of 0.1 meters which we specified right here.

150
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,680
OK.

151
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,410
Now we're going to go into some cool stuff which is the bezier path the bezier path is used to create

152
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,680
custom shapes from a path that you draw.

153
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
So what do I mean by this.

154
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,770
First off right path is equal to you bezier path.

155
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:21,080
We're going to start our path 0 meters from where you positioned so to C.G. point X is 0.

156
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,070
Then why is zero think of the game.

157
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,130
Connect the dots.

158
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,120
If you connect every dot with a line eventually are going to form and drawn.

159
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,790
This is the same concept.

160
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,960
We're going to draw lines from one point to another until we form a custom shape to remove this node

161
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,020
geometry since we're not going to put it period any more.

162
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,750
So we're aligning our path exactly where our node is currently positioned and then we're going to add

163
00:12:49,780 --> 00:13:01,490
a line from this position or path dot line to see G point X being 0 and now will be zero point two.

164
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,950
So we're starting our path wherever it's positioned so right here and then we're adding a line that

165
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,310
goes 0.2 meters upwards.

166
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:20,920
So let's assign this to our geometry and to do the right leg shape is equal to se and shape the path

167
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,310
is simply going to be the path that you ger and the extrusion depth basically gives your drawing a certain

168
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,590
thickness.

169
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,050
We're going to give it a thickness of zero point two meters and now assign this shape to the geometry

170
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,370
of I already know geometry is equal to shape.

171
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,970
And if you're not sure what happened it will be more clear to you once I run the app and explain it

172
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,000
just going to wait till the world orange and low as soon as it loads your bezier path.

173
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,360
And this is the line that we drew the line start to zero meters from the current position that you gave

174
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,840
it.

175
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,290
And it goes 0.2 meters upwards.

176
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:08,970
So we drew a line from 0 meters of the position that you gave it such that it goes point two meters

177
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:15,220
upwards and the line has a thickness an extrusion depth of point two meters.

178
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,800
And from the top we're going to go diagonally up.

179
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,250
I want you to pause the video and try and do that one yourself.

180
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,270
So we need to add another line that goes diagonally upwards from this position.

181
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:43,910
So what she would do is the right path that add line to C.G. point since we want to go diagonally.

182
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,730
That means that we have to change its horizontal positioning.

183
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,350
So right next 0.2 and Y is 0.3.

184
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,710
So here is what would happen.

185
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,730
Our path first was horizontally aligned to the current position.

186
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,760
So now our path is going to end up being 0.2 meters to the right of this position and zero point three

187
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,920
meters above it which is basically going to be zero point two meters to the right of the previous point.

188
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,530
And the path and 0.1 meters above the previous point and the path which is essentially going to form

189
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,880
a diagonal line that goes there a point two meters to the right in 0.1 metres above run the up

190
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:40,860
your path and this makes perfect sense the shape is perfectly aligned with where we positioned our node

191
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,290
and then you're drawing a line that goes 0.2 metres upwards from the current position.

192
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:55,270
So now we're going 0.2 metres to the right and 0.1 metres above the current vertical position which

193
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,350
is 0.3.

194
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,410
Therefore drawing a diagonal path from that current point.

195
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,890
Now from this point we want to draw a diagonal path that goes downwards.

196
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,280
So how would you do this.

197
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:15,300
Pause the video and give this one to try.

198
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:24,130
So we need to go diagonally downwards our x value has to change such that it goes to the right and our

199
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,190
Y value has to change as well such that it goes back down from this point.

200
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,610
We're going to add another line.

201
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,050
So right path dot line to C.G. point

202
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:45,590
and now from the position that's 0.2 meters to the right of the origin we're going to go another is

203
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,620
there a point 2 meters so 0.4.

204
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,250
But this time we're going to travel back downwards.

205
00:16:52,310 --> 00:17:00,230
We're going to travel back to 0.2 metres above the origin so we're starting off that the path is exactly

206
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:07,490
where the node is positioned perfectly aligned horizontally and vertically but then we're moving 0.2

207
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,780
metres upwards.

208
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,820
Such that the path is now 0.2 metres from the Y axis of the origin and then we're moving 0.2 metres

209
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,470
to the right as well as 0.1 metres upwards from the previous point.

210
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:30,830
So we're moving at an upwards diagonal and then from there we're moving another 0.2 metres to the right.

211
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,720
So point metres from the origin and we're moving back downwards by 0.1 metres.

212
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,970
So this is going to lead to us drawing a diagonal path downwards 0.2 metres to the right and zero point

213
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,330
1 metres downwards.

214
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,170
Let's run the app to see how this looks OK.

215
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,990
So I'm going to wait till my world orange and loads

216
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,620
and as soon as it does my path and this makes sense as well.

217
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:11,250
So we're starting at the current position 0 0 and then we're moving 0.2 metres above the position and

218
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,710
then we're moving 0.2 metres to the right as well as 0.1 metres above the current vertical position.

219
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:25,070
So now we're 0.2 meters to the right of the origin and zero point three meters above.

220
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,580
Then we're moving another 0.2 meters to the right such that we're 0.4 in the for the right of the origin.

221
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,730
But we're moving 0.1 metres back down.

222
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:43,000
So now our position is 0.4 meters to the right of this position and 0.2 metres above it.

223
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:50,710
Now we want to go back down such that where is zero meters vertically from this position but we're still

224
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,930
0.4 meters to the right.

225
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,110
So why don't you try and do that yourself and see what kind of results you come up with.

226
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,190
So paused the video and try to.

227
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,710
Here is what you should have come up with past that line to see point

228
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,060
our x value will remain the same since we're not going to be moving in the horizontal direction.

229
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,920
But we want to go back down to the previous position.

230
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,210
So put zero right here for the final position.

231
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:34,540
We're moving 0.2 meters down and the horizontal positioning stays the same.

232
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,700
So run the app to see what this looks like.

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,050
Let me just wait till the world orange and load's do your best your path and look at what this forms

234
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,660
a house.

235
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,430
So let's go over this.

236
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,150
We're starting off at the current position perfectly aligned horizontally and vertically then we're

237
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,590
going 0.2 metres up.

238
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,540
Then we're moving a diagonal distance 0.2 metres to the right and 0.1 metres above.

239
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,350
So right now where is there a point two metres to the right of this position and zero point three metres

240
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,410
above it.

241
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,760
And from this point we're going back down 0.1 metres.

242
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:22,820
So now we're 0.2 metres above this position but we're 0.4 metres to the right of it.

243
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:31,390
So 0.2 metres to the right of this one which makes for a downwards diagonal line and then from this

244
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,900
distance the horizontal positioning stays the same but we're drawing a line that goes downwards.

245
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:47,700
And with our extrusion depth of 0.2 metres which is giving this bezier path a depth it forms a perfect

246
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:55,920
house so we just made our first custom shape by drawing lines from one point to another.

247
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:04,530
And there are a lot of softwares where you can make custom shapes softwares such as this one.

248
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:11,470
If you were to use it you would manually make your own custom shape and once you make it it would convert

249
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,820
that custom shape for you.

250
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,880
In code you white bezier a path code that you would just copy into your ex-school project to load the

251
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
custom shape that you made.

252
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,330
There are many apps just like this one for example.

253
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,400
There as deep as your code vector drawing to objective c code.

254
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,980
There are some apps for swift code but it's really hard to convert objective c to Swift.

255
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,820
There are many tools to do that.

256
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,730
So this is another example of it converting images to you bezier path code right here.

257
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,630
And that is it for this video point and this video was to show you all of the default shapes that we're

258
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:53,020
going to use later on in the course to build many complex 3D models look like our portal and our basketball

259
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,580
court.

260
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,440
And the next video we're going to look at relative positioning.
