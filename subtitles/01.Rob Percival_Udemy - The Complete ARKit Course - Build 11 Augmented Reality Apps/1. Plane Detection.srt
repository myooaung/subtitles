1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,280
In the section we're going to be looking at plans in this.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,800
Whenever the phone detects a horizontal surface such as the floor or a table it turns that surface into

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,510
love.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,440
This is a great app to understand how a plane detection works.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,930
To begin.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,960
Open up X code create a new project.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:31,170
A single allocation call the project floor is lover press next.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,710
And create the first thing we have always done is go to the main storyboard and do the initial controller

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,520
add an arcade scene view to display three dimensional content in a camera view of the real world expand

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:55,550
the edges of that scene view and pin it to the top bottom leading and trailing space opened up.

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:04,180
The assistant editor and to the controller link can see a view with an IAB called Scene view import

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,890
our kit to use the framework close the assistant editor and do the controller add a configuration constant

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:22,250
equal to our world tracking session configuration world tracking is used to detect the position and

14
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,970
orientation of the device at all times.

15
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:33,040
So make sure you run a session with that configuration by writing self that scene view the session that

16
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:45,270
run configuration and debug options by writing self-deceit view debug options is equal to A R S C and

17
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,330
debug options does show world origin and a r s n debug options does show feature points.

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,130
OK we've done all of this before and in other stuff that we've done over and over is going to the infidel

19
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,390
purist right the property privacy kime or ETA's description.

20
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,860
This property displays an alert to the user prompting him to enable the camera to the alert.

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,600
Make sure to have a descriptive message telling the user that he needs the camera to display cool a

22
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,550
Arcata.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,250
I hope you've mastered these steps by now since we've been doing them in every single section.

24
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,360
All right so if you remember from the demonstration that I showed you the film detects horizontal surfaces

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,000
and when it detects that it replaces the horizontal surface with lover.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,370
But how do we detect horizontal surfaces.

27
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:52,310
Well it's simple unheated load just right configuration or self-taught configuration to keep things

28
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,210
consistent.

29
00:02:53,210 --> 00:03:02,650
The plane detection is equal to horizontal now our session which has this configuration is now configured

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,800
to detect horizontal surfaces.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,050
Now we need some kind of delegate function to tell us whenever the device detects a horizontal surface

32
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,520
to do that inherit from a r s and the delegate.

33
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,780
Remember in the drawing section we use this delegate to find that whenever a new scene was rendered.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,290
This time we'll use this delegate to find that when a new horizontal surface is detected.

35
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:38,490
So write the renderer did add function did this delegate function checks if an anchor was added to the

36
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,550
scene.

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Now an anchor is simply information.

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,220
This information encodes an orientation position and size of something in the real world.

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,930
More specifically if this anchor that was added is a plain anchor then it would give us the orientation

40
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,310
position and size of a horizontal flat surface in the world that it just detected.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,250
So the device checks for horizontal surfaces if it finds one it adds a plane anchored to that horizontal

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:19,200
surface such that it gives us the position orientation and size of the surface to check if the anchor

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:30,360
that was added is a plain anchor just right guard let slainte anchor is equal to anchor as they are

44
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,160
playing anchor else return.

45
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,330
If this guard Tim and succeeds the anchor that was added is indeed a plant anchor meaning the filmon

46
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:49,790
detected a new horizontal surface and added a plain anchor to represent the surface.

47
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,930
Then Prince

48
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:04,520
knew flat surface detected new a plane anchor it.

49
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,590
And before we were on the up make sure to set the scene use delegate itself so that this delegate function

50
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,450
can get cold.

51
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,830
Now we can run the app

52
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,070
the chair has a horizontal surface.

53
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,580
If I point my film to it it prints new flat surface detected new airplane anger at it.

54
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,090
The floor also has a horizontal surface.

55
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,870
If I point my phone to that it's going to detect the surface and print the same thing.

56
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,010
The table also has a horizontal surface so a point point my phone to the table.

57
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,930
The same thing occurs all right now the floor is one surface.

58
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,700
So we have one airplane anchored to represent its position in the world as well as its size.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,420
But the device only detected a small portion of the floor.

60
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,670
So as I keep moving with the phone the film starts discovering that the floor is much bigger.

61
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,810
Therefore updating the floors A-R anchor wolt to observe how a building the A-R anchor go back to your

62
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,230
ex code.

63
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,250
Call the function did a day

64
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,780
and heres what would happen.

65
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,240
Did it get triggered when we update the anchor of something in the real world.

66
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,310
We want to know only when a plain anchor is updated.

67
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:46,150
So copy this guard statement and remember that a plain anchor encodes the orientation position and size

68
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,240
of a horizontal surface.

69
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,340
For example as the phone keeps discovering that the floor is bigger.

70
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,750
It's going to keep beating the floor is our plane.

71
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:05,060
Anchor to testis Prince of dating floors anchor

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,130
run me up OK.

73
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,110
So first its going to recognize the floor as one horizontal surface and notice the print statement in

74
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,160
the debugger that keeps getting activated its constantly updating the floors anchor because as I keep

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,550
moving around and explore more parts of the floor it updates the floors Ankara's it realizes that the

76
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,140
floor is much bigger than it initially thought.

77
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,610
Back to X code.

78
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,830
Notice the print statement.

79
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,390
So first it recognizes the floor and then as I keep moving the phone around it keeps updating the floor

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,480
is a play an anchor as it realizes that the floor is much bigger than what it initially thought.

81
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,000
And there is one more thing.

82
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:07,710
The new flush surface detected new airplane anchor added was triggered more than once for the same floor.

83
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,110
Now the device isn't perfect.

84
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:18,180
Sometimes it makes mistakes and it adds more than one anchor for the same horizontal surface.

85
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,770
Now every horizontal surface remember this as a rule of thumb should only have a single airplane anchor.

86
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,920
Now the device eventually catches its mistake and it removes the second airplane anchor that doesnt

87
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,040
need to be there when it removes it.

88
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,160
It calls the function did remove

89
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,750
so did remove gets called when the device makes an error and makes more than one airplane anchor for

90
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,150
the same horizontal surface.

91
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,400
Every horizontal surface should only have one airplane anchor.

92
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,560
So we removes the second one and this function gets called in summary every time we detect a flowers

93
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,530
on the surface.

94
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,410
It adds a new airplane anchor and caused it.

95
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,650
And whenever the device discovers more of the same horizontal surface it updates the surfaces plane

96
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,510
anchor and whenever there is an error and the device adds more than one plane anchor for the same horizontal

97
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,890
surface it removes it and calls it removes.

98
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,480
And the next video we're going to use all of this information and these delegate functions to put lava

99
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
in every horizontal surface that we detect.
