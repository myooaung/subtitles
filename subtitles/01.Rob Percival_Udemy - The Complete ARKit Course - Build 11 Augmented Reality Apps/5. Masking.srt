1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,880
In the last video you were able to cover the portal room with images creating the illusion that the

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,050
user is going inside of the new world.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,700
In this video we need to make the walls invisible from the outside.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,810
We need to make them translucent.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,790
We need to mask them enough with the synonyms.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,300
Entire file We're going to start off by masking all of these walls.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,230
So start with side door B SO side door B give it a child know of a box.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:43,020
So drag this box right under side Dorby and give this box the exact dimensions as its parent.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,410
So side door B has it with a point seven five a height of two and a length of 0.03.

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,580
So do the same thing for the box.

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,810
A What of 0.75 a height of.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,980
I think it was to any length a depth of zero point zero three and give this a diffuse color of black

13
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:18,590
position the box exactly where its parent node is by making this zero this zero and there's zero as

14
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,600
well.

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,020
And finally remove this 90 degree rotation to make it vertical.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,090
OK.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,740
Now we have the box covering our side door.

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:41,460
Now you want to place this mask just a little bit in front of our side door about zero point zero three

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,450
meters in front

20
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,620
and there you go.

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,640
Now the mask is officially in front of either side door.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,640
Do the same thing for side door and drag a box right under it and give the box the exact same dimensions

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,280
as a side door which is again point seven five meters wide two meters high and zero point zero three

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,670
meters deep.

25
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:15,910
So 0.75 two meters high and zero point zero three meters deep or long.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,180
It's positioned exactly where the door is already.

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,510
It's not rotated in any way which is perfect.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,940
Now just place that zero point zero three meters in front of either side door to mask it and give it

29
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,600
a diffuse color of black as well.

30
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,810
You can give them any diffuse color you want.

31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,890
Just make sure that the diffused color is uniform so that we can distinguish between what's a wall and

32
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,020
what's the mask.

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,670
We're not going to give the roof or the floor any masks.

34
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,850
We'll discuss that later.

35
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,950
The back wall is going to have a mass so I add another box right under your back wall and we just try

36
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,550
and get it to be a child of the back wall shouldn't be that hard.

37
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,680
There you go.

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:11,110
The back wall has dimensions to to end point is there are three do the same thing for the box to two

39
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:22,750
and 0.03 position exactly where our wall is which it already is and zero point zero or three metres

40
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,370
behind the back wall so that it covers it.

41
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,330
OK.

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,460
Now just make this black

43
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,220
and this didn't work out because it's not behind the back wall it's in front of it.

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,440
Make sure it's behind it by reading negative 0.03.

45
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,630
There you go.

46
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,620
Now we just have our sidewalls.

47
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:58,200
So two boxes here as well want the sidewall eight and we'll go one box at a time.

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,910
This box will have the same dimensions as this wall.

49
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:12,650
So two two and zero point zero three for the length give it a diffused color of black.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,720
Now place this mask also in front of our sidewall 0.03 meters in front of it.

51
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,650
And do the same thing for this one.

52
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,210
First match its walls dimensions.

53
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:31,210
So two meters wide is really hard to click on two metres high

54
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,440
and the length will just be the same length as the wall.

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:47,880
0.03 give it a diffuse color of black as well and place it right in front of your sidewall.

56
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,890
Since the orientation is reversed for this wall put at negatived 0.03.

57
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,880
There you go.

58
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,680
Now we just covered every single part of our room with a mask instead of calling it box called mask

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,850
for every single note.

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,970
There you go.

61
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:19,460
So somehow every one of these masks has to be invisible and it has to make the wall behind it invisible

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,970
as well.

63
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,220
How will we do this.

64
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,440
First off we only added masks to the walls not to the roof or the floor.

65
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:35,720
So in the View Controller whenever we load the image for the wall in our wall load the mask of the wall

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,460
as well whether its the back wall the side of the wall load its mask by a writing flap mask is equal

67
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:52,240
to child the child being a certain wall that was specified right here that child node with name remember

68
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,120
the mask is a child of the tool and we gave every single one of them the name.

69
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,390
So back into your controller the name of each mask belong to a wall is just mask and recursively is

70
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,320
false since the mask is an immediate child of its respective wall.

71
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,910
Now the whole point of this was to make the walls translucent such that I can't see them from the outside.

72
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:25,130
Remember this as a rule of thump for something to be translucent it depends heavily on rendering order.

73
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:34,790
So if I make the mask completely transparent by writing mask geometry that first material transparency

74
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,540
is equal to zero point 0 0 0 0 0 1.

75
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,390
So this mask is almost completely transparent.

76
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,240
Welcome back to this.

77
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,180
Now if I go to the portal scene and when we load this portal into the scene view everything the walls

78
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,110
the roof and the floor.

79
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,350
They're all loaded.

80
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,910
They're all rendered at the same time.

81
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,150
Since the rendering order of every single one of these nodes is 0.

82
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,310
So if I put the rendering order of every single wall to be a crazy number like 200.

83
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,830
So child rendering order remember child is simply any wall that has been specified right here.

84
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,760
So child rendering order is equal to 200.

85
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:30,420
The mask which has a default rendering order of 0 is going to be rendered way before the walls will

86
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,150
since nodes with smaller rendering orders are rendered first.

87
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,470
So the walls will be rendered a way after the massacres.

88
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,300
Why is this important.

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,690
While the mask is basically completely transparent it's translucent and the walls are opaque.

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,570
Remember this as a rule of thumb.

91
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,620
If a translucent object is rendered first such that it's in front of an opaque object.

92
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:03,920
Their colors will be mixed so the color of the mask and the color of the walls now are going to be mixed.

93
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:11,580
And since the mask is extremely translucent almost transparent and by mixing the color of the walls

94
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,570
with the mask the walls are also going to be extremely transparent.

95
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,300
You'll be able to see right through them to the point that they're almost invisible.

96
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,380
So run the UP

97
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,900
WAIT TILL THE WORLD origin loads as soon as it loads the.

98
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,570
The horizontal surface.

99
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,340
Place your portal on that surface.

100
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,070
There is our portal and you can barely see the walls anymore.

101
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,140
In fact they're invisible.

102
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,000
However you can still see the roof and the floor

103
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,350
and this makes sense since we did not add a mask to the roof or the floor.

104
00:08:51,730 --> 00:09:00,820
Well we don't really need to the roof and the floor are already surrounded by all of these masks so

105
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,960
we don't need to give them their own mask.

106
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,760
So all we have to do is in the View Controller mummer the rule of thumb up if an opaque object is behind

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,390
a translucent object and is rendered after it then the colors will mix.

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,810
So the roof and the floor are already behind all of these masks.

109
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,780
So all you have to do now is make sure that they're rendered after the masks by giving the floor and

110
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,640
the ceiling a rendering order of 200.

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,650
So child rendering order is equal to 200.

112
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,750
Why would this work.

113
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,730
Well remember the rule if we render this after the masks are rendered then both of their colors will

114
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:50,950
mix and since the mask is extremely transparent this will make the roof and the floor extremely transparent

115
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,340
as well.

116
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,970
And we're finally done the app run

117
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,030
wait till the world origin loads once it loads start detecting a surface.

118
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,070
Place your portal on this surface.

119
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,060
And this portal looks pretty great.

120
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,100
It really does look like a real life and one dimensional portal

121
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,840
and it really does feel like that I'm going inside of a new world.

122
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,790
There are many possibilities with the portal.

123
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,150
You could make this world into anything you want as long as you have the proper cube map to cover every

124
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,680
part of the room.

125
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,160
Next up we're making is the basketball up which is just as awesome as this one.

126
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,770
We'll make it in the next section.
