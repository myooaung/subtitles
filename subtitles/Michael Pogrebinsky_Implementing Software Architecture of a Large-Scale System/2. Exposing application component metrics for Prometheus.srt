1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,100
The changes that we have to make to our services are extremely simple because we are using spring framework,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,480
so let's order some of this.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,550
All we have to do over here is we need to go to the configuration file.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:26,360
And we need to instruct spring framework to enable Prometheus Matrix once we do this, then on the Port

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,030
eight zero eight zero, which is the standard port for replication on the server port itself.

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,290
The Matrix will be enabled and they will be available.

7
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,360
And there you are a call slash actuator slash Prometheus.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,560
So that's something we will see when we configure Prometheus.

9
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,170
So but for now, this is the only thing that we need to do for our services.

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,400
So we'll have to do this for every service.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,270
So let's say let's look at Getraer service.

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,330
Again, the same thing, and this is the only change that we need to do to enable Prometheus in our

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,760
services, so pretty simple.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,870
Now let's look at our web application for our web application will have to install Django Prometheus

15
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,220
package so that installation instruction will go in our Docker file, where we are installing all other

16
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,990
packages for Django.

17
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,820
Then the other few things that we need to do, which are, again, pretty simple that there is you are

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:41,470
ill start be way, there are two you are to start pivoting in our web application, one where we have

19
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,530
all the application, you are as defined and there is another you are to by which actually imports this

20
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,040
previous.

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,870
You are registered to be.

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,760
And this is where we imported over here.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:01,300
We need to also provide include the what is there that exported by Django Prometheus.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,590
So we are going to import those URLs over here.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,150
Then the last thing that we need to do is we need to let.

26
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:22,070
Django framework now that we have installed Django Prometheus and it is part of installed apps and in

27
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,380
middleware section, these are the two statements that we have to put in the beginning.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,330
And indeed, and so does this one.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,190
This last line.

30
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,800
Apart from that, we do not need to do anything.

31
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:48,110
This is pretty much what we need to do to enable Django Matrix, and these Django Matrix will be available

32
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,980
on the solo port itself on Django Application Board on Yulara Slash Matrix.

33
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,090
So we will see that when we get into the demonstration.

34
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,700
So for demonstration, we will go to our workstation machine.

35
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,720
So let's go there and get into the demonstration.
