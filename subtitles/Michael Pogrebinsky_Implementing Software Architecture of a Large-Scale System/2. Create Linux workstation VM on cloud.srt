1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,340
In order to create a virtual machine, we will open a browser and you will go to Google Cloud.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,480
Will have to go to console the cloud or Google Dot.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,780
Once we go there, we reach to our homepage where we have to select a project.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,980
So I have created a project called A.W. Meanies, his next project.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,230
If you are coming here for the first time, what you'll have to do is from this election, put it on

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:27,560
menu.

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,550
You will come to the screen and there you have a new project button.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,780
All you have to do over here is you have to create a project with unique names so that that's pretty

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,920
much that you need to do.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,920
One thing I forgot to mention is that you can use your Gmail I.D. to log in into Google Cloud console,

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,620
and if you come here for the first time, you will see this offer of 90 day dollars 300 free trial.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,100
You can use it to minimize your costs on Google Cloud if you use it efficiently.

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,520
This should be more than enough to finish this course.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,450
When you are creating a new project and you do not belong to any organization, this is the kind of

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,870
screen that you see all you have to do over here it is.

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,540
You have to select a unique project name and you can continue with no organization over here and just

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,730
hit the Create button and that will create deep project.

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,610
Once a project is created, then you can go to compute engine.

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,570
Here we can create an instance by clicking this create instance button.

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,870
We can give our instance name, let's say, look, station one.

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,670
That would be the Instance.new.

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,540
It should be located in the closest region, so for me, the closest is.

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:59,360
Yes, years old ones also like Selector Zone can be aging does not matter in this case, then we will

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,260
select the machine.

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,990
You basically need to select the machine type.

26
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,510
How many CPU's and how much memory?

27
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,000
So I'll select four CPU and 16GB memory.

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,310
Then the next thing that we select is was the kind of boot disk.

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,920
This is where we will select the operating system.

30
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,440
By default, it is Debian Linux, but we want Ubuntu Linux, so we will change this.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,440
We will go here and we will change this to Ubuntu.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
We can even go for Ubuntu Pro also.

33
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,210
Pretty much the same thing, except that also provide some support and some license cost.

34
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,720
Then the important thing over here is that diversion of you will do that we need you're going to go

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,580
for the latest version Ubuntu 21.0 for.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,940
So this is what we have selected, apart from this, we can increase the disk size from 10 to 12 BGP.

37
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:04,590
This will make sure that we can store everything and select this one small disk is selected, then pretty

38
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,320
much all selections have been done.

39
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,990
The price of our machine is 123 dollars per month.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,200
If it is used 24 hours for a month, then this is the price.

41
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,090
We can further reduce this price by going to management.

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,710
So let's open that.

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,140
Once we are in management, we need to look for pre-emptively, the recommended setting is off.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,510
We need to make it on.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,990
It has all four production machines, but here we do not require production capabilities.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,010
We can set a tone and that way we can reduce the price by almost to almost one third.

47
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,240
So now it is forty one dollars per month, which is about point zero six dollars.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,480
But.

49
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,610
So this is good for us.

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,350
And the only downside is that if Google shortage of machine, then Google can take away our machine,

51
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,200
which means that we'll have to restart our machine.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,580
We do not lose any data.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We just need to claim new CPU and new RAM.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
So that's not a big problem.

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,180
Whenever that happens, at least we are saving a lot of money by doing this.

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,960
OK?

57
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,390
With that, all our selections are done.

58
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,980
Let's go to create, button and create this.

59
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,040
Instance.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:41,260
Are Virtual Machine is created with name WUIS or Workstation one, and it has got this external IP address.

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,860
In the next session, we will come back to this machine.

62
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,740
We will connect to it and we will do the.
