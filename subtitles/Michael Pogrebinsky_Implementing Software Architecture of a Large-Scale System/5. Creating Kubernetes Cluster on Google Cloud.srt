1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:09,820
OK, so all our container images, they have been uploaded to Google Container to justify a new refresh

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,140
container registry.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,690
It has all the images that we have created.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,270
So now the next thing that we need to do is we need to create Kubernetes cluster.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,150
So for that, let's go to.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,220
Kubernetes engine, so this is Google, Kubernetes, Indian.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,600
You will find this over here in computer, Kubernetes, Indian.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,410
If you click this.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,200
It will ask you first time if you are coming here, it will ask you to enable Cuban, it is here.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,460
You can enable them and this is where you will come to.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,210
So the first thing that we need to do over here is we need to create Cuban.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,450
It is.

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,650
So here we have two choices.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,650
One is gaze tinder and other one is to autopilot and create a standard.

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,800
One benefit of G.K. Standard is that you will really understand what Cuban industry is doing behind

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,250
the scenes.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,270
To get standard in that sense is better.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,390
But if you want more automation, then Autopilot is the choice.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,230
There's a newer choice if once you have, once you understand how Cuban it is works, then this is a

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,890
great choice.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,540
And it probably will also allow you to save some money because it will optimize the hardware that you

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,200
are going to need.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,930
So over here we are going to go to Big Eastender, so let's click this configure button.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,010
OK, so the first thing that we need to do is we need to choose a cluster name, so let's go ahead with

25
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,830
cluster one, whatever is over here, then we will create a regional cluster, meaning we will have

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,130
our system in multiple zones within a region.

27
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,100
So I'm going to select Asia South one.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,070
This is the region where I am located, so I'm going to choose that.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,950
Then pretty much we can live all the choices over here as the default.

30
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,650
Then the next thing that we need to go to is North Pole.

31
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,990
So we'll click on North Pole on the top level of North Pole.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,130
We can give them to the North Pole here we will go with default pool, whatever default name is debt

33
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,530
and the size.

34
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,090
Let's keep it as one.

35
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,890
So I am going to rent out one machine in each zone, so it is going to be a powerful machine that I

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,640
wouldn't go.

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,640
The other way of doing it is that you can rent out more number of machines, which are less powerful,

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,380
so that's also perfectly fine.

39
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,440
But this is what I'm going to do for our convenience and during the demonstration, this will.

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,520
It will be easier for us to understand with lesser set of machines.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,960
So I'm going to go with three machines in three different zones.

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,390
The rest we can leave it, as is the next item.

43
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,620
Next item that you can click is Nord's.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,910
Whoever it is can run any container image, so there's a whole container, I think that is the going

45
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,780
forward container.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,930
So you whenever you Docker images, they'll work perfectly fine with this container container on time.

47
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,850
And this container optimized operating system, there are other choices as well.

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,020
So let's say you can choose Ubuntu at Docker, you can choose this also, or we can leave the default

49
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,190
choice going his way.

50
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,000
Both of them will work, so it's just a matter of choice over there.

51
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,600
Then we have to choose a machine over here, the kind of machine that you will use.

52
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,750
So I'm going to create a custom machine over here in this custom machine I will choose.

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,300
Six CPU cores.

54
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:08,510
And I think, well, gee, we should be more than sufficient over here, so I choose to be quite a machine.

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:17,210
OK, then the next thing is the amount of disk space on each node, so 50GB should be more than enough.

56
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:24,680
So we will choose that and then we can leave all the other stuff is this.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,390
So these are the only changes that I made.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,910
One more important change we have to enable preemptively nodes.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,310
If you don't do that, we will not be able to run pre-emptively nodes, which are much, much cheaper

60
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,330
than non-trivial nodes for so far for our Big Machine.

61
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,070
Also, we use pre-emptively nodes.

62
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,440
We will use these pre-emptively nodes for our Google when it is listed as well.

63
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,500
So it will give you a warning that it won't live more than 24 hours, which is fine with us because

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,550
we are going to save a lot because of this option.

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,500
So in that sense, this option is important.

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Otherwise, it is not needed.

67
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,420
So once we have made all these choices, this all this stuff, we can live as this.

68
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,050
Another thing that you could have touched over here it is networking and security.

69
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,620
We could have created our own network, but we are going to use the default network.

70
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,030
That's good enough for us.

71
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,020
They are the same default network that we use for our machine as well.

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,300
So we are just going to go ahead with that.

73
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,400
So we are going to hit this great button once we hit that.

74
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,100
This will start Kubernetes cluster creation process, which will have three nodes.

75
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,800
So this takes time.

76
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,880
So we will let this run and when we come back, then we will see that the cluster is created.

77
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,070
OK, so our cluster is created, this is Kubernetes cluster, it is located in Asia, southwest region.

78
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,320
It has got three nodes.

79
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,380
It has got 18 Sybil's in total and it has in total 36 GB memory.

80
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,320
And it is distributed across three zones.

81
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,790
So we have to see that we can actually go to compute engine.

82
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:21,700
Where we normally have buried machine along with that, we also have three more machines, which are

83
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,520
part of G.K. Kubernetes cluster.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,920
And these images are there in three different zones, so Asia's Holtmann Sea, Asia's home to an air

85
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,760
is just over the surface there in three different zones.

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,090
Now let's go back to Cuba in a decision.

87
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,690
We have our communities, clusters of our co-editors clusters ready.

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,710
We have to put workloads on this cluster, so this workload is empty.

89
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,300
I don't think there'd be a reported.

90
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,730
So is this services are also as expected and that's what I have to cluster.

91
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:06,430
So now, in order to host application on Google Cloud, we'll have to create services and workloads

92
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:06,640
here.

93
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,700
Services doesn't mean these services in our application context, but in Kubernetes Indian context.

94
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,600
So we will see what do you mean by that when we look at configuration?

95
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,350
But in order to deploy replication on this Kubernetes cluster, we'll have to create some configuration.

96
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,870
So in the next session, we will look at how we can write that configuration.
