1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,930
OK, so this is the current state of our system.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,330
We have got multiple components now, and potentially each component can be scaled into many more number

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,140
of instances.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,940
Let's say here we have shown two instances were product service.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,990
We can potentially have been 50 or whatever number of instances that required.

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,000
The other issue right now we have is that we have deployed everything on a single machine, so we really

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,480
do not have a deployment strategy in place either.

8
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:37,460
Then we can do a deployment for testing our system where we can deploy everything on a single machine

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,340
and we can successfully tested every time.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,730
But now, if we are to deploy this system for production, we have to take care of the scale of the

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,080
system, one due to the large number of components that we have.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,760
Second, each component can have multiple number of instances.

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:04,210
And third is that each component is running in certain environment and we need to maintain that environment.

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,420
We need to reliably reproduce that environment every time.

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:16,700
Now we have seen how to do that with Docker images, but we need something on top of that because now

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,660
we are talking about an entire system on multiple machines.

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
So Docker alone will not be sufficient.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,080
We will need something else.

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,370
So that is what our objective is right now.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,280
We are looking for a tool which will allow us to deploy this large system on a very large scale.
