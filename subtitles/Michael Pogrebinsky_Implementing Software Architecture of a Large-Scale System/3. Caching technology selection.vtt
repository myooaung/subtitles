00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.290
Now, let's talk about the different options that we have for a cash that we can use in our system.

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.110
So there are two popular open source options that we have.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.300
One is my guest and the other one is that it is now.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.220
Both are pretty popular options and pretty good.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.610
But these days, rest is more popular.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.680
And this is what we are going to use.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.290
And there are reasons also why, and it is fits better in our architecture.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.400
And for that, we will have to look into certain things that this offer, which meant cash doesn't.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.820
The first difference between that is cash and man cash.

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570
This that rate is also provides cash assistance.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.790
So whatever data we are cashing, it can asynchronously write it on disk space also so that where the

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.410
data is persistent, so in the case, let's hope the cash crashes or we have to restart the cash for

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.230
whatever reason that we are maintaining it, we're going to patch the machine on which cash is running,

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.820
so we'll have to restart the cash.

15
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.410
Whatever is the reason.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.530
If the cash goes down, then when it comes up, it will take time for that cash to warm up, meaning

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.120
will take time to populate, repopulate the cash with the data and for that period of time are requests

18
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
which are not coming, which are not being sold by the cash but are reaching to the database.

19
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.770
Their performance level will go down and it will increase the load on the database.

20
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.210
So caching persistence is a pretty powerful option, which is offered by traders and is not available

21
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.980
in cash.

22
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.400
So that is one big reason why we would like to use reduced cash.

23
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.300
The other reason for which we would like to use right this is eviction policy and eviction policy is

24
00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.400
useful in the case where cash memory gets full so cash can evict some data in order to fit the new data.

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.820
So that's where these policies like least recently used.

26
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.490
These frequently used are peoples.

27
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.530
They become important.

28
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.990
Now, in some cases, we may not like cash to evict any data.

29
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.000
So this is one such case or one eviction policy of eviction, which is provided only where it is.

30
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.110
It is not provided by cash.

31
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.470
So if we want this kind of policy, then there is another reason to use raids.

32
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.910
Only raids besides supporting all the other eviction policies like members, Support said, also supports

33
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.660
new eviction.

34
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.400
Now, in our case, let's say if you want to get all the products for a particular category, then we

35
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.340
want all the products to be there in the cash.

36
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.690
We do not want cash to evict any of the product because space was less.

37
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.610
So we are going to make sure that we have enough memory in our cash and we do not want our cash to evict

38
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.110
any data.

39
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.220
We want to throw the area that no longer can fill the daytime to the cash.

40
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.780
So that will be a signal for us to actually augment the cash.

41
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.660
But in general, we want cash to retain everything that we have put in the cash for use.

42
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.420
Cases like that can be used, his other use cases as well.

43
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.300
But in our case, the use case that we are talking about is that for a given category of products,

44
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.770
we want all products over there so that the user can bazinet over those products and can view them right

45
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.790
from the memory.

46
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.790
We do not have a need in that case to go to the IDB aims to get the product details.

47
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.360
So for that reason, we would like to go for it.

48
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.910
No eviction case policy provided by status.

49
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.980
So these are some reasons why we would use it in our system.

50
00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.210
Now let's look at the court that will have to modify for our system to incorporate risks, and then

51
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.520
we will see the demonstration in which we will run our system with the latest cash.
