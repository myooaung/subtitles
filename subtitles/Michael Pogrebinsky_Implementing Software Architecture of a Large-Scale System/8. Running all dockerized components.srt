1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,820
Now that all components are running, let's do a quick check for that.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:15,460
We will connect to our cloud machine to connect through a browser using the ports on which our application

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,910
is running.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,670
So let's say this is a web application on 8000 port because authorization service is running, so we

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,170
should be able to sign in now.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,900
So we are able to sign it now.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,540
Similarly, we should be able to access our single page application that's running on board it.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,600
So that's how a single page application on Port 80, so book connections we are able to make.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,150
It seems all our components are running fine.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,430
So with this, we have democratized all components of our system.

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,280
They are up and running as Docker containers.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,480
So this is the basic set up of Docker containers.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,610
We still need to optimize it.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,960
Our goal is that we should be able to run our system in such a way that it mimics a production system.

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,070
So we will need to fine tune our Docker set up a bit.

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,250
And next, that is what we are going to do.
