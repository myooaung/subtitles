00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's go to a workstation.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.480
It's already started, so we're going to connect to it.

3
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.180
Now that we are connected, let's go to our code base directly.

4
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.870
And over here, I'm just going to update the code base.

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.920
It's already up to date.

6
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.110
OK, so now let's go to Dr. Dam, was that actually

7
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.190
the demo that we're interested in right now is 09 guessing and it's going to there directly?

8
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.150
What do we have over here?

9
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.040
So apart from those usual fights, these rules, Prometheus flew in one.

10
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.250
That we used for displaying metrics and logging data.

11
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.770
We need to focus on data and we see which is there.

12
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.620
Generally, you won't see data and we because it starts with dots.

13
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.480
So those finds that he didn't, so you'll have to do mine is here to see these files.

14
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.170
OK, so here what do we have here?

15
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.460
We have anybody that is cash and we have provided the host hostname in bold name information.

16
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.820
So that's what we need to hear.

17
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.130
Now let's see Dr. Campos fine.

18
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.630
Let's go to the bottom.

19
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.420
It should be there.

20
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.720
So here everything is set, except that we would have rigid risk configuration over here, so this is

21
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.100
where it is configuration.

22
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.610
We are downloading this image from Docker registry, and it does not require multiple configuration,

23
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.470
we have put it into a network and we have enabled the boards apart from that.

24
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.790
We have.

25
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.290
Put radius exported like we did in case of Chris, we created a post exporter.

26
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.870
So here we have this exporter so that our Prometheus can get the matrix off.

27
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.910
That is scarce as well.

28
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.560
So that's all we need to do.

29
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.000
It's pretty simple.

30
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.730
Now let's just run our system with this.
