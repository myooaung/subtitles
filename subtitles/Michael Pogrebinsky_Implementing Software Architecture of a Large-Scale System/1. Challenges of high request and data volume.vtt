00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.810
So this is the current state of our system.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.400
It has got a lot of components and each component, whether it's a web application, it's the services

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.850
they all can be scaled out of.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.690
Law goes up.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.440
We can add more number of instances to all of these components.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.750
And that way, we can take care of the law.

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.850
There is, however, one component, which is our database component, and right now we are using both

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.170
rescue and I'd be remiss.

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.850
So this being an idea, BMS cannot be scaled out maximum.

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.470
What we can do is we cannot read replicas, so it can help to some extent by taking care of reload.

11
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.850
But ultimately, this architecture will not be able to take care of the load if it goes beyond a point

12
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.490
and it start reaching our database and if it starts overwhelming our database.

13
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.990
So we still need to take care of our data architecture that we have in our system in order to take care

14
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.940
of high volume of requests because those high volume of requests will choke our database.

15
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.730
So in the next few sections, we will see how we can or what we can do to the architecture of our system

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.420
in order to take care of high amount of data.
