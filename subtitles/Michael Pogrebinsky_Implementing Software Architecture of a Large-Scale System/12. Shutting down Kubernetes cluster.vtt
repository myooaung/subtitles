00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.990
Now that we have completed the demonstration, we can actually remove our setup and for doing that,

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.340
what we can do is we can go to our work station.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.690
And but before that, let's take a look at the cluster.

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.040
It seems like autorizacion service boards.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.370
They are decreasing because there is no load.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.600
And arrest, all of the system is running as it is, let's refresh this.

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.270
OK, the system is running right now, and we no longer need this, so what we are going to do is we

8
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.860
are going to delete this system.

9
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.640
So I'm going to show you how we can delete this system so that we can again use cube deploy script.

10
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.380
And here we can choose all configuration because we need to delete all of them and it will delete them

11
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.050
in the reverse order of it in reverse order in which it created it.

12
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.870
So it is deleting it.

13
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.730
First, it is deleted.

14
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.590
All the horizontal bar are those killer is deleting parts and libraries.

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.260
It will go and delete the entire cluster.

16
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.270
Once you are ready to bring down your lifestyle, tell you can issue this command, and the other thing

17
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.190
that you need to do after this is your volumes don't assets.

18
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.230
And here you sit, delete.

19
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.020
So that's the last command that you'll have to execute, and this will also delete your persistent volumes

20
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.010
that we have created.

21
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.140
Okay, so we can look at this cluster right now because the workloads, what's happening over here?

22
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.530
So it is removing it vis a vis inventory, some sort of service products or whose parts they are going

23
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.860
down.

24
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.900
And if you look at services.

25
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.440
The number of services have reduced, and schoolbag said it is removing Yeager report right now.

26
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.080
You can wait a bit.

27
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.760
Now, very few services are left.

28
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.040
And very few workloads that have a meaning right now.

29
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.870
Seems like that also got deleted.

30
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.100
OK, so after this, the only thing left for us is volumes delayed.

31
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.810
So this will delete the space that it would have resolved or not.

32
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.600
Cluster node So this will logically delete the entire deployment.

33
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.410
Now we have even lost the data files that got created on US norms.

34
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.620
OK.

35
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.090
So that's the last thing that we can do is the cluster that we have.

36
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.970
We can delete the cluster also.

37
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.440
So this should delete everything that we created for our demonstration.
