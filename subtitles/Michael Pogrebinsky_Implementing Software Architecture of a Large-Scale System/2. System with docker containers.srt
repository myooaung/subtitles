1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,780
So this is how our system is going to look like once we containerized every component of our system

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:16,990
by containerization, I mean that we package our component along with its dependencies and its environment.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,450
So let's say this is a web application.

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,850
We have taken a base for that.

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,990
So it's a python.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,730
It's a Python application.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,020
So its dependencies are basically Jango and Python.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,380
The software that is required to run this particular web application, and let's say this is running

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,150
on a Linux operating system.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,300
So we will take our Docker Linux image of, let's say, Ubuntu Linux image.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
So we will package them as a container image.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,830
And this is something that we are going to see next.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,520
So that you exactly understand what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,870
The reason we are going to do this is once we have this complete package of every component, it will

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:09,370
become very efficient and predictable and consistent to start and stop our system.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,490
So the way we are developing and dealing with our system components right now, that is going to vastly

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:15,970
improve.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,100
Let's take one of these components and understand what exactly I'm talking about.
