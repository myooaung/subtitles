1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,740
The next item that we are going to implement as part of observability is tracing.

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,860
Now we have a large scale system over here.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,830
And if some API starts performing badly, then how do we know which component in this system is responsible

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,330
for that bad performance?

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,620
So this is where distributed request racing comes into picture.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,720
It helps us in pinpointing the exact cause of poor performance will be able to nail down which component

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,630
is causing the delay and how much delay that is causing.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,480
So what we do over here is the sort of profile and monitor the system as a whole.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,910
So we know there are various ways of monitoring and profiling single components.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,340
But here the problem is different here.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,370
The problem is we want this entire system to be profiles.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,790
If a request which travels through this entire system through lots of its components, then which component

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,650
actually slow down the request?

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,020
That is what we need to find out.

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,870
So what needs to be done is that we need to connect the profiling information that is coming out of

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,610
each component and we have to connect it meaningfully so that we can know exactly in which API, which

17
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,100
component disclosing performance problem.

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,270
So that's what distributed request tracing is, and it is absolutely essential for a large scale distributed

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,760
system.

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,680
So let's understand what kind of architecture we need to have distributed request tracing in our system,

21
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,470
and then we will go ahead and actually implement it.
