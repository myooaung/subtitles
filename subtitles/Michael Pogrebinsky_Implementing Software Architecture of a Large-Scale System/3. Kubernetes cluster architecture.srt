1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:08,370
In order to run our system on Kubernetes, we will first need to create Kubernetes cluster and we will

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,810
need a container registry in container registry.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,150
We will keep these documents that we have created.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,950
So there's nothing new that will have to do with these Docker images.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,330
We will use those Docker images, but we will have to put them on Google Cloud's container registry

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:35,190
so that the Kubernetes cluster that we will create it will pull out these images from container registry,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,290
and it will launch these images as containers on virtual machines, which will be part of Kubernetes

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,710
cluster.

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,980
These virtual machines will be part of something which is called as node pool, which is controlled

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,780
by a Kubernetes control plane.

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,090
So this control plane is the the operating system of Kubernetes, and it controls these nodes of more

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,570
pools.

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,430
So these more pools are really the virtual machines where applications run a replication run there as

14
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,710
boards boards encapsulate one or more containers within each port.

15
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,050
So right now, we can think of them as containers.

16
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,680
Kubernetes will pull out these Docker images, and it will launch these images on these virtual machine

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,810
called nodes as boards.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,220
OK.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,670
So with that now we noticed that first thing that we need is we need to create a Kubernetes cluster.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Then we also need Google Container Registry.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,470
And then the third thing is that we need configuration.

22
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,880
So when Kubernetes will pull out these images, it will deploy them on these nodes as per this configuration.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,930
So these are the three things that we need as a setup before we can actually run our system on cue when

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,290
it is.

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,970
So first thing that we are going to do is we are going to create a pool when it is cluster and we are

26
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,490
going to create the Google container registry and we are going to upload all the images that we have

27
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,210
created so far on this container registry.

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,830
So let's go ahead and do that.
