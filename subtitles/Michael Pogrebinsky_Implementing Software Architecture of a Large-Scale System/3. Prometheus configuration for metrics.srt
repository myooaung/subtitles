1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,230
Let's connect to our workstation.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,080
OK.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,100
We are connected.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,010
Let's go to the project directly and then Dr. Demo's directly.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,700
So right now, we need to do matrix demonstration.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,070
So let's go there.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,170
So these are the files that we have.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,080
There are at least two files which are new over here.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,270
Let's go over these files one by one environment variables.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,410
We added an environment variable, which is needed for services to enable Prometheus Matrix.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,020
And for that, we have anyway enable them in the code itself.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,600
So that's not customizable as of now.

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,390
I'll see later on if I can make that customizable to an environment variable, but that's how it is

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:00:59,840
right now.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,800
So these are the environment variables we need to have.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,720
Then the next thing is that in Docker compose file.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,980
So if we go through this file, we have.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,100
After Yaga, we have added Prometheus Docker container over here.

19
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,020
So this important image from Docker registry.

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:36,920
This is Prometheus image exposes a port and it takes a configuration file as a parameter, and we have

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,280
kept this configuration file in the current directory.

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,180
So we have mapped it over here in the current directory.

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,830
So this gets mapped to the config file, which Prometheus will take as a configuration parameter.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,470
So this is where we have done that mapping.

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:03,320
Now, apart from this, like I said that for Postgres database, it won't export Prometheus Matrix,

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,580
so we have put an exporter over there and to this exporter, we have configured this with the information

27
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,640
as to where database is located.

28
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,170
What is the username, password and database that needs to be monitored?

29
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,370
Similarly for ElasticSearch, also we have created a we have added an exporter.

30
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:33,380
So this is pretty much that we need to do to enable Prometheus Matrix.

31
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,550
There are configuration files that we need to just.

32
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,930
There is one thing I think I forgot to tell you over here.

33
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,780
There are two configuration files that we have added.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,840
One is Prometheus, Dart, Weinman and inside Prometheus.

35
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,980
Well, we have also provided one more configuration file, which is will start via email, so that is

36
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,960
also available in the current directory Buddhists Docker image.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,210
So let's see those two files so they are here in the current working directory Prometheus star acquirement

38
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,980
and we'll start by Iman.

39
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,750
Let's check them one by one.

40
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,860
First, let's check Prometheus via email.

41
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,670
This is the main configuration file of Prometheus.

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,220
Here we are telling Prometheus what to monitor, so we'll have to provide that as part of script config

43
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,880
because it is going to scrape the pages that each application will expose on these web pages only on

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,650
certain you are, you are you read.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,610
Each application will expose these metrics, and I'll just show you after starting the application that

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,260
what I actually mean by that.

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,320
So there are configuration for, let's say this is for web application matrix.

48
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:01,250
Here we are saying that the it is available on so and so you are right, and this is the most important

49
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,040
information for services.

50
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,050
Either we can provide this static information that there are services allocated located or we can simply

51
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:20,300
point services configuration to your recorded history and it can determine from you recorded history

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,410
where exactly service instance is located.

53
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,220
So let's say we have four or five authorization service instances multiple product, multiple service

54
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,850
instances.

55
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:40,430
So we will not have to provide this very lengthy static configuration over here, and it is slightly

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,790
dynamic also when we discuss service discovery.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,740
So it is useful to provide service discovery over here again.

58
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:56,660
The new array on which The Matrix will be available on services is this actuator Prometheus, which

59
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,890
we discussed some time back.

60
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:07,850
Now, similarly, we need to, apart from the replication and services we can monitor if our yaga components

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,570
are up or not.

62
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,560
So we have provided Target, says yougot Agent Yeager, Collector and Yegor, Griddy, and we have given

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,710
the where Yeager exposes these Prometheus matrix.

64
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,910
So Yeager does that on its own.

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,110
We do not need to do anything to Yeager, who export Prometheus Matrix.

66
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,540
Then we have certain databases over here in Postgres and ElasticSearch.

67
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,720
They do not export Prometheus Matrix, so we have provided exporter's for them and these are the targets.

68
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,060
These exporters are the targets over here.

69
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,590
The last thing that we have over here is that we have provided a rules fight that and we have provided

70
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,880
the location for the rules.

71
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,770
Now let's go and check what's there in the rules, while the whole site is basically for alerts.

72
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,320
We are using it for alerts.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,830
We have specified two alerts over one alerts about if some instances don't, then we will get an alert.

74
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:16,750
We can hook it with an SMS or an email alert also that whenever an instance goes down, the administrator

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,480
or whoever is in the mailing group can get mail notifications or SMS notifications.

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,440
So that kind of configuration can be done over here.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,430
All the mail notification and SMS notifications we have not configured over here.

78
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,790
That's something we need to do separately, but we have put some basic functionality over here, which

79
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,310
will provide us alerts on the UI.

80
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,410
So this is alert alert configuration in case of any instance going down.

81
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:54,280
And if for some API of the latency goes up by a certain fraction, then we will get an alert.

82
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,540
So this is another alert for that and how they are configured.

83
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,230
You can get that information from Prometheus documentation.

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,550
So that's the configuration part.

85
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,780
And now what we are going to do is now we are going to launch our system.
