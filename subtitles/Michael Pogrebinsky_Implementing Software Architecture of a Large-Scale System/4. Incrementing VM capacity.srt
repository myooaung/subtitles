1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,140
Now, before we go to our workstation for the demonstration, we need to increase the capacity of our

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,830
workstation because we have lots of components in our system now.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,410
So we will need a bigger machine.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,080
So what I've done is I have already started the machine.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,660
You can go here and start, stop whatever needs to be done to have stopped the machine.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,660
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to edit it to increase the capacity of this machine.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,580
So let's go ahead and go ahead and do that.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,640
Here we can edit it.

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,240
So right now we have two CPU and 8GB of memory.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:52,010
I'm going to increase it to four CPU and 16GB of memory rest, everything can remain the same.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,500
So just need to make sure that dependability is on, so predictability is one that will cost will be

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,310
under control, so and we will save it.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,780
OK, so the machine is updated now we can go ahead and start this machine.

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,980
So let's start there.

15
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,070
This machine start will take some time, so I'll stop the video over here and we will resume our demonstration

16
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,030
in the next session.
