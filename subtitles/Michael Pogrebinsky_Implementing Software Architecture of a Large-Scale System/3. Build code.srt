1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,440
Are what your machine is created with name W or workstation one, and it has got this external IP address.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,710
Now we can connect to this machine using a switch.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm going to click this button.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,990
So this will take a few seconds to connect.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,940
In the meantime, let's get the link to Bitbucket, where our code base is.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,830
So this is the link.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,920
I'm going to copy it.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,180
OK, so that's a big Bitbucket link, so we are going to go to bed bucket.

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,690
We have a jet repository over there.

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:49,760
So here we have our code base and the way to clone this is through this clone, where then we can get

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,280
the clone command from here.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm going to copy it.

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,580
Once it is copied, we can go back to our association here.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,430
Right now, we do not have anything.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,840
It is completely empty.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,160
Widget is installed.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,050
It came along with this Ubuntu image, so I'm going to make use of that.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,790
So that space, the clone command that we got from the bucket.

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,330
So code, don't load it, it is there in this minister's next directly.

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,730
Now, the next thing that we are going to do is we are going to install some software, so this software

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:44,070
that we are going to install, so we need to install Python three notches, JDK MAVEN and Postgres database.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,380
So let's go ahead and do that.

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,280
So for that, we will go into our code base, Mini says next year.

24
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,400
We have been directory where most of the scripts are.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,280
So we will going to be directly if I list this directly.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,690
There are two scripts over here.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:11,910
One is installed as tools and the other one is install base tools.

28
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,380
So based tools are required for doing the build on this machine and test tools are required for running

29
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,350
our application on this machine.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,020
So let's go ahead and run these two scripts one by one.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,320
So this is going to take some time, so I'm going to oppose it and will come back once it is done.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,450
So basic tools are installed now, the next thing that we are going to do is we are going to install

33
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,820
test tools, which will help us in running the application on this machine.

34
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,760
So this will include software like Postgres Database one, which is not required for doing big work.

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,690
When we run the application, we will need the database.

36
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,540
So this script is also going to take a few minutes, so I'm going to pause the video and will resume

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,410
it once it is done.

38
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,560
Now, test tools are also installed.

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,320
So the next thing that we need to do is we need to build our application and we need to create schema

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,790
of our database.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,290
So we will first create this schema of our database as part of installation.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,630
The database got created, it got created as a service.

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,520
It's up and running so we can all connect to it using its client, which is there in the.

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,900
Everything is part of the installation process itself.

45
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,550
So let's go ahead and first create this schema and then we will verify it by connecting to the database.

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,940
So let's first list the scripts that we have in this.

47
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,780
We have a script called Create Schema Dataset, which is going to run this group called Create Schema

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,560
Autodesk Cuit.

49
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,270
So let's just run this.

50
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,190
So this shows that the script has run and it has done fine.

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:20,860
It has created a new database called Worms, and it has created various tables and some indexes and

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,240
as part of this schema.

53
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:31,660
So let's just verify that the way we can do that is we can create a connect as Postgres user, so we

54
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,100
will do that.

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,970
And we are going to use be sequel, which is declined.

56
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:51,610
So now if I missed all the databases, so this is the database that God created or miss notify, we

57
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,250
can connect to this database.

58
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,000
Once we are connected, then I can list the tables.

59
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,900
So we have these tables that we wanted.

60
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:11,980
As part of these tables, there is a table called user art, which even has got a record in it so we

61
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,700
can check that

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,730
all of these tables are empty.

63
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,870
But this the only table which has got a single record and it has it has got a user record of user admin

64
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,080
so that we can log in into our system using this particular user I.D..

65
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,550
So that's what we have as part of our schema, let's just get out of this.

66
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,170
And now we would like to trigger our build process.

67
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,640
For that, we will go to the root directory of our code base, which is one level up here.

68
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,440
We have a script code based system dataset.

69
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:01,510
We will make use of this and we will trigger this script within our government call.

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,520
It will just be whatever we need to run this system.

71
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,440
So let's just go ahead and do that.

72
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,120
So I have triggered this build systems group.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,340
It's going to take time, and this step takes a long time because it has to download a lot of Java libraries

74
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,420
from the internet and for that matter, even for libraries, for Python and for religious lines.

75
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,430
So there's going to take some time.

76
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,600
It can take about 15 minutes on a new machine.

77
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,420
Once you have done it on a particular machine and later on, if you do it, it's not going to make.

78
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,620
It's not going to take that much time because this stuff is already downloaded.

79
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,740
It is just going to update anything that has changed.

80
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,960
So we will let it run for some time, and then we'll post this video and we will come back once this

81
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,450
is done.

82
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,110
The builders, it unsuccessfully, as we can see, that we have got this success message generally.

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:13,420
This bill will not fail because we have done everything through scripts and we are not changing anything

84
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,900
over here.

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,830
So as long as the operating system version is fixed, the core base stays the same and we run the scripts

86
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,960
to install the software.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,780
It is going to run perfectly fine, it's going to be perfectly fine.

88
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,340
So I has succeeded.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Now the next thing that we need to do is we need to run the application, but we are going to do that

90
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,400
after we take a backup of this machine and then we will run our entire system.
