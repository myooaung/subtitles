00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.320
Now we will actually act these load balancers to our system.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.940
First, we will look at how we can act Netflix reboot and then we will go to engine.

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.520
So as Netflix, it again is a clean slate load balancer, so we need to write some code for that.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.170
So let's just quickly look at the work.

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.250
We have seen this before.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.680
So get the service users.

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.120
Netflix, Hulu and Netflix provides easy integration with Netflix, but so there isn't much that we

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.610
need to do, except that in the properties file, we need to set this property right when you retire.

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.650
Enable to do here at a set of false, but this is just the default property.

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.950
When we actually run our system, we will override this property through environment variables where

11
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.100
we will set it to.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.700
So ribbon, not Ribbon Gate Service, Netflix, Zul service.

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.660
When it does routing it uses it will use this load balancer and at that time it will do all that routing

14
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.100
using this load balancer.

15
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.150
So there isn't much that we need to do over here except setting this flag now for other services where

16
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.950
we are using when load balancer, we will have to write some amount of code.

17
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.800
It's very minimal, but we'll still have to write some.

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.630
So this is being used in order service where we process inventory.

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.190
So here we have an inventory like this inventory line needs to reserve inventory at that time.

20
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.960
It needs to access inventory service, so it makes a call to the inventory service.

21
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.020
So before it makes a call to the inventory service, it needs to know the host and board information

22
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.670
about the inventory service.

23
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.210
So what it does is it takes this route when load balance.

24
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.780
So this ribbon load balancer is auto wired over here by the Netflix libraries itself and using spring

25
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.710
framework, of course.

26
00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.850
So this instance is available to us test load balancer instance, and we can use this to fetch information

27
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.630
from registry about inventory service by providing its I.E.D..

28
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.340
So once we do this, we get all the information about the instances that we have, and this will in

29
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.820
fact choose one out of those instances.

30
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.170
So there are 10 instances of inventory service.

31
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.900
This load balancer will choose.

32
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.870
One of those instances we can set the different strategies by modifying the properties of this load

33
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.290
balancer.

34
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.130
But I guess by default, it selects a round robin strategy and we will see that during the demonstration,

35
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.440
and that is good good enough for us for now.

36
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:44.020
So this ribbon level and said what the only thing that it does is that it fetches the registry information

37
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.980
from discovery service and out of the instances that are available for a particular service, it will

38
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.750
choose a particular instance from this instance object.

39
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.220
We can get the host port and any other information that we need.

40
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.630
So once we have that, we can use a regular CTP line to make that as you typical to our inventory service.

41
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.970
So this is how a client side load balancer works.

42
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.550
For Engine X, we will see during the demonstration.

43
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.620
Work configuration we need to do.
