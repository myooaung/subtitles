1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,150
Let's first create a work environment.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,300
We will rent out a machine on Google Cloud.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,630
This machine will be a Linux machine of Ubuntu flavor.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,720
It will have four CPU and 16GB RAM.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,420
If you want, you can start with a smaller machine.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,940
And as we move along, as we scale up our system, you can scale up the machine as well.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,950
Then the next thing that we are going to do is we will download the code base or clone the code base

8
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,700
from Bitbucket.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,090
Then we will install some software, which will allow us to Berlin run our system on the machine.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,510
So let's go ahead and create a work environment on Google Cloud.
