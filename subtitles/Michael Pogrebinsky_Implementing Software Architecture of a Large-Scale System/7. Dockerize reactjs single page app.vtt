00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.540
This is the configuration for a reactor up our single page application that is nothing fancy going on

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.990
over here.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.690
We will take in the next docking container image as the base.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.230
On top of that, we will put react.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.530
We will copy react.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
And we will also copy an Engine X configuration file, which will have the information of which board

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.750
to run and the next.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.320
And from there to pick up the React build.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.800
So those two information we need to put, so this is the configuration.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
This is usual configuration that we have done for other components as well.

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.970
So let's just go and save this in Docker compose file.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.820
Let's go to the bottom.

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.190
You can pasted over here.

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950
OK, let's have it.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.450
We are done.

16
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Now we are ready to boot.

17
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.820
But before that, this let's take a look at the configuration a bit.

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.610
So this is the Docker files or indeed, Docker file.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.290
Again, nothing fancy.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.020
We are starting with Engine X base image.

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.370
Some tools we have installed, we have copied Engine X configuration to a certain location and we have

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.500
copy, react to a certain location and we unzip that vehicle.

23
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.960
So that's pretty much what we have done.

24
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.560
Let's see what's that in the image directory?

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.760
Image directly.

26
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.290
Like I said, there are two things.

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.140
So there is this reactor in zip form and there is engine con file.

28
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.250
We can just open this engine ex-con file.

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.720
So like I said it, the configuration that is there over here is that the port it is listening on is

30
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.740
port number eighty.

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.580
And for any real, it will go to this particular location where we have copied a reactor.

32
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.970
So that's pretty much we are ready to build this.

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.710
So let's go ahead and build this.

34
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.720
For that, let's move one level up

35
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.230
and speed.

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.330
So let's build this.

37
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.230
This will download Engine X will take a few seconds, so we will wait for it, and then it will copy

38
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.000
the configuration files and react.

39
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.040
Plus, it is installing some utility tools that should be quick should not take much time.

40
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.960
So.

41
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.240
Our container bill is done now, we're ready to launch it.

42
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.250
So let's go ahead and do that.

43
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.800
Up minus D.

44
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.970
S Beer.

45
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.090
So it has started a container, we can take a look at the logs.

46
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.250
So it started if you look at Docker process.

47
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.720
So this process is launched and it is up.

48
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.100
OK, so our entire system is running.

49
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.980
So let's go ahead and test our system.
