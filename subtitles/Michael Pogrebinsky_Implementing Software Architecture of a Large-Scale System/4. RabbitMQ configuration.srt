1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,060
Let's get into a redemptive demonstration, so we have this machine, let's get connected to this.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,460
While this is connecting, let me tell you that I have upgraded this machine, so if we go and look

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,020
into the properties of this machine.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:22,040
And edit it if we look at this, the machine tirade right now is E-2 Standard, which has got eight

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,380
CPUs and 32GB memory here at CPU's is good for us.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,370
We need that, but 32GB memory is a bit too much.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,930
We do not need that much.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,060
But because this machine comes as a standard machine, so we have taken this.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,400
Otherwise you can go for a custom machine also.

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,720
Nevertheless, we have this machine and we expect this to perform a bit better from the previous machines

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,710
that we were using.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,890
So now let's go to our connection.

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,940
So we have connected.

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:00,050
So let's go to our demos directly Docker demos directly.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,180
Now, the demo that we are interested in right now is this number 10 is in the process.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,770
So let's get into that.

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,280
These are the files.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,770
First, we will look at in B file what we have ED over here is these flex order process.

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,160
Async is hard to do because we want this process to be asynchronous.

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,690
Q-Tip is that every time Cube and we have specified host for every time QC, every time Q itself.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,870
So those were environment variables.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,060
Now let's look at our Docker compose file in Docker compose file.

23
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,370
Let's start from the top.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,650
The only thing that has changed over here is that we are rated a venue for rebuilding.

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,450
So that's a change from the previous demo.

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:09,790
Now going to the next change we have created to order service instances, so I'll just stop at that.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,190
Yeah.

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,690
So here we are, so earlier we had order service as the order service now because we have created two

29
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,200
instances to give a flavor of multiple instances.

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:31,720
So we have named it as auto service one and the other instances, orders of these tools you now instead

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,970
of one consumer of our every time we will have to consumers.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,530
So that's the change with our order service.

33
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,810
It works the way it has been.

34
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,730
Working order change now, the last change that we import is that we have created a rebate MQ container

35
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:59,740
over here, and this container uses this image from Docker registry that every time queue of management

36
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,190
version.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,410
Now it exposes some ports, the last port is required one, five, six nine two, I think this one is

38
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,790
required for the administration console, but there is this other old one five six seven two which is

39
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,540
required for Prometheus audited all the way around that 7:02 is required for main console and nine is

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,240
required for Prometheus Matrix.

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,520
So because everytime you exposes Prometheus Matrix by itself, we do not need any exporter like we have

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,660
work for Radius, Postgres and all those components.

43
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,820
So here at every time, you will expose Prometheus Matrix by itself.

44
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,300
So that's our component configuration.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,350
With that, we are ready to run our system.

46
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,580
So let's launch that.
