00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:01.345
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.996 --> 00:00:05.150
Lets go ahead and take a look at

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.680
arrays of structures.

4
00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:11.980
In the previous example,

5
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.021
we set the values of attributes
for b1.

6
00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.946
Variable one by one.

7
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:20.010
We type in b1.ID equals zero.

8
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:23.195
b1.name= I don't know

9
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:24.890
the name of the book etc.

10
00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:26.475
But here,

11
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.750
we can see something completely

12
00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:29.416
different.

13
00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.830
So, we have created a variable

14
00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:35.228
of type Book.

15
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.500
We have just named it book1.

16
00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:38.455
I could have

17
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:39.593
just as well named it

18
00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:40.451
b1

19
00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.480
it doesn't matter, I just typed
in.

20
00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:44.206
So, sorry.

21
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.535
It could have been b1.
But I could have typed,

22
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.510
I'm going to use

23
00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:49.640
book1.

24
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.615
No big deal.

25
00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:53.750
Same thing.
Just different variable name.

26
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.750
And then I began intializing it,

27
00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.236
initializing its attributes
one by one.

28
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.345
So let's have a look.

29
00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:01.970
ID

30
00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:03.990
ID will be zero.

31
00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:05.240
Name of the book,

32
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.626
well I've literally placed
the name of the book

33
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.655
to be name of the book.

34
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:11.838
Author,

35
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:14.276
I don't know, Unknown Author.

36
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.201
And then we have

37
00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:19.800
an attribute which is actually
a structure here.

38
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:26.310
And that should be published,
which is of type date and

39
00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:28.115
date is a structure here.

40
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:30.766
And then

41
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.800
I needed this variable.
I needed a variable which had

42
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:37.840
all the attributes initialized,

43
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:40.350
through which all the
attributes are initialized.

44
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:41.256
So,

45
00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:44.945
dt, date for book1.

46
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:48.435
Okay, dt for book1.

47
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.981
And here you see the single
line initialization

48
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.421
or the short initialization.

49
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:56.021
Well it's

50
00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:58.760
maybe not shorter or
one line or whatever

51
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.826
but it's definitely more practical
than typing in

52
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:04.820
b1.id, b1.name,
b1

53
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.840
.author, b1.count, etc.

54
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.008
This is far more

55
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:11.395
convenient, so.

56
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:12.230
1,

57
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.065
2,

58
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:13.945
3,

59
00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:14.836
so,

60
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:15.876
what do I get here?

61
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.226
Day, month, year

62
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:21.445
so it's 10th of the 10th of 2016.
That's what I chose as a date.

63
00:02:21.936 --> 00:02:24.025
And then for book2, again,
some random date.

64
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:26.975
It's the 11th of the 11th of 2011.

65
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:28.806
So just two

66
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.015
variables.

67
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.741
And

68
00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:31.810
then I'd use

69
00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:33.011
this variable

70
00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.291
with all the attributes initialized
and I have placed

71
00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.031
placed it here.

72
00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:38.868
So,

73
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.375
that the variable
would book1

74
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:43.665
would have all the attributes
initialized

75
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:45.015
including

76
00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.181
the one of

77
00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:47.690
the one of type date.

78
00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:50.540
And that type date would
have all the

79
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:51.631
the type date

80
00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.375
variable published

81
00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:58.110
would have all the elements,
all the attributes intialized from the

82
00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:00.235
like the day, month, year.

83
00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:05.835
So that could be printed
out as well. Now,

84
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.606
hopefully this is clear.

85
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.905
So this is how you can
initialize them.

86
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:13.180
It's far more convenient
to do it this way.

87
00:03:13.971 --> 00:03:14.718
Down below

88
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.895
you have

89
00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:18.683
basically this array that
I talked about.

90
00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:22.535
So this is basically

91
00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:23.605
array

92
00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:28.760
books. It's not really that
much different from a regular

93
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.926
type array.

94
00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:30.920
No big deal.

95
00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:31.776
So, look.

96
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.076
Here I have book.

97
00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:36.535
Type book and then the
variable book1.

98
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:38.796
Here again I have typed
book

99
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:42.365
and the variable actually here this
time it's books.

100
00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:45.275
And I am basically the

101
00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:48.686
books, that's the array and
I am giving it a size of

102
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.890
100.

103
00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.346
And it looks pretty much the same

104
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.745
as a regular array.
No difference there,

105
00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:58.690
pretty much this is the
first elements so,

106
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.668
the second element would
be like 1, 2

107
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:03.060
3, 4.

108
00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.935
No big deal you could
just list them

109
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.301
on and until you reach
the end of the array.

110
00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:09.370
No big deal.

111
00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:11.815
This is how you would
intialize

112
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.860
these elements,

113
00:04:12.995 --> 00:04:14.036
these attributes.

114
00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.030
The syntax

115
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:21.310
there is, I mean, the syntax
is an array, it's pretty much,

116
00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:23.350
as the regular array,
it's pretty much

117
00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:24.971
the same, that's what
I want to say.

118
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.760
And this is how you would
initialize them. So the ID

119
00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:29.476
of

120
00:04:29.756 --> 00:04:31.195
let's say the third book,

121
00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:33.408
is 10.

122
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.140
Third because it's zero,

123
00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:36.560
one, two.

124
00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:38.415
That's what we learned
about the arrays.

125
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.015
The count begins from zero.

126
00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:43.291
So the ID

127
00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:44.878
of the third book

128
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:45.845
is 10.

129
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.525
The author

130
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.191
of

131
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:49.515
the,

132
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.700
of the

133
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:52.045
15th book

134
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.098
is

135
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.830
tralalalala,
so that's

136
00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:55.970
the name of the author,

137
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:57.500
imaginary name
I might add.

138
00:04:58.456 --> 00:05:01.520
So the author of the
14th book would be tralala.

139
00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.720
And the ID of the second
book would be 10.

140
00:05:04.956 --> 00:05:06.946
And this is how you
would access those

141
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:08.645
attributes and this is
how you would

142
00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:09.550
basically,

143
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.875
I don't know just explained it

144
00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:11.786
through your print out,

145
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.360
how you would access them
to actually print them out.

146
00:05:15.685 --> 00:05:16.890
And let's go ahead and

147
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:18.050
build and run this.

148
00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:20.651
And you will see 10 and tralala.

149
00:05:21.165 --> 00:05:21.865
Simple as that.

150
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:23.986
I mean no big deal,
there isn't that much difference

151
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:25.875
from this standard,
regular arrays

152
00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:26.670
that we have

153
00:05:26.806 --> 00:05:27.618
learned about

154
00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:28.460
actually,

155
00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:31.305
to me this part is more
interesting up here

156
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:32.385
as opposed to this one.

157
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:36.040
Because there is nothing really
that much different here.

158
00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:38.035
In conclusion,

159
00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:39.001
structures

160
00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:42.130
are powerful abstraction tools
in programming.

161
00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:45.920
Say we have to keep information
about

162
00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:47.935
100 books,

163
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:51.965
without structures we
would have to have like

164
00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:53.948
separate

165
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:00.430
not only without structures but

166
00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:01.221
without

167
00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.420
arrays of structures

168
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.305
you would have something
like this. You would

169
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:06.160
like int

170
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.606
Id

171
00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:08.320
ooops,

172
00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:10.361
IDs

173
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:11.415
and then you would

174
00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:13.545
create some sort of
an array here.

175
00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:16.106
And these would be the
IDs for 100 books.

176
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.235
And then you would have

177
00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:20.986
to have another array for
names

178
00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:24.000
and another name for
authors and another name

179
00:06:24.181 --> 00:06:24.968
for

180
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.546
date, etc.

181
00:06:27.456 --> 00:06:30.266
But the array for date would be
like would be like the array for day

182
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:31.675
and then the array for

183
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.000
month and then the array
for year

184
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:37.346
so that would make the draw
a lot difficult

185
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.945
because look, it would be like this.

186
00:06:39.271 --> 00:06:39.875
int

187
00:06:41.386 --> 00:06:42.035
year

188
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:47.421
100 and then you would
have int

189
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:49.465
day

190
00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.806
100 and then you would have

191
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.315
int

192
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:57.705
month

193
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:03.255
100 and so on and so forth.
You would have

194
00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:07.065
a ton load of these variables,
they would be on end.

195
00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:10.945
But like this, we can
save a lot of time

196
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.065
by just having one array here

197
00:07:13.201 --> 00:07:16.286
instead of having all of
these arrays here,

198
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.560
a lot easier.

199
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:21.086
But with structures,

200
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.485
as I said here,

201
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:23.945
there is only one variable

202
00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:25.081
array

203
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.220
and

204
00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:26.986
there you go.

205
00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:30.350
You don't need all of these,
you can just have one of these.

206
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.100
And that's it and then
you can have

207
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:33.766
the list of attributes here

208
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.625
and then you can have
an array here

209
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:38.666
so you can keep records
for thousands and thousands

210
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:39.870
and thousands of books.

211
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.506
And there is only one array

212
00:07:41.641 --> 00:07:44.165
which you actually need
to modify and not

213
00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:45.190
a hundred of them.

214
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:47.720
A lot simpler, right?

215
00:07:48.116 --> 00:07:48.673
Hopefully.

216
00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:49.901
Yes.

217
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:51.410
Anyway.

218
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:54.755
I bid you farewell here.
Wish you a ton load of luck with this.

219
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.746
Anything that you wish
to ask, feel free

220
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:58.795
to go to the Q&amp;A section.

221
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:01.066
If you need tech support,
go to the Q&amp;A section.

222
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:02.865
If you want to ask me
something personally,

223
00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:04.485
feel free to send me a PM.

224
00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:08.476
I try to read all the messages
and I really do try to answer

225
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.590
them all. If by some crazy chance
I missed you or

226
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:13.446
I fail to provide you
with answers,

227
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.890
just send me another

228
00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.515
message because I probably
didn't see it

229
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.026
or something like that happened
or I accidentally skipped it,

230
00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:22.270
for that I am sorry

231
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:23.035
if it happens.

232
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.483
Anyway, as I said,

233
00:08:24.616 --> 00:08:25.968
for anything that's
not clear,

234
00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:27.960
please feel free to go
to the Q&amp;A section.

235
00:08:28.286 --> 00:08:29.706
Now we're going to wrap
this tutorial up

236
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.908
and go to the next chapter.
