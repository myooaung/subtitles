00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Welcome all to this
tutorial, today I'm

00:00:02.465 --> 00:00:04.880
gonna go ahead and
show you how you can

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.844
set your development
environment up

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:10.990
now I'm personally using a Linux

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.054
environment Linux operating

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.259
system. I'll show
you how you can

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.657
actually installed
UID by the terminal

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:20.730
but I'm guessing
that most people are

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.112
using Windows so also
I will show you how

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:25.560
to do it in Windows
now keep in mind

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.622
that the procedure
for Windows and for

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:31.780
MACs it's pretty much
to say it's very

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.406
very very similar if
you really need me to

00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:37.100
show you how to install
codeblocks on a Mac

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.020
just send me a p.m. or something like
that and I'll make an extra video we

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.575
just download a file
in run it, that's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.779
basically it but I'm
gonna go ahead and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.202
show how you can conduct
an installation

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:51.889
on Windows and how
you can do it on

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.233
Linux so it's fairly
simple as I said I

00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:58.640
will be using a I
don't believe it I

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.518
didn't know if I
actually mention that

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:02.250
in the intro but I
will be using a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:10.240
Windows machine, I will be
using a Windows virtual machine for

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.950
the demonstrations of this tutorial, but it
really doesn't matter which operating

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.985
system you are using
once development

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.180
environment is set
up it will be the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.090
same across all platforms it will look
the same across all platforms and you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.776
will use it in
pretty much the same

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.170
fashion across all
platforms again so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.140
the integrated development environment
that I have chosen today to use today is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.097
basically codelocks.
Why codeblocks?

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.780
well for notice
it doesn't really

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.518
matter for Linux you
can use pretty much

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:41.789
whatever development
environment you

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.100
want and they were
all fairly easy to

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.430
set up but for Windows
sometimes you

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.040
can have compiler problems and you
need to link it manually

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.119
it can get complicated
however with

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:56.780
code blocks, you get a compiler

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.700
with the integrated
development environment

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.520
so basically just
have a file which

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.600
you download and run and that's it you
can begin your programming session it's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.960
fairly easy no no difficult

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.334
there is nothing
particularly difficult

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.450
to do there, I mean
it's fairly easy

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.375
so you don't have to
worry about that is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.300
the primary reason
why I have chosen to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.446
use codeblocks, due
to the ease of setup

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.800
I generally tend to
use Eclipse for C++

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.978
or for Java I don't
do a lot of work in

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.090
Java anyway but for
Python I tend to use

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.907
Spider those are all development

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.850
environments which
you can set up now

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.640
some of you might ask
me why don't use

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:45.430
Visual Studio blah
blah but you have to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.820
Visual Studio is a pretty complex
development environment and I don't like

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.200
the way things are compiled when you
take Visual Studio for example in the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.730
keylogger course while the keylogger was being made if it was

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.500
compiled for example in Visual Studio
it wouldn't behave

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.832
the way we wanted it
to behave but for

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:11.320
example if we compiled
it in codeblocks

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.310
with a complete game with codeblocks
it would behave exactly the way

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.208
we have intended
it to behave so I

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:18.760
don't know there's
just some of my own

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.695
personal preferences
to tell you the truth

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.430
said and to be honest
with you, you can

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.770
use any development
environment for this

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.110
course that you
want just set it up

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.596
and make sure it's
running, that its

00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.210
functional and you
won't have any

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.261
problems with it as long as it

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:36.270
comes with a compiler or did you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.265
can order to know how
to link a compiler

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.040
to development
environment so let me

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.220
just quickly show you how you can
install it in Linux just open up a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.775
terminal type in dnf search codebloks

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.330
and there you go,
so you indeed

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.840
have codeblocks right here

00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:01.064
so you can type dnf install

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.492
codeblocks and this
will just basically

00:04:04.517 --> 00:04:07.000
just go ahead run and
install codeblocks

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.901
without any problems
or difficulties

00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:12.660
it is in default
repositories and I

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.363
personally find that
the installation is

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.359
probably the easiest
in Linux just type in

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.825
one command and that's
done, you don't

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.491
need to go visit any
sites you need to go searching

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.574
for it online you just have your

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.490
internet connection
you type in a single

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.627
command it gets pulled from the

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:28.400
repository is installed
and setup for you.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.490
indeed come to the fullest extent so let
me just launched it to make sure that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.702
it's running to make sure
that everything is fine

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.415
codeblocks. ok. current
default compiler

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.400
GCC yep that is what I want as

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.150
you can see there are some other ones
but it doesn't really matter it'll

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.510
do just fine that's what we want
and there you go

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.955
so it runs so this
is how code blocks

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.110
looks in Linux. Now
you will remember

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.660
because you will see exactly the same layout in Windows it

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.673
looks exactly the
same they're pretty

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:10.500
much no differences
of whatsoever so let

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.310
me just go ahead and close it because I
don't really need it here if you're

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.366
using this is for our
view this is the

00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:19.470
way to install it on
Fedora if you using

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.630
Ubuntu or Debian based distribution you
can just type in apt-get

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.498
install code blocks
this should work

00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:32.140
should work on it
in pretty much any

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.976
Debian system
without any problems if

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:39.479
you're using some other
Linux that had that

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.518
not using the app get
or its not using

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:44.950
the DNF you can just type in the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.529
command that is used to install

00:05:48.554 --> 00:05:51.440
basically here and
space install space

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.530
codeblocks it should work without any
problems

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.633
keep in mind that
you can also pretty

00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:58.919
much use the same
procedure as you do

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.168
the same procedure
as on Windows or

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:03.260
Linux as well you can
just download it

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.190
from the net and run the file so that's
also an option

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.483
so let me just move
this terminal away onto

00:06:11.508 --> 00:06:13.990
my other screen and
here is a Windows setup

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.755
so Windows setup is
also fairly easy, let

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.890
me just go ahead and
expand this across

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.890
the full screen

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.711
ok so let's go ahead
and open up Firefox

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:37.800
and let's type
codeblocks fairly simple

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.970
open up the website it's gonna be the
first one, if you type in codeblocks

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.220
chances are there's going to be
the very first one

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.934
ok so you have a lot
of documentation

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.880
here that you can
read about it if

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.539
you want, not big deal

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.110
go into downloads, we would
like to download the

00:06:58.135 --> 00:07:01.530
binary release it can
also be done with the

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.530
source code if you want to examine it
and here you have like I don't know if you're

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.879
a Mac user just go
ahead and click on

00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:11.230
Mac OS X its gonna
drop you down and

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.759
there you go thats file that you
download and that you run that you

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.825
don't actually need
to do pretty much

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.719
anything else what is
codeblocks ok so you

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.643
don't really have
the latest one for

00:07:27.668 --> 00:07:32.030
Mac but yeah they're
looking for Mac

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.595
developers so if you
are and if you feel

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.069
like you want to do
it you can apply

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.469
it's it's out there
you know it's very

00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:43.749
very good learning
best way to learn

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:45.665
actually but anyway
that doesn't really

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.740
matter now so you see
you have also for

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.581
Linux 32 bit and 64 bit,
it'll show what you

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:53.170
want and you also have
this is a demo for

00:07:53.270 --> 00:08:00.340
Windows, you also have here for Windows
Windows XP Windows Vista 78, point eight

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.630
8.1 and Windows 10, Ok
just go ahead

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.005
basically and click
on it and here you

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.930
have multiple choice
options so let me

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.333
just see which one do
we need we need the

00:08:15.358 --> 00:08:18.409
one we deem in GWT
compiler which is

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.391
going to be this one,
picks up, so just

00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:24.110
go ahead so once
again look it's this

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:30.069
one I am selecting it don't
miss it so if you do something else

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:32.647
chances are you're
going to encounter

00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:34.810
problems thats the
1,2,3 the fourth one

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.391
from the top and then go ahead

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:38.034
and click on sourceforge.net

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.362
it says download of
codeblocks will start

00:08:45.387 --> 00:08:49.100
at like 3,4,5 seconds
whatever excellent so

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.601
you have chosen to open
codeblocks, exit, ok,

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:55.470
save file. By the way, let
me just tell you that

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.570
when downloading X-files files from the net
and running on your PC

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.429
make sure I mean
absolutely make sure

00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:05.130
that you trust the
source of your

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.868
download and that you
trust the developers

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:09.860
of that program especially when

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.706
downloading closed
source applications

00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:13.810
codeblocks is not a
cause close source

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.690
application it's open
source application

00:09:15.715 --> 00:09:17.530
you can actually
download the source

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.185
code itself and have
a look around if you

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.900
want, no big deal
there but I'm just

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:30.510
saying that when you download X-files doesn't
matter if the course is mine or someone

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.440
else's or if you were looking at a
YouTube tutorial or whatever and when

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.014
somebody says ok now
you need to go to this

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:40.450
website download this
X-files file and run into your PC

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.490
don't don't take that and face value like
think about it a little bit examine

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.480
the source where you're downloading it
from what to what are you downloading

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.284
don't just downloaded
theX-files files and

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:55.860
run them on your PC,
it can cause you

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.194
a ton load of problems
so just go ahead

00:09:59.219 --> 00:10:02.180
and click on this we're going to

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.379
download it basically and run it

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.841
it doesn't matter which
browser you're using,

00:10:07.866 --> 00:10:10.049
I personally am using
Firefox I really

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.997
prefer Firefox across
all my devices

00:10:13.022 --> 00:10:16.073
so welcome to
codeblocks, set up next

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:21.703
agree ok so all these
things need to be

00:10:21.728 --> 00:10:26.709
selected click on
Next install and it's

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.529
going to run so now
you can just leave

00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:32.389
it and let it roll
eventually it's going

00:10:32.489 --> 00:10:34.785
to get there, the
installation process

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.029
is surprisingly a
little bit slower on

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:38.879
Windows probably
because it's a virtual

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.769
machine and it is not
as fast as my main

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:44.347
machine you can
see that the icon

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:47.509
appeared in the upper
left corner as

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:50.759
well, excellent. So it's
gonna finish, the beauty

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:54.009
of it is as I said is
that it comes with a

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.561
compiler so there's
no need for linking

00:10:55.586 --> 00:10:57.399
or any of that, or any of those

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:00.788
complications that
come around where the

00:11:00.813 --> 00:11:03.869
clips or some other
ID although I do

00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:06.923
prefer actually a clips
for when I'm working

00:11:06.948 --> 00:11:10.289
on a project or something
like that it does

00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:16.079
come with a pretty good
amount of options so do you want to run

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:21.109
codeblocks now? No thank you, we should
run it later, you click Next

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:26.429
finish close. Yeah, there we go so it's
done and over with and I would never

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:28.959
want to say is that
codeblocks not as

00:11:28.984 --> 00:11:31.439
it lacks options but
it's probably one

00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:34.357
of the best development
environments for

00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:37.339
learning probably the
best and you can

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:41.966
also do some very serious
working on it, so let's

00:11:41.991 --> 00:11:46.089
go ahead and open it
up, run it, there you

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:50.819
go. So look, let me just go ahead minimize the
virtual machine

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:59.120
and go ahead then run
codeblocks here so

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:05.220
do you notice the
similarity it looks

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.086
pretty much the same right?
So this

00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:14.839
is Linux and this
is windows so the

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:16.382
development environment
looks the same

00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:17.800
and it's going to
look pretty much

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.908
exactly the same on a MAC
as well so you don't

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:24.310
need to actually worry
about that either

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:30.680
there are no problems there of
whatsoever so pretty much the same the

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.832
the development
environments and the

00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:34.470
installation procedure
is also fairly

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.649
simple there aren't pretty much no complications with it so

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:42.213
let me just go ahead
and expand this to

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:44.970
full screen if you
want to create your

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:51.290
project to just go. This is just
a very very very basics as we progress

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.180
through the tutorial downwards and as we go into

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.861
two more complex
stuff as we begin

00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:00.029
learning etc, I
will introduce the

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:03.290
various options in codeblocks but I
just want to show you how to create

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.230
a project so just
go ahead and click

00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:08.990
on File, go into
New, go into Project

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.484
click on console
application click on Go

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:16.350
next select this,
make sure that C++ is

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.903
selected here next
whatever you can name

00:13:19.928 --> 00:13:22.929
your project, I'm
just gonna name my

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:24.905
test for now you can
select the folder

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.781
where you would
like to save your

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.790
project this isn't arbitrary I mean
wherever you save it wherever you want

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.934
it makes the difference
to me, I will be

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:37.250
doing my saves on
desktop because I will

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.475
delete them later on
anyway and go ahead

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.929
and click on Next
you don't need to

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:50.499
change anything here just click on
Finish and you will get your first C++

00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:53.559
project this is a
generic thing that's

00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:56.223
generated by codeblocks,
it can be changed

00:13:56.819 --> 00:13:59.220
main of this is, what
all of this is

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:01.559
how it all works all
of this will be explained

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:06.370
now another key thing
is that if you want to

00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:09.689
like for example delete
a file actually if

00:14:09.789 --> 00:14:12.561
you want to delete
a project, it's a

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:15.269
bit strange you first
need to go ahead

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:20.889
and go into closed project and then go
into the file here wherever I have saved

00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:29.456
that, codeblocks, I
have no idea where I

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:33.249
saved it, let me just
go into properties

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:37.944
test this chapter 4 ok it seems

00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:42.423
to have used a previous folder

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:45.964
yep it's right here,
so look, if you want

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:48.659
to delete this project
you need to first

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:52.724
close the project and
then find it in the

00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:56.970
file system so mine
is here and then

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.218
deleted it, the reason why
you'll see Chapter four

00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:03.599
loops, we're gonna get
to that,t is due to the

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:06.505
fact that I usually
cast at least like

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.089
50% of the course or
something like that

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:11.748
and then I come back
and make the intro

00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:14.389
for the course and set
up I don't know I

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:16.969
just find it easier
that way but hey you

00:15:16.994 --> 00:15:19.499
know many people
and many different

00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:21.369
tastes and ideas

00:15:21.369 --> 00:15:23.459
ok so now that you
have your integrated

00:15:23.484 --> 00:15:25.389
development environment
setup configured

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:28.084
up and running I'm
gonna go ahead and

00:15:28.109 --> 00:15:30.499
bid you farewell
here and hope to see

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:34.470
you in the follow tutorial where we will
actually start coding
