00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial. So, today we're gonna talk a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.335
little bit more about
input and basically

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.980
not import but output
and formatting the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.134
output. So let's go
ahead and take a look

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.420
at a few new concepts
that were gonna go

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.767
over. First of all, you
have oh where's my

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:27.760
mouse? There is. No
there's this new thing on

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.640
Macs were you move your mouse and
apparently it enlarges so if you in case

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.817
you lose your mouse
pointer to screen, you

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:35.799
can actually find
it, I never thought

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.540
I would ever need that but here was a
moment where that would have been

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.762
useful. Anyway let's
go ahead and use STD

00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:49.709
colon colon, cout
and let's use our

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.089
insertion operator
and type in 2000 and

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:59.489
pretty sure its sixteen
yes it is sixteen

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.190
It is because it says
in the bottom right

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.050
the corner. So,
anyway let's go ahead

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
and continue. We're
gonna open up quote

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:15.250
marks, press space,
here, type is today's

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.968
year and we're gonna put
a dot there, and we're

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:22.129
gonna say again we're going
to use the insertion

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.290
operator again and
type STD colon colon

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:30.430
endl now endl means
end line, it adds a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.782
new line after the
output why do we do

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:34.750
this? Well, have a
look and look at this

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.540
but we're just gonna go ahead and copied
his part. I'm really lazy typer so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.633
everything that I can
like copy out like

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:52.780
basically just copy
it and reuse it for

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.741
my own code but maybe
not the best of

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.659
practices for you at
the very beginning.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.974
So, this is today's
month I'm pretty sure

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.899
it is not today's
month in fact I am

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.990
actually certain now that I look at the
date down below but in my notes it is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.819
today's month.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.428
Ok, never gonna do
this again and type

00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:17.730
in std, colon colon,
endl and we need a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.935
semicolon at the end
here and a semicolon

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.040
at the end here, these
are line terminators

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.131
and type in std, colon
colon just type in

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:27.889
cout, I want to get
a full date out of

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:35.700
this so uncertain what day is it today?
sixteen apparently it's 16 I'm very bad with

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.790
time and date etc, I pretty much
have no concept of time or anything like

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.230
that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.875
never understood it really.
Again we shold

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.010
type in the insertion
operator here, std

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.660
endl. So, if we print
this out, each one

00:02:56.685 --> 00:03:01.310
of these lines will
go into a new line,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.948
which might seem very
natural to you, but

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:06.550
let me show you
something, so if I run it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.730
build it and run it to see everything, it has

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.310
2016 is today's year, 3 is today's month and 16th is

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.966
today's date. However,
if I did not have

00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:24.359
endl at the end of
every line, so we can

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.859
just comment about I'll explain the comments in a moment

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:35.539
well not here just place a line
terminator here and // last year

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.230
can do the same thing
here just place

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:44.614
line ending here
and // last year

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.450
Ok, so now let's run
the program, what

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:55.330
is this? 2016 is
today's year, third is

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.252
today's month and 16
is today's day. So,

00:03:59.277 --> 00:04:02.449
the endl at the
bottom doesn't really

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.030
matter but the other ones do, why?

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.539
Well, it doesn't matter that all these
things are in different lines the

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.719
computer doesn't care in fact it
couldn't care less unless you tell it to

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.979
actually print something in the new line
everything's gonna get printed in the

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.380
very same line

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.420
the last endl here, the last endl, it
pretty much just serves to tell you that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.049
whatever comes afterwards
shall be printed

00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:31.480
in today in the new
line, it's pretty much it.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.560
Ok, so let's remove this.
Keep that in mind

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:39.150
the computer doesn't
care how you order

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.950
the computer cares what you tell it and how how you tell it to ordered

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.246
things, how you tell
it to order things

00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:50.800
around. So let's take
a look at another

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.840
example so there are various
modes and methods of formatting this can

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.470
take a look at it on the net as well and
you can ask questions in the course

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.515
itself in the discussion
section there's

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.160
always somebody from
the tech support to

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.950
provide answers for you there but, in
general you can do stuff like this

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.330
you see, it says here see out and
then we can insert something here

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:26.420
std, colon colon, setw. And we can setw to be 5

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.983
positions and let's
go ahead and put

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:34.030
those five positions
in each one of

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.380
these so CTR+C oh actually need to
insertion operator here so we are

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.556
going to effectively
copy this in order

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:53.130
to reuse the code,
space and down here as well

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.580
space. There we go. So, it says here

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580
setw it needs to, this first

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.130
the 2016 in total is going to occupy
five positions so you're gonna see one

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.100
space here in front
here you're gonna

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.110
see four spaces in
front and here again

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.830
and gonna see see three spaces in front when it gets printed out onto the screen so

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.706
let's go ahead and press
CTRL+S to save it

00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:23.330
and then let's build and run it.
It seems

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.570
to be a problem here in this line, well
no big deal

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.945
of course now you see
this is a typical

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.789
error that people
get the forget to

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.559
I don't know, include a certain
library we're gonna go

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:42.469
ahead and include it. Oh
I've forgotten it but it's

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.564
a it's actually
good things but if

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.490
what you might say.
So if you forget

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.360
something it doesn't matter it's gonna
tell you it says error down here in the

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.857
console place it's kind
of dificult to see

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.999
it down here but try
to read these areas

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.706
try to read it where
it says it says is

00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:06.300
not a member of STD
ok well, probably

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.400
because we didn't include the library up
here oh I oh we will get to the

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.419
debugging part where I will go to the
debugging process will be explained in

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.069
great detail what you need to look for,
how you need to read it, how you need to

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.719
read the areas, etc, what
something means, what the, where the air

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.170
so most likely to
be found, what sort

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.469
of errors can you expect, etc.
So we

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.969
will we will deal with that in a
completely separate section but for the

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:35.000
time being, you want to pay a little bit attention down there, I will of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.589
course and largest when we get to that
section type in i/o

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.609
so input-output
manipulate and if we

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:49.950
press CTRL+S and if
we run this again

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.389
you see it's going to
work without any problems

00:07:52.414 --> 00:07:54.469
or whatsoever, so all
that we needed to do

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:58.083
was include a library
and you can see it says

00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:01.839
one space, one position
2016, so 2016 is

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:09.386
four digits and set with was 5.
12345 one more

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:16.980
time 12345 you see
everything is formatted in

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.279
that fashion hopefully get the idea
there are many more ways of formatting

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:26.210
this, in fact the ways
of formatting text

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:28.849
output are infinite
there is no end to

00:08:28.949 --> 00:08:32.780
that, you can manipulated
in so many ways

00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:35.711
it's hilarious but
this is just a basic

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.582
example as we get
into more and more

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:40.340
complex up so we're
just going over some basic things

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.780
as we move along. So,
I'm gonna go ahead

00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:46.420
and bid you farewell
here and then

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.325
we're going to go
ahead and continue In

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.254
the follow up tutorial
of this chapter.
