00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.660
Now that the connection is established between Cloud9 and

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.795
CodeCommit repository, we need to clone the repository and make

3
00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:14.960
the changes. Let's see the steps involved in making changes to the

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.340
CodeCommit repository from Cloud9.

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.440
Once we've successfully cloned the repository,

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.940
it's advisable not to make any changes directly in the master branch.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.889
We'll be creating a separate branch named develop, make code

8
00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:40.460
changes, commit the changes, push the changes, create a pull

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.200
request, and merge the change back to the master.

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.170
I just logged back in to my Cloud9 environment. I'm using git clone to

11
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.280
clone the Globomantics repository that we created before. You can see a new

12
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.780
directory named Globomantics has been created.

13
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.100
Let me switch to this directory, and you can see the branch name is

14
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:19.040
master, and it has one file named file1.txt. Before making changes, let's

15
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.160
create a separate branch named develop and check out this branch. Let's

16
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.910
run a git status and make sure that we're currently getting the files

17
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:43.160
under develop branch. Open file1.txt, perform some changes, and save and

18
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.800
exit. Let me run git status again, and it shows the uncommitted changes

19
00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:01.010
to file1.txt. Let's use git add to add the changes to the local branch.

20
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.150
Git commit commits the changes to the local branch with a brief

21
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.930
discussion. To provide a name and the email address to the commit user,

22
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.120
you can use a git config and add these settings.

23
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.820
Now that the changes are committed,

24
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:26.340
let's push the changes from our local branch to the remote develop branch.

25
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.702
Let me log in back to CodeCommit repository, click on

26
00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:39.440
Globomantics, click on file1.txt.

27
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.880
You can see that the master branch code has no changes.

28
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.960
Let's switch to develop branch, and you can see that the develop

29
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.023
branch has the changes that we performed in our Cloud9

30
00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:57.440
environment. In order to merge the changes,

31
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.210
let's create a pull request.

32
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:09.240
Give the pull request a title, and click on Create pull request.

33
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.940
Click on Commit, and you can see the commit that we performed a few minutes back.

34
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.040
Since there are no merge conflicts,

35
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.830
click on the Merge button, choose a merge strategy, and click on

36
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.810
Merge pull request. Click on Code, file1.txt.

37
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.540
Now you can see the changes that we performed in the develop branch

38
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430
have been successfully merged to master branch.

39
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.990
Let's quickly recap what we learned so far.

40
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.595
We saw the features and benefits that are offered by AWS Cloud9.

41
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:59.760
We saw the policies that are needed by a specific user in order to

42
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.740
create an environment in AWS Cloud9.

43
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.940
Later,

44
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.520
you saw the various settings and how to share an environment with other users

45
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.590
so that you can collaborate with other users by providing them either

46
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.440
read‑only or read‑write access to your environment.

47
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.880
Then we explored how to integrate CodeCommit on

48
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.840
Cloud9 and cloned the repository,

49
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:39.000
created a branch, performed changes, pushed the change, and merged the changes back to the master branch.
