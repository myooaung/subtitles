00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.080
So far we have seen the data passing through attributes here in the HTML.

2
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.930
The product card component has attributes which are getting passed to the component.

3
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.470
But what if you pass the data inside the tag like here in the product?

4
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.910
I want some content to be passed, let's say an H1 I want to pass and that too with some data.

5
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.650
For example, I want this H1 to be the title for each component.

6
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.110
I'm going to say Apple component.

7
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.840
Let me also copy this H1 and paste for individual product.

8
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.640
Now here instead of Apple, I'm going to say orange grapes and banana.

9
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.630
Let's save this and check the output.

10
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.000
I'll just refresh.

11
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.880
This will come on the same line later on.

12
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.220
Let's open the developer tool.

13
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.500
Now, if I expand the individual product card here, the H1, which you see is part of the actual DOM.

14
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.390
That is the light Dom.

15
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.550
So here we have two terms Light Dome and Shadow Dome.

16
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260
Why it is Light Dome?

17
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020
Just to segregate it from the Shadow Dome.

18
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.390
We call the actual dome as light dome as well.

19
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.940
Now this one is part of the DOM and it is not passed to the shadow dom.

20
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.070
We want that.

21
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.150
We want to pass this H1 as a content of the product element, custom html element.

22
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.510
Let's try that with the slot element.

23
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.800
Here.

24
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.400
We have to use the slot to pass the content of the custom element.

25
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:06.840
So here with H1, I will say slot attribute is equal to for example, I say product title, that is

26
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.830
P title.

27
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.310
Now let's copy this and paste for rest of the H1 as well.

28
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.650
Once we have given this slot attribute here, the same attribute we have to read with the help of slot

29
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.890
element inside the component code.

30
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.550
So let's go to product card or JS and here.

31
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.170
For example, I want the title to be displayed before the image that is as a title of the component.

32
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.150
So here I'm going to create a division.

33
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.740
And here I'll say slot.

34
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.350
This am writing is an HTML element.

35
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:59.890
So let me also end this slot here and then inside this I'm going to give a name is equal to B title.

36
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:11.110
So the H1, which has B title with slot attribute, that particular element will be placed wherever

37
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.160
you write this slot element.

38
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.820
If I write this slot, let's say after buttons, then the title will be displayed after buttons.

39
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.980
But we wanted before the image.

40
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.250
Let's save this and check the output one more time.

41
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.650
And now you can see that every component has the title Apple Component, Orange Component, Grapes and

42
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.510
Banana, respectively.

43
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.960
So with the product card HTML element, we are able to pass the content as well.

44
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.080
It means instead of this single etch one inside the product card, you may have, let's say, submenu

45
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.710
items with title, maybe UL and whatnot.

46
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.760
Now let's talk about relative questions.

47
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.740
So what is light down?

48
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.810
So as I mentioned, light dome is the actual dome.

49
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.340
Only whenever there is a concept of Shadow Dome with web components, we need to segregate the actual

50
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.050
dome from the Shadow Dome.

51
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.850
So actual dome is referred to as the light dome in that case.

52
00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.750
The second question is how can you manage our display the content placed inside the custom HTML element?

53
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.960
So like in our case, we tried to add an H1.

54
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.910
We may have divisions, paragraphs and whatnot inside this product card customised HTML element.

55
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.220
When we want to display that, when we want that it should act as normal html, then we have to use

56
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.400
the slot attribute and the slot HTML element as well to implement it.
