00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,070
This section has an important question.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,780
What is the difference between window and document object?

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,520
The category of this question is DOM and web related question.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,440
And we will have around 6 to 7 related questions which are connected with this topic.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's begin the answer.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,270
If you want to quickly visualize window and document, then let me show you.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,220
With the help of browser.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,020
Now, as you see that the entire browser window is actually window object and the inner part where the

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,350
content is displayed, all the content can be accessed using the document object.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,410
This also means that window is the main container or patterned or global object and document is child

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,270
of window object operations related to entire browser.

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,840
Window can be part of window object, like opening a new window for that matter.

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,750
Alexi Accessing this address bar.

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,750
Let's I want to see what is the value inside this address bar.

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,140
So this is beyond document, but under window.

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,260
Let's try to see the content of both the objects in console of developer tool.

17
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,180
Let me expand the window object.

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,290
You see that there are various values we have underpin the object actually we have various events,

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,250
various objects.

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,470
Document is also an object of windows, so let's try to refer the document as well.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,130
Now you see that the moment I type document, the document section is automatically highlighted.

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,030
And if we expand this document object that also has that HTML and various other things.

23
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,130
The way I have type document, I can also say window dot document.

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:09,600
That's also a valid way to refer the document object, but because window is a global object and document

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,640
is child of it, we do not need to say window to document all the time.

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,990
All the members meet object method are properties.

27
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,500
If they are part of window object then you do not need to refer the window object again because window

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,940
is a global object like for example, set interval or for that matter set time method.

29
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,880
All these methods are part of window object.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,240
So ideally you would write a window, not set interval or window not set time out.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,980
Then it is not wrong.

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,350
But because window is global, you avoid using the window term all the times.

33
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:58,530
Rather you use set interval are set time out directly, so set interval or set timeout etc. are methods

34
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,970
of window, whereas document is an object of window.

35
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,000
Of course, further document object does have various other objects.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,650
Methods are properties as well like document or get element by ID.

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,390
So get element by id is part of the document object.

38
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,800
Window object also has properties like inner height or inner weight.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,690
Let's try it practically.

40
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,100
To see this, let's say or log window, not inner height.

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,070
And now, just to prove that that innervate is part of window, I do not need it.

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,490
I will write Innervate without the window object.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,140
Let's try to run this.

44
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,750
So display some value.

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,480
That is the height and width of the browser window.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,770
Now let's run the same code by resizing the browser window.

47
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,320
As you see that it displays the current inner height and weight of a window in pixels.

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,300
So these types of settings, the window object has let's try a few more properties of window like location.

49
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,080
I'll say cancel or log window that location.

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,839
Now when I run this, you see that it displays the object literal, which has various values like hostname,

51
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,640
adjective and other values.

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,820
Also, let's try to refer only the adjective.

53
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,550
Now I will not write window, not location.

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,630
I will simply say console or log location, not adjective.

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,830
Let's run the code.

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,330
Now you see that the atrophy is displayed separately.

57
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,900
In fact, there are few terms which are related to this concept, like Dom and the Bomb.

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,990
Dom is document object, model and bomb is the browser object model.

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,760
We can think of bomb and dom as shown in the figure.

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:06,670
So the window has various objects like location, screen, navigator, frames, history, etc. so all

61
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,550
related information to these things, if you have to use it, is the window object which gives you the

62
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,730
access to it like we have already seen window location.

63
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:23,830
But when it comes to elements placed inside of the HTML, all the elements are part of the DOM.

64
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,010
That is the page which you see inside the HTML.

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,000
So if you want to access that, you will say document dart.

66
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,140
The member name of course, window is the main umbrella where all other elements are part of it, but

67
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,110
that is a classification for each and every segment displayed inside the browser window.

68
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,000
So when you refer the term bomb, that means it is the browser object model.

69
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,560
It means it has objects like these, and DOM allows you to access entire content which is played by

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,060
HDMI links.

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,880
So now you know both window and document object and it's usage as well.

72
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:10,780
Let's discuss different ways of asking this question are related questions to this topic.

73
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,610
The question can be Is there any difference between window and document?

74
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,830
So we have already discussed this.

75
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,640
The next question, what is Dom or what is DOM API?

76
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,060
So the answer can be it is the document object model.

77
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,750
That means the browser is giving you the document object, which helps you to access the elements through

78
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,620
JavaScript.

79
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,410
It is also referred to as the DOM API.

80
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,670
Next question is what is BOM?

81
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,140
That is browser object model.

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,610
So it is basically giving you a few objects related to window and using that we access location, history,

83
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,120
screen the height and width of window, etc..

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,560
So bom actually refers to the window elements only.

85
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,880
The next question can be explained.

86
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,980
The difference between dormant bomb.

87
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,450
So you already know now.

88
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,610
Next question, which is a global object in the browser.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,140
So the answer is window is the global object in the browser.

90
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,270
Next question.

91
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,540
How will we check the inner weight or inner height of a window so you can see window, not inner height,

92
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,170
ordinary weight.

93
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,450
Next question.

94
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,670
How will you get hostname or value typed in the address bar?

95
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,220
Again, you use window dot location and the related properties to have access to it.

96
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,560
So that's on for this topic.
