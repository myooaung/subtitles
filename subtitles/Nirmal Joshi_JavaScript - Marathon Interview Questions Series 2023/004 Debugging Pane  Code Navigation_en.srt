00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,360
In this section, we will learn how to navigate through the code while debugging using the debugging

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,260
pane tools.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,610
The category is debugging techniques and this itself is a question that how to navigate through the

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,440
code at the time of debugging.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:25,490
While remaining inside the sources panel and debugging the code is made convenient using these navigation

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,030
tools.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,260
Inside the debugging pane, let us practically implement them.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,530
Let me provide the values and click on the button.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,630
Once the debugger has paused, you can start navigating throughout the functions and code to resume

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,620
the execution.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,720
Click on this resume script execution icon and it will continue execution until it encounters any other

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,220
breakpoint, if at all.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,030
You have given it.

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,730
When the debugger has paused on a particular region of code.

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:07,310
And if it seems bug free and you skip that and jump to the next function, then click this step over

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,410
the next function call option.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,600
It will navigate like this.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:12,960
Let's.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,310
There is a breakpoint on this line and I run the code.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,950
The debugger pauses, and when you click on this icon that is to step inside the next function, it

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,710
will jump into the next one like this.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,100
If you want the debugger to leave or step out of the current function, then click this icon.

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,070
In case you want to debug the code step by step and monitor the code flow.

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,780
Press this step option which will navigate line by line code.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,840
Then there are various break points in the code and you want to deactivate them all at once.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,010
Then click this deactivate all breakpoints option.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,370
Observe here when you deactivate them and let me resume the execution.

28
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,560
And when I click on the button now, the debugger does not pause.

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,440
So the breakpoints are deactivated.

30
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,110
This is how you can navigate code and debug in the browser itself.

31
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,330
In the forthcoming sections we will learn debugging with different types of breakpoints.
