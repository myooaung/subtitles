1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,350
The next method we are discussing is the match method.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:18,840
Match method returns an array containing matched value all matching values in an array if slash g modifier

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,560
is given.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,220
And null if that is no match.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:32,759
The syntax is we apply the match method on the string and we give the pattern in the brackets of match

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,560
method as a parameter.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's try it practically.

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,280
I will again have the same string.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,930
The pattern I'm using here is the word is, which we want to find.

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,530
Let's try to call the match method with console.log.

11
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,040
And run the code.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,230
So at the moment there is only one word found in the output.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,110
In spite of more is word existing in the STR variable.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,980
And the reason is we have not given the g modifier.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,170
So let's add and see the output.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,110
Now we have all the words in the output.

17
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,690
Let's change the pattern from is to is and see the result.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,050
So now the output is null because there is no match.

19
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,860
So we have seen that if there is one match found, then it returns this way.

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,310
If there were more than one matches, then it returns the error.

21
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:56,740
If the error with all the words matched and it returns null in this case where there is no match found

22
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,110
like the match method, we do also have match all method.

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,110
This method is an improved new version of match method.

24
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,130
It returns an iterator of all matching results.

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,040
Let's see the syntax we give the string then match all.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,380
And here in the parentheses we give the pattern.

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,550
Let's try to apply match all practically to get a better understanding.

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,080
First, we will try to use this method with one of the simple codes we used with match method.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,500
I'll declare the string variable.

30
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,160
Of course, I'm trying to find the word is with global modifier and I'll say match all.

31
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,240
Now you see that in the output we have regular expression iterator returned.

32
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,960
You can expand this iterator object and check the details, but we will try to make it more simple.

33
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,860
Let's take an iterator object and try to put the for off loop to see the output in a better way.

34
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,070
So we are keeping the first two lines of the code as it is.

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,230
Now I'm going to say const I object, which is an object is equal to string, dot match all.

36
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,990
And here I'm passing the pattern.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,570
This returns and iterable object.

38
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:29,040
So I object becomes an object which has various items return by the match all method.

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,550
So I'll say for loop item off.

40
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,600
I object and I'll try to display each and every item.

41
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,640
Now you can see that each item contains the array, which has found word index and other details.

42
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:57,630
This also means we can use item and get the word or index separately as well.

43
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,950
Let's try to display words along with index value using the return iterator object.

44
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,920
So in this far loop I'll say console.log.

45
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,570
We already have an item which is an array.

46
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,050
So I'll say the zeroth element, which is the word itself.

47
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:21,390
I'm going to join it with a string, a constant that is found at now because it has an index number.

48
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,310
I'll say item or index.

49
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,780
Let's run the code now.

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,040
Now you see that we have the desired output in a more appropriate manner.

51
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:42,740
Match All is a newer and improved way of match method and may not work in all the browsers as it is

52
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,300
not working in all the browsers at the time of creating this tutorial.
