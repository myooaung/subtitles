00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,010
In this section, I'm going to discuss two methods which help you to convert the case.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,270
That is, you can convert from lower to upper or upper to lower case.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,600
There will be one related question regarding these matters.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,270
The syntax of these two matters are.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,970
These methods are very useful when you are comparing strings.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,300
Let's take an example of both the methods.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm going to declare a string here and say let str is equal to test.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,880
Now I'm going to say console.log because both the method that is to uppercase and to lowercase return

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,830
a new string.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,280
So I'll say str dot that is the string variable dot to.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,310
Uppercase.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,640
And to lower case and say lower case.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,720
So when I run this.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,160
You'll see that in the first case the entire string is converted into uppercase, whereas in the second

15
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,350
it is converted into lowercase.

16
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,680
The main advantage of using these methods is when you are comparing a value.

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,460
It's always good to have uppercase or lowercase.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,440
For example, I just want to compare if the value SDR is test or not.

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,340
Now in the condition I'm writing it in lowercase.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,090
Now the user may enter this test value in any case, but you just want to make sure that when you have

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,820
fixed a value like lowercase this way and you want to avoid the case sensitivity.

22
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,630
Simple is that you convert the string into lowercase.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,360
Now before I convert, let me just run this.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,570
I'll say equal to the strict equality that is.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,230
Or rather I'll write console.log here.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,910
I'll say string is equal to test that that will return true or false.

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,160
So let me run this.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,040
Now you see that it says it is false.

29
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,039
Now you want to implement this into case insensitive condition checking.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,140
So I'll say to lower case.

31
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,850
Now, regardless of what the value is inside the SDR, it's going to return the true because to lower

32
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,370
case is converting the value in lower case.

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,030
And here you have even the lower case value only.

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,310
You can do the reverse way as well.

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,670
I can say test here and here.

36
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,970
I simply convert into uppercase.

37
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,640
This will also give me the true result.

38
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,650
Let me change the values so you can see that the value is not matching.

39
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,310
It will return the funds.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,470
So this is the purpose of using two upper and lower case.

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,850
There is also one more method replace method which is used to replace the character or substring, but

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,760
it also returns the new string only.

43
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,730
The replace method is wonderful method to find and replace a value.

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,480
It can take a regular expression or a substring to understand how it works with regular expression.

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,420
You can check my regular expression tutorial.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,710
There is a lecture on replace method which explains the regular expression and replace method in detail.

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,860
So right now I am not discussing those things here, but certainly I am going to show you one simple

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,580
example that it shows how we can replace a string so it automatically finds and replaces the value.

49
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,120
Say.

50
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,140
For example, I just want to say console.log.

51
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,980
And here I'll start out replace.

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,310
That string I want to find is, let's say, 23.

53
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,880
And I want to replace it with exclamation.

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,070
Let me run this.

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll clear the console and run it.

56
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,420
Now you see that T3 is replaced by an exclamation.

57
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,930
So this is a very useful method when you want to find and replace values in a string, but certainly

58
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,260
it is extensively used with regular expression.

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,330
We have only one question here, and the question is get a character from the user and check whether

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,880
the character is a vowel or consonant.

61
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,720
This is one of the example where we can use to lower our to upper to avoid the case sensitivity.

62
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,430
This is how the program will be.

63
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,630
When we run the program, it will ask users to enter a character.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,130
Let's say the user enters EA, then there is a message displayed that is a vowel.

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,200
If a user enters are, then the output will be r is a consonant.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,940
Same goes for all vowels or consonants.

67
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,000
We'll take a variable and will have a function to get the value.

68
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,320
We'll have the prompt statement to get the character.

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,530
Now we are going to put an if condition.

70
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:27,380
Variable switch, we are going to check whether it is e e I or you.

71
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,830
Then we print c is vowel.

72
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,660
Otherwise it's consonant.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,450
So now let's try the lowercase values.

74
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,900
So as you can see, let's enter a.

75
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,560
It says it is Volvo.

76
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,630
Let's enter you.

77
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,810
It says it is Volvo.

78
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,370
Let's enter via.

79
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,720
It says it's a concern.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,110
Now, these values which we have entered so far are small cases.

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,790
That is lower cases.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,960
Let's try to enter a value capital a.

83
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,710
Now it's this consonant.

84
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,580
Now let's try to apply the lowercase logic here.

85
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:35,410
So after the input of character, I will convert the character into lowercase.

86
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:43,300
So now let's try see it not to lowercase to convert the value into lowercase.

87
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:53,800
Now let's run the code again and we will try to enter capital E that says it's available.

88
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,420
So this is a basic logic to convert the value into lowercase because you are checking lowercase in if

89
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,050
condition.

90
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,440
If you can write capital in if condition or capital values, uppercase values that is, then you can

91
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,940
convert it into uppercase.

92
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,530
That's the whole idea behind keeping the single condition and converting the value smartly in respective

93
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,070
cases.
