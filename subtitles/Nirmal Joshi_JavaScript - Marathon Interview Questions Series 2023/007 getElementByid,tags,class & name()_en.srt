00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,740
This section is about getting the reference or searching the elements using the get element by I.D,

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,770
by tags, by class or by name method.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,570
This topic is of dumb and web category, and there will be three related questions of this topic.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,870
We have already discussed that what is dumb and how the nodes are placed inside the dome.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:30,170
Now, when do you think that you have to search or get the reference of a specific element?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,790
Let's take an example.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,420
We have this each one here, which is showing content when page loaded message and there is a button.

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,660
Now let's say I want that when I click on the button, I want to change the content of this action.

9
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,950
That means you need to get the handle of this action to get the handle of this particular element.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,880
We have to give you an idea and then we can get the reference.

11
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,410
Let's try this example.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,060
I have the code ready here.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,420
First thing is that I'm going to give some identification to this age when, let's say you may be C

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:06,840
and D.

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,680
Now when the button is clicked.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,310
I have already configured a function called BTN plugged.

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,790
So on click I want to call this function called.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,890
BTN clicked.

19
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,210
Now, when you want to change the content of this one.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,290
It means you need to get the reference off it.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,460
Then only you can change it.

22
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,370
So let's take an example here.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,130
That is an object called document, which we have discussed in few of our previous sections.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,600
The document object has a method called get element by ID.

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,550
So this says that it is going to get the element by ID.

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,120
So the issuance I.D. is right now.

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,410
See, and this I'm going to say CND now H1 is an element which has a content.

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,700
So that is a property called enriched DML, which we can use.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,110
Let's say I want to change the content that is content after button clicked.

30
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,280
Let's go back to the browser.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,750
I'll just refresh.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,030
And now when I click on this, you can see that the content is changed.

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,230
So the get element by IED is one of the material which you can use to get a specific element.

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,240
Only remember that in fact the same code can be redone in one more way.

35
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,800
Let's try that also.

36
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,720
What I can do is I can create a variable saying C and D, for example.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,550
This is a kind of element.

38
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,610
So I will say a CND element, right?

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,690
That equals two.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,250
I'm going to.

41
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,870
Just shift this thing.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,220
And keep it on the separate line.

43
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, this C.R.A. element has a reference of this entire element.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,550
It means that now I can say that, see, and the element that generates HTML equals to the value.

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,870
Let's try this now.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,790
See the output is still the same.

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:17,500
In the previous way, we tried this statement that this document our get element by it directly, whereas

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,230
here now we are using the object.

49
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,760
This object can further be used to represent this entire element.

50
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,110
You must remember that whenever this document or get element by idea method is used, it is used to

51
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,060
get the reference directly.

52
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:40,450
So the get element by ID is something which gets a reference off a particular element.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,160
There are also other methods which can be used to get references.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,190
Let me change this code and then we will discuss.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,640
Now this page has a division three paragraphs, two edge trees and a button as well.

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,740
Let us, first of all, check the output.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
So here is the output.

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,740
We have the paragraphs and the trees here.

59
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,880
Now let's try a few more matters to get a reference.

60
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:16,640
Now on a click of a button, I'm seeing concert elements is a call to document art, get elements by

61
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,480
tag name.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,459
Remember here, elements is plural.

63
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,610
So there are multiple values can be returned.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,650
Let's say I will write be here.

65
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:33,140
That means the tag paragraph, whichever paragraph it finds in this document that we want inside this

66
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,770
elements.

67
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,780
So naturally, because there are multiple values, it's going to return and add it.

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,950
And that added we are going to display so I'll say console.log elements.

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,180
I'll just refresh the page and clicking the button.

70
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,850
So here you see that we have three paragraph references returned.

71
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:02,100
So in case if you want to refer to the first paragraph, you can see elements of zero which will refer

72
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,790
to this element.

73
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,580
So this is the kind of matter which searches the elements by the tag name.

74
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,370
Similarly, we have a matter which searches by the last name as well.

75
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,100
Right.

76
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,870
So instead of by tag name, if I just say class name here.

77
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,890
Right.

78
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,030
But then we need to give the CSIS glasses.

79
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,120
So let's try with each three.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm going to say class is equal to maybe eight and the same I will apply for, let's say, the other

81
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,260
paragraph.

82
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,740
Also here, I'm going to say class is equal to E, so all the elements which have the class name E,

83
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,760
those classes will be returned in two elements.

84
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,230
Let's write this also.

85
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,050
And just click on this.

86
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,100
So now you'll see that we have Dart and Edge three Dart.

87
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,890
So now we have reference of a paragraph and H3 like last name.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,810
We do also have only name that is elements by name.

89
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,360
So in case if you have given the name property, let's say here the name attribute, I mean, let's

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,860
say the name attribute, I say name is equal to better.

91
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,890
That is paragraph.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,340
And this also, I guess you name is equal to.

93
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:16,890
Better.

94
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,550
Most of the time you will see that the same name creates a group.

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,990
I'll just ship this here.

96
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,300
The same name you see with radio buttons more often.

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,420
But here also, we can try this.

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,770
Now we start off air.

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm going to say baton here.

100
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,550
So whichever element has the name Para will be returned.

101
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,360
As the output.

102
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,310
So there are two paragraphs which are having the same name.

103
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,100
So now we have seen that we have a get element by ID, get elements by tag name.

104
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:57,020
Get elements by class name and get elements by name method to find the element.

105
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,830
References.

106
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,150
Get element by ID is a kind of method which can only work with the document object.

107
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,680
You cannot say element dot and then get element by it.

108
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,050
Let's try this division here.

109
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,330
I'll say division is equal to I.D., for example, test.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,160
So this is a test.

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,910
Division instead of document, you can have reference of that division only say for example, I'll get

112
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:36,020
const test division is equal to document dot get element by ID and you give the test here.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,160
So now the T2 is the reference of this entire division.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,710
Now what you can do, you can see, for example, let's say I change this method, I'll say get elements

115
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,270
by tag name, let's do that and I want to search for all the paragraphs.

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,630
Now, if you write this, it means it is going to search for all the paragraphs in a document.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,840
Assume that you have one more division here, which again has one more paragraph.

118
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,400
Right.

119
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:03,950
This is a.

120
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,300
Next Division paragraph, for example.

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,320
Let's try this.

122
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,010
First of all, I'll just save this and refresh.

123
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,630
Now how many paragraphs you have?

124
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,210
You have the three paragraphs of the first division, right?

125
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,110
And the fourth paragraph of the next division.

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,470
We have four elements that are done by this method.

127
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,460
Now, instead of document, I'll just say T do, d do, which represents the first division.

128
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,100
So in this case, what will happen if I refresh and click on this?

129
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,240
Now it represents only three paragraphs.

130
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,480
The reason is we have applied the method on element.

131
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,150
So you can always have element art.

132
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:58,270
That means in this case D do, but the element which are element you have that dot the get elements

133
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,420
by tag name by class name or even by name.

134
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,380
Matter though by name doesn't make much sense, but get element by ID is a kind of method which is always

135
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,120
applied with documents.

136
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,380
So you are always going to write like this document out get element by 80.

137
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,280
If you write element dot get element by ID, it is invalid.

138
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,650
So these are a few get element by that is tag class or even IED and name.

139
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,430
These matters help you to get references of the elements from a document.

140
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,430
The reason behind getting a reference is because like we tried to change the content of iTunes.

141
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,210
So from JavaScript, when you are trying to change something inside the JavaScript section, you need

142
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:50,300
to have reference of those HTML elements, and that's where these methods are useful.

143
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,720
Now let's discuss relative questions of this topic.

144
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:03,320
The first question is can you use document dot, get element by ID and element dot get element by I.D.

145
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,640
The get element by ID with document is possible, but with element it's not possible because the searching

146
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,270
of element by ID is always for the entire document and not for a specific region.

147
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,230
The second question is what does the get elements?

148
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,280
My tag name return the get elements buy tag name returns the array of elements.

149
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,970
Like this.

150
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,830
We tried the example and it return all the paragraphs of the document.

151
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,960
The third question is what is the difference between get elements by blast name and get elements by

152
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,830
name?

153
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,980
So the class name and name are different methods.

154

The class name refers to the class of an element, whereas the elements by name refers to the name which

155
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,710
is given to the element.

156
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:03,400
Remember, never get confused with ID and name because name can be a duplicate value.

157
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,120
But in case of ID, you should never keep a duplicate I.D..
