00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:08.010
In this session, I'm discussing about the class excesses that is getter and setter methods.

2
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.790
This itself is a question that what is a getter or setter method?

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:21.010
So the accessories, also known as getter or setter methods, is an approach to create a property to

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.850
a class.

5
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.180
The gate and set keywords are used to create a method which acts as a property.

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:38.080
The getter method is executed when you read or get the value and the setter method is executed when

7
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.630
you assign a value to that property.

8
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.300
Let's have a look at the basic syntax.

9
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.720
First, let me create a class vehicle.

10
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.970
Now here I will say get, which is a keyword.

11
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.280
Then I'm going to use the method that is, for example, model, which will be actually a property.

12
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.910
Now let me just say console.log and I will display a message saying Getter executed.

13
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.290
Now there will always be a return statement inside the getter method.

14
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.430
So I'll say return.

15
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.090
And at the moment I don't return anything, just a string.

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.090
Now let me also have the setter method.

17
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.950
I'll set model.

18
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.430
Now there will be a parameter, so I'll say V.

19
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.190
And here I will try to just display setter executed message.

20
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.230
Now let's try to create the instance of vehicle class.

21
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.960
So I'll say const objects equal to new vehicle.

22
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.410
Now just observe this.

23
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.040
I'm going to assign value to the model property.

24
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.750
So I'll say object model is equal to SUV.

25
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.330
So model is treated as a property because it is placed as getter and setter method.

26
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.540
Now let's display the value of model.

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.570
So I'll say console.log object model.

28
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.050
Let's run the code.

29
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.530
As you can see that when I try to assign value, the setter method is executed and when I console.log,

30
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.390
that is, I try to read the value.

31
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.630
The getter method is executed.

32
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.430
Normally this way is very useful when you want to customize properties or implement validations.

33
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.670
If you keep only the getter method, it means you create a read only property.

34
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.060
Let's try a more practical approach.

35
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.460
I'm going to define a private member in the class saying underscore model.

36
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.050
This is generally the normal naming convention we follow when we implement the getter or setter method.

37
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.430
Inside the getter method.

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.990
I'm going to just say return this star underscore model.

39
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.370
And here in this set, for example, I want to put a validation that whenever the value is assigned,

40
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.880
if the length of the value is less than three, then I want to add M at the beginning.

41
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.730
Otherwise I want to keep the value intact.

42
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.070
So I'm going to say if v length is less than three, then this START model is equal to M plus v.

43
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.810
Else I'll keep this model is equal to we.

44
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.990
Let's run the code.

45
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.740
So now it is saying sorry.

46
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.860
Now let's try to remove this value as so it is less than three.

47
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.780
Let's see what happens.

48
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.210
You can see that it adds an m at the beginning.

49
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.590
It says movie.

50
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.670
So this is just a sample validation, which we have tried.

51
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.960
You can do a lot more with setter and getter methods.
