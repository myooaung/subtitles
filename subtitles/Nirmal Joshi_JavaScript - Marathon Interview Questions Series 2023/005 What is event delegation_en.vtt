00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.960
We have seen capturing and bubbling in previous question.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.940
This section we are discussing a further, more important concept.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.030
That is, what is event delegation?

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.930
This again is a category of DOM and web related question, and there will be three related questions

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.100
with this topic.

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.840
So in previous question, we have seen bubbling and capturing.

7
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.370
By default, the events bubble up.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.590
It means that when an event is triggered on an element, the same event is also triggered for the elements

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.520
ancestors.

10
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.080
This very behaviour allows one excellent event handler pardon guard event delegation.

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.050
The benefit of this behaviour is realised when you have multiple deep level elements and let's say on

12
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.800
the deepest level, when an event is fired and you want to handle at a top level, for example, you

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.630
have a table of 1000 rows and let's say 15 columns and you want to handle some common execution or common

14
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.320
job on click of each cell to execute.

15
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.120
Can you even think about giving click event handler to each cell?

16
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.520
The answer is absolutely no.

17
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.760
I guess now you can understand why this event delegation is so useful.

18
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.920
Let's try this practically.

19
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.630
Here I have created a table which has three rows and I had a row as well and we are showing some data.

20
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530
Imagine that we want to deal with every tree.

21
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.020
Click.

22
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.420
Now that is where the problem starts.

23
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.930
If you try to handle the event for and click of beauty, then it becomes really very difficult.

24
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:58.060
In such cases, if I handle the event on table, for example, then because it is going to bubble on

25
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.950
every tree click, we will be able to execute this function because the event is always going to be

26
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.650
fired whenever a tree is clicked because the events are getting a bubble.

27
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.050
So now this is going to be the output.

28
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.570
Imagine that we just want to deal with this particular deal.

29
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.090
Let's say when I click on this file, it should give me the information that which element is clicked.

30
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.410
How will we do that?

31
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.860
That's where the event object helps you a lot.

32
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.420
Let's try a few things here.

33
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.910
First of all, I have written a main click function on table on click.

34
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.710
So this function is going to be called every time any cell is clicked.

35
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.170
So here's how we make sure that when data is clicked, I want to do something.

36
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.000
In such cases you can use the event dart target property.

37
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.400
Let me write that here.

38
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.350
Event dart target.

39
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.770
Not only this, I will also display event or target dart Dagny.

40
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.670
Now this Dagny property gives you the information that which element is clicked.

41
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.530
Let's say you clicked on.

42
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.220
You clicked on D edge.

43
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.420
You clicked on button.

44
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.640
You clicked on input.

45
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.250
All the elements which you click.

46
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.110
If you want to get the type of element, you can use the tag name.

47
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.970
So I'm saving this file and let's say I click on any of the cell.

48
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.620
If you observe the console because we have tried console log event, our target is displaying this value

49
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.500
and the target date tag name displays Didi.

50
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.170
That is the type of element.

51
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.060
So now you can understand that no matter how many elements you have.

52
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.750
But if you have this bubbling, then it's really easy to handle the deepest level event in the most

53
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.560
easiest way.

54
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.210
Let's say when click of sale, you want that the value you need to refer.

55
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.330
So you always have this value separately as well.

56
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.950
Let's say I just want to refer the value of the cell so I can see event or target dart because it is

57
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.620
an element.

58
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.200
I will say in RHD Yemen.

59
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.870
This will give me only the value.

60
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.180
Dollar ten banana.

61
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.690
1002 earlier it was showing us the HDMI element itself.

62
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.210
It was a complete HDMI element reference because we wrote event dot target.

63
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.680
But here now we are writing even our target dot inner HDMI.

64
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.580
Imagine that a cell of a table has input.

65
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.830
For example, here in the last cell, I want to have an input box.

66
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.640
Let's try.

67
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.900
That type is equal to text and I'm going to end it here.

68
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.700
Let's try the output here.

69
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.990
I click on this text box.

70
00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.560
Now if you observe, the first console.log is not giving any output because it is inner HDMI.

71
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.430
Here if I click on any other cell, it does give me the output, but the moment I click here in the

72
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.920
text box, it has stopped working.

73
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.570
It doesn't show any value.

74
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.200
Now, even if I type here and click then also we are not able to refer the value.

75
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.880
The reason is that inner HDMI will not work with input elements because it is not the content of the

76
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.300
element.

77
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.270
So here we have to type the value.

78
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.340
Now I will refresh.

79
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.460
Click here.

80
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.340
Of course, because there is no value, there won't be any output.

81
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.780
But now if I click here, you see that the value entered in the cell is now referred and the tag name

82
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.410
is input.

83
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.340
Now if I click on TV here, that will show me undefined because that is no such thing for an HTML element

84
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.400
called value because it has enriched Yemen.

85
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.510
Now how will you deal with this?

86
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.830
Let's say every time a cell is clicked, you want the value.

87
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.160
Then you will check whether it is an HDMI element.

88
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.350
Like in this case we can see if it is.

89
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.710
The tag name is D.D. then display the value.

90
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.820
Here you can see.

91
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.170
If this tag name is Steely, then you want to display the value.

92
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:24.600
In this case, we can directly say enriched DML here because it is d d otherwise will display the value.

93
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.740
That's it.

94
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.420
Refreshing the screen.

95
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.470
Click here.

96
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.810
This value is also getting displayed.

97
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.990
And here also you'll be able to refer the value.

98
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.640
So the advantage of bubbling or capturing can be handled in such situations.

99
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.520
Let's discuss related questions of this topic.

100
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.000
First question how event babbling or capturing is useful in practical programming world?

101
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.850
We have already seen you can discuss this scenario that when you have deep level elements and you want

102
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.280
to handle at the top level, then you can use this bubbling or capturing.

103
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.100
When I say deep level, that applies to babbling.

104
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.150
But there can be a reverse scenario, but you can use capturing that on top element.

105
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.320
Something is executed.

106
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.400
It should go till the end.

107
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.680
So that is also possible with capturing.

108
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.800
Second question which property can be used to check the element type on which the event is triggered?

109
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:28.190
So we have seen that if we want to check the element type, we do use the tag name, event or target

110
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.390
date tag name.

111
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.980
That will be the property.

112
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.910
Third question how can you get value of the element which raised the event?

113
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.220
So here we tried event or target date value or event or target not enriched.

114
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.950
It depends what type of element it is.

115
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.830
Depending on that, you use the property to get the value of the element which actually raised the event.
