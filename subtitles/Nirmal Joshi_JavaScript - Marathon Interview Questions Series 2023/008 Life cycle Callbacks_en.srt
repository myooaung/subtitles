00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:15,880
Before I talk about events with a web component, it's essential to know the concept of life cycle methods

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,440
or callbacks.

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:25,420
As we have seen the constructor method getting called automatically when the component is initialized.

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:33,910
There are other methods getting called automatically on different phases of a web component if you give

5
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,360
them.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:43,300
In fact, when I say lifecycle of a component, it means from components initialization.

7
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,780
Attaching to Dom.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,910
Modification in between.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,690
Til it gets removed from the dom.

10
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,610
When the component is initialized, the constructor method is invoked.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,800
Next step component gets attached to the documents.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,540
Dom and at that time the connected callback is invoked.

13
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:17,970
When the custom element is disconnected from the documents Dom, the disconnected callback is invoked

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,310
during the existence of component.

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,220
If an attribute is added removed or even value changed, then the attribute changed.

16
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,620
Callback method is invoked.

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:40,200
When the component is moved on, a new page or a document, then adopted callback is invoked which is

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,790
very rarely used.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,880
Let's practically check one such method connected callback.

20
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:56,240
This method, as I mentioned, gets executed or invoked when the component or custom element is connected

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,290
to the DOM.

22
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,050
So let's write this method.

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,980
Remember, it is a predefined method.

24
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,380
So the name should be exactly the same here after the constructor.

25
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,130
I will say connected callback.

26
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,820
And let me just have a console.log here.

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,560
I'll say console.log.

28
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,900
Method called.

29
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,190
Let's save this and run the code.

30
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,900
As you can see, the message method call is displayed four times.

31
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,750
Reason is for each component.

32
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:38,020
The connected callback method is automatically called when it is attached to the DOM.

33
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,710
Before moving further.

34
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,240
I will just rename the attributes with lowercase.

35
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,390
Otherwise it does not work in some cases when we make the components more dynamic.

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,950
So let me just say B status in small case.

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,960
And accordingly I'll change the p name and P image as well.

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:17,350
Let me also go to product card JS and here also I will change the attribute with the lowercase.

39
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,070
And we are done with this small change.

40
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,650
Now we will extend the discussion of the web component by adding events to it in the next lecture.
