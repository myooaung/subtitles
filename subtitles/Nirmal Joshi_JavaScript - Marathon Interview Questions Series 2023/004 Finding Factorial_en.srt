Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,900
In this video, we are going to solve the factorial problem.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,550
The problem when you have to get a number from the user and display it's factorial.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,060
The program will run something like this.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:28,500
When you run it, it'll say enter a number the user enters for and the output is four factorial is equal

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,310
to 24.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,080
All right.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,740
So to solve this problem, first we will understand what is a factorial of a number.

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,780
When you say four factorial, which is written like this is basically.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,420
You multiply the number with its previous number.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,660
So here what actually happens is four into three into two into one, something like this process gets

12
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,680
executed.

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:07,090
If I say I want to find five factorial, it means five into four, into three, into two into one.

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:17,350
So to find a factorial of a number, what you actually do is starting from the number, you start multiplying

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,600
with a previous number that is.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,700
And into n minus one.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
And this process keeps on repeating unless you reach two one.

18
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,850
So to find four factorial, this is the process actually we have to execute.

19
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:43,990
So for example, if we take N is equal to four for which we need to find a factorial and the multiplication

20
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,310
goes till the end.

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,490
We can write the pseudocode something like this.

22
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,520
So now we take two variables here.

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:00,250
One is factorial and the second is N and is the number for which we want to find the factorial.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,080
We say end is equal to 4 to 1.

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,910
I will say step minus one.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,670
This is the pattern of pseudocode.

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,550
Whichever language you use, you are going to decrement the value accordingly.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
But when we write pseudocode we use this syntax.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,960
So here factorial is initialized with one.

30
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,420
Now let's try it on this.

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,990
Let's check step by step and let's check the output table.

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,740
Also, at the moment in the output table, as you can see, factorial is one and is four.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,120
Now the next step is factorial into N.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,890
This step gets executed.

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,830
That means one into four and the result is stored in two factorial.

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,610
So now in this table the factorial value is updated.

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,030
We keep the previous value and we add a new value here.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,030
So the this table we are going to constantly watch.

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:02,100
Now this factorial is four it goes on the for loop and n is decrementals by one.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,680
So N is three as you can see in the table and the factorial is four.

41
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,540
So we see four into three.

42
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,300
Now next step it will be four into three.

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,770
That means straddle.

44
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,100
So 12 is stored in the factorial.

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,810
Again, the factorial value is updated in the table and and is also reduced by one.

46
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,200
So now factorial becomes 12 and and becomes two again.

47
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,340
This process is going to repeat and the factorial will be factorial into n that is 12 into two.

48
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:47,190
It will be 24 still and is two so factorial is 24 and and now gets decrement by one.

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,780
So end is one.

50
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,580
And when you say 24 into one, it will be 24 only.

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,150
And at the end we just say bring factorial.

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,570
This is how the factorial is achieved.

53
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,380
You may also run this loop from 1 to 4.

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,780
That's also fine, but ideally when we say four factorial, that means four into two into three into

55
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,050
one.

56
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,490
If you say five, that means you got till one from 5 to 1.

57
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,649
That's why we are following this pattern.

58
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:28,320
Otherwise the same thing can be achieved with one to end the loop, starting with one and ends at end.

59
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,610
That's also possible.

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,900
That is also another way to find the factorial.

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,170
We can write a recursive function.

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,470
So now we have discussed how to achieve.

63
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,030
What can be the logic.

64
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,590
Let's try to go to this.

65
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,000
We are going to take n variable that we we have discussed in the pseudocode will say n is equal to.

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,850
Of course we are going to convert that into number.

67
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,030
So first thing I'm going to write is pass int.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,300
And then I will say enter a number.

69
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:10,890
We also take a variable, Carl Factorial, where I'm going to assign one to it and let's put a our loop

70
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,160
here.

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,090
Now, we do not need to initialize anything to end because we are taking the value from the user.

72
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,850
So I'll keep this blank so I'll put a semicolon for the initialization.

73
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,650
There is nothing to write here.

74
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,300
We are going to put a condition and is greater than equal to one.

75
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,100
And of course we want to minus the value of N.

76
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:45,330
And the way we wrote in the pseudocode we are going to say factorial is equal to factorial into n.

77
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,360
And at the end we just want to display console.log log I would say.

78
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,340
Factorial is equal to.

79
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,800
Victoria.

80
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,000
I missed the prompt command here, so let me write that.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,110
Now later on, this court is going to ask a number.

82
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,360
I'll say full and output is four factorial.

83
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,300
Let's run it again.

84
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,680
We try to find five factorial.

85
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,870
It says 120.

86
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,680
So this is how you find a factorial of a number.
