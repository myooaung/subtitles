00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.190
We are discussing one more problem where we check for a word which contains only digit no letters,

2
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.460
spaces or any other special characters.

3
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.050
Here we are going to create a pattern with anchors like Carrot and a dollar sign.

4
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.480
Let's declare a variable where there are all numbers.

5
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.960
The pattern we are going to define is, again, the anchor for the beginning, a dollar for the end.

6
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.420
And in between, in the squared bracket, I'm going to say 0 to 9 and plus quantifier for at least one

7
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.860
occurrence of the range.

8
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.190
Thus we get only numbers in this pattern.

9
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.989
You can try adding space or other characters in the string.

10
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:13.360
So now it says false, as not all the characters are numbers only or digits only in the string.
