00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,680
In this section, we are discussing another important and commonly used character class or meta character

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,540
called Slash B.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,180
It is used like anchors.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,540
That is the carrot and dollar signs.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,430
Let's begin with an example to understand it in an easier way.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,430
I'm taking a variable here, SDR, where I say testing a test to testify.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,190
Now let's create a pattern to search a word test.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,130
So I will write the pattern test and try to print.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,880
Using console.log.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,820
Let's run the code.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,710
So here on index zero, the test word exists and it is returned in the output.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:01,810
Of course, we should search for all the test words existing in the string, so we will add the slash

13
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,260
g that is global search modifier.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,340
So let's add slash g and run the code again.

15
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,780
Now we have all the test words existing in the entire string.

16
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,780
But here I want only those values which are complete words.

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,920
That is, I just want test word to be returned.

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,260
And as you can see, that is only one search word in the string.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,010
Here comes slash B in rescue.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,500
We are now going to apply the boundary for the word in pattern.

21
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,580
So the pattern will be slash B test and slash B.

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,620
Let's run the code.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,900
Now you see that only one word satisfies the pattern.

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,620
Matching the slash B gives a boundary that a word should be test.

25
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:11,110
In case if I remove the last B, then it will search for all the words beginning with test.

26
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's remove the second slash B and run to see the output.

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,100
So again, we have all the words starting with test in the output.

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,910
We can also apply the reverse logic.

29
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,310
Let's say we want to find all words ending with SD.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,230
In that case, we can use pattern SD and slash B.

31
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,880
So in the beginning, I'm not giving slash B.

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,330
I'm adding one more word best before the word test in the string.

33
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,720
And run the code.

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:58,580
Now you see that there are two such words which end with the word SD.

35
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,980
You can also use the same pattern to find numbers.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,350
For example, we want to search 45 in a string of digits.

37
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,720
Let's write the code for it.

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,470
I'll say let STR is equal to some numbers.

39
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,770
Now the pattern will be.

40
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,980
Slash be 45 and of course, the global search.

41
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,360
Let's try to console.log.

42
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,020
And run the code.

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,550
So now it has returned 45.

44
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,750
Of course, it is a string value which is searched and nothing numeric about it.

45
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,660
But let's say we want to find all values which are of three digits.

46
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,870
Here you can use the slash DX character class, which we have already seen in previous section.

47
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,400
In this case, the pattern will be I will use the slash B to begin.

48
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,080
Then I need three digits.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,190
So I'll write slash the three times and I will have slash B at the end, which is the end of the boundary

50
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:20,390
that is three times slash d1/d for each digit and place between the slash B word boundary.

51
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,520
So now you have two such values, which are of three digits.

52
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:38,720
You can also search for values where you have the decimal place like 56.67 or maybe a dash between numbers

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,850
and so on.

54
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,890
There can be many combinations which you can think of.

55
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,890
So Slash B allows you to search with a boundary for a word.
