00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:07.470
In this section we are discussing about mouse event related properties, properties which are representing

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.180
the X and Y coordinates.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.510
There are two related questions to this topic.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.700
So with mouse event, there are various properties of event object which give you X and y position or

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.650
coordinates of the mouse.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.180
They can be used in different contexts as per requirement.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.750
And these properties are the client X.

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.950
Client Y.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.410
Page X and page y.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.190
And we do also have screen X and screen Y to understand all these properties.

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.080
I have created a sample code.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
Let's check the code first and then we figure out workings by looking at the output.

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.630
Here I have created a C.

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.430
S class for division.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.140
I have used the element selector and here I'm using an ID selector.

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.160
So there are two divisions I have placed here.

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.420
So on the first division, I am going to display the x and y value and the second division is just there

18
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.480
to have a scroll bar in some situation, which I will explain in a moment when we see it in the browser.

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.350
Also, I have used the on mouse model for the body and I have called the E handler.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.190
This is a function which I am calling, and inside this function I have joined a string that I display

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.190
event card, client x and y, page x and Y and screen x and y.

22
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.120
All these different properties you will easily understand.

23
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.440
Once we go through it.

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.960
Now, let me show you the output first.

25
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.390
So this is the output now because I have written on Bodies Mouse Moon.

26
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.610
The moment I moved the mouse I will have updated x and y coordinates.

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.960
Now here.

28
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.960
First of all, let's quickly understand what is screen x and why the screen x and Y represents the screen

29
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.620
itself.

30
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.590
So whatever is the screen size, depending on that, that means relative to screen.

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.190
That means this entire screen, in this particular screen size, where is the mouse pointer?

32
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.930
That means what is the horizontal value?

33
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.140
That is the X value and what is the vertical value?

34
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.250
That is the Y value.

35
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.390
Now let's talk about the client and page coordinates.

36
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.160
At the moment.

37
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.600
If you carefully observe for both X and Y of client and page mode, the values remain same.

38
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.820
Right now, let's say it is 119.

39
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.090
Now, if I move it, it is still 162.

40
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.820
If I move it, it is to 36.

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.170
But the values that is both client and page values are the same.

42
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920
Then what is the difference between these two?

43
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.140
The difference is that client X and Y is related to the current window, whereas the page X and Y is

44
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.150
related to the document.

45
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.350
That is the page.

46
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.360
Now let's see the difference.

47
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.190
At the moment, both client and page y are same excuse anyway, going to be same, so that doesn't matter.

48
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.380
Now I will just resize the window and I will make it smaller.

49
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.040
All right, so now I just add a situation where I have a scroll bar in the page.

50
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.590
Now, still, the Y is similar.

51
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.190
Let me just scroll and then reset the value.

52
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.310
Now there is a difference in client y and page y.

53
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.360
That means the moment you have the scrollbar, the values differ.

54
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.640
What actually happens is, let's say this consider this pointer as the position.

55
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.070
So the position X or Y is actually calculating from this place, whereas in case of page, some section

56
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.590
of page is still scrolled up.

57
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.910
So it starts calculating from that place itself.

58
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.110
That is this one.

59
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.380
So now you see this client is starting from this place, but as page is calculated from this place.

60
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.200
Now this only happens when you have a scrollbar.

61
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.160
So page Y will always see the starting of the document or the page, and then it will give you the vertical

62
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.700
position.

63
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.650
Whereas in case of client it is going to check the window itself.

64
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.240
That is from this place.

65
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:39.480
So the position X or Y in case of client is related to window and page X and Y is related to document.

66
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.290
That means whenever you have scrollbar, you'll be able to understand that from the client x and Y.

67
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.020
They are calculated this way and page x and Y they are calculated in this way.

68
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.290
Let's discuss the questions of this topic.

69
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.760
The first question is explain the difference between client x, y and page x, y.

70
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.990
So this is how the differences that the client refers this window area where is the page might be scrollable

71
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.810
in both x and y coordinates and then it will be a different value in a non scrollable window.

72
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.840
You might find that that both the values are similar.

73
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.290
The second question is explain the difference between planned x, y and screen x y.

74
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.500
So screen actually represents the entire screen.

75
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.650
Plant x, y refers to the window which we have already seen, whereas screen refers the entire screen.

76
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:43.330
So whenever you move the mouse, the relevance of screen x y is always related to the screen size itself.
